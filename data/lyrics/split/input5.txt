till hell 4 a hustler

[Hook]
Lord, help me change my ways (Lord!)
Show a little mercy on Judgment day (help me change my ways)
It ain't me, I was raised this way
I never let 'em play me for a busta, make it Hell 4 a hustler (why I was raised this way?)
Lord, help me change my ways
Show a little mercy on Judgment day (on a judgement days)
It ain't me, I was raised this way
I never let 'em play me for a busta, make it Hell 4 a hustler

[Verse 4: 2Pac]
No insanity plea from me, I ride the beef 'til I burn
Censor me and bar your kids from the lessons I learned
And in turn I'm hostile, guess you can recall me antisocial
Niggas shakin' like they caught the Holy Ghost when I approach
Try to politic before I smoke 'em, like Sun Tzu
Niggas do unto these snitches, before it's done to you
And if the cops come arrest me in the evening
Best believe they comin' for my dogs in the morning
And if I die by a slug, the death of a true thug
Tell me will my niggas mourn me?, gettin' blowed out
High watch me murder the bird before he testify
Strikes walkin' close to my third, I live a troubled life
And if you dream, be a part of my team from Long Beach to Queens
Drug dealers to ex-fiends
Keep yo eyes on the prize, nigga watch for bustas
Either heaven or jail, it's still hell for a hustler

[Hook]
Lord, help me change my ways (Lord!)
Show a little mercy on Judgment day (help me change my ways)
It ain't me, I was raised this way
I never let 'em play me for a busta, make it Hell 4 a hustler (why I was raised this way?)
Lord, help me change my ways
Show a little mercy on Judgment day (on a judgement days)
It ain't me, I was raised this way
I never let 'em play me for a busta, make it Hell 4 a hustler

[Outro: 2Pac]
This is how we ride not knowin' if we'll live or die
Catch me rollin' with my motherfuckin' guns on the side
In case of drama, I'm the first to break wild 'til they all die
This is how we ride not knowin' if we'll live or die
Catch me rollin' with my motherfuckin' guns on the side
In case of drama, I’m the first to break wild until they all die, outlaw
Yes, change my ways yes, the Black Jesuz guide us through this
Weary weary weary weary, aight, only God can save us
* Poems written by Shakur as ~ interpreted by other artists

[Ludacris]
Yes, sir
This is Ludacris
In a recite to you an original poem written by my man 2Pac Shakur
Entitled; in the depths of solitude
And it goes with a something like this
Eh, ehhm
Yeah

I exsist in the depths of solitude
Ponderin my true goal
Tryin to find piece of mine
And still preserve my soul
Constantly learnin to be accepted
And from all recieve respect
Never compromising but sometimes risky
And that is my only regret
How can there be peace
A young heart with an old soul
How can I be in the depths of solitude
When there are to inside of me
This duo within me causes the perfect oppotunity
To learn and live twice as fast
As those who accepts simplicity
Yes
If you're reading between the lines you can understand exactly what my man
2Pac shakur was talking about mayne
You see in or outside the music industry
Everyone has heard the expression as lonely on top
Well you know
Pac was on top
It's only naturally that he exsisted
In the depths of solitude
Of course he was a young heart with an old soul
And individual with, what was a way ahead of his time
And sometimes when you are ahead of youre time
You do wonder what your true goal in life is
When you get so ovius critisising and put down for teaching
What you've learned to others
And doing what you feel is the rigth thing to do
So with that
Pac like all soldiers fought, to be accepted
Specially by those who rejected him the most
And even if you didn't like him
You had to respect him
See nobodys perfect
And off course everyone makes mistakes
But experience is the best teaching, if you ask me
So its important to learn from each mistake
And try hard, not to make the same one twice
His only regret was making the mistake of being too overdemanding at times
But it was the wild outrages Pac
Mixed with the sensitive love in Pac
That made him almost the perfect person
Also made him learn and live twice as fast
And I'm sure, he would rather walk through life
With these multived dimensional personalities
Than to except being one side than simplistic
Any day..
So being in the depths of solitude, if you ask me
Is were the true heroes of our times stay
2Pac Shakur, in our hearts and our minds forever
Rest In Peace, live in harmony...
This is Luda, signing out
Peace

[Intro: 2Pac]
As the world turns—
As the world turns my niggas grow and grow and grow
And get dough and roll and ride
Niggas die and mommas cry
Niggas got alibis and suicides and homicides
And three strikes and yo' life and my life and times change
And niggas fame, as the world turns—

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Though I walk through the valley of Hell the shadow follows me
Wisdom hard to swallow tomorrow, expect apologies
You probably panic, stranded in search of a better planet
Realism hard to understand, we stand slanted
And still stranded, merciless thieves stole the best of me
I pray to black Jesus to please take the rest of me
And still, the best of us build and reach monetary gains
Some of us killed, but still, most of us can change
If we search deeper
God bless the hustler, curse the first sleeper
Enemies get beside me, flows go deep as Poseidon
When we ride, plots keep all my enemies blinded
Time will soon show, a thought can last for years
Outshinin' your fake smiles, plastic tears
Like last year, niggas stuck in the past, and it's clear
Just some busta ass bastards allergic to cash this year
Makaveli for the mob, M.O.B
Killin' bustas is my motherfuckin' job, him or me
Lyrically fatally driven, niggas reported missin'
My competition dead or in prison, as the world turns

[Hook: Darryl 'Big D' Harper & (2Pac)]
As the world keeps turnin' round and round
It's gon' be goin' round as the world turns, and steady turnin'
(Turns, turns, turns, turns and turns
My niggas grow and grow and grow
And gettin' dough and dough and dough
From this state to that state
From this cell to that cell, as the world turns)

[Verse 2: Young Noble]
As the world turn, burnin' paths, starin' through my rearview
It's a war goin' on, and the president is here too
I hear 2Pac sayin', "Watch 'em, they'll kill you"
Sippin Thug Passion, scrub actin' like he feel you
Steady plottin', ready or not; Outlawz lost but not forgotten
From Gittere to Compton, a spitter of the hotness
Long time next, since like six I ain't never been rich
I need cream to buy Ellene a dream house
She no longer fiend out y'all, Outlaw!

[Verse 3: Napoleon]
Another lonely nigga with a 12-gauge pump, with a 12-hour rush to run and get this money, fuck these punks!
Road rules, I swim in the dirt, I stay in some skirt
I hit where it hurts, I ride or die for my turf
I ride or die for Makaveli, the legendary war thug nigga
Kadafi better unslug this nigga, Seike betta undrug this nigga
Out of the buildin', we street children with no souls
Our hearts gon' stay cold, the war gon' stay on
We serve 'em, like 'Pac told us to, catch 'em wreck with the TEC
Hit 'em in the neck and watch him die like he supposed to
Napoleon: the front line soldier, front times over
Rider for the mighty dollar, rather drunk than sober
Nigga talkin' thug walkin' all through yo' squad
Y'all niggas scared by a dog, I got my 44 for y'all
It's like a hot-heated day, homie
Warfare, don't play, homie, better be prepared
Then try to duck away from these strays, homie
Worlds turn, things burn, all in one shot, rest in peace to the fallen soldiers, all that we got, as the world turns—

[Hook: Darryl 'Big D' Harper & (2Pac)]
As the world keeps turnin' round and round
(And my niggas roll and ride, hahaha)
It's gon' be goin' round as the world turns— and steady turnin'
(Niggas gettin' swoll out, and it don't stop and it don't quit
That real shit!) (real shit)
As the world keeps turnin' round and round
(How many you niggas try for this? )
It's gon' be goin' round as the world turns (as the world turns)
(Murderin' methods— haha, OUTLAW!)

[Verse 4: E.D.I. Amin]
Only haters caught feelings when my homie caught millions
And acquired the desired status of boss livin'
We cross driven, cornered into a life that's hellish
Payin' our dues with bloodshed, ain't shit y'all could tell us
Fellas – mount up, it's time for battle, it's on now
Two worlds collidin', armies ridin', soldiers gone wild
Sometimes I think my glory days was back in my youth
I sought too for family, but I got it lost in these ounces
Now, as the world turns court adjourns, I'm sentenced to burn
The cost of my sins too much, nothin' left to earn

[Verse 5: Kadafi]
October 9th 1977 first day out my baby carriage
Married my MAC-11 hit the block playin'
Only five years up in this bitch, papa runnin' from the feds
Puttin' peanut butter on the walls to hide his prints
Me on my own, not yet grown, but only man of the home
To protect my zone in these streets I roam
Dough on d-low, downin' straight shots of Cristal Brothers
100 dollar snot box on cee-lo, fuck eighth
I need a kilo, got a plot, move my block down state
Got the drop on the spot, movin' pounds of weight
Fuck my fate and lots of loot to burn, a hustler's yearn
For this dirty money earned as this crooked world turns

[Overlapped Hook: Darryl 'Big D' Harper]
As the world keeps turnin' round and round
It's gon' be goin' round as the world turns— and steady turnin'
As the world keeps turnin' round and round
It's gon' be goin' round as the world turns—
As the world keeps turnin' round and round
It's gon' be goin' round as the world turns—
As the world keeps turnin' round and round
It's gon' be goin' round as the world turns— and steady turnin'
As the world keeps turnin' round and round
As the world keeps turnin' round and round
As the world keeps turnin' round and round

[Collision: 2Pac & Napolean]
Hahaha— as the world turns—
And turns and turns and turns— haha
This for the soldiers out there involved in the everyday struggle
Hopin' to bubble, keep on hustlin', as the world turns
Money come and go, hoes come and go, foes come and go, friends come and go— my soldiers stay eternal
Outlaw Immortalz, dedicated
I send this to black Jesus, only he can feed us
When you need us, as the world turns
Throw this shit in the deck, hahah
Niggas gettin chin checked
From the East to the West, best to wear a vest
Nigga we ain't the ones to test, fuck you!
As the world turns— Outlaw ridahs, Mutah right beside us
Kamillion, wanna make a million
Haha legit, as the world turns, haha— burn, baby, burn

(A lot of niggas get burned as the world turns
A lot of niggas gettin' burned as the world turns
Gettin' burned as the world turns)

[Intro: 2Pac & Kadafi]
Searchin' for Black Jesus
Oh yeah, sportin' jewels and shit, yaknahmean?
(you can be Christian)
Straight tatted up
Straight Jehovah witness (no doubt)
Islamic (no doubt man)
Me, I'm a thug; thugs, we praise Black Jesus, all day
Young Kadafi in this bitch, set it off nigga—
What?

[Verse 1: Kadafi]
I do my shootings on a knob, prayin' to God for my squad
Stuck in a nightmare, hopin' he might care
Though times is hard, up against all odds, I play my cards
Like I'm jailin', shots hittin' up my spot like midnight rains hailin'
Got me bailin' to stash more greenGods
They ain't tryin' to be trapped
On no block slangin' no rocks like bean pies
Brainstorm on the beginnin'
Wonder how shit like the Qu'ran and the Bible was written
What is religion?
God's words or a curse like crack?
Shai-tan's way of gettin' us back
Or just another one of my Black Jesus' traps

[Verse 2: Storm]
Who's got the heart to stand beside me?
I feel my enemies creepin' up in silence
Dark prayer, scream violence - demons all around me
Can't even bend my knees just a lost cloud; Black Jesus
Give me a reason to survive, in this earthly hell
'Cause I swear, they tryin' to break my will
I'm on the edge lookin' down at this bottomless pit
Will it matter if I cease to exist? Black Jesus

[Hook: 2Pac]
All hail, the pressure no endeavor can fail
Submissive souls turn to hoes when exposed to jail
In times of war we need somebody raw, rally the troops
Like a saint that we can trust to help to carry us through
Black Jesus
He's like a saint that we can trust to help to carry us through
Black Jesus

[Verse 3: Young Noble]
Outlawz we got our own race, culture, religion
Rebellin' against the system, commence to lynchin'
The president ain't even listenin' to the pain of the youth
We make music for eternity, forever the truth
Political prisoner, the two choices that they givin' us
Ride or die, for life they sentence us
Oh Black Jesus, please watch over my brother Shawn
Soon as the sky get bright, it's just another storm
Brothers gone, now labeled a statistic
Ain't no love for us ghetto kids, they call us nigglets
History repeats itself, nuttin new
In school I knew, e'rything I read wasn't true
Black Jesus

[Verse 4: 2Pac]
To this clique I'm dedicated, criminal orientated
An Outlaw initiated, blazed and faded
Made for terror, major league niggas pray together
Bitches in they grave while my real niggas play together
We die clutchin' glasses, filled with liquor bomblastic
Cremated, last wishes niggas smoke my ashes
High sigh why die wishin', hopin' for possibilities
I'll mob on, while they copy me sloppily
Cops patrol projects, hatin' the people livin' in them
I was born an inmate, waitin' to escape the prison
Went to church but don't understand it, they underhanded
God gave me these commandments, the world is scandalous
Blast 'til they holy high; baptize they evil minds
Wise, no longer blinded, watch me shine trick
Which one of y'all wanna feel the degrees?
Bitches freeze facin' Black Jesus

[Hook: 2Pac]
All hail, the pressure no endeavor can fail
Submissive souls turn to hoes when exposed to jail
In times of war we need somebody raw, rally the troops
Like a saint that we can trust to help to carry us through
Black Jesus

[Verse 5: Kastro]
Some say, some day, some how, some way, we gon' fail
And it ain't hard to tell, we dwell in hell
Trapped, black, scarred and barred
Searchin' for truth, where it's hard to find God
I play the Pied Piper, and to this Thug Life, I'm a lifer
Proceed, to turn up the speed, just for stripes
My Black Jesus, walk through this valley with me
Where we, so used to hard times and casualties
Indeed, it hurt me deep to have to sleep on the streets
And haven't eaten in weeks, so save a prayer for me
And all the young thugs, raised on drugs and guns
Blazed out and numb, slaves to this slums
This ain't livin'— Jesus

[Background Overlapped singing]​
We believed in you
Everything you do
Just wanna let you know, how we feel
Black Jesus!
We believed in you
Everything you do
Just wanna let you know, how we feel
Black Jesus!
We believed in you
Everything you do
Just wanna let you know, how we feel
Black Jesus!

[Collision: Kastro]
Searchin' for Black Jesus
It's hard, it's hard
We need help out here
So we searchin' for Black Jesus
It's like a Saint, that we pray to in the ghetto, to get us through
Somebody that understand our pain
You know maybe not too perfect, you know
Somebody that hurt like we hurt
Somebody that smoke like we smoke
Drink like we drink
That understand where we comin' from
That's who we pray to
We need help y'all

[Intro: 2Pac]
These some hard times we livin' in
Churches burnin', planes fallin' from the sky
Murder, the good die young
Hahaha, The good definitely die young
This is a lil' somethin'
To help you get through the day
If it could

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
It was more than a tragedy, emotions be grabbin' me
Plane fell from the sky, we tryna figure what happened
Burnin' churches, fearin' God, who can be so cruel
We all ignorant to AIDS 'til it happens to you
Just be a man, make plans, listen to your voice
A woman's tryin' to make decisions, we should leave 'em a choice
Cause who we to say who lives or die, breathes or stops
All this judgement on other lives needs to stop
What are we livin' for, givin' more back than takin'
On my knees still waitin' for my own salvation
Now I feel abandoned cause Pat Buchanan say I'm greedy
You can take my taxes, send me to war but can't feed me
It's so easy to regret thangs after they done
Babies catchin' murder cases scared to laugh in the Sun
The tragedies that we all need, love in doses
In times like these we feel closest the good die young

[Hook]
Does anybody have an answer why
(it times like these we feel closest)
It seems the good die young (the good die young)
Can anybody tell me why
(rest in peace, god bless the dead, and we carry on huh)
Can anybody tell me why
(the good die young)
Does anybody have an answer why (I ain't Quincy Jones)
It seems the good die young
(the good die young)
Does anybody tell me why
(Now we hear from the future, the next generation, tell me)
Does anybody tell me why

[Verse 2: Napoleon]
Now in my world will it get worse
When I been trapped since birth
But I had to sleep in a hearse, cause it was my bed first
My grands probably burnin' turnin' in they grave
Some folks ain't even get to see a high age
But they did, so I ain't afraid
And this money got me feelin' like a star
And this murder got me feelin' like my death ain't far
And the land of stolen cars, don't get no better
Don't get no weaker or no harder
I was raised in a rush without my moms and my, father
So tell me somethin'
If I grab my gat and get the dumpin'
Would God get to lookin' at me funny uhaha
Rest in peace to my mother Aquillah Beale
Rest in peace to my father Salek Beale
Rest in peace to my grandparents
And thug in peace to my brother Seike
You know I love you

[Verse 3: Young Noble]
Which is worst, first Storm and then Al
Pac and then Yak
Regrey Brown
Coulda' sworn I seen ya face in a cloud
Family grievin' on your last breath
Close to the heart whether you know it or not
I swear the love won't stop
Jewel, that's my boo, Mom, Duke and Nu
From jump you kept it true
Helped to feed the crew
The good die young
Livin' fast jumpin' the gun
Mama blamin' the community for killin' her son
My cousin Darren wasn't scared of goin'
But never knowin' he was dyin' slower
I guess I see ya when I see ya soulja

[Hook]
Does anybody have an answer why (answer why)
It seems the good die young
Can anybody tell me why (tell me why!!)
Can anybody tell me why

[Verse 4: Kastro]
I know my life ain't promised
That's why the wise move in silence
Analyze these scandalous times
It's hard dogg but we managed
Schools turn to war zones
Even homes unsafe
Leavin' children to play caged and raged they hate
How come!, someone explain "why the good die young"
Why the bad die slow and outlive everyone
It's time somethin' is done
For our young kids
They growin' hopeless
That ain't the way to live
Tell me why

[Verse 5: E.D.I Mean]
Days go past and as they pass, time move, quicker
No time for wastin', put your hustle down my young dealers
Cause the end is nearer
But at least that's what they tellin' me
Hell, all I know brothers ain't ridin' 4-3 felony's
It's time to plan, plot, and strategize
Capitalize, mobilize
We in the war y'all
It's for all y'all
My family to the ones that stand me
Little bit mo' love is what's recommended
Yeah, and it's plain to see (plain to see)
The seeds from you and me
Gon' be the ones to lead us towards unity
That's if we treat them right
Man, teach them right
Raise your kids better than you was
And see what it does
But if you don't
Man, we sure to be dumb
And we'll all see exactly why the goods die young
(We ain't lyin' man)

[Hook]
Does anybody have an answer why (tell me why)
It seems the good die young (tell me why)
Can anybody tell me why
Can anybody tell me why
(the good die young)
Does anybody have an answer why (tell me why)
It seems the good die young (die young)
Can anybody tell me why (tell me why)
Can anybody tell me why
(the good die young)

[Outro: 2Pac]
I send this out for all my homeboys that passed away
And all yo' homeboys that passed away
I send this out to all the former fallen soldiers
That's in the cemeteries buried
Never got to see they dreams
For everything I touch you touch
For every step I take you take
For every breath I breathe you breathe
Every dollar I make you make
I told you we'd make it to the sunshine one day
You just got there a little quicker
But like my homeboys Thugs say
"I'll catch you at the crossroads"
The good die young

This song is dedicated to all them
Young kids that died innocent
That died young
At Columbine High
Rest in Peace (Oklahoma)
Outlawz
(Lil' Yummy Sandifer
Tasha Harlins, all them
All the fallen kids
The dead babies
The closed caskets)

[2Pac]
Oh shit, caught that nigga alone, ain't that a bitch?
Hey, uh, this one here is, uhh for them niggas that be Johnny Dangerous when they be fuckin' 50 deep
But they be fuckin' cowards when they by theyselves
You know who I'm talkin' about
You know who I'm talkin' about, that's right
You ain't shit without your homeboys
You ain't shit without your homeboys
You ain't shit without your homeboys

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Now, everytime I see you cats is rollin' in packs
For the life of me I cannot see why you don't know how to act
Love to clown when you deep, but when you on that solo creep out on the streets you don't hear a peep
Nigga, it's a God damn shame, somebody explain
Why they sent a Bad Boy to play a grown man's game?
Tear that ass out the frame, completely get that ass kicked
Woke up on the street, but you'll be sleepin' in the casket
How long will it last? Nigga, don't ask, just be first to blast
Outlaw on the mash, tryin' to be the first to see some cash
My shit's classic, like my nigga Nate
Go get the tape, we keep the nation anticipatin' until we break
Money made me evil, court cases got me stressed
Niggas aimin' at my head, but I still wear my vest
I don't give a fuck, motherfuckers, I'm loc
They all duckin' when my gun smoke
You ain't shit without your homeboys

[Hook: 2Pac]
You probably run at the sound of funk
I give a fuck, you niggas is punks
Without your homeboys you be the first to reach in your trunk
You scary niggas is punks
You ain't shit without your homeboys, nigga
(Punk ass— that's right motherfucker)
You ain't shit without your homeboys
(Throw your hands up you little trick)
(a squared— coward motherfucker)

[Verse 2: Young Noble]
Like Yak said, how the fuck you gonna shoot me rocks?
When you got the Outlaw Pac shittin' your box
You was lookin' real weak walkin' down the street
Now a nigga 30 deep, oh, you wanna beef?
Talk cheap, shoot a nigga the fair one
Your homies like fuck it – what's this? You the only scared one
Damn, son, close call I bet
Now down around the way you gets no respect
They like that Outlaw nigga played you out
We could have took it to the fists, I would have laid you out
Niggas be actin' all different when they dogs come around
Watch 'em act like bitches when Outlawz draw down
They all clown, better yet they all stunned
You the type to have a gun and never blazed it once
Get y'all banana split, you ain't Emmanuel
Outlawz you'll never forget, Makaveli the Don get a call y'all
Turnin these streets into Vietnam
Where your homeboys?

[Hook: 2Pac]
You ain't shit without your homeboys
My thug niggas, I love niggas
From small time crooks to big-time drug dealers (without your homboys)
The only thing a nigga got left
I love my niggas to death, we ain't shit without our homeboys
(You know what time it is)
I ain't shit without my homeboys
(Hey, tell 'em the story how you came up, nigga)

[Verse 3: 2Pac]
Now, I was born alone, took my first joint and I got high alone
Now I'm an Outlaw nigga, I never die alone
Me and my niggas is so close, it's complicated
One nigga smokin' and drinkin', and yet we all faded
My nigga Edi had a son, we all happy
Cause now that little ridah got to deal with eight daddies
My niggas cry, we all cry, and all ride
To rectify the problem, motherfuckers, they all die
Been tryin' to make a million by hustlin since my adolescence
From crack dealin' to rap villian, my new profession
Who wanna see me at eight deep, fuck 3D
You coward ass motherfuckers'll never see me
Bustin' with automatic straps, my raw raps like good crack
Niggas fiendin', I got 'em comin' back
Until I die, they label me as a ridah forever, my niggas be together

[Outro/Hook]
Ain't shit without your homeboys
Thug niggas, I love niggas
From small time crooks to big-time drug dealers
Without your homeboys
The only thing a nigga got left
I love my niggas to death
We ain't shit without our homeboys
(without our homeboys)
Love my niggas to death
I ain't shit without our homeboys
Love you niggas to death
We ain't shit without our homeboys

[Intro: 2Pac & H.E.A.T.]
I feel you (uhh), baby don't
But you can't, you can't give up
(H.E.A.T., 2Pac with, Outlawz!)

[Hook: 2Pac & H.E.A.T.]
Baby don't cry! I hope you got your head up (Outlawz)
Even when the road is hard, never give up!
Baby don't cry! I hope you got your head up
Even when the road is hard, never give up! (Keep ya head up)

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Now here's a story 'bout a woman with dreams
So picture perfect at 13, an ebony queen
Beneath the surface it was more than just a crooked smile
Nobody knew about her secret so it took a while
I could see a tear fall slow down her black cheek
Sheddin' quiet tears in the back seat; so when she asked me
"What would you do if it was you?"
Couldn't answer such a horrible pain to live through
I tried to trade places in the tragedy
I couldn't picture three crazed niggas grabbin' me
For just a moment I was trapped in the pain
Lord, come and take me
Four niggas violated, they chased and they raped me
Even though it wasn't me, I could feel the grief
Thinkin' with your brains blown that would make the pain go
No! You got to find a way to survive
‘Cause they win when your soul dies

[Hook: 2Pac & H.E.A.T.]
Baby please don't cry!, you got to keep your head up
Even when the road is hard, never give up!
Baby don't cry!, you got to keep your head up
Even when the road is hard, never give up!
(Baby don't cry!) baby don't cry!, I hope you got yo' head up
Even when the road is hard, never give up! (keep ya head up)
Baby don't cry!, I hope you got your head up (never give up)
Even when the road is hard, never give up!
Baby don't cry…

[Verse 2: Edi Amin]
Forget him, girl, he ain't gon' never change
I ain't no hater but that nigga lost in the game
After the bright lights and big thangs
He probably could love you, but he in love with the struggle
Everyday, his mind on gettin' mo'
And never your feelings, he's chasin' millions for sho'
Uh oh, now you 'bout to have his baby?
Another wild-ass nigga that's gon' drive you crazy
You got too much mo' livin' to do – I'm spittin' this to you
‘Cause you deserve more than what he givin' to you
Beautiful, black, precious, and complicated
A new millennium dime piece, so fine she
Got 'em all stuck standin' still when she come through
Baby, take a little mo' time, love will find you
And sho' as the sky's blue somebody other than me
Gon' give you everythin' you need, feel me? (Don't cry-ahh…)

[Hook: 2Pac & H.E.A.T.]
(Baby don't cry!) baby don't cry!, you got to keep your head up
Even when the road is hard, never give up!
(Baby don't cry!) baby don't cry!, you got to keep your head up
Even when the road is hard, never give up! (you'll be alright)
(Baby don't cry!) baby don't cry!, I hope you got your head up
Even when the road is hard, never give up! (keep ya head up)
(Baby don't cry!) baby don't cry!, I hope you got your head up (never give up)
Even when the road is hard, never give up! (no no.. ohhhh)
Baby don't cry…

[Verse 3: Young Noble]
I'm tryin' to do all that I can
From jump, now you losin', you was choosin' the wrong man
Dealt the wrong hand, you was young and beautiful
Lost and turned out, what you let that nigga do to you?
I knew her since elementary, she blew a kiss to me
Wrote me a note in crayon, wantin' to get with me
We was kids, now she got three kids
They see their father e'ryday, and they don't know who he is
Seen him last night, homie roll a E-class
Mad cheese in the stash, still a deadbeat dad
I bring her Pampers and food, just to stop through
But those ain't my seeds, nothin' really I could do
I feel pity for you, you ain't even his wife
Seventeen with three kids, locked down for life
Should've chose me, she 'bout to OD from the pressure
Hell nah, I won't let her (BABY..)

[Hook: 2Pac & H.E.A.T.]
(Baby don't cry!) baby don't cry!, you got to keep your head up
Even when the road is hard, never give up!
(Baby  don't cry!) baby don't cry!, you got to keep your head up
Even when the road is hard, never give up!
(Baby don't cry!) baby don't cry!, I hope you got your head up
Even when the road is hard, never give up!
(Baby don't cry!) baby don't cry!, I hope you got your head up (never give up)
Even when the road is hard, never give up!
(Baby don't cry!) baby don't cry!, you got to keep your head up
Even when the road is hard, never give up!
(Baby  don't cry!) baby don't cry!, you got to keep your head up
Even when the road is hard, never give up!
(Baby don't cry!) baby don't cry!, I hope you got your head up
Even when the road is hard, never give up! (keep ya head up)
(Baby don't cry!) baby don't cry!, I hope you got your head up (never give up)
Even when the road is hard, never give up! (no no.. ohhhh)
(Baby don't cry!) baby don't cry!..
(you'll be right)..
(Baby don't cry!) baby don't cry!, I hope you got your head up
Even when the road is hard, never give up! (keep ya head up)
(Baby don't cry!) baby don't cry!, I hope you got your head up (never give up)
Even when the road is hard, never give up!
Baby don't cry

[Outro: Edi Amin]
For all the ladies (Soulshock, Karlin)
Baby don't cry! Got to keep your head up
(Keep your head up)
Makaveli lives on (head up) aight?

[Hook: E.D.I. Mean]
You either ride wit' us or collide wit' us
It's as simple as that for me and my niggas
You either ride wit' us or collide wit' us
It's as simple as that for me and my niggas

[Verse 1: E.D.I. Mean]
War time, war time, it's either yours or mine
Outlawz be on the grind and a mission to shine
And ride on 'em, leave 'em stuck and fucked from the gate
Set it straight, regulate, with a bomb I'm about to detonate
Boom! Hesitate? Aww, now you know what
Ya'll niggas were here to go if you know it was good for ya
Bunch of toy soldiers all dressed in fatigue
But I'm E.D.I. Mean on a mission to make 'em bleed
Nigga what? Nigga who? It was cool? And at you?
What the fuck is you gonna do? Barbecue and boo-hoo
Ride or die, get money, all at the same time
Split the pie with the homie, ball at the same time
Any nigga slippin', fall at the same time
We all links in the chain, tryin' to gain, do time
We all see the sunshine, but when you could do yours
We'll bring these motherfuckers war

[Hook: E.D.I. Mean]
You either ride wit' us or collide wit' us
It's as simple as that for me and my niggas

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
As I approach the scene
From smokin' green got my eyes closed
Niggas so cold on my foes, I make 'em die froze
Watch me make 'em bleed, makin' G's, Lord, help me with it
Got me paintin' pictures of a meal ticket, help me get it
See me and pray for options, but the pressures nonstop
Niggas get the pistol poppin' and watch his body drop
I'm a lethal threat, watch me hit your set, flash on
Blast on them bitch-made niggas with my mask on
Do it for profit, plus I'm lookin' for punks to bust on
If you ain't screamin' "Westside!" you can get the fuck on
I'm seein' demons, hittin' weed, got me hearin' screams
Scared to go to sleep, watch the scene like a dope fiend
Probably be punished for it, though you can't ignore it
I live the life of a thug nigga, and die for it
Niggas pass the clip and watch me bring 'em to the floor
Got some shit that they ain't ready for: I got the secrets of war

[Hook: E.D.I. Mean]
You either ride wit' us or collide wit' us
See it's as simple as that for me and my niggas
You either ride wit' us or collide wit' us
Look it's as simple as that for me and my niggas

[Verse 3: Yaki Kadafi]
We do this thug life shit, like 4, 5, 6, stick 'em
Down with no rounds left up in the pound when the sounds
Squeeze the lead off, I blow his motherfuckin' head off
Signal all the other Outlawz to get this shit set off
Yaki Kadafi, it ain't a cop here to stop me
These streets is black hockey and raw, we get sloppy
Put a pamper on your silly ass prestyle grammar, locked in the slammer, while I'm layed cocked back like a hammer
Ya'll newly weds that in honey moons, times 'bout up, y'all
That means I leave no trace found with you face, bounce stuck
Your pig scanners can't come close touch or even hit me
Doin' my dirt, puttin' in work, you see shit, what you gon' do?

[Hook: E.D.I. Mean]
You either ride wit' us or collide wit' us
See it's as simple as that for me and my niggas
You either ride wit' us or collide wit' us
Look it's as simple as that for me and my niggas

[Verse 4: Young Noble]
Check the murder rate percentage, niggas is finished
Get blood checks from clinics, this thug shit is in us
Flowin' through my system, you a victim
Blunts, I twist 'em. Fuck the whole world, it's us against them
You got some heat? Pull it out, cock the hammer if you with it
Don't make no difference here with the 25-to-life sentence
We already doin' life on the streets
Like Al G., niggas be heated when they walkin' the beat
This shit is flaky, makin' backs shaky, niggas hate me
Scared to face me, knowin' that the Outlawz blaze me
Pull me up on game, put me up on a hustle
Once I suck my money muscle, all the G's got devils
Movin' shit like a dollar, beatin' niggas like Rodney
Turn a killer like Kadafi, and a nuke stream to stop me

[Hook: E.D.I. Mean]
You either ride wit' us or collide wit' us
See it's as simple as that for me and my niggas
You either ride wit' us or collide wit' us
Look it's as simple as that for me and my niggas
You either ride wit' us or collide wit' us
Man it's as simple as that for me and my niggas
You either ride wit' us or collide wit' us
See it's as simple as that for me and my niggas

[Outro: 2Pac & E.D.I. Mean]
Bring it on, and all you lil' young ass soldiers
You play this shit back about 15 times ( talk about it)
You'll have enough game to roll up in a club or somethin' (e'ry body tough)
Teach these bitches a lil' somethin'
You know what I mean? Secrets of muthafuckin' war…

[Intro: 2Pac]
Makaveli the Don, break on 'em!
Ah put ya, ah put ya hands on ya, hands on ya heater
Hands on ya, hands on ya heater, hands on ya, hand…

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Let it be prophesized; niggas'll die because your crew's doom
Around the way niggas get murdered by the full moon
Heard it in whispered tones, niggas is bold and they choose to roll
I kill 'em all, watch now, nigga, truth be told
Westside was the war cry, look how they scatter
Niggas dyin' by my 30-odd, brains is splattered
Wonder why these niggas crossed me, I'm certified crazy
So sick the world made me now d-d-die
Every time I ride is for reasons
Hard to kill a nigga 'cause I'm comin' back like Jesus
Bow down to my ill nation, runnin' from drug cases
Lookin' at my congregation so full of thug faces
Mama gave a nigga breath, a life of stress
I invest in a vest and makin' niggas watch they every step
Label me a threat and I ain't even got started with this shit yet
Thug style, baby, hands on my pistol, listen
I'm a rider, every nigga breathin' pay attention (Listen)
'Bout to show you motherfuckers how it feel to drop a body
A simple glimpse of my lifestyle, Killuminati…

[Chorus: Kastro & 2Pac]
Yo, Makaveli, they can't stop you
Hold it down!
Killuminati and we got you, got you
Yo, Makaveli, they can't stop you
Hold it down!
Killuminati and we got you, got you
Yo, Makaveli, they can't stop you
Hold it down!
Killuminati and we got you, got you
Yo, Makaveli, they can't stop you
Hold it down!
Killuminati and we got you, got you

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
After the fire comes the rain, after the pleasure there's pain
Even though we broke for the moment, we'll be ballin' again
'Til I make it, yo, my military be prepared for them bustaz
Similar to bitches too scary, get too near me, we rushin'
Visions of over-packed prisons, millions of niggas thug livin'
Pressures and three strikes, I hope they don't test us
They pull the heat out, ammunition in crates
Psssh! Move without a sound as we slide down pistols in place
They got me fiendin' for currency, the money be callin'
It’s like I’m - dreamin', seein' scenes of me ballin'
Participated in felonious behavior
Cock the cocked 45, snatchin' niggas pagers
Labeled a mark soon as we start, it was hard to quit
We started out drinkin' 40's, moved to harder shit
God damn, now I'm a grown man, I follow no man
Nigga got my own plan, and it's called Killuminati

[Chorus: Kastro & 2Pac]
Yo, Makaveli, they can't stop you
Killuminati and we got you, got you
Killuminati
Yo, Makaveli, they can't stop you
Hold it down!
Killuminati and we got you, got you
Yo, Makaveli, they can't stop you
Hold it down!
Killuminati and we got you, got you
Yo, Makaveli, they can't stop you
Hold it down!
Killuminati and we got you, got you

[Verse 3: E.D.I. Amin]
I spend most of my time bankin', niggas
Because they hate a nigga, comin' across fake niggas
But we made niggas, old school and I'm thinkin'
Y'all some bitch made niggas and you steadily sinkin'
O-U-T, L-A-W-Z, ain't nothing fuckin' with that
We bustin' back, comin' back for the stacks
Laugh last, cash cash, all I want is the paper
Givin' them fuckers tool whips, I rule haters
Y'all can't fade us, we kill, steal and peal quickly
The boss niggas, definitely, put it down strictly
E.D.I. Amin, until the law come for me
Kill 'em all for shorty, '99 Killuminati

[Verse 4: Kadafi]
They got me thinkin' strugglin' and hustling's my only fate
Toppin' graems on the kichen plate
Tryin' to keep that money straight
Times is rolling three up these streets sleep
But when I crack, hammer cocked back, rapped in my sheets
My life's been crossed, crooked since a seed
It hurts, got a package from the devil, payin' my deeds
Preoccupied by the greed in this crooked life I lead
More funds to spend or bigger guns to squeeze
Me and my thugs clock G's, sippin' naughty thangs
Real as these tats on my body, and it's Killuminati

[Chorus: Kastro & 2Pac]
Yo, Makaveli, they can't stop you
Hold it down!
Killuminati and we got you, got you
Yo, Makaveli, they can't stop you
Hold it down!
Killuminati and we got you, got you
Yo, Makaveli, they can't stop you
Hold it down!
Killuminati and we got you, got you
Yo, Makaveli, they can't stop you
Hold it down!
Killuminati and we got you, got you

[Outro: 2Pac]
(Makaveli the Don until I'm gone, I maintain)
Makaveli up in this bitch, worldwide mash, Westside
(Makaveli the Don until I'm gone, I maintain)
The question we ask, do you know what time it is?
You know what type of shit we be
(Makaveli the Don until I'm gone, I maintain)
You want that hip-hop real, it's that hip-hop that's real
Hold it down, hold it down! Hip-hop that's worldwide, feel?
(Makaveli the Don until I'm gone, I maintain)
Fuck with me, nigga, you get killed!
It don't get no realer than this
(Makaveli the Don until I'm gone, I maintain)
What's my motherfuckin' name, nigga?
My niggas, we all bad
(Makaveli the Don until I'm gone, I maintain)
What's my muh'fuckin name, nigga?
What's my muh'fuckin name?
(Makaveli the Don until I'm gone, I maintain)
Outlawz in this bitch, Death Row at its finest
(Makaveli the Don until I'm gone, I maintain)
Repeat! Death Row at it's finest
Nigga, you know what time it is
(Makaveli the Don until I'm gone, I maintain)… Outlawz…

[Intro: E.D.I Amin]
High speed
For all my niggas livin' in the rush
Slow it down just a notch baby
It's goin' be alright, it's goin' be alright

[Ad-libs: 2Pac & E.D.I Amin]
Life at high speed, life at high speed
Fuck the punishment, Thai weed
Buy me a gun, liquor and puffin' Thai weed

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
I live life high speed, slightly disillusioned by weed
I breed thug muthafuckas even worse than me
When I bleed, my enemies best to flee quickly
Harm me, my army, niggas decease swiftly
Look at you now, why you wanna act out?
I pull the hammer back, strike wit' a cannon that'll blow yo muthafuckin' back out
They blast but I'm still standin', slightly scarred
Deep questions for the lord "Why you don't like me, God?"
So, though my life was hard with no remorse
I absorb all lessons, provide protection for the boss
Rollin' in my double R, rugged and ruthless
Keep a vest through these hard times, knowin' it's useless
And my crew, we crooked, be mistaken for Jews
We all about our cash, blast if you break the rules
Fools turned snitch for the D.A., be heaven-sent
Switched like a stone-bitch, turned state's evidence, why?
Then they wonder why niggas die
Put your family in danger, just to get high
Now, what the hell can we get from jail?
More tricks for the crime trade, this is hell
Bail out, a thug nigga fresh out the jailhouse
Open your safe count and take all the mail out
Whatever happens happens, whoever falls dies
We fresh out of time, livin' blind, so we all ride
In times like these, chronic or Thai weed
Puffin' through this high speed
And people say...

[Chorus: 2Pac]
Whatcha gonna do when you get outta jail?
I'm gonna buy me a gun
Then what's next?
Food and sex, house parties in the projects
We goin' all night
Whatcha gonna do when you get outta jail?
I'm gonna buy me a gun
Then what's next?
Food and sex, house parties in the projects
We goin' all night

[Verse 2: Yaki Kadafi]
Verbal assassin, I hit the corner fast, blastin'
Hot plastic stretch your chest plate back like elastic
No need to push me to split ya, I love beef
Like pussy and pistols, for all you pussies that's softer than tissue
I ride by like the fall guy out the roof
Bustin' at you wise guy, gettin' high, sippin' hundred proof (yeah)
Give me the joints low to verdict wit' mine
Get that ass attacked, murdered, and robbed, blind from behind
Rapid shots pourin', catchin' niggas while they snorin'
Kickin' his door in, I'll leave your whole fuckin' family in mournin'
Bust me, you itchy-bitchy types can't touch me
Frontin' like you're hard, I'll play your fuckin' yard like a trussle

[Chorus: 2Pac]
Whatcha gonna do when you get outta jail?
I'm gonna buy me a gun
Then what's next?
Food and sex, house parties in the projects
We goin' all night
Whatcha gonna do when you get outta jail?
I'm gonna buy me a gun
Then what's next?
Food and sex, house parties in the projects
We goin' all night

[Verse 3: E.D.I Amin]
At times, I look through times wit' so much anger
Wonderin' why it keeps on passin', pushin' me into danger
No stranger to hard times or the good ones, at times I'm amazed
At what the motherfuckin' hoods done, what we do to get paid
All day, for the almighty, dollar
Don't even bother to holla, we all destined to be swallowed
By the same thing we lust for, threw away our morals
And values and dust more, niggas is dying tomorrow
We — bailing on borrowed times, nigga the clocks tickin'
Approachin' is the day you gonna need money or Glocks spittin'
Cops sittin', politicians passin' laws you ain't know what
Soon that money gon' be illegal when you die to keep your dough up
But I ain't goin' tell you "What?" To stop chasin' paper
Man, I'm just like y'all, I worry 'bout that shit later
Put the metal to the pedal, slash up nigga, blaze
Let's get blowed out high speed 'til the end of my days
Now my people say

[Chorus: 2Pac]
Whatcha gonna do when you get outta jail?
I'm gonna buy me a gun
Then what's next?
Food and sex, house parties in the projects
We goin' all night
Whatcha gonna do when you get outta jail?
I'm gonna buy me a gun
Then what's next?
Food and sex, house parties in the projects
We goin' all night
Whatcha gonna do when you get outta jail?
I'm gonna buy me a gun
Then what's next?
Food and sex, house parties in the projects
We goin' all night
Whatcha gonna do when you get outta jail?
I'm gonna buy me a gun
Then what's next?
Food and sex, house parties in the projects
We goin' all night
Whatcha gonna do when you get outta jail?
I'm gonna buy me a gun
Then what's next?
Food and sex, house parties in the projects
We goin' all night

[Outro: 2Pac]
High speeds (we goin' all night)
Life of an Outlaw, ghetto stars (we goin' all night)

Whatcha gonna do when you get outta jail?
(I'm gonna buy me a gun)
For my niggas on the West Side and the East Side
And the North Side and the South Side
(I'm gonna buy me a gun)
(Whatcha gonna do when you get outta jail?)
From Compton to Jersey
(I'm gonna buy me a gun)
Gettin' it real hard
Niggas in Michigan, (M.O.B nigga, M.O.B)
From Atlanta, Georgia to Utah
(Whatcha gonna do when you get outta jail?)
From St. Louis to Alabama
(I'm gonna buy me a gun)
From Mississippi to Oakland, from San Francisco to San Diego
Seattle to Florida
(Whatcha gonna do when you get outta jail?)
Maine to Mass, haha
(I'm gonna buy me a gun)
Food and sex
(Whatcha gonna do when you get outta jail?)
And it don't stop, and it won't quit
(I'm gonna buy me a gun)
And it don't stop, and it won't quit
And it don't stop, and it won't quit
(I'm gonna buy me a gun)
Then what's next?
Food and sex, house parties in the projects
We goin' all night
High speeds
And it don't stop, and it won't quit
(We goin' all night)
And it don't stop, and it won't quit
(We goin' all night)
And it don't stop, and it won't quit

And it don't stop, and it won't quit

And it don't stop, and it won't quit

And it don't stop, and it won't quit
And it don't stop, and it won't quit
Outlawz with that rough shit, baby!

[E.D.I Amin]
Learn about it
Pac you goin' rap?

[Intro: Napoleon]
Life… What the fuck is life for niggas like us?
Been wakin' up to another mothafuckin' day
I'm the type of soldier
A nigga that seen everything in my mothafuckin' eyes
I seen my parents get killed to my mothafuckin' eyes
I seen my brother kill himself in my eyes
I seen 'Pac, Yak die in the struggle in my eyes
So I know anybody can be touched
You know what I mean?

[Verse 1: Napoleon]
Oh God, forgive me, somebody please say a prayer for me
Needed my parents, but they was never there for me
Believing everythin' they feed me, I'm seein' demons
I wake up screamin', who believe me or was I dreamin'?
5 fingers on the .45 chrome
Dead aim at my brain, infrared with no lights on
I ain't afraid to die, I wanna see what's after this
I'm livin' blind, writin' rhymes 'til they capture this
And if we die, let the world understand why
Soldier my eyes, hate to see a young thug cry
They seein' us inside a casket, that's how they see us
Oh God, forgive us ghetto bastards, we human beings
They leavin' us inside this hell hole
Just waitin' to fail, so then they tell us that's what jail for
Adolescent young teens turned violent
It's floatin', in a world turned silent
'Cause u could be touched

[Hook: 2Pac]
Young niggas in the wildlife
Criminal mind of a juvenile, still livin' child life
Thinkin' he can make his pay, too in a rush
Niggas better slow down, 'cause you can be touched
Young niggas in the wildlife
Criminal mind of a juvenile, still livin' child life
Thinkin' he can make his pay, too in a rush
Niggas better slow down, 'cause you can be touched

[Verse 2: E.D.I]
I live life high speed, movin' a million miles per hour
Towards my destiny, makin' decisions carelessly
Yeah, it's me, yo' nigga man-child
Bomb first, stand proud, ain't lookin' for hand-outs
(Shit!)
Twenty-five years up in this bitch
(Shit!)
And I'll be damned if I ain't leavin' rich
And leave my kids a grip
I let my blood drip off in this thug shit
You can be touched
I catch you slippin' while I'm on a money mission
Like right now, thirty dollars to my John Hancock
Try to get more, so my shit don't flock
I lick off shots for everything they owe me
And when it's my time to go, I pray the Lord hold me

[Verse 3: Kastro]
I was born in the city that never sleeps
Schooled by the realest of the real niggas that ever breathed
And I was big, when I was young
And now I see that I was dumb
My nigga Lonnie just got hit with ten
Ten years for trustin' a friend
They left him stuck in the pen'
I love him, we all here just to die here
Plus, nobody cares what got here
Touched by angel and kissed by the Lord
Praise the thug ways and I'll never be bored
Touched by angel and kissed by the Lord
I praise the thug ways, so forever it's on, baby

[Hook: 2Pac]
Young niggas in the wildlife
Criminal mind of a juvenile, still livin' child life
Thinkin' he can make his pay, too in a rush
Niggas better slow down, 'cause you can be touched
Young niggas in the wildlife
Criminal mind of a juvenile, still livin' child life
Thinkin' he can make his pay, too in a rush
Niggas better slow down, 'cause you can be touched

[Verse 4: Young Noble]
Why grieve this life, planted by the fiends and pipes?
Green lights, so I'm seein', seein' everything twice
Pretty much of nothin' nice, we suckin' it up
Even when we get a job, we fuckin' it up
Like it can't happen to us, I could never be a bum (Yeah)
Yeah, right, you wind up one
God forbid I'm touched, Y'all keep livin' it up
Look and learn, next it could be your turn, word

[Verse 5: Kadafi]
Yes, this a felony's hobby that got me here, thinkin' robbery
Day to day all year long, Teflon protects my body
It's such unimportant in this criminal cartel
I'm caught and supportin' me
So in these streets of hockey, I play the goalie
Secrets of war licks, and score shit
Share between clients & homies
Remember what Pacino told me
Before he passed, watch them, clowns
With them, crocodile smiles
'Cause they phony, I get that cash, stay lonely
And I'm point like a thorn, and it's survival of the strong
Livin' outside the laws of this crooked world I was born
Touched

[Hook: 2Pac]
My young niggas in the wildlife
Criminal mind of a juvenile, still livin' child life
Thinkin' he can make his pay, too in a rush
Niggas better slow down, 'cause you can be touched
Young niggas in the wildlife
Criminal mind of a juvenile, still livin' child life
Thinkin' he can make his pay, too in a rush
Niggas better slow down, 'cause you can be touched

[Verse 1: Young Noble]
Yo, I can see, that you obviously, don't know me
Or my homies We O-U-T Lawz, fuck the phonies
A wise hustler once told me "It's on you"
Though it was dreams when he first told me, now it's true
I got love for you only to a certain extent
Niggas ain't worth shit, cops and ride dick permits
I heard this and heard that about them O-U-T Lawz
Some of them soldiers got shot, some of them soldiers fell off
Fuck y'all now everybody tied to us
Hollerin' out a nigga name (What a fine young outlaw nigga y'all) But never said what up
That shit critical, despicable, unforgivable

[?] like I blew, ya own fan won't remember you
Thuggin' but we still spiritual, clear lyrical
I'm like the fuckin Def Squad, my ears ain't hearin' y'all
Pump fear in ya, but damn I ain't even wanna to scare ya
Listen to what I tell ya, fuck the world
Your baby moms, and your baby girl
You muthafuckas so fake, yo they made me wanna earl
Blake, hate snakes thug hatin' degree
Outlawz on a paper chase, can you relate
Thug niggas

[Hook: Young Noble]
We, will never, fall
Through it all, we'll always stand tall
Cause in the end we'll be remembered as some young muthafuckin' soldiers
And if you believe in that shit that you heard
Y'all don't know us, y'all don't know us

[Verse 2: Napoleon]
Now I've been trapped down, and fucked from day one
This indestructible style of mine, ain't no fun
Where I'm from, you sure to see about 10 niggas in a bedroom
Heatin' on the same spoon, sweepin' with the same broom
It's hazard, if you don't want yo life, well give me grab it
I was born inside a love zone, with a Glock-nine young marriage
It's critical then one of them sat down livin' so mystical
And influenced with a heart full of anger it's so ridiculous
So give me some with a 21-gun soldier salute
With a 19-inch black handle steak knife in my boots
Strength of the strong, dark to yo' light right in your wrong
I'll put the good to yo' evil, I'm the shells in yo' chrome
You dig that? I'm life, I bring the moon to your night
I put the dick to your wife and I'm the Jesus of your Christ
You dig that? respect this I bring the end to yo' clog
I bring the loc to your heart, and I put the snoop on ya dogs
You hear me?
Well follow, this little bullet so hollow
I can promise that this ecstasy ain't promised tomorrow
With this two man maze, me and my soul death astrayed
I watched my parents get blowed away, now look what it made
I'm something to face this ludacy deain' with me you dealin' with chemistry
Got my eyes on you, the first time you cross me
I'll be fryin' you, cause y'all don't know me

[Hook: Young Noble]
We will never fall
Through it all, we'll always stand tall (Why)
Cause in the end we'll be remembered as some young muthafuckin soldiers

[Verse 3: E.D.I]
When we was kids, the lovin' felt good
But of course havin' respect feels even better
Now for this chedder, niggas is layin' deader
Then Malcolm and Martin, put together
Oh Lord only knows, where we'll end up
Remember 'Pac said "Watch the fuckin' signs"
But we wasn't listenin', too busy trippin' off his shine
Now one time for my muthafuckin' Outlawz
Napoleon, Noble, and Kastro, may we all raw
And if you don't know, we got the rap game petro
Scared cause we 'bout to release, like heavy metal
Nationwide, underground, we runnin' the ghettos
Stealin' all of ya fan base, like we kleptos
Bitch I can't let go I've been strugglin' too long
Thuggin' too long and niggas is stealin' my shit, and bustin' it wrong
Hot shots holla back, when you get 'em
Outlawz'll sic 'em, bustin' back at the system
Militant wisdom, preparin' myself for Armageddon
Breakin' my balls at this game, knowin' it's a dead end
And my only weapon is my belief that I'm superior
Yeah, we the muthafuckas you niggas is leery off
Controlin' my steam, knowin' my team deserve more
Fuck the reframe, stick to the game and earn more
Holdin' my head, rollin' the head with focus
Laughin' inside, cause deep inside, y'all don't know us

[Hook: Young Noble]
We will never fall
Through it all, we'll always stand tall (Why)
Cause in the end we'll be remembered as some young muthafucka soldiers
And if you believe in that shit that you heard
Y'all don't know us, y'all don't know us
We will never fall (Never)
Through it all, we'll always stand tall
Cause in the end we'll be remembered as some young muthafucka soldiers
And if you believe in that shit that you heard
Y'all don't know us, y'all don't know us

[Outro: E.D.I Talking]
Ain't never know niggas like us boy
They don't make niggas like us no more
Thug in Peace.. to all my niggas (Never)
See ya soon.. uhh

[Intro]
(Hahhh, hahaha) Hehehe, word
It's like all we got left – teardrops and closed caskets
(Throw it up, fool! Hey, nigga, haha)
Tell me how you feel, homie

[Verse 1: 2Pac & (Outlawz)]
(Yeah, it took a week to go down)
You recollects and see how crazy it sounds
The whole town's on a mission, adolescents (Penitentiary bound)
(Now introducin' Young Trigga)
Since birth, eyes set on gettin' bigger
Just another wild-ass nigga
(But he was fiendin' for Precious) WHAT?
(But Precious was a ghetto girl)
Couldn't be no sex without that gold Lexus
(But Lil' Trigga was heartbroken, he had to get his papers)
Seein' visions of people smokin' and niggas catchin' vapors
Got his man from around the corner (we call him Lil' Mo)
(Been in so many reform schools they had to let him go)
(Here's where the plot thickens)
They got a plot to make a profit with they Glocks spittin'
(They call the squad, hittin' blocks with they guns blowin')
(Somebody's gonna die tonight)
Still no one's knowin' so they kept goin'
Catchin' dealers comin' out they cars
(Will they survive? Two semi-automatic 9's)
(them niggas died)
(Plus nobody in the hood cries)
(It's like they celebrate to death and wish they could die)
So peep the lesson, but wait a minute, back to Precious
She's snortin' dope in the back seat of Trigg's Lexus
Teardrops and closed caskets

[Hook: Nate Dogg & (2Pac w/ Outlawz)]
Will I!!.., forever be!!.., alone!!!?
(Teardrops and closed caskets)..
(Teardrops and closed caskets)
Will I!!.., forever be!!.., alone!!!?
(Teardrops and closed caskets)

[Verse 2: 2Pac & Outlawz]
(Don't let these ghetto streets get you, Precious)
(was the victim, from a dime to a nickel)
Hopin God's blessings stick with ya
Picture the neighborhood kingpin, who's gettin' bigger
Familiar face, but a man now, it's Lil' Trigga
Now Lil' Mo was a soldier to the fullest
Down for his homies, always the first to spit bullets
(All he wanted was to be a thug)
Never pictured his truest homeboy would fall in love
(Here's where it gets ya)
Now Precious is pregnant, Lil' Trigga is happy
He wants to marry her now (not knowin' he ain't the daddy)
But Precious was lonely, while Lil' Trigga was makin' dough
She's slippin' in secret places and gettin' with Lil' Mo
The neighborhood's buzzin', now people are talkin'
Lil' Trigga's gettin' pictures of the both of 'em walkin'
(Hand in hand, couldn't understand)
How his baby's mama could disappear with another man (and his best friend)
Now jealousy's dangerous, and if you don't believe me
Then watch the way that this story ends and maybe you'll see
There ain't no heroes or villains, ain't no pleasure in killin'
Just the smoke from the cap peelin', a man with no feelings
Teardrops and closed caskets

[Hook: Nate Dogg & (2Pac w/ Outlawz)]
Will I!!.., forever be!!.., alone!!!?
(Teardrops and closed caskets)
(Bury you dead and look ahead)
(a man with no feelings)
(Teardrops and closed caskets)
Will I!!.., forever be!!.., alone!!!?
(Teardrops and closed caskets)

[Verse 3: Outlawz]
Now with the problems of poverty and the tricks to these tales
How many people'll die? How many'll live to tell?
Although best friends before, Lil' Trigga and Mo
They in an all out war, over a fiend they ain't know
Behind the curtains their privacy lust is already laid down
The results is the same with different names and it turns out

[Ad-libs: 2Pac]
Y'all know how it is, same old thing in the same old town
Lil' Trigg got his nose wide open on this one trick
Now he's played out

[Verse 4: 2Pac & (Outlawz)]
Think it's Lil' Mo (was plottin' plans on gettin' bigger)
(Precious was his way to put his hands on Lil' Trigga)
All the while let's look at Precious, too dumb to see what's goin' down (too doped up to ask questions)
Used to be comrades, (but now we blast on sight)
What could be so bad?, (God, will we last tonight?)
From misdemeanors to felonies, small-time to sellin' ki's
I can't believe the shit they tellin' me
They opened fire, three bodies dropped, so call the cops
(Precious, Lil' Mo and Trigg) – teardrops and closed caskets

[Overlapped Hook: Nate Dogg & (2Pac w/ Outlawz)]
Will I!!.., forever be!!.., alone!!!?
(Teardrops and closed caskets)
Will I!!.., forever be!!.., alone!!!?
(Teardrops and closed caskets)
Will I!!.., forever be!!.., alone!!!?
Will I!!.., forever be!!.., alone!!!?
(Teardrops and closed caskets)
Will I!!.., forever be!!.., alone!!!?
Will I!!.., forever be!!.., alone!!!?

[Collision: 2Pac]
Aye, QDIII in this motherfucker
We dedicate this to all the fallen comrades (that's right)
All the homies that didn't make it to see this day
(rest in peace)
Yaknahmean? I know it's hard out there, heheh
With teardrops and closed caskets
It's like that's all we got to look forward to these days
Murders, brothers dyin', funerals
Shit, it's like I done ran out of suits, homie
I done ran out of tears
Know we gon' have to do something y'all
We gon' have to do something
'Cause I know all these mothers is tired of seeing the same thing (rest in peace)
I send this out to Mutulu and Geronimo
And to all the fallen comrades, all the soldiers
(to the homie Boonie, rest in peace, nigga)
All the homies that fell, all the homies
May God bless your families
May you always live in the motherfuckin' heart
In a thug nigga's heart forever (that's right)
Rest in peace, nigga
May your enemies be deceased, dead on the streets
We can't have peace 'til the niggas get a piece

[Intro: Kastro]
Dear Lord, as we down here, struggle for as long as we know
In search of a paradise to touch (My nigga Johnny J)
Dreams are dreams, and reality seems to be the only place to go, the only place for us
I know, try to make the best of bad situations
Seems to be my life's story
Ain't no glory in pain, a soldier's story in vain
And can't nobody live this life for me
It's a ride y'all, a long hard ride

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Somebody wake me, I'm dreamin'
I started as a seed, the semen
Swimmin' upstream, planted in the womb while screamin'
On the top was my pops, my mama screamin' stop
From a single drop, this is what they got
Not to disrespect my peoples, but my papa was a loser
Only plan he had for mama was to fuck her and abuse her
Even as a little seed, I could see his plan for me
Stranded on welfare, another broken family
Now what was I to be? A product of this heated passion
Mama got pregnant and papa got a piece of ass
Look how it began, nobody gave a fuck about me
Pistol in my hand, this cruel world can do without me
How can I survive? Got me askin' white Jesus
"Will a nigga live or die?" cause the Lord can't see us
In the deep dark clouds of the projects, ain't no sunshine
No sunny days and we only play sometimes
When everybody's sleepin'
I open my window, jump to the streets and get to creepin'
I can live or die, hope I get some money 'fore I'm gone
I'm only 19, I'm tryna hustle on my own
On the spot where everybody and they pops tryna slang rocks
I'd rather go to college, but this is where the game stops
Don't get it wrong cause it's always on, from dusk to dawn
You can buy rocks, Glocks or a herringbone
You can ask my man, he's a mind reader
Keep my 9 heater all the time, this is how we grind
Meet up at the cemetery then get smoked out
Pass the weed, nigga! That Hennessey'll keep me keyed, nigga
Everywhere I go niggas holla at me, "Keep it real, G"
And my reply 'til they kill me: "Act up if you feel me!"
I was born not to make it, but I did
The tribulations of a ghetto kid, still I rise

[Chorus: Ta'He]
Still I (Still I), I rise (I rise), please, give me to the sky (To the sky)
And if (And if), I die (I die), I don't want you to cry

[Verse 2: Yaki Kadafi]
I stay sharp as always
Runnin' your bricks with blitz, through your project hallways
Dumpin' crews like two's, nigga, all day
Secrets of war prepare me for the worst
A life that's lavish, full of cabbage or a life that's in a hearse
But now my dreams, it seems though
Be placin' triple beams and things, bro
Diamond pinkie ring got the loot poppin' out my jeans

[Verse 3: Napoleon]
Now I plan to keep my Glock cocked
If trouble was searchin' for me, then why not?
Show 'em what I'm made of, plus raised on, on my block
Chancellor Ave, where many turn to the street
Thugs snatchin' bags, preoccupied with makin' cash
It wasn't fast, it'll make me mad, I'm just like him
My homie on the corner with his gat tucked in
Youngins, they buckin' somethin'
The life he lead's the life he don't need, don't we all know?
He tryin' to rise up and we just go doe, still he rise

[Verse 4: Young Noble]
Dreams of lost hope
I hit the strip broke where the fiends get coke
And still I rise, now I float, cowards ghost
Whenever we come around, I'm runnin' down
Clutchin' a pound, live as sirens, duckin' the sound
I used to hustle with my moms 'til the sun came
My homie Harm doin' time from this drug game
Stolen cars, war scars, born a outlaw
Behind bars, go to sleep just to see the stars
Freedom is ours, though we trapped on a firm block
Crackheads only 10 learn to duck cops

[Verse 5: Yaki Kadafi]
In '96 my Glock's my plastic, passion for blastin' bastards
No faces for open caskets, peelin' your cap backwards
You cowards ain't prepared for pistol practice
I send my missiles through your mattress
Leavin' holes in your body like a cactus
While me and my crew be boppin' more greens than topic
And loot to keep the seams in my motherfuckin' jeans poppin'
Leavin' your spleen to pick up
Half of you niggas is softer than a Snicker
Let's go to war and see who draw quicker
And still I rise, and still I rise—

[Chorus: Ta'He]
Still I (Still I), I rise (I rise), please, give me to the sky (To the sky)
And if (And if), I die (I die), I don't want you to cry
Still I (Still I), I rise (I rise), please, give me to the sky (To the sky)
And if (And if), I die (I die), I don't want you to cry

[Outro: some little kid]
Y'all niggas be fake, all day every day
So now I got roller blades, bitch
Thought you knew
Your mouth is rich
C'mon pops, let's go!

[Intro: E.D.I Mean & 2Pac]
Uhh, dear Mr. President. What's happenin'?
I'm writin' you because
Shit is still real fucked up in my neighborhood
Pretty much the same way
Right around the time when you got elected…
Ain't nothin' changed. All the promises you made, before you got elected… they ain't came true
Tell me what to do, these niggas actin' up in the hood
Send mo' troops, dear Mr. President
(Me and my homies is wonderin' what's goin' on… holla!)
Tell me what to do, these niggas actin' up in the hood
Send mo' troops…

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Why should I lie when I can dramatize?
Niggas fell victim to my lyrics, now traumatized
Simply by spittin' I've been blessed given riches
Enemies suspicious 'cause I'm seldom in the company of bitches
Plus the concepts I depict, so visual that you can kiss
Each and every trick or bitch, inside the shit I kick
My heaviest verse'll move a mountain
Casualties in mass amounts, brothers keep countin'
Fuck the friendships, I ride alone
Destination: Death Row – finally found a home
Plus all my homies wanna die; call it euthanasia
Dear Lord, look how sick this ghetto made us
Sincerely yours, I'm a thug, the product of a broken home
Everybody's doped up, nigga, what you smokin' on?
Figure if we high they can train us
But then America fucked up and blamed us
I guess it's 'cause we black that we targets
My only fear is God, I spit that hard shit
In case you don't know I let my pump go
Get it ride for Mutulu like I ride for Geronimo
Down to die for everything I represent
Meant every word in my letter to the President

[Hook: 2Pac]
Dear Mr. President, tell me what to do
These niggas actin' up in the hood, send mo' troops
Dear Mr. President, tell me what to do
These niggas actin' up in the hood, send mo' troops

[Verse 2: E.D.I. Mean]
Oh you's a baller in the White House, I hope you comfortable
'Cause yo', I spend my nights out, with the lights out
Under the safety of darkness
Amongst the crazed and the heartless
And young soul bros, ready to rode a starship

[?], leave a nigga flat for scratch
The Godless, I gotta get chips, but you can't understand that
Wanna ban rap? - Stand back, before you get hurt
It's the only thing nigga pay the paper besides smoke and work
On a mission, listen 

[?] with precision
First made my decision, I realized this ain't livin'
Trippin' to drastic measures, tryin' to get stacks of cheddar
Motherfuckers hate cops, wait, it ain't gettin' better
But you keep tellin' us that it is
While your motherfuckin' troops keep killin' our kids
Dig, don't be surprised if you see us
Dumpin' with nothing but artillery to free us, motherfucker

[Hook: E.D.I. Mean]
Dear Mr. President, tell us what to do
These niggas actin' up in the hood, send mo' troops
Dear Mr. President, tell me what to do
These niggas actin' up in the hood, send mo' troops

[Verse 3: Kastro]
Strapped and angry, with no hope, and heart-broke
Fightin' first my trained brain until it's not so
It's hostile, niggas lick shots to watch the Glocks glow
Cadres of coppers patrol us like we some animals
And it ain't no peace, my peace a piece on my streets
To people beefin' and things squeakin' on they fiefs for weeks
Mr. President, it's evident, nobody really care
For a struggler out the gutter, 22 with gray hair
I was raised to raise hell, frail and my heart stale
So I'ma bring hell to Earth until my heart fail
But y'all play fair, give me and mine, I'll share
'Til y'all show us you care, it's gon' be mayhem out here
Me and these 223's will freeze the biggest with ease
I'm still a nigga you fear, bring the beast to his knees
And I've been born to represent, for that I've been heaven-sent
And I meant every word in my letter to the President

[Ad-libs: E.D.I Mean]
Shit is still fucked up, y'all. And y'all wonder when it's gon' get better, and it ain't gon' get better

[Hook: 2Pac]
Dear Mr. President, tell me what to do
These niggas actin' up in the hood, send mo' troops
Dear Mr. President, tell me what to do
These niggas actin' up…

[Verse 4: 2Pac]
Heavenly Father, may I holla at you briefly?
I wanna meet the President, but will he meet me?
Is he scared to look inside the eyes of a thug nigga?
We tired of being scapegoats for this capitalistic drug dealin'
How hypocritical is Liberty?
That blind bitch ain't never did shit for me
My history full of casket and scars
My own black nation at war, whole family behind bars
And they wonder why we scarred, 13 lookin' hard
Sister had a baby as an adolescent, where was God?
Somewhere in the middle of my mind
Is a nigga on the tightrope, screamin', "Let him die!"
Can't lie, I'm a thug, drownin' in my own blood
Lookin' for the reason that my momma's strung out on drugs
Down to die for everything I represent
Meant every word in my letter to the President

[Verse 5: Big Syke]
Blacks is broke, think it's a joke that we livin' low?
Y'all sniffin' blow and postin' what they hittin' fo'?
Tell the secretary it's necessary we get paid
Look what you made, little kids gettin' sprayed
Day after day, and night after night
Battles and wars to the daylight
We might change and rearrange if you do somethin'
'Til then we gonna keep it comin', Mr. President
And I meant every word in my letter to the President

[Ad-libs: 2Pac]
Word motherfuckin' life, what the fuck this nigga think?
Cuttin' taxes, takin' off welfare
We 'sposed to just sit here, go broke and die, starvin'?!
Motherfuckers crazier than a motherfuckin' scout
Nigga, this Thug Life, Westside, Outlaw Immortalz
Nigga, we finna hustle 'til we come up

[Hook: 2Pac]
Dear Mr. President, tell me what to do
These niggas actin' up in the hood, send mo' troops
Dear Mr. President, tell me what to do
These niggas actin' up in the hood, send mo' troops
Dear Mr. President, tell me what to do
These niggas actin' up in the hood, send mo' troops
Dear Mr. President, tell me what to do
These niggas actin' up in the hood, send mo' troops

[Outro: 2Pac]
Dear Mr. Clinton, shit (send mo' troops)… it's gettin' harder and harder for a motherfucker to make a dollar in these here streets
I mean shit (send mo' troops), I hear you screamin' peace
But we can't find peace
'Til my little niggas on these streets get a piece (send mo' troops)
I know you fear me 'cause you too near me not to hear me
So why don't you help a nigga out? (send mo' troops)
Sayin' you cuttin' welfare
That got us niggas on the street, thinkin' who in the hell care? (send mo' troops)
Shit, y'all want us to put down our Glocks and our rocks
But y'all ain't ready to give us no motherfuckin' dollars (send mo' troops)
What happened to our 40 acres and a mule fool? (send mo' troops)
We ain't stupid, think you got us lookin' to lose
Tryin' to turn all us young niggas into troops (send mo' troops)
You want us to fight your war, what the fuck I'm fightin' for? (send mo' troops)
Shit, I ain't got no love here
I ain't had a check all year, taxin' all the blacks (send mo' troops)
Police beatin' me in the streets… fuck peace!
These niggas actin' up in the hood, send mo' troops..troops..troops..troops!

Will somebody call me a cab?

So betta yet call me an ambulance

[Chorus]
Cause I'ma dopefiend baby, I don't know why
All I wanna do is get high
Between your legs is where my brain is at
Cause I'ma nymphomaniac

I used to smoke marijuana when I was a kid
Now I'm trippin on acid
I'm high on every drug known to mankind
So go ahead and pass it

[Chorus]

My designated driver was this girl
Her name was Carolyn
But I can't go home cause she just died from an overdose of heroin
She's a dopefiend baby
She don't know why
All she wants to do is get high
Between her legs is where my brain is at
Cause I'ma nymphomaniac

[Chorus]

This butt naked girl sat next to me
And offered me some ecstasy
Then she gave me a big fat kiss with a mouth full of LSD

[Chorus]

Wave your hands in the air
Then wave it like you just don't care
If you got on clean underwear somebody say oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Check it out all the homeboys gather round cuz

Shit, God damn, get off your ass and jam
Shit, God damn, get off your ass and jam

[Chorus - repeat 3X]

Hell yeah, A man, I'm gonna do some impersonations right
A, the first one is a mixture between the lead singer of the B-52's
And Robert Smith from the cure right

[Chorus]
I'm gonna do Axl Rose from Guns N Roses cuz

[Chorus]

Willie Nelson, Willie Nelson, we gonna sing some country
Maybe I didn't fuck you
But little darling don't cry
The fact is I masturbated
About an hour before you came by
You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind
On the road again
Open up your legs and let me stick it in
My favorite past time is making love to my girlfriend
I can't wait to shoot my load again
Shoot my load again
Stick my dick some where it's never been

[Verse 1]
Walking down the street with a gangsta limp
Hoes on the corner like a O.G. pimp
Feelin real good cuz I'm drunk and high
Throwin up the hood as the cars go by
The light turned green and I started to bail
Across the street, drunk as hell
Seen a fine girl at the red light
Her face her hair her car was tight
The light turned green and she had to go
The bitch pulled over at the liquor sto'
She got out the car and walked around
And there I was, posted 'cuz
She looked at the Khakis hangin off my ass
She put her head down and tried to pass real fast
But on the way back out, before she left
I asked her with Colt 45 on my breath

[Hook]
Can I get my freak on with you? (come here baby)
Smoke some weed and drink some brew (I love ya body)
Can I get my freak on with you? (yeah)
Smoke some weed and drink some brew (oww)

[Verse 2]
When I heard Too Short "The Freaky Tales"
I was still a virgin, I was mad as hell
Had nothin to lose, everythang to prove
Tryin to fuck every duck that moved
Hangin at the swapmeet, drunk and high
Flirtin with the hoodrats walkin by
Sometimes I got dissed, sometimes I got laid
Sometimes I got ganked, sometimes I got paid
High school parties in East Palmdale
Dancin with a female lookin bomb as hell
With a booty up against me make me feel real good
Plus her hands between my legs rubbin on my wood
My dick Johnny Cochran gets real hard
And all of a sudden, I want the broad
High on weed, drunk on beer
That's when I whispered in her ear

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Redheads, blond hoes, Puerto Ricans and chicanos
Oriental girls not mention black
Back to back, stacked like a six-pack
Panties droppin, bra unstrappin
Like Mariah Carey I'mma +Make It Happen+
Whoo whoo (whoo whoo), ride hoes like my Coupe
I'm 30 years old in 2004
I got a wife and I don't fuck around no more
Ay, remember Joby, well Joby's a giant
And bitches wanna do me like I'm Kobe Bryant
Too many skeezers, too many diseases
Now I'm in the Bible tryna be like Jesus
I used to be a gigalo back in the day
I remember when I used to say

[Hook: 2x]

[Hook: 2x]
Don't grab my keys when the party's over
I drive better drunk than you do sober

[Verse 1]
I don't know what you've been told
I've been drinkin since 12 years old
Started in 1988
Hanging at the liquor store real real late
I drunk a swallow, I drunk a cup
Drunk the bottle, I threw up
Over the years, I learned to pace it
Get kinda tipsy, but not that wasted
I like beer, but I love malt liquor
Cuz malt liquor, get me drunk quicker
Stop on the freeway, take a whiz
Hop in my Cadillac and handle my biz
I drive better drunk than I do sober
Cuz when I'm sober right
I think I can make through the, red light
Go, go, go, I hope I'm not dead right
But when I'm drunk, I know I can't
So I ain't, I drive like a saint
Drinkin is a class I did not flunk
I'm a Colt 45 certified drunk

[Hook: 2x]

[Verse 2]
I dropped outta school in 9-0
Became the world's greatest wino
I drink at home, I drink at work
Ignore the boss, he just a jerk
I drink 12:00 in the day
Relax my nerve, serve my yay'
When my day go bad, I always drink
Calm down, relax and think
Only days we like to clown
A 24-ounce 'fore the sun go down
On weekends, that's when it's cool
To drink a 40-ounce, and act a fool
Once I get into that zone
I leave that beer and that liquor alone
I can barely walk, I can barely talk
But I can glide that Cadillac like a hawk

[Hook: 2x]

[Verse 3]
I ran from the cops in the rain
With my church shoes on
I drove from Palmdale, California to Compton
Drunk two 40-ounces, Old English 800, the club ended
All the homies left my in the parkin lot toe' back
Wasn't nobody out there but me and the sheriff department
Fell asleep on the 14
Woke up on the 405
Fell asleep on the 405
Woke up on the 105
Fell asleep on the 105
Woke up in bed
Call that, uh, autopilot
But don't try that at home; I got skills
I am to liquor, what the Crocodile Hunter is to alligators
"These crocs, they're not your ordinary crocs
"You gotta grab them in the mandible"
We can't find no hotels man (you know what I'm sayin)
So we might have to drive
All day, and all night
I got some music
So it's alright

[Repeat 4x]
All day, and all night
I got some music
It's alright

Make you feel good
Rollin through the hood
With your windows down
Checkin out your sounds
Just lend me a light
No stress and strive, baby

[Intro]
I done been to jail for a lot of stupid shit
And when you go to jail for a lot of stupid shit, you try not to go back
And I...you know...I take precaution, you know
However, sometimes you can take too much precaution
To the point where it gets - ridiculous. Haha, aww man

[Verse 1]
Each day at my dope spot
I watch him as he passes by (Hey black, hey black who dat man, who dat?)
I say to myself he looks like the FBI (Yeah)
A white man like him (White man like him?)
What is he doing over here? (You know what I'm sayin? I don't know)

[Hook]
It was just my paranoia (hey hey hey)

So uh, I'ma do it quick and clever (quick and clever)
However, drinkin malt liquor, smokin endo (endo)
Two cops ran by my window (aww shit)
It's a raid (a raid?) - or that's what I assumed (yeah)

[Hook]
It was just my paranoia (hey hey hey)
Running away with me yeah

And we'd be goin off man
Hey, you know what I hate though (What's that man?)

[Verse 3]
I hate them late model cars doggonnit
Look like bikes with all those antennaes on it
Paranoid I used to sell yell man
Trippin on the telephone and the mailman
Treat customers like compulsive liars (compulsive liars)
Raise their shirt and check for wires (check for wires)
I got a little money but I need a little more
Damn somebody's knockin at my front door
Some guy in a shirt and tie (shirt and tie)

[Afroman talking]
Hey man, you know where my paranoia really get me at man? (What's that?)

Everybody be lookin like undercovers, cause they be starin (Man you know)
And I don't be knowin, you know what I'm sayin?

[Verse 4]
I hate sellin dope
I think about stoppin
Undercover cops follow me while I'm shoppin (damn)
Trackin me with a hidden camera (hidden camera)
Plottin to throw me back in the slammer
They think I don't see em, but yes I do (yes I do)
They some haters (haters), actin like they pickin tomatoes (pickin tomatoes)
I'm ready for quick decisions (quick decisions)
Keep 'em in my peri-fee-al vision (in my peri-fee-al vision)
I see 'em in the airport, plain and clear
Street clothes with that little wire in their ear
They rush me, shake my hand
"I'm your biggest fan, sign this for me Afroman"

[Hook]
Just my paranoia (hey hey hey)
Running away with me
It was just my paranoia
Running away
It was just my paranoia
Running away with me yeah
It was just my paranoia
Running away

[Verse 5]
You know
I wrote a hit song "Because I Got High" (high)
Signed with Universal
Now my bank account's dry
Universal records, yeah mon
Took my money like Enron
Broke and alone
Things got hard
However, it brought me close to God
I changed my life and became a Christian, singer, rapper, and musician
I've been high, I've been low, I've been rich, I've been po', I've been right, I've been wrong
Since I been with God my paranoia's gone

[Hook - Repeat until fade]
No more paranoia (hey hey hey)
Running away with me yeah
I have no more paranoia
Running away (aww yeah)

My girl got real long hair
Down to her underwear
My girl gotta slender waste
Her favorite seat is on my face

[Afroman talking]
When you born in this world
You get these people that you coincidently grow up with
And you get this illusion of friendship
You know what I'm saying man
But as you get older
You notice, you notice people trying to take advantage of you
You notice people trying to like manipulate you
Then all of the sudden homeboy
It hits you
And you realize
You ain't got no friends cuz

Gotta get on down
Gotta get on down
Gotta get on down
Gotta get on down
Gotta get on down
You know I gotta get on down
Gotta watch my back
Gotta watch my back
Cause I might get jacked
Gotta pack my gun
Gettin beat up ain't no fun
Yeah baby baby
Aw yeah aw yeah aw yeah

[Chorus]
We don't kick it no more
You ain't my friend
You need to pay me back my ends
Cause you ain't my friend
Stop drinkin my gin
You ain't my friend, you ain't my friend, you ain't my friend
You be pinchin my sack
Cause you ain't my friend
Talkin all behind my back
Cause you ain't my friend
Yo man it's all good
But you ain't my friend
Cuz we from the same hood
But you ain't my friend
Droppin dope in my yard
You ain't my friend
Tryin to scope out my broad
Cause you ain't my friend
Never visit me in jail
You ain't my friend
Never post my bail
Cause you ain't my friend

When it comes to friends I ain't got none
All I got is a double barrel shotgun
I can't stand a useless man that has no plan
Lookin at me with an empty hand
You always talkin but you never listen
When you ride in my car CDs come up missin
And that's strange
Damn, what happened to my loose change
If I remember correctly, you was flat broke
Now you eatin on chips and drinkin on a soda loc
Lookin at me smilin
But yo I need some gas and my stomach is growlin
Fools always act like they down with me
But they never wanna go outta town with me
Flip about four or five pounds with me
Get a motel sleep on the ground with me
But when I get back with my money stacked
All the homies start beggin and talkin smack
Tryin to scheme and plot on the cash I got
A cuz go head and shake the spot

[Chorus]

I used to be a gang member
Now I'ma gangsta
I don't trust he she him nor her
There's no honor among thieves
Everybody got tricks up they sleeves
You say you my friend but that's a bunch of noise
I stopped kickin back with my homeboys
That same mother fucker that's shakin ya hand
Be the first one to rat to the police man
Just when you think you've found a buddy
Get drunk and your buddy start actin nutty
Now isn't this an excellent adventure
He turned on you like a Doberman pincher
Crazy, as it seems
Afroman gotta million dreams
I can't hang with ya'll and drink alcohol
Get into a brawl over nothing at all
I got plans but you don't believe em
Hangin round you I'll never achieve em

Aw yeah, aw yeah, aw yeah
A, this one for all the loners out there
I ain't got no family
I ain't got no friends
Only thing that I have
Is a big fat bottle of gin
Make me feel all right
Make me feel all right
Soothe me till i'm satisfied
Yeah make me feel all right
I got the gangsta blues
Yeah got the gangsta blues
Stacy Adams shoes
With the gangsta blues
Do the crip walk
Do the crip walk
A everybody, do the crip walk
A cuz, do the crip walk
Do the crip walk
Do the crip walk
Nobody loves me but my mama
And I think she's lying too

That's all right
(Intro)
Hahahaha, yeah
Just move from side to side
C'mon y'all

(Hook)
I can't sleep at night
Cause the couple next door just fuss and fight
But when the night's over and it's daylight
They hug and kiss and everything's alright
Head, shoulders, feet, and toes
Scratched up knee caps and elbows
Every night, they duckin blows
But they still together and that's how it goes

(Verse 1)
This is a story of Jack and Jill
No, not the ones who went up the hill
I mean a couple lovers that live next door
They always fightin, and I keep the score
They be pettin and pokin
Jabbin and jokin
Coo'in and crackin
Moo'in and whackin
Neckin and knockin
Sangin and sockin
Squakin and squeezin
Burnin and freezin
He holds her hand, long as he able
But when he lets her go, she bops him with a table
Pattin and pinchin
Cloutin and clenchin
Havin theyself a good tiiime
(Hook)
I can't sleep at night
Cause the couple next door just fuss and fight
But when the night's over and it's daylight
They hug and kiss and everything's alright
Head, shoulders, feet, and toes
Scratched up knee caps and elbows
Every night, they duckin blows
But they still together and that's how it goes

(Verse 2)
Reverend Green thought he called one day
On this nice newly-wed across the way
But just as the pastor knocked on the door
A right connected and he hit the floor
They was pettin and poppin
Bangin and boppin
Coo'in and kissin
Hittin and missin
Groovin and grievin
Lovin and leavin
Kickin and cacklin
Ticklin and tacklin
My other neighbor tried to intervention
But one jab knocked out his good intentions
They was stewin and stabbin
Jivin and jabbin
Havin theyself a good tiiime
(Hook)
I can't sleep at night
Cause the couple next door just fuss and fight
But when the nights over and it's daylight
They hug and kiss and everything's alright
Head, shoulders, feet, and toes
Scratched up knee caps and elbows
Every night, they duckin blows
But they still together and that's how it goes

(Verse 3)
A lion escaped from a circus train
Strayed in Jack and Jills domain
They got in a towering rage
The lion took a look and jumped back in the cage
They was swattin and swayin
Plottin and playin
Stompin and stabbin
Groovin and grabbin
Dancin and duckin
Trippin and truckin
Plottin and pleadin
Bangin and bleedin
Her mama said "I'll go fetch her!"
But mama came out ridin on a stretcher
They was hittin and holdin
Faintin and foldin
Havin theyself a good tiiime
(Hook)
I can't sleep at night
Cause the couple next door just fuss and fight
But when the night's over and it's daylight
They hug and kiss and everything's alright
Head, shoulders, feet, and toes
Scratched up knee caps and elbows
Every night, they duckin blows
But they still together and that's how it goes

(Verse 4)
One day a reporter interviewed the wife
Try'na get some data on her hectic life
She said that she never had time for books
She was too busy, duckin left hooks
Swattin and swingin
Sockin and singin
Cuttin and cuddlin
Messin and muddin
Fondle and fussin
Kissin and cussin
Tippin and teasin
Squattin and squeezin
The cop said "Stop! I'm the law!"
Too bad he couldn't stop that right to the jaw
They was jivin and jumpin
Thrivin and thumpin
Havin theyself a good tiiime

(Hook)
I can't sleep at night
Cause the couple next door just fuss and fight
But when the nights over and it's daylight
They hug and kiss and everything's alright
Head, shoulders, feet, and toes
Scratched up knee caps and elbows
Every night, they duckin blows
But they still together and that's how it goes
That's how it goes

[Verse 1]
A little ditty, about the Afroman
A Mississippi rapper, doin the best he can
Afro gon be a hip-hop star
Freestylin in the back of that police car

[Hook]
Oh yeah, life goes on
Long after the Sheriff Department is gone
Oh yeah, I said life goes on
Long after the Sheriff Department is gone

[Verse 2]
Afro got some weed, and hit the bong
He hit the jackpot, when he wrote a hit song
+Because I got High+
Signed with Universal, cuz he was havin fun
But they took his money, like Enron

[Hook]
And oh yeah, life goes on
Long after the thrill of riches is gone
Oh yeah, I said life goes on
Long after the thrill of riches is gone

[Verse 3]
Broke and alone, in a cheap motel
Afro spots a bible and he says "what the hell"
Mama said it's better to give, than it is to receive
Afro went to church and said "I believe"
Universal loved Afro when he was on top
But when he became a Christian, that's when he got dropped
But Jesus would comfort Afro when he prayed
Jesus said "Don't worry bout that money
People download your music off the internet anyway"
Jesus said

[Hook]
And oh yeah, life goes on
Long after corrupt record companies go bankrupt
Oh yeah, I said life goes on
Long after corrupt record companies go bankrupt

[Verse 4]
So let em steal, let em do all this wrong
Let em make evil videos, and encourage evil songs
Keep rippin off artists for as long as you can
People go to the internet and make you a broke man (Laughing)
"Is night shift okay with you?"
"Yes."
"Hey well you got yourself a job, homie"

[Verse 1]
Graveyard shift ain't never dead
We go to work when people go to bed
We got a tremendous work overload
The boss don't care about the dress code
So if your hair's messed up, come on in
Nobody don't care 3 o'clock in the mornin'
I'm fantasizin' about a six fo'
Broke as hell, moppin' the flo'
I don't know but I gots the hunch (what's that?)
That it's almost time for lunch
Smokin' cigarettes in the parkin' lot
All the homies tellin' lies 'bout the women they got
Nobody gets offended at a racial joke (why?)
Everybody's laughin', tryin' to stay woke (yeah)
We takin' it easy though times are hard
Pullin' practical jokes on the security guard
And if you come late, the boss won't boot ya
Standin' 'round, talkin' 'bout the future
Don't even trip if you feel tired
Take a little nap, you won't get fired
Drink a little beer (beer), smoke you a spliff (spliff)
Nobody cares on the graveyard shift (uh, yeah, yeah uh, uh)
{*mouth scratches a chicken cluck*}

[Hook]
Paaaaaaaaarty (yeah!) on the graveyard shift (paaarty)
Paaaaaaaaarty (oh yeah! alright now) on the graveyard shift
(you don't have to slave)
You don't have to slave too hard (oh!) on the grave-aveyard

[Verse 2]
Hey, yeah, uh
My name is Joseph Foreman, they call me 'Fro (cuz)
I worked at the neighborhood grocery store
We actin' crazy like a bunch of kids
Playin' frisbee with the trash can lids
When the bossman comes, baby we don't run
He's a fool like us just tryin' to have fun
Graveyard shift is a little bit prouder
Play the radio just a little bit louder
DJ playin' that midnight mix (mix)
Dance contest on isle number six (six)
Bumpin' that old school Too $hort rhyme (uh)
Got the homeboys in a Soul Train line
If you wanna act crazy, go ahead and be wild
If you wanna rap, go ahead and freestyle
Graveyard shift, you just can't beat it
If you get hungry, grab something and eat it (haha)
Drinkin' in the back with my home girl (yeah)
The beer's on the house from the Corporate World
Act like a fool 'til the break of dawn
Yellin' curse words on the intercom
Drag racin' with the fork lift
Nobody cares on the graveyard shift
(you know what I'm sayin', ha!)

[Hook]
Paaaaaaaaarty (yeah!) on the graveyard shift (everyday)
Paaaaaaaaarty (alright! yeah!) on the graveyard shift
(you don't have to slave, oh yeah!)
You don't have to slave too hard on the grave-aveyard
(break it down, fellas) ohh ohh ohh ohh ohh ohh

[Verse 3]
I never would work on daytime (daytime)
Graveyard shift is my play time (playtime)
Daytime jobs are flaky (flaky)
Daytime jobs are shaky like (what?) Jello Gelatin (gelatin)
So I work graveyard shift like a skeleton (yeah)
An afro-classic is what I am
I drive to work without a traffic jam
Everybody on the graveyard is like my brother
Always lookin' out for each other
Speak up fo' ya like I lawyer
If you come late, we'll punch the clock fo' ya
We gots no money but we got pride
If you car break down I'll give you a ride
Cause the Corporate World is oh so cold
To the people at the bottom of the totem pole
Divided we fall, together we stand
What you need? Get it from the Afroman
I'm not a thief but I got the hook up
For the barbeque ribs you wanna cook up
And if you need somebody to get drunk with
Call the homeboys from the graveyard shift
(Dedicated to all the blue collar workers
Strugglin', strivin', throbbin', thrivin')

[Hook]
Paaaaaaaaarty (if the boss lookin' for me)
On the graveyard shift (I'm in my car asleep, you know what I'm sayin')
Paaaaaaaaarty (hey so watch my back cuz)
On the graveyard shift (tap on the window or something, haha)
You don't have to slave too hard on the grave-aveyard
Ohh ohh ohh ohh ohh ohh

[Verse 4]
Happiness is hard to find
Happiness is a state of mind
It can't be found in fame or wealth
It's found real deep inside yourself
Brothers, stop singin' the blues
Throw parties and barbeques
Don't destroy your life, enjoy your life
Play with your kids and make love to your wife
Drink a little beer, don't smoke no crack
Have a good time before Christ comes back
Keep your head high, keep your back stiff
I'll see you Sunday night for the graveyard shift

[Hook]
Paaaaaaaaarty on the graveyard shift
Paaaaaaaaarty on the graveyard shift
You don't have to slave too hard on the grave-aveyard
Ohh ohh ohh ohh ohh ohh

[Outro]

Hush, hush (yeah yeah)

Hush (listen baby) hush (somebody's callin)
Somebody's callin my name

Somebody's callin my name (I know I'm high but baby)

Somebody's callin my name
Oh my lord, Oh my lord, what shall I do

(You know man, I think about all the hard times that I
Went through and I think)
I'm so glad that trouble don't last always
I'm so glad that trouble don't last always
I'm so glad I'm glad that trouble don't last always
Oh my lord, Oh my lord, what shall I do
I gotta feelin, that everything's gonna be all right
I gotta feelin everything's gonna be all right
I gotta feelin that everything's gonna be all right
Be all right
Be all right

(A man it's funny cause I learnt this song when I was a little kid
When I went to visit my granddaddy down there in Mobile, Alabama
He stayed in this place called Trendy Garden you know what I'm sayin?
He used to grow his vegetables right there on the side of the house
And every now and then he'd get me to help him out know what I'm sayin?
And as he was like weedin out his garden and everything
He'd sing all kinda tunes and hymns know what I'm sayin?
And sometime he'd sing the same one like over and over and over again
You know what I'm sayin?
He'd get tired of singin the words
Sometimes he'd take a sip of his water outta that glass jar, set it back down
And while we was plantin them collard greens, he'd hum it
Just like this right here, help me out cuz, you know how we used to do it)

{*humming*}

It gets all in my hands
It gets all in my feet
It makes me wanna sing my song
To every little girl I meet
It gets all in my heart
It gets all in my sole
It comes straight out my mouth
And then I lose control
Cause I, I got this feelin, that everything's gonna be all right
Be all right
Be all right
Be all right
(Intro)
Yeah, how you doin?
Haha, right
Guess I'mma go ahead and break this weed down, hell yeah
No seeds, just crumble it wit'cha fist
Aww yeah, fresh blunts man
I love it when they split down the middle like a brand new fresh baked brownie.. just ugh

The blunts be crackin like fall leaves n shit, know what I'm sayin?

(Hook)
I smoke two blunts in the morning
I smoke two blunts at night (Smoke two blunts at night)
I smoke two blunts in the afternoon
It makes me feel alright (Makes me feel alright)

I smoke two in the time of war (Two in the time of waaar)
I smoke two blunts before I smoke two blunts
And then I smoke two more (Then I smoke two moooore)

(Verse 1)
Gotta stay calm (Calm) gotta stay cool (Cool)
Can't blow up and act a fool
Wisdom, reason, login, sense
Gotta be relaxed, not tense
I can't overreact (Overreact)
Cause It's over if the wrong person overreact, back (BLat!)
One puff, one day at a time (Day at a time)
One forty ounce, one big fat dime (Big fat dime)
One nation, under a groove (Under a groove)
Nothin to prove
Hit the blunt, don't move (Bucauwk, yeah)
Soothe me baby
Before life, drive me crazy
(Hook)
I smoke two blunts in the morning

(Verse 2)
Early in the mornin 'fore my day gets started (Day gets started)
I grab a knife and my blunt gets parted (Parted)
Grab the trash, if you know what I mean (Know what I mean)
My blunt need to get its colon cleaned (Its colon cleaned)
Tobacco gone, no hesitation (Hesitation)
Restore the blunt with good vegetation (Vegetation)
I got a personal lighter (Personal lighter)
If you steal it, hope you a good fighter

(Afroman talking)
(Palmdale was like the peak of my life
But Palmdale over with homeboy
I'm fittin to go home cuz)
Please take me back home (you know what I'm sayin)
To Mississippi
(I got my Greyhound ticket right here man
I'm fittin to go back and kick it with my family cuz)
Please take me back home (take a couple pounds of this weed)
To Mississippi
(You shmell me homeboy
Yeah, take them fools back to '82 cuz)

Before South Central, Palmdale flossin
I stayed in a place called Palmer's Crossing
Hattiesburg, Mississippi
Smokin marijuana like a Woodstock hippy
All my homies in Laurel
Beg borrow
Buy my rap tape tomorrow
Tell DJ Pumpkin "Keep it crunckin Clyde"
Request my tape when you go inside
So I can take Jane and girl
To Waynesboro
Fuck their little homegirl
Make her toes curl
Rock their world
Leave with their Auntie Sheryl
She sucks me sucks me
Fucks me fucks me
Cries every time I leave Biloxi
But I hops in the Coup
Cause I gots to go
Scoop another ho
From Tupelo
Hit it once hit it twice, then I hit it again
Hit it in Meridian
Make that bitch rub her clit again
Pinch the nipples on her tit again
Suck my dick until she spit again

[Hook]
Please take me back home (Hell yeah)
To Mississippi
Crooked letter crooked letter hump-back hump-back
Afroman's the bomb, bump that
Please take me back home (Hell yeah)
To Mississippi
From the delta to the coast
I'm doin the most
Grab your 40 ounce, let's toast

I sold rock cocaine down in Ellisville
Baseheads hit the pipe, they can tell it's real
Kept my dope stashed with this hoochie
Way down yonder in Eastabuchie
Cops be sweatin outta town dog
Sniffin my car with a hound dog
Separate me from my bitch and shit
Tryin to get my bitch to fuckin snitch and shit
Officer Roscoe P. Coltrane
Runnin warrant checks on the Afroman
But I can't be no hip hop star
Cuffed in the back of some police car
Did you find the gun? NO!
Did you find the dope? NO!
Open up the back door "Well son, you're free to go"
A-F-R-O marijuana cargo
Flossed like a cholow
In a clean low glow
Come on let's all get drunk tonight
I hope I don't fight with a punk tonight
Get nervous
As I swerve this
Cadillac through Purvis
Hope I don't crash when I hit Petal
Get my ass kicked in the white ghetto
Prejudice police won't let me go
So I'mma drive slow
Hide my fro
I was dumb, now I'm dumber y'all
Last summer y'all
I fucked all the little girls down in Sumrall
Grabbed my guitar and started pickin a tune
For Nikki and June
Down in Picayune, baby
Just like a shovel I be diggin
All the pretty young women in Wiggins
On the boat
Gulfport
I got my dick down some girl's throat
I can't help it I'm a Crip baby
I think you need to wipe your lip baby
Hula Hula Hula
The whole house ruler
What's up with all the bitches down in Pascagoula
Small towns, small cities
But they still got big ole asses plus titties
Is it a bird? Is it a plane?
It's the hungry hustler Afroman
Flyin through the air in my underwear
Geri curl activator in my hair
I'm in control like Janet when I hit Jackson
Always gettin plenty panty action
McClaine, even McComb
Tell the whole world Mississippi's your home
Yazoo, Columbia and Natchez
I got the weed brother, who got the matches?
Who got the funky DJ that scratches?
Depend on me like my name was patches
First it was a black thing, just the big Willies
Now I roll Phillies
With all the Hillbillies
Never ever thought I'd see the Klu Klux Klan
Buying front row seats for the Afroman
Confederate flags tobacco in their mouth
It's a beautiful thing jumpin off in the South
Afroman, I'm a part of it
Hattiesburg hip hop I'm the start of it
I'm the latest
I'm the greatest
And all you haters, I'll mash you like potatoes
I'll make your girlfriend holler and scream
Then cook me some cornbread and collard greens

[Hook]

1982, '83, '84
Erin, Broste, Carlos, and Tonto
Tryin to break dance in my B-Boy stance
Micheal Jackson glove, parachute pants
Calvin Gary, Garnett Jones
G-dog cuz, I don't believe we grown
But hey G-dog, you and me'll see dog
Whatever happens cuz, it's you and me dog
Or should I say loc
Cause you my folk
So let's take a toke
Till we croak
I'm a locsta locsta
Hundred spokesta
Drinking everyday like I'm supposed to
Bottle after bottle dog in my lip-a
Flowing on the mic like the Mississippi river

[Hook - 2X]
Ahhhh shit!  Shit!  Shit!
Now, I'm walking down the street with some chicken and a forty
I'm yelling at these hoochies and I'm looking for a party
Drink it fast, make it last, 'til you know it ain't no mo'
Run outta dough, slap the ho
Get the dough and go back to that liquor sto'

[Hook - repeat 4X]
Afroman likes tall cans

Now I'm a afroholic, call me Afroman
Love to sag my khakis with a tall can
My homies pop the forty of some St. Ides
Now that mother (uh!) staggering from side to side
Now, we the loudest homeboys in my neighborhood
We look real bad but we feel so good
My thirst is quenched but my craving won't extinguish
I need some forty ounce mother (uh!) Old English
Put the top in my mouth, put the bottom to the ceiling
Drink it down down until I get that crazy feeling
Now just walking down the street with some chicken and a forty
I'm yelling at these hoochies and I'm looking for a party
Drink it fast, make it last, 'til you know it ain't no mo'
Run outta dough, slap the ho
Get the do' and go back to that liquor sto'

[Hook]
See these girls be acting all bad and rude
Always got a bad attitude

So I wind up dancing by my goddamn self
But I paid my money, just like you
And baby I'mma do what I came to do
You see I can't wait around 'til I get rich
Just to make yo' gold digging attitude switch
So I'm walking down the street with some chicken and a forty

Drink it fast, make it last, 'til you know it ain't no mo'
Run outta dough, slap the ho
Get the do' and go back to that liquor sto'

[Hook]
I stepped into this party full of Mexicans
I didn't realize I was the only black man
One hand on my bottle, the other on my peter
I barked like a dog and started freaking senoritas
I think she was embarrassed with the eight ball in my cup
She kept on stepping back so I kept on stepping up
This vato strolled up, put his gun to my head
I knew if I moved I was officially dead
That had to be his woman, I know it doggonit
That ain't the first time that I got confronted
Got my quete, "What up, ese?  Get the fuck outta here!"
I said, "I'm gone mother fucker, now give me my beer."
Cause I'm just walking down the street with some chicken and a forty
I'm yelling at these hoochies and I'm looking for a party
Drink it fast, make it last, 'til you know it ain't no mo'
Run outta dough, slap the ho
Get the do' and go back to that liquor sto'

[Chrous]
HO HO HO HO HO HO HO HO HO

Put the top in my mouth put the bottom to the ceiling
Drink it diggy diggy down 'til I get that crazy feeling

[Hook - speeds up at end]

[Intro]
A few words of inspiration
This song is dedicated to hustlers standing on the curb
Smokin herb, movin weight from the inner city to the suburbs
Paranoid of jail, pocket full of yall, just waitin on another sale
Sip your beer wipe your tears encourage your peers its gonna be alright

[Hook]
Everything is gonna be alright
Sell your dope! Make your money every night
Them brothers 'round the corner they wanna start a fight
Sell your dope! Keep on hustlin until your money's right
You and your girl, you might argue every night
Sell your dope especially when your pockets are tight
You can't find a job because your skin ain't white
Sell your dope brother you know this world ain't right

[Verse 1]
Hey wussup lil inchworm
I hope this letter make you feel just a little bit better
Got your t-shirt picked your khakis creased
So you can be G'd up when you get released
Me and my homeboys put together some chippers
To buy some beer and a couple of strippers
You can use my car till you find ya own
I can't wait till you get home but later on
That money that you get from your GR check
Should be enough to put you back on deck
Now I know you on parole but don't be scared
This time we'll be prepared
Fuck the feds don't say shit to your broad
Keep your dope stashed in your neighbors yard
When they kick in the door with they steel toed boot
Won't find nothin but a lawsuit, baby baby

[Hook]
Everything is gonna be aright
SELL YOUR DOPE, Make your money every night
Them brothers around the corner they wanna start a fight

Sell your dope brother you know this world ain't right

[Verse 2]
Your baby momma she might trip
Cuz you hangin with a Crip tryin to clock your grip
She can't help a black man out
But when bills come around she's got her hand out
Now the baby needs pampers, Similac...
Plus you need rims for your Cadillac
Ignore your girl when she starts trippin
Keep them kilos flippin Dayton's dipin
We can expand by a little land
Hand the dope game down to the next man
Buy a little business clean the money
Look at the cops funny hey hey hey
Frontin in a Caddy or a beat up Taurus
Got the baby gangsters sellin the shit for us
We can dance underwater and not get wet
Sell crack on the internet but not yet
Everything is gonna be aright SELL YOUR DOPE
Make your money every night
Them brothers around the corner they wanna start a fight
SELL YOUR DOPE keep on hustlin till your moneys right
You and your girl, you might argue every night
Sell your dope especially when your pockets tight

Sell your dope brother you know this world ain't right

Them brothers around the corner they wanna start a fight
SELL YOUR DOPE keep on hustlin till your moneys right
You and your girl, you might argue every night
Sell your dope especially when your pockets are tight
You can't find a job cuz your skin ain't white
Sell your dope brother you know this world ain't right

[Singing and talking]

Early in the morning when I get outta bed

Of pretty young women I found arousin
Grocery store shoppin
Magazine browsin
Many different ways to keep their hair styles in
Full of boredom

Male aggressor
Female impresser
Say the right things possibly undress her
But that's the post game
This is still the pre game
Silly woman she game
Baby what's your name
Even though I'm a freak
I play it off like a college geek
Crack a smile and politely speak
With intellect to the women I select
Hoping that she don't detect
My egotistical chauvinistical lust
I thrust till I scream like Mystikal
YAAAAAAHHHH!
The wrong message I hope I'm not sendin
Laughin and pretendin my dick's not extendin
Can't be over zealous she might discover
She's walking away BITCH! blew my cover

While we're drinkin' and we're drivin'
Hope I don't wreck when my vision gets blurry
Sober up lookin' at an all white jury
Judge don't like no drunk like me
Punk might give me strike number three
'Cause when I'm drunk and when I'm high
I don't give a damn bout a D.U.I
Let's just get lit, dance like a nitwit
Try to talk to the women that we can't get with
Me and my staff make everybody laugh
If the beer runs out we can all go half
It's Friday night got the perfect weather
Let's get drunk together

[Chorus]
Let's all get drunk tonight
I hope I don't fight with a punk tonight
Let's all get high tonight
Maybe nobody will die tonight
Let's all sell yayo tonight
I hope I don't go back to jail tonight
Let's go to the club tonight
Find a woman that wanna make love tonight
A yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

[Verse 2]
Bacardi, Colt .45
Let's party we still alive
Tomorrow, brings pain and sorrow
But tonight, we're all right
Drink that beer till your belly can't hold it
Tell the homeboys we fittin' to get loaded
Rollin through the Ante-dope Valley out there
Hope the cops don't smell that beer on my breath
'Cause if the sheriff, catch a whiff, of that fifth
It'll probably knock him stiff
Don't look dumb if my breath on hum
Stick your hand in you're pocket please, pass some gum
So the cops can't tell my breath smell
We won't go to jail, we'll go to Palmdale
With the beautiful women and the beautiful weather
We can both get drunk together

[Chorus]
Let's all get drunk tonight
I hope I don't fight with a punk tonight
Let's all get high tonight
Maybe nobody will die tonight
Let's all sell yayo tonight
I hope I don't go back to jail tonight
Let's go to the club tonight
Find a woman that wanna make love tonight
A yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

[Verse 3]
Baby I beg your pardon
But your outfit's givin me a hardon
Maybe some way, maybe some how
You could dance with me, right here, right now
Been lookin at you all night long
That DJ's playin my favorite song
Everything's splendid, don't mean no harm
Don't get offended when I pull your arm
I ain't felt this good since I don't know when
And I might not feel this good again
It's Friday night, beautiful weather
Let's get drunk together

[Chorus]
Let's all get drunk tonight
I hope I don't fight with a punk tonight
Let's all get high tonight
Maybe nobody will die tonight
Let's all sell yayo tonight
I hope I don't go back to jail tonight
Let's go to the club tonight
Find a woman that wanna make love tonight
A yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

[Outro]
Let's all get drunk tonight
I hope I don't fight with a punk tonight
Let's all get high tonight
Maybe nobody will die tonight
Let's all sell yayo tonight
I hope I don't go back to jail tonight
Let's go to the club tonight
Find a woman that wanna make love tonight
A yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

[Intro]
Yeah I be actin' crazy, rappin' nasty
But don't get me wrong, I got sense
I'ma thank God on this song man
This song is dedicated to all the homeboys that almost died
But for some strange coincidental
Ironic reason you lived through it homeboy
But I'm here to tell you man
It's not a coincidence and it's not ironic
God got a plan and purpose for your life man
The Quarter Peace Quartet gon' help me sing it right about now, uh
{*chicken cluck*}

[Hook: Quarter Peace Quartet]
God has (come on y'all) smiled on me (yeah)
He has set me free (like when them bullets just fly past you)
Ohhh God has smiled on me and He's been good to me (yeah, uh)

[Verse 1]
Before I was a wild juvenile
I used to be a mild Christian young child
I used to seek and seek, search and search
Analyze everybody in my church
A 1-2, I've seen a lot of hypocrites, religious fakers
Deacon whore mongers and offer takers
When I turned thirteen I thought church was fake
I took all I could take so I took a little break
I went to the world, bought a geri curl
And some crack to slice so I can do my own thang
The street life I didn't understand good
So I started gangbangin' to prove my manhood
Yeah, had fun packin' the gun
The baddest kid on the block was a Christian son
Went to the county jail not once but twice
Gamblin' with my life with the dealin' dice
{*chicken cluck*}

[Hook: Quarter Peace Quartet]
God has smiled on me (yeah)
He has set me free (haha yeah)
Ohhh God has smiled on me and He's been good to me
(uh, yeah)

[Verse 2]
I got released in '94
Told my mamma I don't wanna get in trouble no mo'
I wanna find a job, obtain some wealth
Be independent like you and take care of myself
{*chicken cluck*}
I stopped bangin' (yeah) I really quit
But not the people I got into it wit'
Back in the day from Palmdale to L.A
They got beef wit me homie up until this day
To make a long story short I stepped out the tub
Walked around the corner to the local night club
Sittin' at a table, just doin' my thang
This when I got approached by this rival gang
His gang and my gang just got into it (just got into it)
I tried to explain I didn't do it (uh)
I told ya bro, since '94
I been straight man, I don't mess around no mo'
{*chicken cluck*}

[Hook: Quarter Peace Quartet]
God has smiled on me
He has set me free (can you sing it again?)
Ohhh God has (yeah) smiled on me and He's been good to me

[Verse 3]
You know what he said man? he got smart with me
He said call the mortuary, order some flowers
You quit your game but we ain't never quit ours
{*faint chicken cluck*}
It got excitin', we started fist fightin'
Like Mike Tyson I was scratchin' and bitin' {*chicken cluck*}
A bunch of them started mobbin' me (mobbin' me)
Threw me on the floor and started robbin' me (robbin' me)
The things that they took from me wasn't nothin' major

Wallet, walkman, cheap little pager
They took my food stamps, took my knife
Took me and tried to take my life {*chicken cluck*}
I tried to fight back but my efforts was useless
Ain't know need to makin' up excuses, hey man
I was on the ground (ground) gettin' beat down (down)
Eight different people kickin' me around
I thought about all the bad things I did
When I ran from God as a little bitty kid
No sign, no reason, no clue, no warnin'
No fair nobody cared, 2 o'clock in the mornin'
Heavy licks they was layin' on me
But at the same time my momma, she was prayin' for me
Lights from the helicopter filled the air
And the police cars came everywhere, uh
I told Jesus "I don't deserve You
But let me live and I'll serve You"
God has smiled on me

[Hook: Quarter Peace Quartet]
God has (come on y'all) smiled on me
He has set me free (can you sing it again?)
Ohhh God has (yeah) smiled on me and He's been good to me

[Outro]
Yeah man, uh, sometimes when I'm drinkin' man
I think about my close calls, you know what I'm sayin'
Times I almost got shot
Times I was commitin' crimes, almost got caught by the police
Man I think about car accidents that never happened
I think about homeboys I speak to one day
Next day they catch 50-60 years
Maybe even rest in peace, you know what I'm sayin'
So check this out man, yeah, we still alive, right?
God ain't through with us
So let's put it down man, stop all this madness
You know what I'm sayin'
Go on take care of some situations we need to take care of
And to all the homeboys that robbed me, hey man I'm still alive
So if y'all be so kind, go down there and buy my tape man
That'll make up them food stamps y'all took from me right
{*chicken cluck*}

[Quarter Peace Quartet]
Amazin' grace (haha) how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost but now I'm found
Was blind but now I see
I'm tellin' you God has (He done smiled on me) smiled on me
(He done smiled on me) He has set me free (can you sing it again?)
Ohh God has (yeah) smiled on me (smiled on me now)
And He's been good to me (can you sing that verse?)
Amazin' grace (amazin' grace)
How sweet the sound (how sweet the sound)
That saved a wretch like me (I was lost, can You help me?)
I once was lost (yeah) but now I'm found (uh)
Was blind but now I see

[Verse 1: DJ Felli Fel]
Uhh, Shock Value II!
Hahaha, yo

Now Timb told me he wanted a intro
Uhh, but you know
With some shit like this, you don't really need a intro
But this how we gon' go anyway
Ay, ay

[Verse 2: Felli & (Timbaland)]

[Intro: Akon]
Who'd ever thought that I would see this day
Where I would see my ghetto life fade away
Cause I was lost, and couldn't find a way
And now I look forward to everyday
Welcome to my sunny day

[Verse 1: Akon]
Block don't stop, always stay hot
No matter how the season scorch
I still remember when they took me away
Kept it on lock, then I got popped
Realized I had to stop
Then I took time to explore a better way
Search high and low, so close, yet so far to go
I just know there's a sunny day

[Bridge: Akon]
Who'd ever thought that I would see this day (I would see this day)
Where I would see my ghetto life fade away (fade away)
Cause I was lost, and couldn't find a way (find a way)
And now I look forward to everyday (everyday)

[Hook: Akon]
Welcome to my sunny day, my sunny day
Everyday, better day
Welcome to my sunny day, my sunny day
Everyday, better day
Welcome to my sunny day

[Verse 2: Wyclef Jean]
I was born in the ghetto, raised in the ghetto
Saw my first 9 millimeter in the ghetto
I got my first kiss in the ghetto
Playin' hide go seek with the girls in the ghetto
I wrote my first hit in the ghetto
Yo Mona Lisa, can I get a date on Friday-ay-ay
It's hard for me to let go, life in the ghetto
The night they blast my cousin, whoa
I had to find a way out the ghetto
Picked up the guitar, started singin' in the ghetto
Haters used to hate in the ghetto
Said I would have never made it out the ghetto
I guess that's why my cousin sold the yayo
Even though Annie said the sun come out tomorrow
But the ghetto stay dark
I never thought I'd ever see the Billboard charts

[Bridge]

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Akon]
Been a long day, on my way
To my holy place to pray
Give thanks for every blessing given to me
I know there's more to see, more to me
No more living in misery
Cause this how I vision life to be
Search high and low, so close, yet so far to go
I just know there's a sunny day

[Bridge]

[Hook]

[Intro: Akon & T-Pain]

[Verse 1: Akon]
So many girls outside, and I wanna go take a cruise
And I know you a sex machine and I wanna do summin' new to you
The way you roll them thighs, and your girl doin' it too
If you want we can mix it up, I could set it up, she can get it too
We got plenty of drinks', plenty plenty of water
We got plenty of things comin' from Cal-ifornia
And we all got that bank so believe we can afford this
So stop, playin' and show me what you can do
And don't be actin' like that (like that) I know you wanna ride
Cause my Lamborghini doors go up and down
Now all these gorillas' here, all these women here
Somebody here gon' fuck

That's why I'm tryna holla holla (holla holla) holla holla (holla holla)

I'mma bout to step out my ride, with about twenty bitches
And they all like girls, so they all be kissin'
That's why I'm tryna put you in this, girl
While I'm up in this club, gotta get my groove on
If you wanna roll with a nigga, go with a nigga try to get a move on
And I hope that you like girls, cause I wanna see you kissin'
And now I'm tryna put you in my world
So don't be actin' like that (like that) I know you wanna ride
Cause my Lamborghini doors go up (and down)
(Now all these gorillas' here, all these women here)
Somebody here gon' fuck

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Akon]
Oh, shawty, said you want a player with money

Shawty I'm tryna do summin' to you, yeah

[Verse 4: T-Pain]

[Hook]

[Intro: Akon & Styles P]
Yeah (Crazy)
It's one of the things, man, you gotta experience, you know what I'm talkin' about (Haha)
It's where the going gets rough (Akon)
The tough stay tough (Styles P)
Ah-hah! Upfront, let's go
Konvict, haha
We in too deep to turn back now, D (Sure is)
Watch yourself 'fore you get (Watch it)
Blown away

[Verse 1: Styles P]
You know where I come from
The place where your fade is a mic or a bull or dum-dum
A jail cell, a pine box, and brothers are dumb young
Still bust a gun for the slum that they come from
Cops is the only ones they gon' run from
They puttin' they hood up
But 9 out of 10 of us ain't got good luck
You gon' ride on a man and catch 25
Or get hit and get sent to the other side
You lose both sides of the coin
So me, I play the hood, baby, 9 in the groin
Momma got a little church I could join, but I ain't go yet
Man got a mosque I could join, but I ain't go yet
Cool with the devil on my back, I'm in cold sweats
About to do some dirt in some dirty black old sweats
If you known, you should've shown the way
Most the hood on the path to get blown away

[Chorus: Akon]
'Cause I was raised up to show no fear
Cowardly hearts'll never last long here
If you ain't man up to make shit clear
Guaranteed you'll get blown away
'Cause I done seen the block break down tears
And I done seen the cops break my peers
Tryna hold on a couple more years
Tryin' not to get blown away

[Verse 2: Akon]
See, I ain't never shot nobody, but I'm known for fighting
So when I strike, man, you think you been struck by lightning
Shouldn't have to prove myself by killin' a nigga
Even a child can take a life by pullin' a trigger
Retaliation only takes anger mixed with passion
See your target in the distance and keep on blastin'
They say, "Guns don't kill people, people do"
So when you hit, man, you feel that shit them evils do
Can't see myself gettin' beat down, my eyes swollen
Moms crying, really don't know what happened, my pride's stolen
If I ain't got my heat, then I got a blade
That can get you off me in so many ways

[Chorus: Akon]
'Cause I was raised up to show no fear
Cowardly hearts'll never last long here
If you ain't man up to make shit clear
Guaranteed you'll get blown away
'Cause I done seen the block break down tears
And I done seen the cops break my peers
Tryna hold on a couple more years
Tryin' not to get blown away

[Verse 3: Akon]
I keep my eye out for Jakes, ears to the streets
Other eye out for snakes and these scandalous freaks
If we ain't on good terms, don't bother to speak
Don't smile and try to spark a convo with me
Same thing make you laugh will make you cry
Fuck around and let this quiet nigga here take your life
Hate for it to be you the world sacrifice
So somebody else could travel through the tunnel of life
'Cause I'm that type of guy
I'll be there when you're ridin', but I stay to myself
So if you see me out there with a bear and we fightin'
Nigga, then go help the bear

[Chorus: Akon]
'Cause I was raised up to show no fear
Cowardly hearts'll never last long here
If you ain't man up to make shit clear
Guaranteed you'll get blown away
'Cause I done seen the block break down tears
And I done seen the cops break my peers
Tryna hold on a couple more years
Tryin' not to get blown away

[Verse 1: Akon]
When I see you
I run out of words, to say (ahh)
I wouldn't leave you
Cause you're that type of girl to make me stay (ahh)
I see the guys tryin' to holla
Girl, I don't wanna bother you
Cause you're independent, and you got my attention
Can I be yo' baby father?
Girl, I just wanna show you
That I love what you are doin' now

[Hook: Akon]
I see you in the club, you gettin down, girl
I wanna get with you, yeah
I see you in the club, you showin thugs love

You're so beautiful, so damn beautiful
Said you're so beautiful, so damn beautiful
You're so beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful
You're so beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful

[Verse 2: Colby O'Donis]
Like the clouds you drift me away
Far away, yeah
And like the sun you, brighten my day
You brighten my day, yeah
I never wanna see you cry, cry, cry
And I never wanna tell a lie, lie, lie
Said I never wanna see you cry, cry, cry
And I never wanna tell a lie, lie, lie

[Hook: Akon]
I see you in the club, you gettin down, girl
I wanna get with you, yeah
I see you in the club, you showin thugs love
I wanna get with you
You're so beautiful, so damn beautiful
Said you're so beautiful, so damn beautiful
You're so beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful
You're so beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful
You're so beautiful

[Verse 3: Kardinal Offishall]
Kardinal told you (you) what is it, sky blue or yellow
This fellow ain't that mellow if it ain't about you (you)
Hourglass shape make the place go "oooh"
Waistline makes my soldier salute
I'm a brute (brute) high from ya high heel game
High heels push up ya ass last name
And you livin in the fast lane, eyes like an angel
Goddess, watch my girl and how she hot dress
Spotless, hotness bad to the bone
Make me wanna bone, put me in a triple-X zone (zone)
Lames don't know how to talk to you
So let me walk, with you, hold my hand
I'mma spend them grands but after you undress
Not like a hooker, but more like a princess
Queen, empress, president pull
Any way ya goin' off cause you're beautiful, okay?

[Hook: Akon]
I see you in the club, you gettin down, girl
I wanna get with you, yeah
I see you in the club, you showin thugs love
I wanna get with you
You're so beautiful, so damn beautiful
Said you're so beautiful, so damn beautiful
You're so beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful
You're so beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful
You're so beautiful

[Verse 4: Akon & Colby O'Donis]
Where'd you come from? You're outta this world to me
You're a symbol of what every beautiful woman should be
Ooh wee
I never wanna see you cry, cry, cry (You cry)
And I never wanna tell a lie, lie, lie (Ooh, yeah)
Said I never wanna see you cry, cry, cry (Oh)
And I never wanna tell a lie, lie, lie (A lie)

[Chorus: Akon]
I see you in the club, you gettin down, girl
I wanna get with you, yeah
I see you in the club, you showin thugs love
I wanna get with you
You're so beautiful, so damn beautiful
Said you're so beautiful, so damn beautiful

You're so beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful
You're so beautiful

[Verse 1]
Nobody wanna see us together
Nobody thought we'd last forever
I feel I'm hopin' and prayin'
Things between us gon' get better
Men steady comin' after you
Women steady comin' after me
Seems like everybody wanna go for self
And don't wanna respect boundaries
Tellin' you all those lies
Just to get on yo' side
But I must admit there was a couple secrets I held inside
Just know that I try to always apologize
But I'ma have you first, always in my heart to keep you satisfied

[Chorus]
Nobody wanna see us together, but it don't matter, no
('Cause I got you, babe)
Nobody wanna see us together, but it don't matter, no

Nobody wanna see us together, but it don't matter, no
('Cause I got you, babe)

[Verse 2]
Got every right to wanna leave
Got every right to wanna go
Got every right to hit the road
And never talk to me no mo'
You don't even have to call
Even check for me at all
'Cause the way I've been actin' lately has been off the wall
Especially towards you, puttin' girls before you
And they watchin' everything I been doin' just to hurt you
Most of it just ain't true and they won't show you
How much of a queen you are to me and why I love you, baby

[Chorus]
Nobody wanna see us together, but it don't matter, no
('Cause I got you, babe)
Nobody wanna see us together, but it don't matter, no
('Cause I got you, babe)
'Cause we gon' fight, oh, yes, we gon' fight (We gon' fight)
Believe we gon' fight (We gon' fight)
Fight for our right to love, yeah (Right to love, yeah)

Konvict, Konvict – ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay
Go gangsta – ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay
Go gangsta, keep boppin' (Block Boy up!)
Rock with me, let's get this bitch poppin' (Upfront!)
Go gangsta, keep boppin' (Geah!)
Like back when a nigga was clockin'

[Verse 1]
See nowadays it seems like e'rybody wanna be killas
Gorillas gettin' high off their weed and liquor
You die quicker, paramedics drive back slow to the hospital
You get pronounced dead at 4 to the hospital
Stop frontin' when you know you won't pull nothin'
First nigga to retreat when the tools bustin'
Playin' with death is bad for your health
All your homeboys gone, you the last one left
Now, they hearts beatin' but these niggas be scared
The real ones are all locked up or dead
Nowadays you can't find a good connect
But if you do, you might be the feds, so—

[Hook]
I don't know you, you don't know me
You don't know the history I got on these streets
Only if you see what my eyes have seen
Then you'll understand why I'm surrounded by G's
If you owe me or we got beef
I recommend you reach for your heat and don't freeze
Pause for a minute, guaranteed you gon' bleed
‘Cause that's how we was raised growin' up in these streets

[Interlude]
Go gangsta, keep boppin'
Rock with me, let's get this bitch poppin'
Go gangsta, keep boppin'
Like back when a nigga was clockin'

[Verse 2]
See it's hard to be good but easy to do evil
And I ain't really into meetin' with new people
Just put the money in the bag and I'll leave you
The weed, coke, Lambo or Evisu
You make a hundred dollars, to the streets you made a G
When you coppin' O's, they swearin' you move ki's
Feds gettin' close and the rats seein' cheese
And they tryna find them birds, not the ones that sleep in trees
We got that bird, we got that blue
You want short skirts? We got that too
Whatever you need, my nigga, show me the cheese
And baby, you can believe that we can make that brew

[Hook]
I don't know you, you don't know me
You don't know the history I got on these streets
Only if you see what my eyes have seen
Then you'll understand why I'm surrounded by G's
If you owe me or we got beef
I recommend you reach for your heat and don't freeze
Pause for a minute, guaranteed you gon' bleed
‘Cause that's how we was raised growin' up in these streets

[Interlude]
Go gangsta, keep boppin'
Rock with me, let's get this bitch poppin'
Go gangsta, keep boppin'
Like back when a nigga was clockin'

[Bridge]
Streets been watchin' and they don't blink
Sidewalk got ears, the pavement don't sleep
The fittest will survive, the weak just don't eat
E'rybody in between just gettin' a rap sheet
The streets been watchin' and they don't blink
Sidewalk got ears, the pavement don't sleep
The fittest will survive, the weak just don't eat
E'rybody in between just gettin' a rap sheet

[Hook]
I don't know you, you don't know me
You don't know the history I got on these streets

I recommend you reach for your heat and don't freeze
Pause for a minute, guaranteed you gon' bleed
‘Cause that's how we was raised growin' up in these streets

[Interlude]
Go gangsta, keep boppin'
Rock with me, let's get this bitch poppin'
Go gangsta, keep boppin'
Like back when a nigga was clockin'
Go gangsta, keep boppin'
Rock with me, let's get this bitch poppin'
Go gangsta, keep boppin'
Like back when a nigga was clockin'

[Outro]
See it's hard to be good but easy to do evil
And I ain't really into meetin' with new people
See it's hard to be good but easy to do evil
And I ain't really into meetin' with new people
See it's hard to be good but easy to do evil
And I ain't really into meetin' with new people
See it's hard to be good…

[Intro]
I can't wait
I can't wait

[Verse 1: Akon]
I think of you
When the morning comes and the night time goes away (all day)
Don't you ever think that we won't be okay (no way)
There is nothin' stoppin' me from lovin' you
Touchin' and rubbin' and kissin' and huggin' you
What's this feelin' taking over, me?
Baby that's love and it ain't no stoppin' it
I don't know as far as the eyes can see
Pick up the pace and it ain't no droppin' it
Always forever I'll be by your side
You're my Bonnie, I'm your Clyde
That's the way that it's gonna be
I'm in love with you and you in love with me

[Hook: Akon]
(I can't wait) Sit down and talk for a minute
Go outside and take a walk for a minute (for a minute)
Just you, and me
(I can't wait) Sit down and talk for a minute
Go outside and take a walk for a minute (for a minute)
Just you, and me
(I can't wait)

[Verse 2: Akon & T-Pain]
I can't believe
That someone like you will love me endlessly (forever)
If this goes our way my love will always be (eternally)
You have set my mind, my love, my heart so free
Together forever however just you and me
What's this feelin' taking over me
Baby that's love and it ain't no stoppin' it
I don't know as far as the eyes can see
Pick up the pace and it ain't no droppin' it
Always forever I'll be by your side
You're my Bonnie, I'm your Clyde
Cause that's the way that it's gonna be
I'm in love with you and you're in love with me

[Hook: Akon]
(I can't wait) Sit down and talk for a minute
Go outside and take a walk for a minute (for a minute)
Just you, and me
(I can't wait) Sit down and talk for a minute
Go outside and take a walk for a minute (for a minute)
Just you, and me
(I can't wait)

[Bridge: Akon]
To have you right next to me here by my side (I can't wait)
To kiss and caress you girl while I'm holdin' you tight (I can't wait)
Can't imagine life without you, it just ain't right (I can't wait)
I got a whole lot of lovin', and you gon' get it tonight

[Hook: Akon]
(I can't wait) Sit down and talk for a minute
Go outside and take a walk for a minute (for a minute)
Just you, and me
(I can't wait) Sit down and talk for a minute
Go outside and take a walk for a minute (for a minute)
Just you, and me
(I can't wait)

[Outro]
{"I can't wait."}
{"I can't wait."}
{"I can't wait."}

[Intro]
I can see it, it's funny, man
‘Cause this life is not going nowhere
And you gon' see it
Wherever there's struggle, knahmean?
{"Once in a while I could look at you"}
I see my pain in yo' eyes, man
So I know you feeling me
{"And see the twinkle in your eyes"}
It's that twinkle, man
That sign of struggle, I've seen it in me

[Verse 1]
‘Cause everyday I can't help but see it
That people ain't satisfied
And you're hating your 9 to 5
And e'rybody wanna live another life
But ain't no length you go or mountain you climb
Not to better your days
But all that would do is leave room for people to say
"I guess you're living better now
Share a little of that cheddar now"
‘Cause I remember days back when
A brother was hustling and robbing too
I done tossed the Beretta now
On a whole another level now
Still I can't enjoy my fame
Unless my people doing the same and get money too

[Hook]
{"Once in a while I could look at you"}
Ohh, once in a while
{"And see the twinkle in your eyes"}
And I can see that you don't ever wanna struggle no more
Struggle no more
{"Once in a while I could look at you"}
Ooh yeah
{"And see the twinkle in your eyes"}
And I can see that you don't ever wanna cry no more

[Verse 2]
‘Cause every time you ask me, I'm grindin'
It shouldn't have to be that way
You shouldn't have to pay my way
I shouldn't have to want for a brighter day
Got a little little problem on the way
Bounty hunters checking state to state
Child support lady on your case
Not to mention tickets you ain't never paid
"Oh what must I do?" is what you'll be asking
God, please hold it down for me
Don't let Satan get ahold of me
I'm tryin' to tell you, it can happen to me too
But it happened a lot worse to my brother
Muhammad, I thank God he recovered, yeah

[Hook] w/ variations + ad libs

{"Once in a while I could look at you"}

[Bridge]
‘Cause I see your pain now (ooh yeah)
‘Cause I see your pain now (ooh yeah)
And I can feel you strain now
And I can see you cryin'
And inside you're dyin'
You're no longer the same now (‘cause you got to)
But you gotta maintain now

[Hook] – 2X w/ variations + ad libs

[Outro]
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah

[Akon]
{*cell door slams*} Konvict Konvict
Hey-ey-ey, hey-ey-ey
Upfront.. Konvict
Hey-ey-ey, hey-ey-ey, ooh yeah

[Hook: Akon]
I gotta find a way to get outta here
I gotta find a way to get outta here
This ain't the way that I wanna live, no
This ain't the way, somethin gotta give
In a rush, rush - gotta keep on movin
I'm in a rush, rush - gotta keep on movin
I'm in a rush, rush - gotta keep on movin, yeah
I'm in a rush, rush - gotta keep on movin, yeah

[Akon]
Cause I find myself on the fast track side of life, drivin me crazy
In the hood daylight to night and you can find me grindin daily
Ay, and it ain't gon' change
As long as we gettin money keep the same mindframe
Same hood, better pop that thang
Same big whip on the block same fly dame
With my lady just rollin
With the sunshine and the wind blowin
Gotta keep my mind cleared from all this crime
Hopefully one day learn from it, but

[Hook]

[Kardinal Offishall]
Girl.. it's like I can't see the sun
Six in the mornin I'm still on the run
Day to the night rushin around town
Tryin to get this done 'fore the case come down
Gotta feed my fate, face to face
With no place to race except straight
I can feel them close on my heels
Gotta keep goin so I'm takin the wheel
Tryin to outrun my fears, outrun my peers
Outrun the killers and escape them years
Yet again, so I take out my pen and say
"If you find this letter please pray for me" - GEAH!

[Hook]

[Akon]
Now can you picture me growin up on the bad side of town
Where them outlaws are hangin out, all them women get down
Where cash money's the only answer to problems around
And if ya missin your people most likely they underground
This cruel world, this cruel world
Gotta leave this town forever, break away and just start o'er, ohhh

[Hook]

[Verse 1]
A moment ago it seemed, it was yesterday
You were here with me
And everything seems to be the same
What am I supposed to do
With all these empty rooms?
Sit here in solitude
With the smell of your perfume

[Hook]
You never took the time to know me
You never took the time to understand
You never took the time to know me, yeah
‘Cause loving you is all I ever had
Said loving you is all I ever had

[Verse 2]
This wasn't what I wanted to be
A man in misery
Girl, I look back a thousand times
And can't believe that you left me
(Why you leave me, baby?)
Why can't you understand my pain?
How can I explain?
Girl, I don't know what I'm doing wrong
I can't believe that your love is gone

[Hook]
‘Cause you never took the time to know me
(Said you never took the time to know me)
You never took the time to understand (ohhhhh yeah)
Said you never took the time to know me
(Said you never took the time to know me)
See, loving you is all I ever had (had, I had)
Baby, loving you is all I ever had

[Instrumental]

[Over hook]
Ooh yeah, you're all I need
You're all I see
And I wish that we could do it again

[Hook/Outro]
‘Cause you never took the time to know me
(Baby, you never took the time to know me)
You never took the time to understand
(Ohh-ohh-ohh, ohhh, yeah)
Said you never took the time to know me, yeah (ohhh)
Because of you, now I'm just a lonely man (ohh)
Because of you, now I'm just a lonely man

[Verse 1]
I'm sittin' on my porch, watching the law
As they ride past in they patrol cars
So tell me why I feel like the enemy
They're supposed to be here protectin' me
I might have went too far
Helping to contribute to making they job hard
Serving fiends like these people ain't no enemy
I can't believe I'm out here killing my community
If you knew how far I came (far I came)
From where I am and where I used to be (where I used to be)
Don't want it, you can tell by the look at me
This gangsta life ain't no longer in me

[Hook]
And I'm tired of the runnin', tired of the runnin'
Tired of the runnin', runnin' from the law
Baby, you gotta believe me
Said I'm tired of the runnin', tired of the runnin'
Tired of the runnin', runnin' from the law
Baby, you gotta believe me

[Verse 2]
I know there's things I could've changed, girl
I know there's things I could've done a lot better
Instead I'm in the streets tryin' to make that cheddar
Thinking in my mind that you gon' be there forever
I know I could've let it all go (let it all go)
But I was thinking it would make life better
Instead I'm sittin' in this cell, writing this letter
Thought I wouldn't get caught ‘cause I was way too clever
I learned there's no one to catch you when you're fallin'
And they'll be no one to hear you when you're callin'
Do you know what it's like to wake up in the mornin'
While you're starvin' and you're hearing bugs crawlin'?
Reminiscing on them days you was walkin'
With pretty women on your arm while you're flossin'
Thankful that I didn't end up in a coffin
Something you see too often

[Hook – x2]
And I'm tired of the runnin', tired of the runnin'
Tired of the runnin', runnin' from the law
Baby, you gotta believe me
Said I'm tired of the runnin', tired of the runnin'
Tired of the runnin', runnin' from the law
Baby, you gotta believe me

I see you winding and grinding up on that pole
I know you see me looking at you and you already know
I wanna fuck you (Fuck you), you already know
I wanna fuck you (Fuck you), you already know, girl

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
Money in the air as mo' fell, grab you by your coat tail
Take you to the motel, ho sale, don't tell, won't tell
Baby said I don't talk, Dogg, but she told on me, oh well
Take a picture with me, what the flick gon' do?
Baby, stick to me, and I'mma stick on you
If you pick me then I'mma pick on you
D-O-double G and I'm here to put this dick on you
I'm stuck on pussy and yours is right
Rip ridinin' them poles and them doors is tight
And I'mma get me a shot for the end of the night
‘Cause pussy is pussy and, baby, your pussy for life

I wanna fuck you (Fuck you), you already know, girl

[Verse 2: Akon]
Shorty, I can see, you ain't lonely
Handful of niggas and they all got cheese
So you lookin' at me now, what its gonna be?
Just another tease far as I can see
Trying to get you up out this club
If it means spending a couple dubs
Throwing bout 30 stacks in the back
Make it rain like that ‘cause I'm far from a scrub
And you know my pedigree
Ex-dealer use to move 'phetamines
Girl I spend money like it don't mean nothin'
And besides, I got a thing for you

[Chorus: Akon]
I see you winding and grinding up on that pole
I know you see me looking at you and you already know
I wanna fuck you (Fuck you), you already know
I wanna fuck you (Fuck you), you already know, girl

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
Mobbin' through the club in low pressin'
I'm sittin' in the back in the smoking section (Just smoking, just smoking)
Bird's eye, I got a clear view
You can't see me, but I can see you (Baby, I see you, see you)
It's cool, we jet, the mood is set, your pussy is wet
You rubbin' your back and touchin' your neck (Yeah, yeah)
Your body is movin', ya humpin' and jumpin'
Your titties is bouncin' (Yeah)
You smilin' and grinnin' and lookin' at me

[Verse 4: Akon]
Girl, and while your looking at me
I'm ready to hit the Caddy right up on the patio
Move the patty to the Caddy
Baby, you got a fatty, the type I like to marry
Wanting to just give you everything
And that's kind of scary
‘Cause I'm loving the way you shake your ass (Ass)
Bouncing, got me tipping my glass (Glass)
Normally don't get caught up too fast
But I got a thing for you

[Chorus: Akon]
I see you winding and grinding up on that pole
I know you see me looking at you and you already know
I wanna fuck you (Fuck you), you already know
I wanna fuck you (Fuck you), you already know, girl
I see you winding and grinding up on that pole
I know you see me looking at you and you already know
I wanna fuck you (Fuck you), you already know
I wanna fuck you (Fuck you), you already know, girl (Girl, girl)

[Chorus]
Hey ladies, drop it down

Shake ya body like a belly dancer
Hey ladies, drop it down
Just wanna see you touch the ground
Don't be shy girl, go Bananza
Shake ya body like a belly dancer

[Verse 1]
Yo, excuse me, beg your pardon, girl
Do you have any idea what you starting, girl?
You got me tingiling, come to me mingiling
Steppin off lookin' bootylicious and jingiling
When you walk, I see you baby girl
When you talk, I believe it baby girl
I like that, thick-petite n' pretty
Little touch is a ditty
Love to work the kitty like "purrrr"
She loves to stir it up (Purrr)
I can hear her purring up
Cause she's the type that'll get arousy of
Get you excited and call her boyfriend up (Ohh)
What's the man without the plan B
We can meet up at the hutter house for the TV
So stand by like a butty pass
While I watch this beautiful thing shake that ass

[Chorus]
Hey ladies, drop it down
Just wanna see you touch the ground
Don't be shy girl, go Bananza
Shake ya body like a belly dancer
Hey ladies, drop it down
Just wanna see you touch the ground

Shake ya body like a belly dancer

[Verse 2]
Girl, I must say you the flyest thang in here
So hot we gon' need some rain in here
Type to make ex-gangstas bang in here
Girl, you could do anything you want in here
Clown if you want to, frown if you want to
You ain't even gotta drop down if you want to
'Cause I'd rather see you shake it standin'
Either way you do it girl, you look outstandin' (Uhhuuuhh)
And now you got me spending (Uhhuuhhh)
The way you got that body bendin' (Uhhhuhh)
An ass like that girl, you gotta be kickin'
And we goin' to church next day repentant
Lap dancing for my FA crew
Slide it ova to Bu cause he wants some too
Up in the VIP with no fee
Blessing you with the G even tho we gettin' it free, so

[Chorus]
Hey ladies, drop it down
Just wanna see you touch the ground
Don't be shy girl, go Bananza
Shake ya body like a belly dancer
Hey ladies, drop it down

Don't be shy girl, go Bananza
Shake ya body like a belly dancer

[Bridge]
Girl shake ya body body

Whatever you do, don't break your body body
After the party party
Grab a hottie hottie
In the back seat of your Maserati-rati
Jiggle jiggle it to the left (Ah ah ah)
Jiggle jiggle it to the right (Ah ah ah)
Jiggle it to the front, then jiggle it to the back
And jiggle jiggle it all all night (Ah ah ah)

[Chorus]

Konvict Music {*echoes*}
Ohhhh

[Hook: Akon]
(Yeahhhhhhhhh) I realize it ain't the life for me
Always gettin into trouble cause (I'm so fly)
I'm on a whole 'nother level
Left the block and now I'm smilin countin money like
(Yeahhhhhhhhh) Realize it ain't the life for me
Gotta find another hustle cause (I'm so fly)
I'm livin life a lot better - a lot better
Still keep a Glock in case the jealous wanna hate tonight

[Akon]
Another day up in the hood can't believe these cats still bangin
Look at the years we wasted on the corner block still slangin
No matter how much we try to make peace gunshots still ringin
Cause to be a hood legend, you die first then become famous
Cause I done seen this type of thang before
Just hangin out up by the corner store
Stick-up kids with them guns galore
Layin e'rybody down stretched on the floor
I thought about it man I'm way too fly
To have a fella robbin me outside
That's why I keep that thang by my side
And count every blessin while I'm screamin out

[Hook]

[Akon]
I hate to say it but the people that's surroundin me are way too shady
The only people I could trust that's my family and my lady
All my dawgs got guns ready for action, they won't betray me
Ain't the type to run or to hold my tongue when it gets crazy
See I been through this type of thang before
Even had trouble with the law
On the couch when they smashed my door
With a warrant found the cash stashed under the floor
I never could understand the cause
I was the one that pulled the shortest straw
I couldn't live this type of life no more
So I had a part of me screamin out

[Hook]

[Blewz]
I'm in blue with them BF frames
Walkin on lean while my chain hangs
Drivin somethin, pronounced mad strange
Yeah I'm mad cool cause I been through flames
Walk with a limp cause I been through dames
Now she's a ho, cause she been through gangs
Beef with cats for a small chump change
I'm rich now, that's more chump change
(Streets is mine nigga!) The cops know slang
Man get the picture, before you buy the frame
Call me heartthrob, cause I'm so vain/vein
Couldn't come close if you sat in my Range
My scars can prove it, I'm passion and pain
Singin

[Hook]
(Don't let it get to you, no baby)
Girl I know you're fed up but things gonna get a lot better
(Don't let it get to you, no baby)
Don't wanna see you give up, whatever you do, don't let up

Girl I know that things are hard now
And you're feeling that you're all alone
Mom & dad's no long 'round now
Cause now you're grown with kids of your own
Baby dad is nowhere to be found
While you play the role of mom & papi
(Raising them all by yourself)
Always home and can't go out now
Can't remember the last time that you were happy
Whatever you do..

(Don't let it get to you, no baby)
Girl I know you're fed up but things gonna get a lot better
(Don't let it get to you, no baby)
Don't wanna see you give up, whatever you do, don't let up
Every man that you meet on the streets
You're looking at him like he's an enemy
(Just give us one more chance)
Girl I know that you can't hurt no more
You've been damaged, can't trust nobody
And I know that you can just move on
If you let your past go with the wind
(And smile more often)
Then you will find that guy that you always wanted
From friend to husband
So girl just know that..

(Don't let it get to you, no baby)
Girl I know you're fed up but things gonna get a lot better
(Don't let it get to you, no baby)
Don't wanna see you give up, whatever you do, don't let up

No matter how bad things get
Girl don't let it get to you
I know you're trying to make ends meet
So girl don't let it get to you
You only got one life to live
So don't let it get to you
So go on and make the best of it
Just don't let it get to you
(Don't let it get to you, no baby)
Girl I know you're fed up but things gonna get a lot better
(Don't let it get to you, no baby)
Don't wanna see you give up, whatever you do, don't let up

[Refrain]
I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't cause I came too far

[Verse 1]
I trying to know what's going on
Echoes on my cellular phone
I know this couple I don't missing
Could it be the feds still listening
See I gat to beat those kisses
Ain't time for the miscelleneous
And they proceed to keep on watching
Cause i've seen them lately
Interrogated my mum
Locked up half of my crew
But I can guarante one thing that t won't let you

[Hook]
I won't let you lock me down
I won't let you push me round
I won't let you stop me now
I won't cause I came too far
I won't let you rule my day
I won't let you stop my pay
I won't no not today
I won't cause I came too far

[Verse 2]
Devil's always watchin' me (watching me)
Evil's always stalkin me (stopping me)
God has been protecting me (protecting me)
And that's how I gat this far
Cause when you ook at me you'll see an angel
Can't believe i've been through half the things that I went through
Cause everyday I see a face (my face)
This come true by the human race (my race)
Please don't you judge me unless you know me
Cause I won't let you

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Came too far to turn back now (too far) 2ce
Ain't nobody goin' stop me (can stop me) 2ce
Came too far to turn back now (too far) 2ce
Ain't nobody goin' stop me (can stop me) 2ce

[Intro]
Ghetto, ghetto
Ghetto, ghetto livin'

[Verse 1]
These streets remind me of quicksand
When you're on it, you'll keep goin' down
And there's no one to hold on to
And there's no one to pull you out
You keep on fallin', no one can hear you callin'
So you end up self-destructin'
On the corner with the toolie on the waist line
Just got up out the thing doin' state time
Teeth marks on my back from the K-9
Dark memories of when there was no sunshine
‘Cause they said that I wouldn't make it
I remember like yesterday
Holdin' on to what God gave me

[Hook]
‘Cause that's the life
When you're livin' in the (ghetto)
And eatin' in the (ghetto)
Oh, sleepin' in the (ghetto)
Ghetto, that's the life
When you're livin' in the (ghetto)
And eatin' in the (ghetto)
Oh, sleepin' in the (ghetto, ghetto)

[Verse 2]
No need to cherish luxuries
‘Cause everything come and go
Even the life that you have is borrowed
‘Cause you're not promised tomorrow
So live your life as if every day is gon' be your last
Once you've moved forward
You can't go back just to remove your past
‘Cause you gotta be willin' to pray
Yes, there gotta be, there gotta be a better way
Yes, you gotta be willin' to pray
‘Cause there gotta be, there gotta be a better day
Whoever said that the struggle would stop today?
A lot a niggas dead or locked away
Teenage women growin' up with AIDS

[Hook]
‘Cause that's the life
When you're livin' in the (ghetto)
Oh, eatin' in the (ghetto)
Oh, sleepin' in the (ghetto)
Ghetto, that's the life
When you're livin' in the (ghetto)
Oh, eatin' in the (ghetto)
Oh, sleepin' in the (ghetto, ghetto)

[Bridge]
Gun shots every night in the (ghetto)
Crooked cops on sight in the (ghetto)
Everyday is a fight in the (ghetto)
Oh oh oh oh oh (ghetto livin')
Got kids to feed in the (ghetto)
Sellin' coke and weed in the (ghetto)
Everyday somebody bleed in the (ghetto)
Oh oh oh oh oh (ghetto livin')

[Hook]
‘Cause that's the life
When you're livin' in the (ghetto)
Oh, eatin' in the (ghetto)
Oh, sleepin' in the (ghetto)
Ghetto, that's the life
When you're livin' in the (ghetto)

Oh, sleepin' in the (ghetto, ghetto)

[Intro]
Okay (UpFront)
Akon, stay out of trouble now son
Akon, stay out of trouble now son

[Verse 1]
Let me tell you what hurts the most
I'm a convicted felon and I can't work
No matter where I go I try to get paid
They never give me the job 'cause they are afraid that
I'ma stick 'em up oh yeah stick it
Rob the manager and everybody in it
That's the everyday life of a convict tryin' to make it
While they sayin' to me

[Chorus]
The judge said don't trouble nobody
Probation say don't trouble nobody
Stay out of trouble, don't trouble nobody
And I'ma try not to trouble nobody
The judge said don't trouble nobody
Probation say don't trouble nobody
Stay out of trouble, don't trouble nobody
And I'ma try not to trouble nobody

[Verse 2]
Me and my niggas on the block all day clockin' dimes lookin' out for police
'Cause this the type of shit that we go through
Up in the ghetto just to make some cheese
Street life got me gettin' locked up about 5, 6 times a week
And then I make bond, take it from the profit of the weed
All this just to feed my seeds, yeah
I got a stop this livin'
I witness one too many killings
I done seen the hardest niggas straight dropped to the ground and was never ever found, so

[Chorus]
The judge said don't trouble nobody
Probation say don't trouble nobody
Stay out of trouble, don't trouble nobody
And I'ma try not to trouble nobody
The judge said don't trouble nobody
Probation say don't trouble nobody
Stay out of trouble, don't trouble nobody
And I'ma try not to trouble nobody

[Verse 3]
I'm tryin' to stay away from trouble every day
But it's hard when the things you need
Picture lookin' at your babies in the face
When they hungry and they need to eat
I'm trying not to do wrong
But they won't let me do right
Even though I done changed my life
Criminal record's what they judging me by, that's why

[Chorus]
The judge said don't trouble nobody
Probation say don't trouble nobody
Stay out of trouble, don't trouble nobody
And I'ma try not to trouble nobody
Momma said don't trouble nobody
Papa said don't trouble nobody
Stay out of trouble don't trouble nobody
And I'ma try not to trouble nobody (So I won't trouble nobody)
The judge said don't trouble nobody (Can't trouble nobody)
Probation say don't trouble nobody (Won't trouble nobody)
Stay outta trouble don't trouble nobody (Won't trouble nobody)
And I'ma try not to trouble nobody (So I won't trouble nobody)
Momma said don't trouble nobody (Can't trouble nobody)
Papa said don't trouble nobody (Won't trouble nobody)
Stay out of trouble don't trouble nobody (Won't trouble nobody)
And I'ma try not to trouble nobody (Yeah)

[Verse 1: Styles P]
Locked up, they won't let me out
And I had a long day in court, shit stress me out
Won't give me a bail, they can't get me out
Now I'm heading to the County, gotta do a bid here
I used to living luxurious, I don't wanna live here
The walls is gray, the clothes is orange
The phones is broke, the food is garbage
Lotta niggas is living with these circumstances
S.P.'s the same, I still merk your mans-es
Drug money to rap money, work advances
Niggas ran and told, I should've merked to Kansas
Got popped for a murder attempt
Knock me on D-Block when I was burnin' the hemp
Had a brick in the stash
Hope they don't take it to a further extent
Locked up and they won't let me out
When I hit my cellblock, niggas know the dread be out

[Verse 2: Akon]
I'm steady tryin' to find a motive
Why do what I do?
The freedom ain't getting no closer
No matter how far I go
My car is stolen, no registration
The cops patrollin'
And now they done stopped me
And I get locked up

[Hook: Akon]
They won't let me out
They won't let me out
I'm locked up; they won't let me out
No, they won't let me out
I'm locked up, they won't let me out
They won't let me out
I'm locked up, they won't let me out
No, they won't let me out

[Verse 3: Akon]
Heading up town to re-up
Back with a couple ki's
The corner block's on fire
Undercovers dressed as fiends
Making so much money
Product's moving fast
Put away the stash
As I sold the last bag
Fucked around and got locked up

[Hook: Akon]
They won't let me out
They won't let me out
My nigga I'm locked up; they won't let me out
No, they won't let me out
I'm locked up, they won't let me out
They won't let me out
I'm locked up, they won't let me out
No, they won't let me out

[Verse 4: Styles P]
Now that I'm locked up I rep two sets so
I'ma Ryde or Die and stay D-Blocked up
Two toothbrushes up, whoever want it with P
When I walk by, nigga, get up
‘Cause I'm locked up, they can't get me out
I smoke a stick of haze when they stress me out
Go and hit the bar when the wrecks be out
Can't wait for the day when they let me out

[Verse 5: Akon]
‘Cause visitation no longer comes by
It seems like they forgot about me
Commissary is getting empty
My cellmates getting food without me
I can't wait to get out
And move forward with my life
Got a family that loves me
And wants me to do right
But instead I'm here locked up

[Hook: Akon]
They won't let me out
They won't let me out
Oh! I'm locked up; they won't let me out
No, they won't let me out
My nigga I'm locked up, they won't let me out
They won't let me out
I'm locked up, they won't let me out
No, they won't let me out

[Outro over hook]
‘Cause I'm locked up
Where's my lawyer?
Get me out of here
Baby, I'm locked up
Where's my niggas on the block?
Tell them I'm locked up
I'm locked up
Can you please accept my phone call?
Oooh oooh Don't make me call the police
Oooh oooh It's a crime the way you bend them knees
From the table to the floor, spin it up and do it slow
Give it up to all my niggas on the corners spending dough like
Game nothing but money to me
So sweet but you ain't nothing but hunnies to me
Shorty get you sexy dere sipping on the cavasier
Stylin up in the VIP, plannin to roll out with me

Rather not run when the cops are stopping me
Pulled over on the road they watching me
As they walk passed all the chicks are jockin me
Ferrari truck on the side of the road
Raspberry paint gloss sitting on 24's
Give me a warning ticket, letting me go

Like right around the corner cause its all in my brain
A nice crib on the hill of Hollywood but the ghetto mind stayin
Ain't a damn thing changed
It's funny how people switch when they get rich
Spend it all on chicks
Hundred-thousand dollar car for what
These bitches
Ten million dollar crib for what
These bitches
Five thousand dollar suits for what
These bitches
Should of known but they only out for your riches
Some freaks need to be dealt with
Spread 'em and smack 'em backwards
With a stick

[Interlude]
Akon (akon) 
C'mon (c'mon)

[Verse 1]
This is the ultimate journey of your life 
Where the weak die and the strong survive 
Prepare to suffer 40 days and 40 nights 
Strap on your boots because you got a long hike 

[Chorus]
Just another journey, another journey into time
(C'mon now)
Just another journey, who ever thought I'd cross this line
Ohohohohoh

[Verse 2]
Walking through the dirty streets of Jersey (Jersey) 
A dollar to my name searchin for that key 
I'm tryin not to reincorinate my past 
I'm tired from the game, took another path 
Destination 95 Dirty South 
Where the devil tried to realter my route 
Creator took me by the hand and led the way-ay 
To make the story short thats why I'm here today 

[Chorus]
Just another journey, another journey into time
(Another journey into time)
Just another journey, who ever thought I'd cross this line
(Cross this line) Ohohohohoh

[Verse 3]
What about that day you said I wouldn't amount to shit
And about that day you kicked me out onto the bricks 
What about that time you said I wouldn't make a dime 
And about that time you said I couldn't make you mine 
Destination to the bank overseas 
Where Akons treated like royalty 
Cause there's so much in this world i have to see-e 
The wagon's rolling so jump in a follow me-e 

[Breakdown]
Born and raised in Africa trying to make a scene 
(Trying to make a scene) 
The best way to get to you is by this music thing 
And you might believe 

[Interlude]
Akon (Akon) 
C'mon (c'mon)

[Bridge]
Lets take it to the streets
(I traveled through the ghettos of America)
Lets take it to the streets
(I traveled through the ghettos of Africa)
Lets take it to the streets
(I traveled through the ghettos of Asia)
Lets take it to the streets
(I traveled through the ghettos all over)

[Chorus]
Just another journey, another journey into time
(Another journey into time)
Just another journey, who ever thought I'd cross this line
(Cross this line) Ohohohohoh
(In my journey yea) yea, yea
The unexpected
Multi-dimensional
Unexpected sound of the Refugee All-Stars

The sweetest thing I've ever known
Was like the kiss on the collarbone
The soft caress of happiness
The way you walk, your style of dress
I wish I didn't get so weak
Oooh, baby, just to hear you speak
Makes me argue just to see
How much you're in love with me

[Hook]
See like the queen upon her throne
It was the sweet, sweet, sweetest thing I've known
It was the sweet, sweet, sweetest thing I've known

I get mad when you walk away (don't walk away)
So I tell you leave, when I mean stay
Warm as the sun dipped in black
Fingertips on the small of my back
More valuable than all I own
Like your precious, precious, precious, precious, precious, baby, dark skin tone

[Hook]

It was the...Ah
I tried to explain
Ah...but baby, it's in vain

Speaking on my mother's phone
The touching makes me think I'm grown, (you ain't grown)
Sweet prince of the ghetto
Your kisses taste like armaretto
Intoxicating, oh, so intoxicating
How sad, how sad that all things come to an end
But then again, I'm, I'm not alone

[Hook]
*News coverage at the beginning*

[Chorus 1]

[All]
We don't need no more trouble
We don't need no more trouble

[Verse 1]

What we need is love (love)
To guide and protect us all (all)
If you hope good down from above (love)
Help the weak if you are strong now (strong)

[Chorus 2]

[Bob]
We don't need no trouble
What we need is love

[Chorus 1]

[All]

[Verse 2]

[Erykah]
Weeping for the living
Weeping for the dead
Weep for one another
Weep for happiness
Weeping for the struggle
Weeping for the pain
Weeping for the children
We must take the blame

[Bob]
Seek happiness
(It's sad enough without your foes)
Come on, you all and speak of love
(It's sad enough without your foes)
We don't need no trouble
What we need is love now

[Chorus 1]

[All]

[Verse 3]

[Erykah]
Now end the war which you just begun
It's sad enough without your foes
I thought I told you not to mess with me
Don't want no trouble but trouble found me
But Marley saying speak of love not war
But we be trying but then eh we don't

[Chorus 2]

[x2]

[Bob]

[Chorus 1]

[All]
Yee-haw!
Oh, shut up, you pig fucker
You're so ugly
You're like a zebra, Adam
You're so ugly
You're a ponyass motherfucker
Why don't you get a haircut, farm boy?

Fuck the chickens, I don't like milk
Fuck the chickens, I don't like milk
Barnyard stoats raid the pen
If you don't shoot 'em, they'll do it again
Fuck the chickens, I don't like milk
Fuck the chickens, I don't like milk
Farmer Joe fucks a cow
He likes it so much, he sucks a sow

Now you
Everyday I'm going to school
I wish I could be satisfied
But it's hogwash
Fuck the chickens, I don't like milk
Now fuck the chickens, I don't like milk
Barnyard Bob mows the field
Sees how much wheat will yield
Fuck the chickens, I don't like milk
Now fuck the chickens, I don't like milk
Barnyard stoats raid the pen
If you don't shoot 'em, they'll do it again
And everyday I'm going to school
I wish that I could find gratitude
But it's hogwash

Fuck the chickens, I don't like milk
Now fuck the chickens, I don't like milk
Barnyard stoats raid the pen
If you don't shoot 'em, they'll do it again
Fuck the chickens, I don't like milk
Now fuck the chickens, I don't like milk
Fuck the chickens, I don't like milk
Now fuck the chickens, I don't like milk

Now me
Everyday I'm riding to school
I'm learning a bunch of brainwash
It's hogwash
Egg raid on Mojo

We began, to attack
The eggs did crack on Mojo's back

Friday night intimacy
Going out the family boar
Another dead through this door, listen
Yo yo from the CIA, they're going
Yo yo what an artist said, they're going

Yo yo yo!
Yo yo yo!
Brad's off twisting a win
And I can't afford to pay the feds
And now I'm never late on Friday night
By a transit cop looking to fight, he said
Yo yo from the CIA, and I'm
Yo yo what an artist said, they're going

Yo yo yo!
Yo yo yo!

Don't hit fudging I'm
Fucking stupid roll up fight
Now I'd rather jump than pay
But they're gonna book me anyway
I can't think straight

Take a look, look at me
What you get is what you see
Ride a bike, drive a car
Vegan Pie, cut a fart
On the bus, on the train
Tami D, on the brain
Can't explain, like The Who
Now it's time to do the do
I can't think straight

On my couch with a pen
Where's the phone, again, again
Can't control rhythm, rhyme
Naked beats on the mind

I am yes, you are no
I am yes, you are no
You are no, I am yes
I can't think straight
Good Evening, ladies
My name is Roy Cormier
Uh, I like it smooth, generally
I mean, a lot of fellas, they like it raw
Personally, I prefer smooth, um, you know
I like the coconut lotion, I'm talkin’
I run a lot of productions, company productions
Uh, keepin' it on the smooth, generally
And on the regular, and uh
You know, with the coconut lotion and all
Keepin' it lovely, it's uh, you know
Nothing but love, baby, baby
All good..
Opens the door Mics the drums
Nervous Assistant here he comes
Too much coffee out of control
When he rides he rides the poll
White build up crazy twitch
Always in a rush to hit that switch

Nervous Assistant

You wanna' something you wanna' something
You wanna' something my dick
Running around nothing found
Moving too damn quick
You know where to find me anytime
I can't take it I've lost my mind
Proud to say no I'm not son
I I I I got one

Nervous Assistant
Too much action right by me
Like Buddy Rich, try me
Need a brain that's stress resistant
Or else I'll be...
The Nervous Assistant
And I thought it was known
All good in the zone
Something you don't have to tell me
Something you don't have to sell me

I'm feeling so, I'm feeling so
I'm feeling so, I'm feeling so

Believe in me, believe in me
Believe in me, believe in me

And what wasn't said
I wasn't lying
What do I have to do
It's not lack of trying

What I don't know, what I don't know
What I don't know, what I don't know

Believe in me, believe in me
Believe in me, believe in me
Brand new, it's brand new for you
Brand new, it's brand new for you
Brand new, it's brand new for you
Brand new, it's brand new for you

Deep inside you will find
Something that you won't mind
Think about diamond rings and goldfronts combined
Then go back go way back
Something passed that you lack
Well I've got brand new
A scooby snack just for you

Brand new, it's brand new for you
Brand new, it's brand new for you
Brand new, it's brand new for you
Brand new, it's brand new for you

Deep inside you will find
Something that you won't mind
Think about diamond rings and goldfronts combined
Then go back go way back
Something passed that you lack
Well I've got brand new
A scooby snack just for you
Sabrosa

Brand new, it's brand new for you
Brand new, it's all brand new for you
Brand new, it's brand new for you
Brand new, it's all brand new for you
Rob and steal from the health food store
The ideas you shout that are so hardcore
Screaming at the phone man collecting the change
Ideas discovered then rearranged

I won't say that life's a bitch and then you die
Because I do my best to enjoy mine
You can't bring me down to a world of self-pity
Lots of ways to deal with it
Deal with it

You do unto others like they're pieces of shit
A righteous man who's flipping the script
There's plenty of room for everyone at the table
Check yourself before you check the label

I won't live life being mad holding a grudge
It's not my place - sitting back, playing judge
Not enough time to always stay mad
May as well be glad to Deal With It
Deal With It
Made a noise invented a sound
When Brian Wilson used it A hit was found

If only I could have imagined
The square waves running through his head

Square wave - people couldn't believe it
Square wave - all the way to Carnegie hall Square wave

One rod for Pitch
Electro Magnetic Fields
Wired up Sing Sing
Hung out with Einstein

For all All of his brilliant innovation
Sent off to a siberian reservation
Square wave - people couldn't believe it
Square wave - all the way to Carnegie hall Square wave

You catch a bad one
Shit happens with the games you run

{"Now I want you all to break this down"}

[Outro]
To all the girls, all the girls... 

[echoes for 20 seconds]

{"You liked it?"}
{"Well, some of it seemed good!"}
M C for what I am, and do
The A is for Adam, and the lyrics... true
So as I pray and hope, that the message is sent
And I am living in the dreams that I have dreamt
Because I'm down with the three, the unstoppable three
Me and Adam and D were born to emcee
And my body and soul and mind are pure
Not polluted or diluted or damaged beyond cure
Just lyrics from I to you, recited
Arrested, bailed, but cuffed and indicted
Enter the arena as I take the center stage
The lights set low, and the night has come of age
Take the microphone in hand as I am a professional
Speak my knowledge to the crowd, and the Ed is Special
For I am the Bard, and I am the last one
I am the king, and this is my castle
Dwell in realms of now, but vidi those of the past
Seen a glimpse from ahead, and I don't think it's gonna last
And you can bet your ass

I drop the L when I'm skiin'
I'm smokin' and peakin'
I put the skis on the roof almost every single weekend
Can't stop the mindfuck when it's rollin' along
Can't stop the smooth running when the shit's running strong
Broke my bindings, the lion with wings
Preaching his words in the b-boy sing
I am one with myself, as I turn to thee
Prefer the dreams to the reality
I prefer my life, don't need no other man's wife
Don't need no crazy lifestyle with stress and strife
But it's good to have a turn to be a king for a day
Or for a week, or for a year, or for a year and a day
Come what may...
I'm fishin' in my boat, and I'm fishing for trout
Mix the Bass Ale with the Guinness Stout
Fishing for a line inside my brain
And looking out at the world through my window pane
Every day has many colors 'cause the glass is stained
Everything has changed but remains the same
So once again the mirror raised, and I see myself as clear as day
And I'm going to the limits of my ultimate destiny
Feeling as though somebody, somewhere, is testing me
He who sees the end from the beginning of time
Looking forward through all the ages is, was, and always shall be
Check the prophetic sections of the pages

EZ Mike with the Disco Dave

He goes by the name of the D-D-D-Disco Dave
Disco Dave, Disco Dave, Disco Dave
Disco Dave, Disco Dave, Disco Dave
Disco Dave, Disco Dave, Disco Dave
Disco Dave

[Verse 1]
Some static started in the pool hall
Hit a motherfucker's face with the cue ball
And I met this girl, she tried to gank me
So I smacked her in the booty with a plank, B
'Cause me and my crew were out breaking windows
The bingo, the lotto, you know I'll never win those
Possession is half the law, I had my routines before all y'all
Your whole life is coming apart at the seams
You ain't nothing but a car thief biting routines
See, I'm a city slicker, I, I ain't no townie
Right now, I wish I had another hash brownie
And like Ricky always said, you've got to toke and pass
Or Mookie's gonna kick your motherfucking ass
Try to take what isn't yours like a god damn rat
See I, personally, I wouldn't even wanna go out like that

[Verse 2]
I'm a writer, a poet, a genius, I know it
I don't buy cheeba, I grow it (I'm a farmer)
People always trying to get next to me
I had a beautiful experience on ecstasy
I smoked up a bag of elephant tranquilizer
Because I had to deal with a money-hungry miser
Had a 'caine-filled Kool with my man, Rush Rush
Saw my teeth fall in the sink when I started to brush
You be doing nose candy on the Bowie coke mirror
My girl asked for some, but I pretended not to hear her
You can't deny me, you always want to try me
Yo, you're just gonna get your ass kicked
Homeboy, throw in the towel
Your girl got dicked by Ricky Powell
The Godfather of Soul in the belly of the beast
Smoking that dust at St. Anthony's Feast

[Verse 3]
All the wife beaters and all the tax cheaters
Sitting in the White House pulling their peters
Buy my cheeba from the cop down the street
The only cop with a rope chain when he's walking the beat
So like a sneaky pouch time-bomb ticking
A-like the beat to my rhyme just kicking
Space cake cookies, I discover who I am
I'm a dusted old bummy Hurdy Gurdy Man
Five-oh caught me, now I'm going to the mountains
Said good-bye to my girl, my lawyer and accountants
My mind is kinda rhyming, and I think I oughta think
So I'm rockin' all the rhymes, and I'll have another drink
So the lights are flashing, my mind is spinning
I feel like it is always the beginning of another rhyme
I'm rapping, emceeing, I rock
You ain't nothing but a car thief who must be stopped

[Outro]
Soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft
Soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft

[Produced by Beastie Boys & Dust Brothers]

[Mike D]
I stay up all night, I go to sleep watching Dragnet
Never sleep alone because Jimmy is the magnet
I'm so rope, they call me Mr. Roper
When the troubles arise, you know I'm the cool coper
On the mic I score, just like the Yankees
Get over on Miss Crabtree like my main man Spankee
Excuse me young lady, I don't mean to trouble ya
But you're lookin' so fly inside your BMW
I got lucky, I brought home the kitten
Before I got busy, I slipped on the mitten
Can't get better odds because I'm a sure thing
Proud Mary keeps on turning and rolling like a Ring-Ding
Jump the turnstiles, never pay the toll
Doo-wah diddy and bust in with the pre-roll
Customs jailed me over an herb seed
Don't rat on your boy over some rat weed
I'm outta your back door, I'm into another
Your boyfriend doesn't know about me and your mother
Not perfect grammar, always perfect timing
The Mike stands for money and the D is for diamonds

[MCA]
Roses are red, the sky is blue
I got my barrel at your neck, so what the fuck you gonna do?
It's just two wheels and me, the wind in my eyes
The engine is the music and my nine's by my side
Cause you know Y-A-U-C-H
I'm taking all emcees out in the place
Takin' life as it comes, no fool am I
I'm goin' off, gettin' paid, and I don't ask why
Playin' beats on my box, makin' music for the many
Know a lot of def girls that’ll do anything
A lot of parents like to think I'm a villain
I'm just chillin', like Bob Dylan
Yeah, I smoke cheeba, it helps me with my brain
I might be a little dusted but I'm not insane
People come up to me, and they try to talk shit
Man, I was making records when you were suckin' your mother's dick

[Ad-Rock]
Girl, you're walking tall now in your fancy clothes
You got fancy things, they're going up your nose
You're getting fancy gifts from expensive men
You're a dog on a leash, like a pig in a pen
Mothership connection, getting girls' affection
If your life needs correction, don't follow my direction
You got your 8 by 10, your agent, your Harley
You be driving around Hollywood with yo, "Sorry, Charlie"
Cause I'm running things like some mack motherfucker
You slipin', you slackin', cause you're a false fake sucker
You slip, you slack; you clock me, and you lack
While I'm reading "On The Road" by my man, Jack Kerouac
Poetry in motion, coconut lotion
Had to diss the girl because she got too emotional
Are you experienced, little girl?
I want to know what goes on in your little girl world
Cause I'm on your mind, it's hard to forget me
I'll take your pride for a ride if you let me
So peace out, y'all, a PCP, song out
Full throttle to the bottle and full, full clout
And I'm out
I give to this world 'till I've got nothing to give to
I give thanks to this world for the life that I've lived through
Stress gets in the way of the shit that we're doing
We'll bum rush the door if you don't let the whole crew in

I want some
I want some
I want some
I want some

Give me the chance and I will show you what I'm feeling
My mind's caught up in the shit the man's dealing
Looking ahead, the next level we're gonna take it to
I guess I should be happy it's a day that we made it through

I want some
I want some
I want some
I want some

[Intro]
Ahh, yeah

[Verse 1]
I looked out the window, seen his bald head
Ran to the fridge and pulled out an egg
Scoped him with my scopes, he had no hair
Launched that shot, and he was caught out there
Saw the convertible driving by
I loaded up the slingshot, let one fly
He went for his to find he didn't have one
Put him in check, correct, with my egg-gun
The egg, a symbol of life
I go inside your house and bust out your wife
I pulled out the jammy, he thought it was a joke
The trigger, I pulled - his face, the yolk
Reached in his pocket, took all his cash
Left my man standing with the egg mustache
Suckers, they come a dime a dozen
"When I say dozen, you know what I'm talkin' about, boy"

[Refrain]
Yeah, that's right, I'm the Egg Man
Driving around, king of the town (yeah)
Always got my windows rolled down
Ready to throw
You know, I'm the Egg Man
Once upon a time (Egg Man…)

[Verse 2]
Humpty Dumpty was a big fat egg
He was playing the wall, then he broke his leg
Tossed it out the window, three minutes hot
Hit the Rastaman, he said, (Bloodclot!)
Which came first, the chicken or the egg?
I egged the chicken, and then I ate his leg
Riding the trains, in between cars
When I pull out the station, You're Gonna Get Yours
Drive-by eggings, plaguing LA
"Yo, you just got my little cousin, ese!"
Sometimes hard-boiled, sometimes runny (Ray)
Comes from a chicken, not a bunny, dummy
People laugh, it's no joke
My name's "Yauch" and I'm throwing the yolk
Now they got me in a cell, but I don't care
It was then that I got caught catching people out there

[Refrain]
Up on the roof, in my car, up all night
I'm going through science like Dolemite
The Mack (Who?)
I'm the Egg Man… Taxi driver?
I'm the Egg Man
Egg Man, Egg Man

[Verse 3]
We all dressed in black, we snuck up around the back
We began to attack, the eggs did crack on Haze's back
Sam I Am, down with the program
Green Eggs and Ham, Yosemite Sam
Come Halloween, you know I come strapped
I throw it at a sucker… "k-pap"
You made the mistake and judge a man by his race
You go through life with egg on your face
Woke up in the morning, peculiar feeling
Looked up and saw egg dripping from the ceiling
The family, punk rocks, the businessman
I'll dog everybody with the egg in my hand
It's not like the crack that you put in a pipe
But crack on your forehead; here's a towel, now wipe

[Outro]
Egg Man, Egg Man, Egg Man, Egg Man, Egg Man, Egg Man
Egg Man, Egg Man, Egg Man, Egg Man, Egg Man, Egg Man
Egg Man, Egg Man, Egg Man, Egg Man, Egg Man...
Egg Man...
{*scratching: "Aw yeah!"*}
There's a girl over there {*"Aw yeah!"*}
With long brown hair {*"Aw yeah!"*}
I took her to the place...
I threw the mattress in her face...
Took off her shirt {"*fresh"*}
Took off her bra...
Took off her pants {"*fresh"*}
You know what I saw {"WICK WICK WACK!"}

{*all laughing*}

[Intro]
Here's another one for y'all to peep
It's called M-I-K-E on the M-I-C

[Mike D]
See... I met this girl last night with a peculiar cackle
I laid the bait, and then she took the tackle
Had too much to drink at the Red Lobster
Now the room is spinnin' 'round like the blades of a helicopter
I never met a girl that was too finicky
If the press has their way, then they're going to finish me
You might know this, but you've never been this, see?
If I ate spinach I'd be called Spinach D
I shed light like cats shed fur
Ride around town like I'm Raymond Burr
I'm so high that they call me Your Highness
So if you don't know me, then pardon my shyness
I live in the Village, wherever I go I walk to
I keep my friends around so I have someone to talk to
I play my music loud because you know it's got clout to it
{"It's a trip... it's got a FUNKY beat
And I can bug out to it!"}

[Verse 1]
Now, I rock a house party at the drop of a hat (yeah)
Now, I beat a biter down with an aluminum bat
A lot of people they be Jonesin' just to hear me rock the mic
They be staring at the radio, staying up all night
So like a pimp, I'm pimpin', I got a boat to eat shrimp in
Nothing wrong with my leg, I'm just B-boy limpin'
Got arrested at the Mardi Gras for jumping on a float
My man MCA's got a beard like a billy goat
"Ooh-ooh" is my disco call
MCA (hu-huh), I'm gettin' rope, y'all
Routines I bust, and the rhymes that I write
And I'll be busting routines and rhymes all night
Like eating burgers or chicken and you'll be picking ya nose, man
I'm on time, homie, that's how it goes
You heard my style, I think you missed the point
It's the joint!

[Verse 2]
Mike D (Yeah?) With your bad self running things
(What's up?) With your bad breath onion rings
Well, I'm Mike D, and I'm back from the dead
Chillin' at the beach, down at Club Med
Make another record 'cause the people, they want more of this
Suckers, they be saying they can take out Adam Horovitz
Hurricane, you got clout
Other DJ's, he'll put your head out
A puppet on a string, I'm paid to sing or rhyme
Or do my thing, I'm in a lava lamp, inside my brain hotel
I might be freakin or peakin', but I rock well
The Patty Duke Show, the Wrench, and then I bust the Tango
Got more rhymes than Jamaica got mango
I got the peg leg at the end of my stump-a
Shake your rump-a

[Verse 3]
A full clout, y'all, a full clout, y'all
And when the mic is in my mouth, I turn it out, y'all
A full clout​

[sound of a bong hit followed by a shotgun noise]
Never been dumped, 'cause I'm the most mackinest
Never been jumped, 'cause I'm known the most packinest
Yeah, we've got beef, chief, we're knocking out teeth, chief
And if you don't believe us, you should question your belief, Keith
Like Sam the butcher bringing Alice the meat
Like Fred Flintstone, driving around with bald feet
Should I have another sip? Nah, skip it
In the back of the ride and bust with the whippet
Rope-a-dope dookies all around the neck
Woo-ha! Got them all in check
Running from the law, the press, and the parents
Is your name Michael Diamond? No, mine's Clarence
From downtown, Manhattan, the Village
My style is wild, and you know that it still is
Disco bag schlepping, and you're doing the bump
Shake your rump-a

[Verse 1]
Now here we go dropping science, dropping it all over
Like bumping around the town like when you're driving a Range Rover
Expanding the horizon and expanding the parameters
Expanding the rhymes of sucka MC amateurs
Naugles, Isaac Newton, a scientific EZ
Ben Franklin with the kite, gettin’ ova with the key
Now rock, shocker the mike of the many times, times the times tables
Rock well to tell, dispel, all of the old fables
Cuz I be dropping the new science and I be kicking the new k-nowledge
An emcee to a degree that you can't get in college
Now the dregs of the Earth and the eggs that I eat
I've got pegs through my hands and one through my feet
Shea Stadium, the radium, E.M.D. squared
Kicked out of the Palladium, 'dja think that I cared?
It's the sounds of science, the sounds of science
Science

[Climb: (Ad Rock)]
Rope-a-Dope!
The newest in new, "Right up to your face and diss you"
Waxin' and milkin'
All of y'all square heads

[Verse 2]
Time and money for girls covered with honey
You lie and aspire to be as cunning
Reelin' and rockin' and rollin' B-sized D-cup
Order the Quarter Deluxe, why don'tcha wake up?
My mind is kinda flowing like an oil projector
Had to get up and get the Jimmy protector
Went berserk and worked, and exploded
She woke up in the morning, and her face was coated
Buddy, you study the man on the mic
D, do whatcha like (Huh)
Drunk as a skunk am I from celebration
To peep that freak unique penetration
Well, I figured out who makes the crack, it's
The suckas with the badges and the blue jackets
Professor of science cuz I keep droppin' it
I smell weak cuz y'all keep poppin' it
People always ask me what's the phenomenon
Yo, what's up? Yo, what's goin' on?
No one really knows what I'm talkin' about
And yeah, that's right, my name's Yauch...

[DJ scratching]

[Verse 3]
Ponce De Leon, constantly on
The fountain of youth, not Robotron
Peace is a word I've heard before
So move and move and move up on the dance floor
Cuz I'm gonna die, gonna die one day
Cuz I'm goin' and goin' and goin' this way
Not like a roach or a piece of toast
I'm goin' out first class, ain't goin' out coach
Rock my Adidas, never rock Filas
I do not sniff the coke, I only smoke the sinsemilla
Well, with my nose I knows, and with my scope I scopes
What I live I write, and that's strictly rope
I got science for any occasion
Postulating theorems, formulating equations
Well, Cheech Wizard in a snow blizzard
Eat a chicken gizzard with a girl named Lizzy

[Outro]
Dropping science like Galileo dropped the orange
It's finger lickin', finger lickin' good, y'all
Finger lickin', a finger lickin' good, y'all
It's finger lickin', finger lickin' good, y'all
It's finger lickin', finger lickin' good, y'all

Lickin'-lickin', uh
Lickin'-lickin', uh
Lickin'-lickin', uh
Lickin'-lickin', uh

Well, Mike d, what's up?
Yo, Yauch what's up?
Come on, Mike, let's tear it up
Hear no evil, see no evil, talkin' no bullshit
So many damn people are so damn full of it
Keyboard Money Mark, you know he ain't havin' it
Just give him some wood and he'll build you a cabinet
I’m convinced that Vince is rippin' me off
I think it's his girdle that's tippin' me off
Well, Mike D's out back and he's growin' onions
I’ve got bigger buns than my man Paul Bunyon's
I’ve been going nuts gettin' all cooped up
Fully hermitizing but now I’m getting souped up
It's time to turn the page to a brand new chapter
Settin' my sights and you know what I’m after
I’ll be in the paper the news with Ernie Ernesto
They'll even print my recipe for pasta with pesto
Now here's another special of the day
I’ve got more spice than the frugal gourmet
It's finger lickin', finger lickin' good, y'all
Finger lickin', a finger lickin' good, y'all
It's finger lickin', finger lickin' good, y'all
It's finger lickin', finger lickin' good, y'all

Lickin'-lickin', uh
Lickin'-lickin', uh
Lickin'-lickin', uh
Lickin'-lickin', uh

Well, Mike D (huh), what you got for me?
Show these good people what it means to be D
Well they call me Mike D with the mad man style
I put the mic up to my lips and I can scream for a while
Created a sound at which many were shocked at
I’ve got a million ideas that I ain't even rocked yet
I’ve got the light bulb flashing on the top of my head
Never wake up on the wrong side of the bed
You're an idea man, not a yes man
With a point to make, you're bound to take a stand
Cause I’m Pete the Puma, Minnie the Moocher
Got every type of flavor or style that will suit ‘ya
You know the bass is real fat, because it's gotta be like that
A snare on the funky tin, and a taste of the hi-hat

Finger lickin', finger lickin' good, y'all
Finger lickin', a finger lickin' good, y'all
It's finger lickin', it's finger lickin' good, y'all
A finger lickin', a lickin', lickin' good, y'all
Yo, Yauch what's up?
Mike D, what's up?
Come on Yauch, let's tear it up
Well, I could catch a groove like a flash in the dark
I grab a hold of your attention like a thief in the park
‘Cause I can flip a rhyme off the tip of my tongue
Yeah, I be switching up the rhythm like the rhyme's a piece of chewing gum
Now I might chew, but I don't bite
My ideas are mine when I begin to write
In my sleep I’ll be thinking 'bout beats and
Getting on the mic and busting some treats and
Sportin’ the crazy funky threads that you've never even seen before
What I’m lackin’ from the mackin’ I can find at the thrift store
I won't scuff nor scuffle, just grin as they walk by
Take time to rhyme for a girl I hear talk fly
Down some papaya, down with the revolution
Always wear my goggles, ‘cause there's so much pollution
I can do the Freak, the Patty Duke, and the Spank
Gotta free the funky fish from the funky fish tanks
I’ll sell my house, sell my car, and I’ll sell all my stuff
"I’m going back to New York City, I do believe I’ve had enough"

Whipped-whipped-whipped cream
Whipped-whipped-whipped cream

We're gonna’ be out of her in a minute
So this one goes out to my man, Mario C
My brother Adrock, cuttin' it up on the turntable
Yeah, finger lickin' good, y'all
DJ Hurricane is finger lickin' good, y'all
Right now, it's showtime at PJ's!
How about a great big round of applause?
(I almost blew it)

They comin' home
Oh, they comin' home
To all their fans, they are, they comin' home
They're comin' home, oh, they're comin' home
Our evening began
In Peter Sichel's comfortable study
In his New York townhouse
Where the candlelight was just right
The hi-fi was in the background
And the wine, was delicious

[Woman] What's the secret, Peter?

[Peter] Naturally, I'll say it's the wine

[Woman] Mmmm, it does go well with the chicken!

Delicious again, Peter
Yo, Paul, this is Al. You can kiss my ass
I ain't interested in you anyhow
I'm just interested in the B-Boys
So fuck you, my man
Yeaaaah, yeah...
Who is it?

Who is the man comin' down your block?
It's me you see with the funk in my walk
Cause I'm doin' just what I like to
Today is my day yeah, and I'mma get nice too
You gotta keep movin', and you can't say nothing
I'mma keep bouncin' and bumpin' and stuffin'
One thing you ought to know
Well, I am the maestro

Yeah, you motherfuckers, I'm all that
I see you lookin' at me sayin'
How can he be so skinny and live so phat?
You know why, cause I'm the maestro
Yeah, you know and I'm
Move outta my way
You got that?
I feel like Rufus Thomas, the crown prince of dance
I'm Mike D, and I'm known for romance
I'm the crazy baldhead with the part on the side
And I'm riding down the block, like I'm on a water slide
'Cause it's the type of day I feel like pressing my luck
'Cause I got nothing to lose, cause I don't give a fuck
See I'm a player, I play
Don't play to win, I play to show
Yeah, I am the maestro!

Ahh, yeah, I need a little bit of cooperation right about now
I'd like to find out who's favorite detective it is
Who is this?
Is it Mannix? Barnaby Jones?
Sombody say Columbo
Mickey Mulroney?
Is it Cannon...
Barnaby Jones?
I said that already

Yeah that's right, ya'll
You know I got my own shit
See, this ain't America's Most Wanted
This is America's Most Mackin!
That's right other people all call it, my hit!
When I get on there is no stoppin'!
Who is this?
Who is the man, who is the man, who is the man?
Who is the man, who is the man, who is the man?
Who is the man, who is the man?

Who is the man?
Who's that?
The maestro
Who is the man?
What? The maestro!
Give it, give it
The maestro
Give it up
The maestro
All three cheers for the maestro!
It's 4am, I've got the Hasenpfeffer Ale
I've got nothing to lose, so I'm pissing on the third rail
Groggy-eyed and fried, and I'm headed for the station
D-train ride to Coney Island vacation
This one’s… dedicated to the boofers in the back of the 1-train
They'll be kicking out windows, high on cocaine
And then I jump the turnstile, I lost my last token
Riding between the cars, pissing, smoking
Head for the last car, fluorescent light blackout
Policeman told my homeboy, "Yo, put that crack out"
You know you light up when the lights go down
And then you read the New York Post, Fulton Street, downtown
Same faces every day, but you don't know their names
Party people going places on the D train

{Stop that train, I wanna get on}

Check it
Trench coat, wingtip, going to work
And you'll be pullin a train like you're Captain Kirk
Pickpocket gangsters, payin' their debts
I caught a bullet in the lung from Bernhard Goetz
Overworked and underpaid, starin' at the floor
Prostitute's spandex caught in the slide doors
Now you're stuck between the stations, it seems like an eternity
Sweating like sardines in a flophouse fraternity
$50.00 fine for disturbing the peace
The neck, tortoise, your Lees are creased
Hot cup of coffee, and the donuts are Dunkin
Friday night and Jamaica Queens funkin'
Elevated platform, I'm never gonna conform
Riding over the diner where I always get my toast warm
Bust into the conductor's booth and busted out rhymes
Over the loudspeaker about the hard times
Sat across from a man readin El Diario
Riding the train down from the El Barrio
Went from the station, to Orange Julius
I bought a hot dog - from WHO? George Drakoulias
Good morning
Time to get up and go to work

I ride on the bus into the city every day
I sit on my seat and I dream myself away
I dream I'm on an island with that foxy lady too
But when I awaken, I must be mistaken, I'm on Third Avenue
Won't you take me away and take away me
Won't you take me away and take away me
Yeaaah
Alright, get off the bus

"You're wild man... WILD!"

"That's insane, you're stupid"
(Huh?)
"You should sleep late man;
It's just much easier on your constitution"
I don't see things quite the same as I used to
As I live my life, I've got just me to be true to
When I find that I don't know about just what to do
I turn and look within—to see what I should do
Now I'm not sure what it takes to be hip
A lot of people making music that to me ain't shit
So I ask creation for rhymes for this jam
Gimme lickle solo and I'll take the mic stand

Love vibe, love vibe, love vibe, love vibe
Love vibe, love vibe, love vibe, love vibe

Yeah, as the earth spins into a brand new day
I see the light on the horizon's not fading away
Gonna shine from within, like a bright white sun
No need to hide and no place to run
Got the vibrations of the music bringing light to your mind
So you can move and groove, and feel the beat of the time
Sense the power in the air as it starts to move
You get a real good feeling that you just can't lose
Love vibe
Contemplation time
Love vibe
Intuition time
Love vibe
Evolution time
Love vibe
Resolution time

Free your mind, it's time for good times
And let yourself move, it's a time to shine
Spread your wings in the sky, feelin' good inside
Breaking fool with no need to hide
I got the music cuttin' through me
Takin' control of my soul
I can't hold back, I've got to let go

Stand together (people come together now)
It's about time (we've got to get together now)
Stand together (people come together now)
I said it's about time (we've got to get together now), come on
Stand together (people come together now)
I said it's about time (we've got to get together, y'all)

I think we should stand together
I wish for peace between the races
Someday we shall all be one

Why fight yourself?
This one is called Rectify

There's something coming to the surface
There's fire all around
But this is all illusion

I've seen better days than this one
I've seen better nights than this one
Tension is rebuilding
Something's got to give
Something's got to give

Someday, we shall all be one

Jesus Christ, we're nice
Once again, I'm all wrapped up in me
My best friend's my own worst enemy
Electricity and gravity
Oh, my god, now take a look at me
My lifeline's run by AT&T
They got their wires all up in me
Is push and pull the way it's got to be?

Once again, I'm all wrapped up in me
My best friend's my own worst enemy
Electricity and gravity

Once again, I'm all wrapped up in me
Once again, I'm all wrapped up in me
Once again, I'm all wrapped up in me
Once again, I'm all wrapped up in me

You know, I wish that there was some way
That I could be outside playing basketball in the rain
And not get wet. Now wouldn't that be great, hmm?

[Intro]
Yeah, that's right!
It's time, to set the record straight

[Verse One]
Ain't nobody got to spell it for me
I said ain't nobody got to yell that can see
I said ain't nobody got to pay that can hear
But if I have to I'll yell in your ear

[Chorus]
Time for livin', time for givin'
Time for livin', time for givin'
Time for livin', time for givin'
Time for livin', time for givin'

[Verse Two]
Check this out
Ain't nobody got to spell it for me
I said ain't nobody got to yell that can see
I said ain't nobody got to pay that can hear
But if I have to I'll yell in your ear

[Interlude]
Soul fire, soul fire
And we ain't got no water
We don't got no water

[Outro]
Time for livin', time for givin'
No time for makin' up a monster to sell
Time for livin', time for givin'
No time for makin' up a monster to sell

[Verse 1]
I'm flowing prose to cons and cons to pros
I'm scheming rhyme against reason like it was flow against know
But beyond the concepts and emotions that rise
To the interconnectedness that underlies
The lies upon lies have lost their meaning
The plies upon plies of consciousness that is being
Over and over, I fall, I learned to walk from a crawl
It's not sad, it's just the way and the purpose of it all

[Verse 2]
Now every word that you heard that I said that you felt
Was put in place in the space as they were shuffled and dealt
I steal feels from reels, but I pay my respects
Paying compliments and disses and deciphering affects
Words are water as I court her, as she is pristine
Words and mics fall to dust and all that's left is the feelings
I give in and I win, I try to never complain
Intentions venture to center and then they set the stage
But I'll remain sane, making gain without pain
Staining trains with names and driving lanes to the refrain
And keep it positive as painstaking as it is
I'll never turn back cause that's the way I've got to live
I'll never turn back cause that's the way I've got to live
I'll never turn back cause that's the way I've got to live

[Verse 3]
So like a cloud carries rain, I'm gonna carry my rhyme
Coming like thunder with lightening timing
No hesitation in gestation of thoughts and plans
Ferment time like wine, no ploys or scams
Like the islands dot the oceans in the endless seas
Ideas coming to me in answer to my pleas
Woke up this morning right out of a dream
Reached for my pen and pad because my mind was on a rhyme scheme
What can I do with these bones and flesh?
With these animated thoughts in a world repressed?
I'm going down like the rhythms on the winds of change
I'm keeping calm under pressure like a deep-sea range
I'm flowing prose to cons and cons to pros
I'm like Toucan Sam when I follow my nose
I'm giving shouts to Gandhi, Garvey, and King
His Holiness and all enlightened beings
I'll be the one who screams it on the microphone
I'll be the one who brings it inside your home
But the words ain't mine, I just pass 'em along
For Betty Williams and her friends, I sing this song
And more ink from my pen and more tears from my eyes
And more crimes are committed as I say these lines

Youth enough, we put down the gun
Jungle-jungle, Merlin Production Company
Black Ark International Branch presents
Coffin going around, have you seen Mister Brown?
Coffin going around, going around the town
Have you seen Mister Brown?
Whispering voices, whispering voices
Whispering voices, have you seen Mister Brown?
They who want to control always lose control
They who wants everything always lose everything
Coffin going around, have you seen Mister Brown in town?
Have you seen Mister Brown?

They who want total control always lose control
Some always lose their soul for silver and gold
Silver and gold are by none
Was in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth
Rise up and walk, rise up and walk
Rise up and walk, rise up and walk
A weepin' time, weepin' time, and reapin' time
Weepin' time and creepin' time
Reap what you sow
Rockin' comin' from the weepin' mind
And all that I reap is mine
So you cannot reap what is mine
Say
Was in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth
Black ganja cigarette
Kindly weed and ganja marijuana lung's breath
Rise up and walk, rise up and clap
Rise up and hap, rise up and lift up your cap
Lift up your cap, and rise up and hap
Do the thunder clap, great ball of fire on the sky
And reap your time, weep your mind
Weepin' time, reapin' time, harvest-harvest time
You reap what you sow, I reap what I sow

Coffin going around, have you seen Mister Clown?
He used to call himself Mister Brown, and king sat down
He no longer miss the town
He not know that I miss the crown and missed the ground
What's comin' up from under ground, we'll weep in time

I.N.R.I. Production that takes over France
With voo-doo dance and science arts
Science machine and science dream
This is a living dream from the Beastly Brothers
And the Beastly Boys with their beastly toys
To give you some beastly joys
So put on your beastly drawers
And show me a beastly pose
Hahahaha...
What's pleasing to the eye
In the delusion of my sight
Is not what I find when I reach into the light
I have lost my mind

I'm walking through time
Deluded as the next guy
Pretending and hoping to find
That distant peace of mind

I don't know
Who does know?
There is no
Where to go

It's not so simple as I try to wish
But then again what is?
There is no other worthy quest
So on I go

I don't know
Who does know?
There is no
Where to go
I don't know
Who does know?
Where to go

I don't know
I don't know
I don't know
I don't know
Well, it's...
Fifty cups of coffee and you know it's on
I move the crowd to the break of break of dawn
Can't rock the house without the party people
Cause when we're gettin down we are all equal
There's no better or worse between you and me
But I rock the mic so viciously
Like pins and needles and words that sting
At the blink of an eye I will do my thing
It's like a needle in the cartridge when the record spins
Like diggin' down deep in the record bins
Everybody gettin' down make no mistake
Nothing sounds quite like an 8...0...8

Money makin', money money makin (Manhattan!)
Super disco, disco breakin'
Money makin', money money makin (Manhattan!)
Super disco, disco breakin'

Sometimes I like to brag, sometimes I'm soft spoken
When I'm in Holland I eat the pannenkoeken
The worm is the spice, you bring the sauce
And you can kiss my ass you funky boss
Now that you got what you want, you want more
Well I'll be with the hammer and the nail at your door
With these funky beats I be goin' head huntin'
Shouts to my peeps let me know if you feel something
Cause I can give you all you need
A little beat for the rhythm and some words to read
Let me tell you now that's my favorite shit
"And when I got a new rhyme I just say..."
So!
Money makin', money money makin (Manhattan!)
Super disco, disco breakin'
Money makin', money money makin (Manhattan!)
Super disco disco breakin'

("Is Manhattan in the house?

[Scratching "uh-huh, uh-huh"]
Is Manhattan in the house?

[Scratching "uh-huh, uh-huh"]

[Scratching continues]
Man-man-Manhattan
Man-Manhattan
Man-man-Manhattan
Manhattan)
And what do you do when
Your man kills himself and
How do I make friends now?

And where is my mom?
I need to show her that
She taught me

And please let me
Die an instant death

[Intro]
Boom, yeah, the world mash up

[Verse 1]
Well, things get hectic quick
From the satellite dish to your joy stick
It's the night of the living cable box
Wires coming up from around the block
Remote control to change the station
But that won't change your situation
Have you seen what I mean
I'm the little gnome that's in your dreams
So I say this rhyme built by design
To take you beyond space and time
Said who is the man making diamonds out of coal
The man pushing buttons on remote control

[Hook]
Re-mote, control
Remote control

[Verse 2]
Until your back's up against the wall
You never know yourself that much at all
So you've got to share your love with a friend
That's all that you've got left in the end
Living in this city of pure confusion
People misled by their own illusion
All this action, no satisfaction
We're all linked together like a chain reaction
Play or fold, love is bold
What is the future that will unfold?
Some like it hot, others like it cold
But we all want to hold the remote control

[Hook]
Re-mote, control
Re-mote, control
Re-mote, control
Re-mote, control

[Verse 3]
Things get hectic quick
All of a sudden I'm in the thick
Too much drama all around
Distractions booming in sensurround
Like a rainy day's Earth it won't sit still
Sliding on down a hill
Sometimes life, it seems to stall
So never be ungrateful y'all
So I got a little something for your pay per view
Like Don King, I've got the crazy hair do
We've got cameras on Mars on space patrol
Controlled on Earth by remote control
Electrify, ele-electrify, electrify
Electrify, ele-electrify, electrify
Electrify, ele-electrify

Words coming forth like water from the tap
Clap tracks line the spaces places papers people stack
Back track through the minutes when the thoughts went insane
I pulled the picture off the cover and blew out the mind games
People say this is the playlist of the void non-bound
But I can say this is the plainness of the peace I've found
It's not the sorrow or the pity that we hope to dismantle
It's just the cast of past dice lighting both ends of the candles
Scandelescent in the means, I have dreamed on the schemes
Reunited in the times of such picturesque scenes
So can I get a witness to testify?
Open your eyes, realize, electrify

Electrify, electrify, ele-electrify
Electrify, electrify, ele-electrify
Electrify, electrify, ele-electrify
Electrify, electrify, ele-electrify
So I plan and I scam and write it off on my taxes
It's times like these, I'll just go with the decisions of the masses
And to the crowds who've come before with their profit massing ways
To the greed that fucked it up and brought it down to today
With pain I stand sane and remain holding strong
Whilst all around me, those who clowned me are now drowning by the throngs
It's illogical the actions that are typically displayed
A set back ain't all that much problem to invade
So I will glow like a lantern on a new moon night
I'll fight violence with these hands that weren't built to fight
But like a furnace burning coal my goals are bound to burn in flames
Whether achieved or dismantled by the agendas displayed
Can I get a witness to testify?
Open your eyes, realize, electrify

Electrify, electrify, ele-electrify
Electrify, electrify, ele-electrify
Electrify, electrify, ele-electrify
Electrify, electrify, ele-electrify

[Intro: Biz Markie]
That's right, comin' to ya all day and all night
They are--I don't have to mention them cause they're superstars
We gonna do a little something like this
Aaaahh!

Dear Alex and Marilyn
They're Lovey and Thurston Howellin'
The grasshopper unit is prowlin'
And Rufus is back home growlin'
For all of y'all that be dozin'
On Hornblower's lederhosen
Like Walt Disney he'll be frozen
And then the Swiss Hall of Fame, he goes in
Cause when he's out in space carousin'
Pick up my mic and start joustin'
My name plate medallion
Says never trust a Hal 9000

Well, can't, won't, don't stop rockin' to the rhythm
Cause I get down, cause I get down
Cause I get down, get down, get down, get down, get down
Check the horizontal hold and check the tint
Are these three fools back at it again?
Inspector Clouseau and Derek Flint
Nothin' but sparks ignitin'
Check two, one-two, mic testin'
This one goes out to Dechen
Rise fallen fighters, take your stance again
Don't think too much about the color of skin
Order in vegetarian shark's fin
Try to keep my life nonviolent
Mario, rewind the tape and "Punch 'em in!"
Like Chuck D with the where you never been, I'm in

Well, can't, won't, don't stop rockin' to the rhythm
Cause I get down, cause I get down
Can't, won't, don't stop rockin' to the rhythm
Cause I get down, cause I get down

I'm a long way from where I've been but I gotta keep moving, movin' on

Oh, my-my, I'm really not feelin' it
Oh, my-my, something's really wrong
Oh, my-my, I'm really not feelin' it
Oh, my-my, something's really wrong

The PA sound is deafenin'
Bitin' MCs, I'm oustenin'
With spinach in your teeth, you're grinnin'
So on your way out, please take a mint
Got the studio to throw a craze in
The basslines Yauch just lays in
This song is the grass you're grazin'
Add a little flange and phase in
Don't get mad cause I'm beguilin'
I'm off the hook, so don't bother dialin'
They're gonna put me in the b-i-n
And if I die, notify the next of kin
Can't, won't, don't stop, can't, won't, don't stop
Can't, won't, don't stop, can't, won't, don't stop

Movin' on

Fresh!
Something on the windowsill
Caught her eye and held her still
The cars pass by outside
Nowhere left to hide
Picture this now crystal clear
Nothing left to hold her here
And creeping up meanwhile
Traces of a smile

Something on the windowsill
Caught her eye and held her still
The cars pass by outside...
Eyes open wide to see if I could fly...

Something on the windowsill...
Something on the windowsill...
Like a flag at half-mast as frames click fast
Not a thing will last as past is past
Like stacks of thoughts that got played and worn
Used over and over till they were tired and torn
Like a broken clock that can't tell time
Like a thick ass book that's filled with wack rhymes
Like a scorching blaze that burned the sand
Like a band that planned and planned and planned
And flew down like a raven in the dark of night
And snatched up the worm helpless to fight
And brought it back to the nest, singing microphone check
One two one two, this is just a test
One two one two, this is just a test
One two one two, this is just a test

Like sand in one hand You can't hold for long
Like scheming on a plan that goes all wrong
It's like fudge and caramel, they're not the same
And it's a shame, all you talk is game
You act like a diamond waiting to be set
In a gold ring, as if, I bet
As time goes by in this give and take
As long as I learn I will make mistakes
Now, what do I want? What do I need?
Why do I want it? What's in it for me?
It's the imagery of technology
Is what you get is what you see
Don't worry your mind
When you give it your best
One two one two this is just a test
One two one two, this is just a test
One two one two, this is just a test
Come on-come on, come on-come on
Come on-come on, come on-come on
Come on-come on, come on-come on
Come on-come on, come on-come on
Thank you very much

I'm hyp-no-tized.. by you
I'm hyp-no-tized.. by you
By you, by you, by you, by you

By you...
By you...
I don't like your attitude, boy

What makes you feel
And why you gotta be
Like you got the right
To look her up and down?
What makes this world
So sick and evil?
I, I don't know

What makes you feel
Like you've got whip appeal?
Who made you the judge and jury?
Ain't you never heard of privacy?
What makes this world
So sick and evil?
You figure it out
You figure it out

You figure it out

[Intro]
Yo...yo...yo...he-hello...he-hello...yo...hello
He-hello...he-hello...yo...hello
He-hello...he-hello...yo...

[Verse 1]
Time, time, time, time
It's times like this when I just can't stop
Can't wind your body without the body rock
Got schemes, schematics, blue prints on file
You got to have dreams to make it all worthwhile
So as I take my time and realign
I wonder what it is I hope to find
I don't mean to brag, I don't mean to boast
But I'm intercontinental when I eat French toast
Adrock--woo!--with the New Edition
Gettin' on down for the year 2000
A slight distraction can get you paid
And when it comes to that type shit, I paved the way

[Hook]
BBoys to the early morn
BGirls be rockin' on and on
BGirls to the break of dawn
BBoys be rockin' on and on
Hey...hey

[Verse 2]
Dogs love me cause I'm crazy sniffable
I bet you never knew, I got the ill peripheral
In your home, I'm cloned, I'm on your headphones
I love it when you spazz out all alone
Cause I'm that fool that broke the key
I'm unlockable so don't check me
I got weight on my shoulders and things on my mind
The sky is falling and I'm fallin' behind
So I synthesize sounds as I patch my brain
Insane mind games move quick like flames
So now I wonder how sometimes you never know
Who be rockin y'all in stere-ereo
In stere-ereo, in stere-ereo, in stereo

[Verse 3]
Ladies and gentlemen
A no time like the present to work shit out
That's what we're going on and on and on about
I'm not fakin', just makin' beats in the Dungeon
Keep that shit funky cause the odor is pungent
No shame in my game just par for the path
I try to hone my craft because at hand's the task
But I find I'm not playing with a full deck
I'm up to my neck like Toulouse Lautrec
All I want to know is when is checkout time
So I could be in heaven with the rhythm rock rhyme
And when I'm with my man, Shadi Rock, at the gates
We'll be rockin' rhythms over disco breaks

[Hook]
BBoys to the early morn
BGirls be rockin' on and on
BGirls to the break of dawn
BBoys be rockin' on and on, on and on, on and on, on and on...

[Samples]
Hubo una vez un gran rey que tenía muchas tierras, un castillo y también un amor
Hubo una vez un gran rey que tenía muchas tierras, un castillo y también un amor
Hubo una vez un gran rey que tenía muchas tierras, un castillo y también un amor
Hubo una vez un gran rey que tenía muchas tierras, un castillo y también un amor
Geesh!
Yeah, all the time
New school, old school (a'ight!)
Keep it on and on

Uhh, yeah

Goin' off the hook like Latrell Spreewell
I've got the ill technique so you know me well
We be kickin' bass, all up in your face
And when it comes to beats, well, I'm the rhythm ace

Now if you check my pulse, it beats skull snaps
I keep all my rhymes in my Le Sportsac
So what if I'm a ham and cheese on rye?
I got to do my thing and that's no lie

Well, ice is cold and fire is hot
When it comes to competition, we've got them locked
U-N-I-T-E
A little shout to Ian and little Zoe
One can wonder why, but can't deny
If we could work it out, it would be so fly
We'll never know unless we try
So tell me, party people, what's your Zodiac sign?

Breakdancers of the world, unite!
"Oh shit… yeah"

Bboys of the world, unite!
"Well wicked"

I went inside the deli, and my man's like, what?
I write the songs that make the whole world suck
I need to break it down every chance I get
So, Ssshhh, we keep it raw on the set

Automation, circulation
This is for the people all around the nations
I got books with hooks, and it looks like rain
Would someone on the Knicks please drive the lane?

Now rhymes are mantequilla on a track by us
I've got to keep my mind clear so I don't bust
If you got bad breath, then maybe try Scope
And if you wash your ass, you best use soap
People of the world, you realize
We got to get together and harmonize
I feel I'm comin down with the boogaloo flu
"Explain to me really what doctors must do"

Ravers of the world, unite!
Come on now

We're the scientists of sound
We're mathematically puttin' it down
When lightning strikes, best grab a ground
Got to get up to get down

I've got the terminator style with a touch of the tweak
Technics 1200's, I'm known to freak
I don't like to fight, I don't carry a piece
I wear permanent press so I'm always creased

Mike D with the rump shakin' action
Do it like this for the intergalaction
I practice asana daily so I'm very flexible
I'm a Scorpio so you know I'm very sexual

Shouts to Rach and my brother Matthew
In Money-Makin', it's how we do
I be smokin' roaches in the vestibule
In the next millennium, I'll still be old school
High roller, big baller
I call 'em crullers but you know they're called crawlers
I keep it movin' to the broad daylight
Bgirls of the world, unite! (a'ight!)

Keep it on and on, keep it on and on
Keep it on and on, keep it on and on
Keep it on and on, keep it on and on
Keep it on and on, keep it on and on
Keep it on and on, keep it on and on
Keep it on and on, keep it on and on
Keep it on and on, keep it on and on

Hahahaha...
Ah, with the rump shakin' action

[Hook]
Beatsie Beatsie Beatsie Boys gettin' live on the spot
Puttin all kinds of shame in the game you got
We keep the party moving to the broad daylight
G-E-T-L-I-V-E, alright

[Mike D]
Transhypnotic, robotic, can't stop it
No limits to this style and you know you can't lock it
First you mock it, rock it and then you stock it
But I've got the styles that are always in the pocket

[MCA]
Well, like a bird floating down on a New York breeze
Every thought in the mind is a planted seed
So watch the mind or the thoughts will stack
Before you know it, boomeranging on back

[Ad-Rock]
Well I'm the king of Boggle, there is none higher
I get eleven points off the word 'quagmire'
Fools can't see me, that's how it is
And that's how I like it and that's my biz

[Hook]
Beatsie-Beatsie Boys gettin' live on the spot
Puttin' all types of shame in the game you got
We keep the party moving to the broad day light
G-e-t-l-i-v-e, alright

[Mike D]
Time's an illusion as the moments race by
Too fast to really grasp, though we may try
Deny 'til we die, ooh my-my
These thoughts that mislead and then multiply

[MCA]
Well, second by second and minute by minute
It's like lotto, you have to be in it to win it
Shakin' mind breakin' on their own demise
Lies tax to the max and they'll be feeling those vibes

[Ad-Rock]
So tell me what you need that you have got
Fiending on power will make your blood clot
It starts with the greed and then goes all wrong
That's why, We can't all just get along

[Mike D]
We're all connected like a Lego set
One equals one together like a croquette
Whether we have or have not yet met
Well, it ain't no thing and it ain't no sweat

[Hook]
Beatsie-Beatsie Boys gettin' live on the spot
Puttin' all kinds of shame in the game you got
We keep the party moving to the broad daylight
G-e-t-l-i-v-e, alright

[Samples]
Non-stop hip-hop, non-stop hip-hop
Non-stop hip-hop, non-stop hip-hop

[MCA]
Well, you're caught in a panic and it's rattled your brain
The selfish ways just can't maintain
But these are the breaks when you try and come fake
Don't come with the rhymes that you just half baked

[Ad-Rock]
Well I'm the Benihana chef on the SP12
I chop the fuck out the beats left on the shelf
You be like 'Hello Nasty, where you been?'
It's time you brought the grimy beats out the dungeon

[Mike D]
I jumped outside the house with my Walkman on
I get so hyped when I hear this song
It's gonna keep me happy like all day long
So go and talk shit cause it just makes me strong

[MCA]
Don't grease my palms with your filthy cash
Multinationals spreading like a rash
I might stick around or I might be a fad
But I won't sell my songs for no TV ad

[Hook]
Beatsie-Beatsie-Beatsie-Beatsie Boys gettin' live on the spot
Puttin' all kinds of shame in the game you got
We keep the party moving to the broad day light
G-e-t-l-i-v-e, alright

[Samples]
Our sound is the nicest, it's the sweetest sound
Our sound is the nicest, it's the sweetest sound
Can't get enough of that f-f-funk
Can't get enough of that f-funk
Can't get enough of that f-f-funk
Can't get enough of that f-funk

Junior...
"Bet you're wondering what's been going on
Bet you think I've almost lost my mind"

My DJ's got the cuts and the beats are on
We're comin' with the limericks, and we're comin' strong
And the rhythm's on time, to every word and rhyme
When it comes to keep it real, I keep it really wrong

At the risk of sounding crass, I would like to mention
That I am well aware of your wack intentions
To usurp my prose, you so-and-so
It's my primary bone of contention

I tell you, everybody, I've had it
With all these people with static
I'll go insane if it don't rain
Sucker MCs are problematic

I love it when you hit those switches
A curve ball's what my pitch is
So here we—here we come
Like dum-ditty-dum
I keep all five boroughs in stitches
"You're right, man"

Sound, sound, sound, sound, sound, sound
Sound, sounds sweeter through the echoplex
It'll spin you around and throw you in a hex
Until you feel no pain inside your brain
All your worries are soothed by the sound effects

You read it in the Post and the Daily News
Listen everybody lets show improve
Don't let me begin about heroin
Living six feet deep just ain't the move

We're giving you soul power
I like it sweet and sour
When it comes to rhymes and beat designs
I'm at the control tower

Tell me what makes you so afraid
Of all these people you say you hate
Just give it one time for your mind
And let's try to negotiate
C'mon, let's try to negotiate
Let's try to negotiate

"Bet you're wondering what's been going on
Bet you think I've almost lost my mind
Bet you think I've almost lost my mind"

[Intro]
Saklig
Ahh, yeah

[Chorus]
B-Boys makin' with the freak freak
B-Boys makin' with the freak freak (oh-oh)
B-Boys makin' with the freak freak (somethin' brand new for you)
B-Boys makin' with the freak freak

[Verse 1]
Yeah, yeah
Puttin' songs together ain't no puzzle like Yahtzee
Sending this one out to K-Rob and Rammellzee
Well, let me introduce myself on this cut (Woo)
I'm Ad-Rock, I'm lit like a motherfuck
Well, I'm brewing up rhymes like I was using a still
Kickin' it old school flow like Mike McGill
Cause Yauch's on the upright, the shit just ain't funny
Got fat bass lines like Russell Simmons steals money
Got clientele, you know I rock well
And then you're on my dick because I'm DFL
Yeah, Mike, 'cause playing the bass is my favorite shit
I might be a hack on the stand up but I'm working at it
I got my hair cut correct like Anthony Mason
Then I ride the IRT right up to Penn Station (Yeah, huh)
Penn Station, up on 8th Ave
Listen all y'all, you get the ball back
He's got the Savior Faire because he's debonair
Well, Mike D with the vinyl, with the grooves so rare
And the rhymes that we're kickin' are doo-doo

[Chorus]
B-Boys makin' with the freak freak
B-Boys makin' with the freak freak
B-Boys makin' with the freak freak
Shit, if this is gonna be that kind of party, I'm gonna stick my dick in the mashed potatoes
B-Boys makin' with the freak freak

[Verse 2]
Been makin' with the freak freak, so unique
I been learning from the elders, now it's time to speak
Oh, that shit sounds nice
Mike D, come on and get it on, y'all
Talking shit about a mile a minute
Put the wax on the table and let the DJ spin it
Well, excuse me, motherfuckers, can I beg your pardon?
I'm gonna see the Knicks at the Madison Square Garden
And like the Knicks, I got game like I worked at Hasbro
On the mic I bug, like I was Prince Jazzbo
Well, the rhymes are stupid to make you go cuckoo
You can't sleep cause you're little Cindy Lou Who
Down with the Hurra since the Raising Hell Tour
Just listen to his cuts, there's no reason to tell more
Cindy what? I didn't catch the last one
That shit sounded kinda nice, but bust a fast one
Well, I'm not known for my speed raps
So grab the microphone and cut out the claps
Ah, yeah, I like that, shit is kind of rough
I'll grab the microphone and fuck it up
(Aight, woo!)

[Verse 3]
Well, I might seem out there, just a little deranged
I've got to cool off, catch me on the driving range
Well I'm the ladies' choice like I was JJ Evans
Legalize the weed and I'll say, Thank heavens!
I'm talking PGA Pro Tour 2
I'm Doctor Beepers on the tv, in my golfing shoes
Pass me an iron and I'll bust a chip shot
Then you throw me off the green because I'm strictly hip-hop
I'll grab the tee, I'll tee off
I'll grab the golf clubs and I'm off, I'm Audi, so check me
I've got the timbos on my toes when I'm not on the green
I've got the custom made boots with the spikey things
I'm working on my driving cause I'm going pro
I've got the funky fly golf gear from head to toe
Yeah, the B-Boys makin' with the freak freak 'cause it's unique unique
Mario's calling Nonni's about the pesto pizza
And then he's on a mission and he's checking for peacha

[Chorus]
B-Boys makin' with the freak freak
B-Boys makin' with the freak freak
B-Boys makin' with the freak freak
B-Boys makin' with the freak freak

[Intro]
Hey, yo, Adam what's up? This is Mix Master Mike. I'm calling from Sacramento. Umm, I've been wanting to hook up with you maybe on some tracks. I've got some shit right here. If you could...
I set my turntable to a wah wah pedal. It's called the tweak scratch

Cause nobody can do it like Mix Master can

[Ad-Rock]
Come on now
I've got the D double-O D double-O style
Here we go again because it's been a while
Do me a favor, don't touch that dial
I rock from Manhattan to the Miracle Mile

[Mike D]
My name is Mike D, and I'm the ladies choice
You'll wanna get next to me in Rose Royce (Royce)
Y'all gather round to hear my golden voice
Cause when its time to rhyme, you know I get noice (voice)

[MCA]
He's cruising like a fan boat on the glade
He'll tweak your ass across the cross fade
So watch your back when he takes the stage (stage) (woo!)
Or he'll send you off on a naked rampage

[Chorus]
Three MC's and one DJ
We be getting down with no delay
Mix Master Mike, what'cha got to say?
("Bug out!" "To!" "The mic" "All the time!")

[Mike D]
Sweet and sour like a tangerine
Fresh like a box of Krispy Kreme
Kenny Rogers' "Gambler" is my gambling theme
Mix Master Mike with the scratch routine

[MCA]
Always up in in it and in the know (know)
You know we break it down going toe to toe
The bass is booming from down below
Ed Norton is chillin with Mario (woo-wee!)

[Adrock]
Well, my name is Adrock, I'm a Scorpio
Don't ask me cause I just don't know
I'm known to mop, I'm known to glow (glow)
But don't get mad when we gots to go

[Chorus]
Three MCs and one DJ
We be getting down with no delay
Mix Master Mike, what'cha got to say?
("Gotta, gotta," "Gotta get down!")
Mix Master, cut faster
Mix Master, cut-cut, cut faster!

[MCA]
All top secret and classified ('fied)
I grab a hold of a mic and let the words glide
It's all hypnotic and sanctified (woo-wee!)
I never wanna let a bad day slip by

[Ad-Rock]
Now we be getting stupid in your area (huh?)
Causing all kinds of hysteria ('steria)
My beats is sick like malaria
But don't worry, I'll take care of ya

[Mike D]
Me and Adam, Adam, and Mario C
In the studio with the place to be
To all the party people who are happy and free (free)
With Mix Master Mike, we're making history

[Chorus]
Three MC's and one DJ
We be getting down with no delay
Mix Master Mike, what'cha got to say?
("God damn, that DJ made my day")

[Outro]
("You came off with that one, Joe
Oh, my goodness")

[MCA]

As I develop the awakening mind
I praise the Buddhas as they shine
I bow before you as I travel my path
To join your ranks, I make my full-time task
For the sake of all beings I seek
The enlightened mind that I know I'll reap
Respect to Shantideva and all the others
Who brought down the Dharma for the sisters and brothers
I give thanks for this world as a place to learn
And for this human body that I know I've earned
And my deepest thanks to all sentient beings
For without them, there would be no place to learn what I'm seeing
There's nothing here that's not been said before
But I put it down now so that I'll be sure
To solidify my own views
And I'll be glad if it helps anyone else out too

If others disrespect me or give me flak
I'll stop and think before I react
Knowing that they're going through insecure stages
I'll take the opportunity to exercise patience
I'll see it as a chance to help the other person
Nip it in the bud before it can worsen
A chance for me to be strong and sure
As I think on the Buddhas who have come before
As I praise and respect the good they've done
Knowing love can conquer hate in every situation
We need other people in order to create
The circumstances for the learning that we're here to generate
Situations that bring up our deepest fears
So we can work to release them until they're cleared
Therefore it only makes sense
To thank our enemies despite their intent
The Bodhisattva path is one of power and strength
A strength from within to go the length
Seeing others are as important as myself
I strive for a happiness of mental wealth
With the interconnectedness that we share as one
Every action that we take affects everyone
So in deciding for what a situation calls
There is a path for the good for all
I try to make my every action for that highest good
With the altruistic wish to achieve Buddhahood
So I pledge here before everyone who's listening
To try to make my every action for the good of all beings
For the rest of my lifetimes and even beyond
I vow to do my best, to do no harm
And in times of doubt, I can think on the Dharma
And the Enlightened Ones who've graduated Samsara

[Biz Markie]

Do it, ahh, let's do it
Ahh, let's do it, ahh, let's do it
Ahh, let's do it, ahh, let's do it
Ahh, let's do it with the disco fluid

[Mike D]

Well, Like the blackbyrds I'm a do it fluid
Building rhymes like buildings, like a stonehenge druid
Step up and get enlightened, educating my mind
I play the tape forward, it's not time to rewind

[MCA]

Step inside the motherfucker and I get my flow on
Amalgamating styles so I've got something to grow on
Seasons change when it comes their time
Fall brings the winter (yeah) and on back to springtime

[Ad-Rock]

Well, it's the King Ad-Rock and that's who I am
Listen all of y'all I'm not the Son of Sam
Cause I'm thin and I don't grin
But check it out people cause I loves to go and swim

[Mike D]

Caught up on the phone, fiber optic distraction
Information super highway got the brain contraction
I'm the Kung Fu master vs. The Sumo wrestler
Got the beats in Manhattan you can hear in Westchester

[MCA]

Well, my mother was born out in Coney Island
Raised on the LES, Manhattan Island
My dad came out from Detroit and they had me
And then back through Ellis Island goes (yeah) the family tree

[Ad-Rock]

Well, I'm a six point seven on the Richter Scale
I've got rhymes gallore and then I never fail
Like gravy to potatoes, Luke to Darth Vader(s)
I'm a souped-up sucker and I'll see you all later

[Biz Markie]

Let's do it, ahh, let's do it
Ahh, let's do it, do it, do it, do it
Ahh, let's do it, ahh, let's do it
Ahh, let's do it, do it, do it, do it

[Mike D]

You see me comin' down the block with the funky cuts
You say, ("Hey, Mike D") and I say, "Mic deez nuts"
I've got attractions like I'm Elvis Costello
Adam Yauch you grab the mic cause you know you're my mellow

[MCA]

Well, when I get it into the zone
I'm gonna take it to a place where I'm all alone
Well when I got my shit ah-with my rhyme style's kicking
My brain is flowing honest like Abe Lincoln

[Ad-Rock]

Cause I'm the fuckin' rhythm ace with the rhyme selection
Listen all y'all, I rap with perfection
Because I got the motherfuckin' old school flavor
That you savor, so watch your behavior

[Mike D]

Talking other dimensions, levels higher
Why did Billy Joel say, "We Didn't Start the Fire"
Take you to another realm, ugh, another level
I've got the funky rhymes but I'm not the funky devil

[MCA]

I step from minute to minute, lifetime to lifetime
Step from stage to stage to see it all unwind
Slowly but surely I seek to find my mind
And every wall that I face is of my own design

[Ad-Rock]

YEAH Glendale Boulevard... ah boulevard
Glendale Boulevard is where I'm at
It's where I'm at, where I live
Check it Check it out cause my head is like a sieve
And yo we turn it out

[Biz Markie]

Do it, let's do it
With your mind, put your body into it
Let's do it, let's do it
With your mind, put your body into it
Let's do it, let's do it
With your mind, put your body into it
Let's do it

A'ight! We got the funk
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
We got the funk
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
What the, we got the f-f-funk
Rrrrr!!

We got the funk
We got the funk
Here's a little diddy about a good guy I know
He's named the Heart Attack Man
And you know, he weighs in pretty hefty
My man's like two hundred seventy...
(Laughing)
How much he weigh?
(Laughing)
He's like the guy in the Hefty bag commerical

Okay, okay, let's take it from here

Drink a six pack and then you play some ball
Walking down the stairs and then he starts to fall
Add on two joints and he starts to sweat
Two hundred seventy-five pounds that you can't forget

Cause he's a...
Heart Attack, Heart Attack Man
Spend all your money on your health insurance plan
Heart Attack, Heart Attack Man
Keep on getting bigger because you know that he can
Why do you force yourself on top of that girl?
Laugh with all your buddies because it's a man's man's world
Someday, that shit will come back to you
Throwing your weight around and that shit is through

Heart Attack, Heart Attack Man
Going nowhere, and got no master plan
Heart Attack, Heart Attack Man

Weighs in at two seventy-five
(Step back, step back, or catch a heart attack)
Yeah, my man is lucky to be alive
(Step back, step back, or catch a heart attack)
Smokin' and drinkin’, too
(Step back, step back, or catch a heart attack)
My man, the Heart Attack Man, is gonna be running over you
(Step back, step back, or catch a heart attack)
Got no goddamn respect
(Step back, step back, or catch a heart attack)
Yeah, you'd better put your big, big bitch ass in check
(Step back, step back, or catch a heart attack)

Heart Attack, Heart Attack Man
Lungs full of tar And a stomach full of Spam
Heart Attack, Heart Attack Man
Time to change your ways, Heart Attack Man
Oh, what do we know about partying or anything else?

[Intro]
That's a record
Uhhhh...
Huh
Yeah

[Chorus]
I kick it root down, I put my root down
I kick it root down, I put my root down
So how we gonna kick it? Gonna kick it root down
Yeah, how you wanna kick it? Gonna kick it root down
So how you gonna kick it? Gonna kick it root down
Gonna break it on down, gonna kick it root down

[Verse 1]
It's not a put down, I put my foot down
And then I make some love, I put my root down
I’m like "Sweetie Pie" by the Stone Alliance
Everybody know I'm known for dropping science
‘Cause I'm electric like Dick Hyman
I guess you'd expect to catch the crew rhymin'
Never let you down with the stereo sound
So, Mike, get on the mic and turn it out (Mike D)

[Verse 2]
We're talking root down, I put my boot down (Boot down)
And if you want to battle me, you're putting loot down (Loot down)
I said it’s root down, it's time to scoot down (Scoot down)
I'm-a step up to the mic in my goose down (Goose down)
Come up representing from the upper west
Moneymakin' putting me to the test
Sometimes I feel as though I've been blessed
Because I'm doing what I want so I never rest (yeah, Mike it, Mike it)

[Verse 3]
Well, I'm not coming out goofy like the fruit of the loom guys
Just strutting like The Meters with the “Look-ka Py Py"
Cause downtown Brooklyn is where I was born
But when the snow is fallin’, then I am gone (oh weee)
You might think that I'm a fanatic
A phone call from Utah and I'm throwing a panic
So break it to the root when we kick it on down
Jimmy Smith is my man, I want to give him a pound

[Chorus]
I kick it root down, I put my root down
I kick it root down, I put my root down
So how you wanna kick it? Gonna kick it root down
'Cause how we gonna kick it? Gonna kick it root down
So how we gonna kick it? Gonna kick it root down
Gonna break it on down, gonna kick it root down (Yeah)

[Verse 4]
Well, Ad-Rock (Huh), don't stop, come on
Just get on the mic with the tic and the toc
I'll fill you to the fuckin' rim like brim
I'm walking down your block and you say, "That's him
There goes the guy with the funky sound"
The Beatsie Boys, you know we come to get down
Because I've got the flow where I grab my dick
And say “Oh my god, that's the funky shit!"
So I’ma pass the mic and cause a panic (yeah)
The original nasal kid is doing damage

[Verse 5]
Every morning I took the train to High Street Station
Doing homework on the train, what a fucked up situation
On the way back up, hearing battle tapes
Through the underground, underneath the sky scrapes
It's like Harlem World Battles on the Zulu Beat Show
It's Kool Moe Dee vs. Busy Bee, there's one you should know, (yeah)
Enough of that, I just want to give some respect due
MCA, grab the mic and Ma Bell will connect you

[Verse 6]
Bob Marley was a prophet for the freedom fight
"If dancin' prays to the lord then I will feel alright"
I'm feelin' good to play a little music (music)
Tears running down my face 'cause I love to do it (love to do it)
And no one can stop this flow from flowing on
A flow master of disaster with a sound that's gone (yeah)
I'll give a little shout out to my dad and mom (yeah)
For bringing me into this world and so on

[Chorus]
I kick it root down, I put my root down
I kick it root down, I put my root down
Yeah, so how we gonna kick it? Gonna kick it root down
Yeah, how you wanna kick it? Gonna kick it root down
So how we gonna rock it? Gonna rock it root down
Break it on down, gonna kick it root down
Yeah, that shit's on down

[Outro]
And that's a record, that's a record cause of Mario
And that's a record, that's a record cause of Mario
And that's a record, that's a record to Mario
Aww, now that's a record, buddy

[Intro]
Alright, you're scratching it right now
Cuttin' the record back and forth against the needle
Back and forth, back and forth, makin' it scratch
But let me tell you something
Don't try it at home with your dad's stereo
Only under hip-hop supervision, alright?

[Chorus]
Alright, hear this
So you wanna be the emcee, huh?
Alright, hear this
So you wanna be the emcee, huh?

[Verse1 ]
Because I grab the microphone and I pick it up
And then I fuck it up and then I turn it in
And then I turn it out, got the body rockin' sound
And then you know I’m gonna get down
Eat a Scooby snack and take disco nap
Because I’m shopping at Sears, cause I don't buy at the Gap
Sending this one out to all the funky inspirations
Pretty Purdie on the drums with the beat relations (Yeah, yeah)
Well, I’m working on rhymes, they're coming line by line
Trying to put what I feel into word and rhymes
I've got a feeling coming on, I’ve got to make some shit
A little something stupid, for the twisted and sick
Because I drive like a maniac on the streets
And I don't give a fuck cause I’ve got the beats
Got my nuts swingin' from left to right and
Right to left and I’m death defying

[Chorus]
Alright, hear this
So you wanna be the emcee, huh?
Alright, hear this
So you wanna be the emcee, huh?

[Verse 2]
I spin my fortune on a wheel like Sajak
Here's "The Payback;" Keep going strong, like since the way-back
I try to be myself but I lose track
Because the shit gets complicated, now I’ve got to get back
As we learn to breed love for one another
In these times of melding cultures
I give respect for what's been borrowed and lent
I know this music comes down from African descent
Because I don't need a magic potion
Let me talk about backfield in motion
My girls got cheeks for weeks and I’m happy
You know I’m a sneak like my old grand pappy
Well I gotta give thanks to my man, Archie Shepp
For staying true to inspiration and I don't half step
So I kick out the jams and tell you who I am
And I talk to the people like Les McCann

[Chorus]
Alright, hear this
So you wanna be the emcee, huh?
Alright, hear this
So you wanna be the emcee, huh?

[Break]
Alright, hear this
(...)
Alright, hear this

[Verse 3]
I ask God for a rhyme or two
A little somethin' for the wise as well as the fool
A little somethin' to effect a little taste of change
For the together and strong as well as the deranged
I'll do you right like Bobby Knight
And then I’m rappin’ on the mic to the Broadway light
Stomp my hands, I clap my feet and
I'm buggin' off Yusef Lateef
I got a match to my ass and I’ma keep it lit
And well I need to get some cash, call my accountant Britt
I'm rushin' around town takin' care of my functions
Always got one more thing so forget about function
We create this world and the problems go on
Create our lives and the things that go wrong
So to the deaf, the blind look around and listen
To what it is you want and for what you're wishin'

[Chorus]
Alright, hear this (Yeah)
So you wanna be the emcee, huh?
Alright, hear this
So you wanna be the emcee, huh?
Alright, hear this

[Intro]
Children of the earth!

[Verse 1: MCA]
Well, I can hear the trumpets blowing, screaming out the end of time
Look around and listen, and you'll see every sign
The waters are polluted as the forests are cut down
Bombing and drilling deep below the ground
Check the prophecies from around the world
And look around now as it all unfurls
Look into yourself and see what goes on
Get a feeling in your heart of the right from the wrong
Because the Mother Earth needs to be respected
Been far too long that she's been neglected
Race against race, such a foolish waste
It's like cuttin' off your nose to spite your face
And at the end of the wars, what was the cost?
Well, it's clear that the Earth was the one who lost
We are one with her, as she is one with us
It's unreal how she is treated so unjust
As our planet grows smaller each and every day
Everyone affecting everyone in every way
We're all citizens of the world community
All here together and we're searching for unity
Over the years I've grown and changed so much
Things I know now, years ago I couldn't touch
There are things I've done that I wouldn't do again
But I'm glad that I did cause I learned from them
I just try to stay present, right here, right now
No worries, no fears, and without any doubts

[Refrain: MCA]
Well, it's about time, it's about time
It's about time, it's about time, it's about time

[Verse 2: MCA]
'Cause in these times, these changing times
A transition is occurring, and I am not blind
As the pendulum swings, a new age we enter
And with every swing, it draws closer to the center
Yes, the storm before the calm and the wars that lead to love
Things must run their course, so we push and we shove
But we're here to work it out, in one way or another
To find a mutual respect for ourselves and one another
But the true key is a trust in self
For when I trust myself, I fear no one else
I took control of my life just as anyone can
I want everyone to see it's in the palm of your hand
The past is gone, the future yet unborn
But right here and now is where it all goes on
I know we can fix it and it's not too late
I give respect to King and his nonviolent ways
I dream and I hope and I won't forget
Someday I'm going to visit on a free Tibet
Someday I'm going to see us all joined as one
And it would be too bad to blow it up before we're done
'Cause we long behind the rage, learning from the pain
The love behind the tension like the sun behind the rain
I'm sending loving light to all that is
To all creation and the life we live
I'm not preaching bullshit, just speaking my mind
'Cause I'm here now and it's about time

[Refrain: MCA]
Well, it's about time, it's about time
It's about time, it's about time, it's about time
It's like that y'all and ya don't quit
It's like that y'all and ya don't quit
It's like that y'all and ya don't quit
It's like that y'all and ya don't quit

Like Frankenstein or Count Dracula
I grab the mic and then I fuck it up
I never settle for less and that's a fact
I'm lettin' you know we not the wack wack
Been nice and all that, c'mon and I'm a keep goin' yup
Bound to make money off the shit that I'm growing
Like that y'all and you don't quit
Keep it on y'all rock the sure shit
I put the pen to the paper and I went off
I'm dropping knowledge and wisdom like a mad head dog
Step into the function cause I'm representing
Lyrics on the brain and they sit fermenting
I try to go and learn the give and the go
Free up my mind let loose with the lyric flow
Trying to get Frank get back, get back, right
Trying to stay positive and feeling alright
It's like that y'all and ya don't quit

"Keep goin' on and on and on and on and on"

So pass the pen and then pass the pad
Like DJ Run there was nothin' ever like the
The sex rhyme kid is back in the panic
Gonna drop the ball on my damn mechanic whoo
Fuckin' up my Nova, naw fuckin' up my life, shit
Fuckin' with my world, cause he's fuckin' with the pipe, aw damn
Like the saying goes, you gotta call and duke it off
Ask Juanito, he'll tell you all about it

Gettin' blind in the mind, two hits and a cough
Put my pager on vibrate, and jerk myself off
Weight on my shoulders and now I'm stressin'
Gotta get back and count my blessings
Stuck on my cellular, I can't get off
This ride is in motion and I can't get let off
Get my penis double clepped and my balls rotated (what?)..
Realized I was trying to get my brain notated

It's like that y'all and ya don't quit
It's like that y'all and ya don't quit
It's like that y'all and ya don't quit
It's like that y'all and ya don't quit
I don't get blind, I don't drink wine
I took A sledge hammer and I broke my nine
Because my life is mine, word is bond I rhyme
And every day I write the book down line by line
I'm feeling good when I do it like this
So come on and turn it up because you can't resist

Because I'm back with another track in which you lack
Cause things is wack and that's a fact
Because I'm on time, you're shouting rewind
You know it's Adrock that's blowing your mind
My shit is rough and you know it is so damn tough

I'm getting intense, not talking nonsense
I made up my mind, not sitting on the fence
I don't always know the right from the wrong
Do my best to figure it out and work it out in the long
I try to do a lot, more than I can chew
I balance out my ambitions what I got to do

Check it, better believe it y'all
Check it, better believe it y'all
This is rough and tough
Cause you hide in broad day light, a parasite
A hypocrite, you take a peek quick
You turn your nose up (what), you think you're high up (uh)
You play it real safe and now your shit's fake
I seen you hawking and then you clock my style
And then you try to play it off like you think you're wild

D.I.Y., that means do it yourself
I don't sit around waitin' for someone's help
I don't sit back and say "Good enough"
I keep on striving, reinventing, keepin' it off the cuff
So I kick the level up cuhootnified
Mackadocius vibes, positively fortified

I'm throwing rhymes down, kickin' them downtown
Traveling high speed through the underground
I kick it freestyle, make it worth your while
I've got shelves of rhymes that I keep on file
I'm feeling good now, back home again
Well, New York City is the city that I feel at home in (woo)
A blast from the Grasshoff, awhile it's been
Stepping into the future again (yeah)

Uh, and now I'm straight from 88
To 93 to 94, I'm out the door
Step into the party with the Fila fresh gear
People looking at me like I was David Koresh here

Kicking rhymes from the heart cause that's where I'm at
Fuck the bullshit, be it far from me to pop that

In the search for truth, I go a lot of ways
There's not a lot of peace that I find these days
I try to stay cool, I try to stay calm
But my life is getting hectic like a smoke bomb
So I'll say it like the group Huggy Bear
There's a boy-girl revolution of which you should be aware

You can't dis me, it ain't worth it, B
You put yourself down and you don't even see
Cause I don't play that, I know who I am
For a minute I did but now I'm back again
I'm feeling strong, see, trust myself, G
Well, I stopped smoking cheeba and that was part of the key

We, we, we've got fire, we need water
There ain't no water, so I guess I ought to
Leave you broke in a comatose state of mind
And I'm blind and I'm working overtime, so check it
I keep my rhymes in my little black book
And I know you wanna take another look
*This is rough and tough*
Yea...
You're coming off like you're van Damme
You've got Kenny G, in your Trans Am
You've got names like Billy Ray
Now you sing Hip Hop Hooray
Put your Oakleys and your stone wash on
Watching MTV and you mosh on
#1 on the side and don't touch the back
#6 on the top and don't cut it wack, Jack

Mullet head

Cut the Sides, Don't Touch The Back
Cut the Sides, Don't Touch The Back
Cut the Sides, Don't Touch The Back
Cut the Sides, Don't Touch The Back

Shiny chrome rims, never rusted
Driving through the tunnel, you might get busted
Never trusted, Mullet head
You know you took that girl to bed
Cruising 8th Street, Saturday night
Trying to find a head shop, looking to fight
You've got that stonewash derriere
Spike the top because the weekend is here
You wanna know what's a mullet? well
I got a little story to tell
About a hair style, that's way of life
Have you ever seen a Mullet wife?

Yo, take a chill, B, check out my Spillbee
Cause you don't know about the Mullet head
Cruise in my IROC, stonewash on my cock
Got it like that cause I'm the Mullet head
Put me on trial cause I'm worth your while
Pass me the comb cause I'm the Mullet man

Got the New York Post, read a story
About Joey Buttafuoco in all his glory
They said he tried to freak it with a high school girl
Pimpin' Amy Fisher to the rest of the world
A real lover man, a real Casanova
Joey got horny and now he's over
Amy got pissed, shot his wife
Joey goes to jail for the rest of his life

Cut the sides, and don't touch the back
The back, the back...
I kick out the jams and tell you who I am
I'll make you shake your ass like Les MaCann (yeah)
And then you're out talking shit like Yosemite Sam
You've got the elephant feet like Les McCann

Up the crack of dawn, I'm on my way
We're talking two foot dump and there'll be no delay
Cause I'm gone, the shit's getting out of hand
I'm changing my middle name to first Trem

I'm walking on the rhythm like Philippe Petite
I've got holes in my mouth where my teeth should be
You ask, Whatever happenened to the rappin' duke?
I heard the Captain's gonna sign him to Jive and that's the truth

Taking care of my functions, still smokin' up the shrubery
I stopped eating chicken cause the shit was too rubbery
My produce, organic, from my own yard
Only the freshest herbs and growing's not too hard

Vibes, vibrations
Vibes, vibrations
Dreaming on it, screaming on it, ready to get dumb
Waking up my long joint, ready to get some
Looking at my board and my old boots
Seeing a waist deep champagne moment of truth

And on the court I've got game like my brother Matt
I give a shout out -- so where you at?
But don't get souped, Matthew, cause I'm-a take ya
Horatio Park right now and I'm-a shake ya

Give me the fresh count, you know that I'm stressed out
I need some inspiration, so get the best out
Like Rock Master Scott, I'm on the request line
Writing the fresh rhyme, having the best time

Good vibes flowing all around
Not a worry in mind as the friends around
A shout out to Linda, riding pow forever
Well the 'Bird is the word and you're as light as a feather'

Well I smoke a bag of rat weed cause I don't care
And I'm waxing old ladies out of their underwears
I like the boomin' grannies in big old panties
I'm giving it to grandma, making her crazy

I might be a white boy, but I'm no goofy
Got beats like Babalu on "I Love Lucy"
I'm not like the Skipper on "Fantasy Island"
I'm more like Captain Stubing when I go buck whylin'
The Cire Traverse out to Death shoot
Or STH when they let me back at the Deuce
Cause I can't get enough of that funky stuff
When the going gets rough, ain't going out in the sluff

Down with Bubble Gum and the Ninth Creation
You get on down, we've got the sound sensation
Kid Fresh is back from the eighties
And we're doing it for the ladies

Vibes, vibrations
Vibes, vibrations

We got Vibes, vibrations
We got Vibes, vibrations
Vi...vi...

[Hook]
Brass Monkey - that funky monkey
Brass Monkey junkie
That funky monkey
Brass

[Verse 1]
Got this dance that's more than real
Drink Brass Monkey, here's how you feel
You put your left leg down, your right leg up
Tilt your head back, let's finish the cup
M.C.A. with the bottle, D. rocks the can
Ad-Rock gets nice with Charlie Chan
We're offered Moët, we don't mind Chivas
Wherever we go, we bring the Monkey with us
Ad-Rock drinks three, Mike D. is D
Double R foots the bill most definitely
I drink Brass Monkey, and I rock well
I got a castle in Brooklyn, that's where I dwell

[Hook]
Brass Monkey- that funky monkey
Brass Monkey junkie
That funky Monkey
Brass

[Verse 2]
Because
'Cause I drink it anytime and any place
When it's time to get ill - I pour it on my face
Monkey tastes def when you pour it on ice
Come on, y'all, it's time to get nice
Coolin' by the lockers, getting kind of funky
Me and the crew, we're drinking Brass Monkey
This girl walked by, she gave me the eye
I reached in the locker, grabbed the spanish fly
I put it in the Monkey, mixed it in a cup
Went over to the girl, "Yo baby, what's up?"
I offered her a sip-sip, the girl, she gave me lip-lip
It did begin, the stuff wore in, and now she's on my tip

[Hook]
Brass Monkey - that funky monkey
Brass Monkey junkie
That funky monkey
Brass

[Verse 3]
Step up to the bar, put the girl down
She takes a big gulp and slaps it around
You take a sip, you can do it, you get right to it
We had a case in the place, and we went right through it
You got a dry martini, you thinking you're cool
I'll take your place at the bar, I smack you off your stool
I'll down a 40 dog in a single gulp
And if you got beef, you'll get beat to a pulp
Monkey and parties and reelin' and rockin'
Def-def girls-girls, all y'all jockin'
The song and dance keeping you in a trance
If you don't buy my record, I got my advance
I drink it, I think it, I see it, I be it
I love Brass Monkey but I don't give D it
We got the bottle, you got the cup
Come on, everybody, let's get ffffff--

[Hook]
Brass Monkey - that funky monkey
Brass Monkey junkie
That funky monkey
Brass Monkey - that funky monkey
Brass Monkey junkie
That funky monkey
Brass Monkey
Well, this girl came up to me - she says she's new in town
But the crew been said they seen her around
I thought they were right, but I didn't want to know
The girlie was def, and she wanted to go
I think her name is Lucy, but they all call her Loose
I think I thought I seen her on Eighth and Forty-deuce
The next thing she said was, "My place or yours?
Let's kick some bass behind closed doors!"
We got into the cab - the cab driver said
He recognized my girlie from the back of her head
He said a little something about tip to base
So I made him stop the cab to get out of the place
Should've looked back, man, I'll always regret it
Something's going on, and I'll probably never get it
She was crying like a baby - stupid dumb
It's just too bad that girl's a bum

She's crafty, she gets around
She's crafty, she's always down
She's crafty, you know, she's got a gripe
She's crafty, and she's just my type
(She's crafty)
I spent my last dollar to buy a Sabrett
When I seen this girl I could never forget
Now, I like nothing better than a pretty girl's smile
And I haven't seen a smile that pretty in a while
The girl came up to me, she said she loved the show
I asked her to come home, and she couldn't say no
We got to the crib - there's Adam and D
We didn't say a word - they just stared at me
I said, "I don't know her - I just met her tonight."
And Ad-Rock started hiding everything in sight
D pulled me over - said, "Hide your gold
The girl is crafty like ice is cold"
The girl is crafty - she knows all the moves
I started playing records - she knew all the grooves
He thought she was a thief - and D was right
But I just figured she'd spend the night
When I woke up late in the afternoon
She had taken all the things from inside his room
I found myself naked in the middle of the floor
She had taken the bed and the chest of drawers
The mirror, the TV, the new guitar cord
My remote control and my old skateboard
She robbed us blind - she took all we owned
And the boys blamed me for bringing her home

She's crafty, she gets around
She's crafty, she's always down
She's crafty, she's got a gripe
She's crafty, and she's just my type
(She's crafty)
Aw, yeah

She's crafty, she gets around
She's crafty, she's always down
She's crafty, she's got a gripe
She's crafty, and she's just my type

She's crafty, she gets around
She's crafty, she's always down
She's crafty, she's got a gripe
She's crafty, and she's just my type
She's crafty
Hold it now, hit it
Yo, Leroy!
Ahh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Why don't you hook up that def jam right about now?

Now I chill real ill when I start to chill
When I fill my pockets with a knot of dollar bills
Sipping pints of ale out the window sill
When I get my fill, I'm chilly-chill
Now, I just got home because I'm out on bail
What's the time? It's time to buy ale
Peter eater, parking meter, all of the time
If I run out of ale, it's Thunderbird wine
Miller-drinking, chicken-eating, dress so fly
I got friends in high places that are keeping me high
Get down with Mike D, and it ain't no hassle
I got the ladies of the eighties from here to White Castle...

Hold it now, hit it
Yo, Leroy!
It's my drum, it's my, hold it now, it's my rhyme
And now it's me, Adam Yauch, in the place to be
All the girls are on me 'cause I'm down with Mike D
I'm down with Mike D, and it ain't no baloney
For real, not phony, O.E. and Rice-a-Roni
I come out at night 'cause I sleep all day
Well, I'm the King Ad-Rock, and he's MCA
Well, I'm cruisin', I'm bruisin', I'm never ever losing
I'm in my car, I'm going far, and dust is what I'm using
Around the way is where I'm from
And I'm from Manhattan, and I'm not a bum
Because you're pud-slapping, ball-flapping, got that juice
My name's Mike D, and I can do that Jerry Lewis

Hold it now, hit it
Yo, Leroy!
Yo, that was real def, man, try that again, man
I like that def stuff, boy

Hip-hoppin', body rockin', doin' the do
Beer drinking, breath stinking, sniffing glue
Belly fillin', always illin', bustin' caps
My name's Mike D, and I write my own snaps
I'm a-peep-show seeking on the Forty-Deuce
I'm a killer at large, and I'm on the loose
Pistol packing, Monkey drinking, no money bum
I come from Brooklyn 'cause that's where I'm from
Cheap-skatin', perpetrating, money-hungry jerk
Every day I drink O.E., and I don't go to work
You drippy-nose knucklehead, you're wet behind the ears
You like men, and we like beer
Hold it now, hit it
Yo, Leroy!
Bust that choco-lotto
What, huh, yo, man, pass that over here, man, all right

King of the Ave with the Def female
You're rhymin' and stealin' with the freshest ale
Kid cooling at the crib watching my TV
Ed Norton - Ted Knight - and Mr. E-D
Pump it up, homeboy, just don't stop
Chef Boyardee, cooling on the pot
I take no slack, 'cause I got the knack
I'm never dusting out 'cause I tossed that crack
The King Ad-Rock — that is my name
Y'all drinking Moet, and we got the champagne
A quarter droppin', going shoppin', buyin' wigs
Surgeon general, cut professor, DJ Thigs

Hold it now, hit it
Hit it
Hold it now, hit it
Yo, Leroy!

Girls – all I really want is girls
And in the morning it's girls
'Cause in the evening it's girls

I like the way that they walk
And it's chill to hear them talk
And I can always make 'em smile
From White Castle to the Nile

Back in the day
There was this girl around the way
She liked my home-piece MCA
He said he would not give her play
I asked him, "Please?" – he said, "You may."
Her pants were tight, and that's ok
If she would dance, I would DJ
We took a walk down to the bay

I hope she'll say
"Hey, me and you should hit the hay!"
I asked her out, she said "No way!"
I should've probably guessed her gay
So I broke north with no delay
I heard she moved real far away
That was two years ago this May
I seen her just the other day
Jackin' Mike D. to my dismay
Girls – to do the dishes
Girls – to clean up my room
Girls – to do the laundry
Girls – and in the bathroom
Girls – that's all I really want is girls
Two at a time – I want girls
With new-wave hairdos – I want girls
I ought to whip out my – girls, girls, girls, girls, girls....!

[Intro: Ad-Rock]
And on the cool check-in
Centerstage on the mic
And we puttin' it on wax;
It's the new style

[Verse 1: MCA + Ad-Rock + Mike D]
Four and three and two and one (What up?)
And when I'm on the mic—the suckers run (Word!)
Down with Ad-Rock and Mike D, and you ain't
And I got more juice than Picasso got paint
Got rhymes that are rough and rhymes that are slick
I'm not surprised you're on my dick (Mike D!)
B-E-A-S-T-I-E
What up, Mike D?
Aw—yeah—that's me
I got franks and pork and beans
Always bust the new routines
I get it, I got it—I know it's good
The rhymes I write—you wish you would
I'm never in training, my voice is not straining
People always biting, and I'm sick of complaining
So I went into the locker room during classes
Went into your locker, and I smashed your glasses
You're from Secaucus—I'm from Manhattan
You're jealous of me because your girlfriend is cattin'

[Chorus: Sample + Beastie Boys]
("There it is")
Kick it!

[Verse 2: MCA + Ad-Rock + Mike D]
Father to many—married to none
And in case you're unaware: I carry a gun (Word)
Stepped into the party—the place was over-packed
Saw the kid that dissed my homeboy, shot him in the back
Man, I had to get a beeper 'cause my phone is tapped
You better keep your mouth shut 'cause I'm fully strapped
I got money in the bank—I can still get high
That's why your girlfriend thinks that I'm so fly
I've got money and juice—twin sisters in my bed
Their father had envy, so I shot him in the head
If I played guitar, I'd be Jimmy Page
The girlies I like are underage (Shh! Check it)
Girls with boyfriends are the kinds I like
I'll steal your honey like I stole your bike
My father—he's jealous 'cause I'm making that green (What up?)
I've got a list of girlies' numbers from the places I've been

[Chorus: Sample + Beastie Boys]
("There it is")
Kick it!

[Verse 3: MCA + Ad-Rock + Mike D + Beastie Boys]
You wanna know why? Because I'm—
October 31st, that is my date of birth
I got to the party, you know what I did? The Smurf!
Taxin' all the females, from coast to coast
And when I get my fill, I'm chilly most
We ragtag girlies back at the hotel
And then we all switch places when I ring the bell
I chill at White Castle 'cause it's the best
But I'm fly at Fatburger when—when he's—I'm way out west (Check it)
Check; K-I-N-G A-D—whammy!
All the fine ladies, they're on my jammy
Went to the prom—wore the fly blue rental
Got six girlies in my Lincoln Continental
I met a girl at the party, and she started to flirt
I told her some rhymes, and she pulled up her skirt (Check it)
Spent some bank, got a high powered jumbo
Rolled up a wooly—what'd he do?—and I watched Columbo

[Interlude: MCA + Ad-Rock]
Let me clear my throat
Kick it over here, baby pop
And let all the fly skimmies feel the beat—
Mmm—drop

[Verse 4: MCA + Ad-Rock + Mike D + Beastie Boys]
Coolin' on the corner on a hot summer's  day
Just me, my posse, and—MCA
A lot of beer, a lot of girls, and a lot of cursin'
.22 automatic on my person
Got my hand in my pocket and my finger's on the trigger
My posse's gettin' big—and my posse's gettin' bigger
Some voices got treble—some voices got bass
We got the kind of voices that are in your face!
Like the bun to the burger—and like the burger to the bun
Like the cherry—to the apple—to the peach—to the plum
I'm the King of the Ave.—and I'm the king of the block
Well, I'm MCA—and I'm the King Ad-Rock
Well, I'm Mike D—I got all the fly juice
On the checkin' at the party on the Forty Deuce
Walking down the block with the fresh fly threads
Beastie Boys—fly the biggest heads

[Outro: Beastie Boys]
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho...
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho...
Brooklyn, ho
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho...

[Verse 1]
Butcher me on the court
Too many elbows to report
Now you're poking me in the eye
Bill Laimbeer motherfucker, it's time for you to die

[Verse 2]
Tough guy, it's time to check yourself
Dribbling the ball like the Biz can be bad for your health
Tough guy, what you gotta prove?
Moving like an elephant, that's your favorite move
Tough guy, your shit is going out

[Verse 3]
Box me out with your fat ass
Throw me around like a bounce pass
You've got a tombstone hanging over your dick
Cause a minor earthquake when you throw a moving pick

[Verse 4]
Tough guy, you think you're like the Shaq
Keep running around, you'll catch a heart attack
Tough guy, what are you giving me?
The way you're playing ball, you'll stop me from living, B
Tough guy, tough guy

[Outro]
Tough guy, you're shit is weak
Tough guy, you fucking freak
Tough guy, I'll stick your shit
Tough guy

[Chorus]
No sleep till
Brooklyn

[Verse 1: Ad-Rock, Mike D & MCA]
Foot on the pedal, never ever false metal
Engine running hotter than a boiling kettle
My job's ain't a job, it's a damn good time
City to city, I'm running my rhymes
On location, touring around the nation
Beastie Boys always on vacation
Itchy trigger finger, but a stable turntable
I do what I do best because I'm illing and able
Ain't no faking, your money I'm taking
Going coast to coast watch all the girlies shaking
While you're at the job working nine-to-five
The Beastie Boys at the Garden cold kicking it live

[Chorus]
No sleep till
Another plane, another train
Another bottle in the brain
Another girl, another fight
Another drive all night

[Verse 2: Mike D, MCA & Ad Rock]
Our manager's crazy, he always smokes dust
He's got his own room at the back of the bus
Tour around the world, you rock around the clock
Plane to hotel, girls on the jock
We're trashing hotels like it's going out of style
Getting paid along the way 'cause it's worth your while
Four on the floor, Ad-Rock's out the door
MCA's in the back 'cause he's skeezing with a whore
We got a safe in the trunk with money in a stack
With dice in the front and Brooklyn's in the back
White boys got more rhymes

[Chorus]
No sleep till
No sleep till Brooklyn
No sleep till Brooklyn

[Ad-Lib: Ad Rock]
Ain't seen the light since we started this band
So, MCA, get on the mic, my man!

[Verse 3: MCA, Mike D & Ad Rock]
Born and bred in Brooklyn USA
They call me Adam Yauch, but I'm MCA
Like a lemon to a lime, a lime to a lemon
I sip the def ale with all the fly women
Limos, arenas, and TV shows
Autographed pictures and classy hoes
Step off, Holmes, get out of my way!
Taxing little girlies from here to L.A.
Waking up before I get to sleep
'Cause I'll be rocking this party eight days a week

[Chorus]
No sleep till
No sleep till Brooklyn
No sleep till Brooklyn
No (no) sleep (sleep) till Brooklyn (Brooklyn)
No (no) sleep (sleep) till Brooklyn (yeah)

[Guitar Solo]

[Outro]
No (no) sleep (sleep) till Brooklyn (Brooklyn)
No (no) sleep (sleep) till Brooklyn (Brooklyn)
No (no) sleep (sleep) till Brooklyn (Brooklyn)
No (no) sleep (sleep) till Brooklyn (Brooklyn)
No (no) sleep (sleep) till Brooklyn (Brooklyn)
No (no) sleep (sleep) till Brooklyn (Brooklyn)
Let it flow - let yourself go
Slow and low - that is the tempo
Let it flow - let yourself go
Slow and low - that is the tempo

It's never old school, all brand new
So everybody catch the bugaloo flu
Not like a fever, not like a cold
The beats are clear, the rhymes are bold
So don't see a doctor or see a nurse
Just listen to the music, first things first
First of all, get off the wall
It's time to party, so have a ball
We slowed it on down, so get the hell up
Like a volcano, I'll erupt
We got determination, bass and highs
White Castle fries only come in one size
What you see is what you get
And you ain't seen nothing yet

So let it flow - let yourself go
Slow and low - that is the tempo
Let it flow - let yourself go
Slow and low - that is the tempo
I do not sing, but I make a def song
You could live your whole life, and I hope you live long
On the Gong Show, we won't get gonged
We're the Beastie Boys, not Cheech and Chong
Strong as a ox, fresh out the box
The crowd is so live, they're coming in flocks
And when we go on, the crowd goes off
It's all hard rock, there's nothing soft

Let it flow - let yourself go
Slow and low - that is the tempo
Let it flow - let yourself go
Slow and low - that is the tempo

COD

So let it flow - let yourself go
Slow and low - that is the tempo
And let it flow - let yourself go
Slow and low - that is the tempo

Now we not only rock the house, but we house the rock
We don't stroll, but we roll straight to the top
MCA, Adrock, Mike D makes three
And we can do it like this in the place to be
When I'm recorded, you'll be rewarded
I know my song is def 'cause you all applauded
Not PCP or LSD,  just me, Mike D, in the place to be
This is not free, you must pay a fee
Cash on delivery like a COD
So let it flow - let yourself go
Slow and low - that is the tempo
And let it flow - let yourself go
Slow and low - that is the tempo

The beat is slow in order to dance
I wanna hear "I do"s and no "I can't"s
First, move your leg and then your arm
It's not fast and nervous, this dance is calm
It's truly stable, and you ought to be able
To dance to the record when it's on the turntable

So let it flow - let yourself go
Slow and low - that is the tempo
And let it flow - let yourself go
Slow and low - that is the tempo

And let it flow - let yourself go
Slow and low - that is the tempo
And let it flow - let yourself go
Slow and low - that is the tempo

[Produced by Rick Rubin and Beastie Boys]

They got a committee to get me off the block
'Cause I say my rhymes loud, and I say 'em nonstop
Because being bad news is what we're all about
We went to White Castle, and we got thrown out

I got my boy Mike D. - I got the King Adrock
I got the jammy with the ammo inside my sock
I shot homeboy, but the bullet was a dud
So I reached in the Miller cooler, grabbed a cool Bud

Slow riding, gun hidin', on the go
I'm fly like an eagle, and I drink Old Crow
I'm the king of the classroom, coolin' in the back
My teacher had beef, so I gave her a smack

She chased me out of class, she was strapped with a ruler
Went to the bathroom, rolled myself a wooler
With bottle in hand, at the microphone stand
Ay, yo, homeboy - what you drinkin', man?
I got money - I got juice
I got to the party, and I got loose
I got rhythms - I got rhymes
I got the girlies with the def behinds
I got ill - I got busted
I got dust, and I got dusted
I got gold - I got funky
I got the new dance they call the Brass Monkey

Because I'm hard hittin' - always bitten - cool as hell
I got the trees on my mirror so my car won't smell
Sittin' around the house - gettin' high watchin' tube
I'm eating Colonel's chicken - drinkin' Heineken brew
I'm a gangster, I'm a prankster - I'm the king of the ave
I'm hated, confrontated for the juice that I have
All the fine ladies are making a fuss
But I can't pay attention - 'cause I'm on that dust
Aaahhh, B-E-A-S-T-I-E go
B-E-A-S-T-I-E
That's just what Beasties gotta be
Can't you see this is an emergency
Can you feel the urgency
B-E-A-S-T-I-E
B-E-A-S-T-I-E
With the hold of democracy
In a state of emergency now

Aaahhh, going out to rock the state
Let's just come and take unique
All across the stormy sea
Better days in democracy
B-E-A-S-T-I-E
B-E-A-S-T-I-E
Captain stayed off so merrily
In a state of emergency now

Aaahhh, B-E-A-S-T-I-E
Cops just don't have respect to me
World is filled with tyranny
All across the stormy sea
B-E-A-S-T-I-E
B-E-A-S-T-I-E
Who the hell are we off to see?
Let's just come and take unique
Now B-E-A-S-T-I-E go
B-E-A-S-T-I-E go
Yes, yes, y'all, (y'all), and you don't stop (stop)
Keep it on (on) and stockin' the place (yo, Yauch)
Well, I'm MCA, I got nothin' to prove
Pay attention, my intention is to bust a move (what?)
I drink quarts and cans and bottles and sixes (what up?)
Between the turntables keep the vodka and the mixes

Well, I'm Mike D, I got the deuces wild (yeah, buddy)
A list of girlies' numbers that I've dialed
I do the Smurf, the Popeye, and the Jerry Lewis
I like Bullwinkle, but I don't like Brutus

Well, I'm schoolin' in the boy's room, coolin' by the locker (well)
All the girls in class knows that I'm the cool rocker (uh, yeah)
Punk in the hall, man, I should of, ought to hit him
Had the fresh rhymes, and the kid cold bit 'em

Smokin' in the boys room is what I do best
While you were at a party, your girlfriend fessed (Check it)
I keep a pistol in my pocket, so you better be cautious
Fly around the world, but it makes me nauseous
Mike D.'s day off every day of the week (ah, D)
I got to the party (keep it on), and I did the freak
I got a girl in the Castle and one in the pagoda
You know I got rhymes like Abe Vigoda
I'm a Def Manhattan killer - a rhyme thriller
A mic in my hand (bust it) and a mouth full of Miller

I got a hat, not a visor - I drink Budweiser
The turntable's up on the drum riser
The needle's in the groove, and the vinyl's on the platter
I know that I'm fly; man, there's no need to flatter
I travel around the globe, it's keeping girlies dizzy
My name's Mike D. - so watch me get busy, y'all

G-g-get busy, y'all
G-g-get busy, y'all

You're a fake wearin' sucker whose gold got rusted
Dusted, rusted, mustard, 'sgusted
Cheaper than a hot dog with no mustard
Mustard, mustard, mustard, mustard
You tried to steal my fresh, and you got cold busted
Busted, busted, busted, busted
Because your crew's all soft, and I'm disgusted
'Sgusted, 'sgusted,  'sgusted

I'm from downtown from the city from of Manhattan
I got a lotta girlies, and not one's cattin'
My posse's in effect, and we're doin' the deuce
And we got more rhymes than your whole damn crew
Caught you poppin' that weak, and you must have been dusted
Dusted, dusted, dusted, dusted
Stuck your head in the toilet and stone cold flushed it
Flushed it, flushed it, flushed it, flushed it
Word

[Verse 1]
Holy crappers
Holy this, holy that
Holy, funky, big, fat rat
Holy piss, holy crappers
Jill Cuniff, holy snappers
I like Batman, I like Crass
Robin's gettin' it up the ass
Holy piss, holy crappers
Jill Cuniff, holy snappers

[Verse 1]
Ohhh, holy this, holy that
Holy, funky, big, fat rat
Holy piss, holy crappers
Jill Cuniff, holy snappers
I like Batman, I like Crass
Robin's gettin' it up the ass
Holy piss, holy crappers
Jill Cuniff, holy snappers

[Verse 1]
Ohhh, holy this, holy that
Holy, funky, big, fat rat
Holy piss, holy crappers
Jill Cuniff, holy snappers
I like Batman, I like Crass
Robin's gettin' it up the ass
Holy piss, holy crappers
Jill Cuniff, holy snappers

Shit...

[Hook]
In a world gone mad it's hard to think right
So much violence hate and spite
Murder going on all day and night
Due time we fight the non-violent fight

Mirrors, smokescreens and lies
It's not the politicians but their actions I despise
You and Saddam should kick it like back in the day
With the cocaine and Courvoisier
But you build more bombs as you get more bold
As your mid-life crisis war unfolds
All you want to do is take control
Now put that axis of evil bullshit on hold
Citizen rule number 2080
Politicians are shady
So people watch your back cause I think they smoke crack
I don't doubt it look at how they act

[Hook]
In a world gone mad it's hard to think right
So much violence hate and spite
Murder going on all day and night
Due time we fight the non-violent fight
First the 'War On Terror’, now war on Iraq
We're reaching a point where we can't turn back
Let's lose the guns and let's lose the bombs
And stop the corporate contributions that their built upon
Well I'll be sleeping on your speeches 'til I start to snore
Cause I won't carry guns for an oil war
As-Salamu alaikum, wa alaikum assalam
Peace to the Middle East peace to Islam
Now don't get us wrong cause we love America
But that's no reason to get hysterica
They're layin' on the syrup thick
We ain't waffles we ain't havin' it

[Hook]
In a world gone mad it's hard to think right
So much violence hate and spite
Murder going on all day and night
Due time we fight the non-violent fight

Now how many people must get killed?
For oil families pockets to get filled?
How many oil families get killed?
Not a damn one so what's the deal?

It's time to lead the way and de-escalate
Lose the weapons of mass destruction and the hate
Say ooh ah what's the White House doin'?
Oh no! Say, what in tarnation have they got brewing??!!!!???!!
Well I'm not pro Bush and I'm not pro Saddam
We need these fools to remain calm
George Bush you're looking like Zoolander
Trying to play tough for the camera
What am I on crazy pills? We've got to stop it
Get your hand out my grandma's pocket
We need health care more than going to war
You think it's democracy they're fighting for?

[Hook]
In a world gone mad it's hard to think right
So much violence hate and spite
Murder going on all day and night
Due time we fight the non-violent fight
Ohhh whoahhh, let's like
Get my bong, and do up some heavy weed, man

Ohhh I love stoned joints

I fucked around and then I lost my tooth ahaa

Like Dennis Coffey, I'm a Scorpio (scorpio)

Making mountains out of molehills and rockin' some mo' skills
Butt naked beats with butt naked fills

Continued evolution of an individual, well I'll tell ya

I have never been more ready in my entire life to do this right now
Never
It's all been leading up to this moment
All right now, right here
My whole life, right here

We got rhyme selections in a wide array
J'ai des bonbons pour vous manger
The party people scream, "Oui, oui, c'est vrai"
'Cause I got a remote for my bidet

Now A-D-R-O-C-K
I use the microphone like Picasso used clay
Down with Freckles from around the way
Peace to Bambaataa and Jazzy Jay

I rock on the mic from here to Bombay
I give it my best and say come what may
'Cause everybody's got their dues to pay
I'm looking sideways like my man Pele
Gettin' on like Ali bomaye
So fed up with racism today
Time to speak up and not turn away
Make the sun shine when it's cloudy and gray

Dip dip dive so socialize
Open up your ears and clean out your eyes
If you learn to love, you're in for a surprise
It could be nice to be alive

I'm taking doody rhymes to a brand new height
I shine on the mic like UltraBright
Created a monster with these rhymes I write
Goatee metal rap, please say goodnight

Now here's a little something you may not like
My DJ's name is Mix Master Mike
It's a real pity that you people got to bite
But I could understand because he sounds so nice

Reading you the news cause I'm Country Mike
Use a microphone like Shazam uses tights
Try to keep clear of that hate and spite
So I keep my mind still like the still of night

Now who in the world do you want to fight?
It's against the system, we should unite
Homophobics ain't alright
If you learn to love, then you might love life
Dip dip dive so-socialize
Open up your ears and clean out your eyes
If you learn to love, you're in for a surprise
It could be nice to be alive

Bring it back that old New York rap
Bring it back that old New York rap
Bring it-Bring it back that old New York rap
Bring it-Bring it back that-Bring it-Bring it back that
Bring it-Bring it back that old New York rap
Bring it back that old New York rap
Bring it-Bring it back that-Bring it-Bring it back that
Bring it-Bring it back that old New York rap

Now you can shuffle numbers but facts is facts
So many billionaires while so many lack
So before the poor decide to react
Come on party people and share up your stacks

Now I'm-a break it down to the brass tacks
Do the Biz Mark dance and the cabbage patch
You try to turn the key but then you broke the latch
Sneak into my files for some rhymes to snatch

I'd like to have a say on the income tax
Don't wanna help build bombs and that's the facts
No money for health care so what's the catch?
The man got you locked with no key to the latch
Mike and Adam have got my back
You bring the mic and we'll bring the raps
Turn on the PA and rock your shack
Don't smoke cheeba, can't stand crack

Dip dip dive so-socialize
Open up your ears and clean out your eyes
If you learn to love, you're in for a surprise
It could be nice to be alive
There's no confusion in her conclusion
She wants to waste my time and that's no delusion
Her final decision is perfection and precision
She's grade-A class, number one in her division

'Cause she's on it
And she's on it

She acts like a nag, I don't know how it started
Even when I'm chillin', she acts retarded
It gets annoying, so high on the tip
If a pirate had a Def Jam shirt, she'd be hard on his ship

'Cause she's on it
'Cause she's on it

Cold chillin' in the spot, and she won't stop
She'll do what's best just to reach the top
She studies real hard, all night she'll cram
In school she majors in Advanced Def Jam
'Cause she's on it
And she's on it
'Cause she's on it

[guitar solo]

'Cause she's on it
'Cause she's on it
'Cause she's on it

She's cold in the winter and cool like ice
Sometimes she gets loose, sometimes she gets nice
Her heart starts beatin', her hands get clammy
'Cause she used to be stuck up, now she's on my jammy

'Cause she's on it
And she's on it

Her bedroom eyes, they start to twitch
But she won't front, 'cause she's got that itch
She'd drop to her knees if we'd only say please
Instead of counting sheep, cold counting Beasties

'Cause she's on it
'Cause she's on it
And she's on it
Fresh dressed 'cause I shop at Modell's
Deep in Brooklyn, I rode the L's
Used to ride the D to beat the morning bell
At Edward R. Morrow out on Ave. L

Now we be grillin' cheese and flippin' flapjacks
With the diamond stylus, yo, we cutting wax
We're the super-elastic, bubble-plastic
Got ethereal material that's straight up classic

You try to vex, reject, but you should respect
Or we'll have JC send you out a FedEx
So don't start to flex up in the discotheque
Or we'll make you extinct, tyrannosaurus rex

We're gonna rock this motherfucker like three the hard way
We're gonna rock this motherfucker like three the hard way
We're gonna rock this motherfucker like three the hard way
Three the hard way
Three the hard way
Your rhyme technique, it is antique
To all my heads, Qu'est-ce-que tu fabriques?
Che cazzo fai? Come stai?
Ho fatto molte telefonate

I said, oops, gotcha, clutch like Piazza
Sneak between the sheets so hide the matzoh
Holler back, challah bread... next
We are the crew who put the crew in Cruex

I can see that Def Jam doesn't recognize me
I'm Mike D, the one who put the satin in your panties
Time to count MC's in this place to be
Not five, not four, not two, just three

We're gonna rock this motherfucker like three the hard way
We're gonna rock this motherfucker like three the hard way
We're gonna rock this motherfucker like three the hard way
Three the hard way
Three the hard way

Round-house kick the mic out your hand
Drunken mantis, my name brand
If you're slick with the tricks and the sleight of hand
I'm hip to the shit that you're trying to scam
Gnip-Gnop, I got shit to pop
I'm an exceptional professional that just don't stop
So pack up your bag and your mic and don't wait
E.T., phone home, now get the fuck out my face

You know we shake 'em, bake 'em, then we take 'em
Treat MC's like leaves, go out and rake 'em
Sell our CDs on Canal before we make 'em
Serve you on a platter like Steak-umm

We're gonna rock this motherfucker like three the hard way
We're gonna rock this motherfucker like three the hard way
We're gonna rock this motherfucker like three the hard way
Three the hard way
Three the hard way
Listen, All You New Yorkers

Brooklyn, Bronx, Queens and Staten
From the Battery to the top of Manhattan
Asian, Middle-Eastern and Latin
Black, White, New York you make it happen

Brownstones, water towers, trees, skyscrapers
Writers, prize fighters and Wall Street traders
We come together on the subway cars
Diversity unified, whoever you are
We're doing fine on the One and Nine line
On the L we're doin' swell
On the number Ten bus we fight and fuss
Cause we're thorough in the boroughs and that's a must
I remember when the Deuce was all porno flicks
Running home after school to play PIXX
At lunch I'd go to Blimpies down on Montague Street
And hit the Fulton Street Mall for the sneakers on my feet
Dear New York, I hope you're doing well
I know a lot's happened and you've been through hell
So, we give thanks for providing a home
Through your gates at Ellis Island we passed in droves
Brooklyn, Bronx, Queens, and Staten
From the Battery to the top of Manhattan
Asian, Middle-Eastern and Latin
Black, White, New York you make it happen

The L.I.E., the BQE
Hippies at the band shell with the LSD
Get my BVD's from VIM
You know I'm reppin' Manhattan the best I can
Stopped off at Bleeker Bob's got thrown out
Sneakin' in at 4:00 am after going out
You didn't rob me in the park at Diana Ross
But everybody started looting when the light went off
From the South South Bronx, on out to Queensbridge
From Hollis Queens right down to Bay Ridge
From Castle Hill to the Lower East Side
From 1010 WINS to Live At Five
Dear New York, this is a love letter
To you and how you brought us together
We can't say enough about all you do
Cause in the city we're ourselves and electric, too

Brooklyn, Bronx, Queens, and Staten
From the Battery to the top of Manhattan
Asian, Middle-Eastern, and Latin
Black, White, New York you make it happen
Shout out the South Bronx where my mom hails from
Right next to High Bridge across from Harlem
To the Grand Concourse where my mom and dad met
Before they moved on down to the Upper West
I see you're still strong after all that's gone on
Life long we dedicate this song
Just a little something to show some respect
To the city that blends and mends and tests
Since 9/11, we're still livin'
And lovin’, life we've been given
Ain't nothing gonna' take that away from us
Were lookin' pretty and gritty cause in the city we trust
Dear New York, I know a lot has changed
2 towers down, but you're still in the game
Home to the many, rejecting no one
Accepting peoples of all places, wherever they're from

Brooklyn, Bronx, Queens, and Staten
From the Battery to the top of Manhattan
Asian, Middle-Eastern, and Latin
Black, White, New York you make it happen

[Biz Markie - many lyrics are mumbled]
Hey kids, shake it loose together
The spotlight's hitting something
That is been known to change the weather
We'll kill the fatted calf tonight
So stick around
You're gonna hear electric music
Solid walls of sound

Say, Candy and Ronnie, have you seen them yet
Oh, but they're so spaced out
B-B-B-Bennie and the Jets
Oh but they're weird and they're wonderful
Oh Bennie she's really keen
She's got electric boots, a mohair suit
You know I read it in a magazine, oh-ho
B-B-B-Bennie and the Jets

Hey kids, plug into the faithless
Maybe you're blinded
But Bennie makes them ageless
We shall survive, let us 

[mumbled] take ourselves along
We fight our parents out in the streets
To find who's right and who's wrong
Say, Candy and Ronnie, have you seen them yet
Oh, but they're so spaced out
B-B-B-Bennie and the Jets
Oh, but they're weird and they're wonderful
Oh Bennie she's really keen
She's got electric boots, a mohair suit
You know I read it in a magazine, oh-ho
B-B-B-Bennie and the Jets

Take it away...

Say, Candy and Ronnie, have you seen them yet
Oh, but they're so spaced out
B-B-B-Bennie and the Jets
Oh but they're weird and they're wonderful
Oh Bennie she's really keen
She's got the electric boots, a mohair suit
You know I read it in a magazine, oh-ho
B-B-B-Bennie and the Jets

B-B-B-Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, and the Jets
Bennie
Bennie
Bennie
Bennie
Bennie
Bennie
Bennie
Bennie
Bennie
Bennie
Yeah..
Ahh, yeah…
Ahh, yeah, this one's dedicated to all the ladies in the front, the back
All the older ladies out there
Lookin' nice, you know who you are
Hoo...

I need you, boomin' granny
I said, I want you, boomin' granny
Boomin' granny, boomin' fanny
Boomin' granny, good and plenty

Well, it might sound odd, it might sound corny
But here's some sex rhymes for those that are horny
For your boomin' granny with the boomin' system
Said I love ya, won't leave ya, so you got to listen
See I’m talkin' about the way that I’m feeling
You're so lovely, lengthy, and so appealing
A sassy, sophisticated, sexy lady
Well I’m 26 and you're 80
The clock is ticking so you better not front
We can go to my place or we could smoke a blunt
Well you're a golden girl, just like Bea Arthur
Just turn down the lights so we can go farther
Boomin' granny, boomin' fanny
Boomin' granny, good and plenty

Because I saw you at the check out line
You dropped your coupons and you were looking fine
Sophisticated, and so mature
I couldn't really care if you're 50 or 74
Because I want ya, and I need ya
Hey boomin' granny, you could be my teacher
And I could be your pet, bet
Listen old lady, I’m gonna make ya sweat
I know I’m younger, and you're much older
You look so nice on my Chevy Nova
I’m gonna take her to the low rider show, and flaunt ya
I gotta tell ya, lady

I said I want you boomin' granny
Because I need you, boomin' granny
Boomin' granny, boomin' fanny
Boomin' granny, good and plenty
Oh
Yeah
Hey Yo
This is a dedication to all you back stabbing biting MC's
Scratching like you got fleas
Know what I'm saying?
Yo. We watchin' you son
We up on the roof
Down in the celler
And up in the crawlspace
Listen fool, I got my eye on you son
What?


There's a party going on in here for real
I got more product than Ron Popeil
So deal with that, troop; We're troopers
The only air time you get is on bloopers
Beastie Boys in the place, up in the space
So renovate or evacuate
You better think twice before you start flossin'
I been in your bathroom often
Taking punk MC's out I'm all about
My to-do list today is turn the party out
Getting hot in here, no room to breath
I got my pen in my hand so you best not sleep
No I'm not Herman Munster nor Dr. Spock
I go by the name of the King Adrock
So here's a match my ass and your face
Listen when I tell you, dog;
I'm in your crawl space
You're in front of my house and you know that's wack
Bite my rhymes with a scanner from Radio Shack
You suckers try to front like you've got the force
But I'll slay like Vader, sip you for a first course
Don't even get me started on intercourse..
*Ahhhh!*
Don't step into my zone or even periphery
Can't grab a hold of my style, it's too slippery
The way you act a fool, son, you can't erase
Andyou running on your way like steeple chase
You tried to take my title, put it back in place
But now you're busted wearing panties and lace
Steeling my style from my trophy case
But my drive's secure like on an army base
You're sneaking and peeking and trying to give chase
But you ain't never gonna catch me;
I'm in your crawl space

Schematics, blueprints and microfilm
Calibrate your sonar when I'm in your realm
Cause you know we're getting scarier and scarier
And this extends beyond the Tri-State Area
Omnipresent and omnipotent
My rhymes are whales and yours are rodents
This means huge compared to very small
You look a little chilly, can I get you a shawl?
Cause these rhymes are two hundred proof
They're like anvils lined up on a roof
Waiting to drop on your corny melon
Cause were not buying what you're selling
First you want to battle then you start to whine
You're looking hungry, it must be snack time
So run home where you feel safe
But don't sleep, Cochese
I'm in your crawl space
Ideas spark, my hand grabs a pen
Sweeten up the sound, let me get the right blend
Coming down the wire to the Neve mic pre
Nice up the sound for the A to D
I'm a Wonderama snake can winner
Bagel from Bob and a TV Dinner
I'm the one that won that dance contest
Cause you know I dance the best
All you gotta do is do your thing, you see
Cause I don't give a fuck who you're supposed to be
My name is Adrock and I aim to please
And I gotta spread love in society

We gotta keep the party going on
All lifestyles, sizes, shapes, and forms

What you saw what you heard
I get involved I might disturb
And if you want what's going down
You might just get that silky sound
So what'cha want? So what'cha need?
I've got the fonts you want to read
Get in the game you gotta scheme
All the same I've got the team
More new wave, not OG
Walking down the block you say "Yo, D!
When you coming out with the new CD
That spreads love in society?"
We gotta keep the party going on
All lifestyles, sizes, shapes, and forms

Goto goto goto goto
Don't mess with crack or the baking soda
Whether in the high rise where you live like Rhoda
Or in the shack and you live like Yoda
Once again it's on like a brand new morn
Beatsie Beatsie Boys here to keep you all warm
All you spazzes and you freaks
Go and do your thing cause you're unique
If it don't hurt nobody else than
Don't be afraid to be yourself and
Special dedication and so on
To all lifestyles, sizes, shapes and forms
We gotta keep the party going on
All lifestyles, sizes, shapes, and forms

"Tappin', clappin, rappin', the sound of fingers snappin’
Tappin', snappin', knockin', rappin', a little sound growin'
Coming out 'n' going all the time"
If you don't like the news then press eject
Baby Davis, getting older, can't take a rain check
It's time to let 'em know what we expect
Stop building SUV's, strung out on OPEC

Hold up, wait up, you know, we come correct
You wanna change things up, well, hey, then get set
It's easier to sit back than stick out your neck
It's easier to break things than build it correct

We've got a president we didn't elect
The Kyoto treaty he decided to neglect
And still the US just wants to flex
Keep doin' that, what, we gonna break our necks

It takes a second to wreck it
It takes time to build
It takes a second to wreck it
It takes time to build
You gots to chill
Ah, yo, hate-filled people wanna keep us in check
Tearin' down each other is what they expect
If you want love, well, hey, that's a bet
We've got to give before we can get

Waiting like a batter who is on deck
When it's time to wreck shop then shop I'll wreck
So let's calibrate and check our specs
We need a little shift on over towards the left

I don't really know but I suspect
I think it's due time that we inspect
How they get their information and their facts are checked?
Another press conference someone's talking out their neck

It takes a second to wreck it
It takes time to build
It takes a second to wreck it
It takes time to build
You gots to chill

So step up to the window and place your bets
Is the US gonna keep breaking necks
Maybe it's time that we impeach Tex
And the military muscle that he wants to flex
By the time Bush is done what will be left
Selling votes like E-pills at the discotheque
Environmental destruction and the national debt
But plenty of dollars left in the fat war chest

What the real deal, why you can't connect?
Why you hating people that you never met?
Didn't your mama teach you to show some respect?
Why not open your mind for a sec?

It takes a second to wreck it
It takes time to build
It takes a second to wreck it
It takes time to build
You gots to chill

It takes
It takes
It takes
It takes
It takes
It takes

{The idea is to keep the green alien landing craft from taking your humans from the ground and changing them into mutants
A mutant is very dangerous to you because he flies faster than you do and shoots at you}
{Uh thank you ladies and gentlemen, this next song is a blast
And I gotta say we are having a ball up here tonight
And when you're ready and...}

Shabba doo, shabba dee
Shabba dee, shabba doo

[Verse 1: Ad-Rock]
Which of you schnooks took my rhyme book?
Look, give it back, you're wicky-wack
With your ticky-tack calls…  Didn't touch you at all
I didn't touch your hand — man, you know it’s all ball

[Verse 2: MCA]
You sold a few records but don't get slick
Cause you used a corked bat to get those hits
You've been in the game, your career is long
But when you break it down you've only got 2 songs

[Verse 3: Mike D]
MC's are like clay pigeons when I'm shootin' skeet
I just yell pull and Mike drops the beat
You people call yourselves MC's but you're garbage men
Takin' out the trash when you pull out the pen

[Hook-Line:]
And if you don't like it, then hey fuck you!

[Verse 4: Ad-Rock]
I read about you up on page 6
They was trashin' your ass it's sad you're getting dissed
Now talk about your face now don't get pissed
But I suggest you see a dermatologist

[Verse 5: MCA]
I keep that hot sauce hot - not mild and weak
It's gonna burn your mouth until you wet your beak
I've got billions and billions of rhymes to flex
Cause I've got more rhymes than Carl Sagan's got turtlenecks

[Verse 6: Mike D]
Your rhymes are fake like a Canal Street watch
You're hearing me and you're like, "Oh my god its Sasquatch!"
I'm walkin' on water while you're stepping in shit
So put your sewer boots on before your ass gets lit

[Hook-Line:]
And if you don't like it, then hey fuck you!

[Sample:]
So put a quarter in your ass cause you played yourself
So put a quarter in your ass cause you played yourself
So put a quarter in your ass cause you played yourself
So put a quarter in your ass cause you played yourself

[Hook:]
And if you don't like it, then hey fuck you!

[Verse 7: Ad-Rock]
Sucker MC’s, it's me they're resenting
In the animal kingdom, they call it presenting
With the dipsy-doodle, the kit and caboodle
The truth is brutal, your grandma's kugel

[Verse 8: MCA]
Kings County is my stomping ground
The Albee Square Mall, Brooklyn, Downtown
So don't ask me to wine and dine ya
I'm from Brooklyn, you're from Regina

[Verse 9: Mike D]
You're like Foghorn Leghorn, Yosemite Sam
You're just yellin' and wildin' wondering who I am
A-with those lies you're telling you're like Toucan Sam
But my style's impregnable like the Hoover Dam

[Hook-Line:]
And if you don't like it, then hey, fuck you!
And if you don't like it, then hey, fuck you!

[Sample:]
W-how, what a loser!
Now what the blood clot, I rap a lot
What you gonna do when the beat goes drop?
Whatcha talkin' 'bout, Willis? Who the illest?
You know my name's Adam, stop callin' me Phyllis
Ya hear some fuss, you're like what's the clamor?
It's just me naked on the cover of Glamour
A phenomenon, pandemonium
The club is blowing up like plutonium

What's all the fanfare, what's the to do
We're known to bring the hullabaloo
On stage or at the spa
Guaranteed we bring the brouhaha
‘Cause it's a brouhaha
‘Cause it's a brouhaha

There's a commotion that's goin' down
I talk more shit than drown the clown
I'm like that freak from Cirque du Soleil
With my leg behind my head and a rhyme to say
Ten nine eight seven six five four
Get upon the mic and I'm a even the score
One two three, three to two one
Don't carry a knife and I don't carry a gun

Yo, we be making mountains out of Cool Whip
Pass me the mint for the julep
Tell me everybody where is the love
Hey yo what's the motherfuckin' hubbub
‘Cause it's a brouhaha
‘Cause it's a brouhaha

Communicator check one two one two
This is Bones McCoy on a line to Sulu
Set the bullshit to warp factor one
Check your tri-corder set your phaser to stun

Oh mai oui you can catch me
At Jon Vie with a pastry
C'est ci c'est la oh n'est pas
Qu'est-ce-que c'est le brouhahaha
Ha haha haha!

Just back from Japan and ooh I'm laggin'
Goin' rao rao with the dungeon dragon
You can dance if you want to leave your friends behind
But if they don't dance and then they won't dance
They can kiss my fuckin' ass
‘Cause it's a brouhaha
‘Cause it's a brouhaha
Yo, what's up?
Sucka emcees, check the footnotes, ya'll
Word up. Ready, bite 'cha ass
Oh, word?

Yo what the schnitzel, we're back
Shit's getting duller and duller and that's a fact
I don't care what you heard or care what you seen
I swear it wasn't me in Bear magazine
Because I'm not that hairy, oh contrary
I go with the flow though the tempo varies
So twist the cap and pop the cork
You know it's Adrock, made in New York

Oh word?

What the ponytail, I don't eat snail
I'll steal your keys and then I'll check your mail
Cause I'm the creepy crawler that be crawling your walls
And I'm the shot caller when it comes to shot calls
And I'll be rockin' parties from block to block
And block party to party the neighborhoods on lock
So hide your eyes, wait, I saw you looking
The name's MCA, made in downtown Brooklyn
Oh word?

Yo what the parsley, parsley to the teeth
I'm a rhyme style writer, you're a rhyme style thief
I may be paranoid, you tried to fade me
Here's a song for you, "Lady"
Make you bug out like you don't know what to do
Your momma says, "Shame on you"
When you're dancing with your crew
So get that poor chicken up off your fork
My name's Mike D, made in New York

Oh word?

Yo what the falafel, you gotta get up awful
Early to fool Mr. Furley
And that's word to Aunt Shirley and you could
Stick your head in the toilet give yourself a swirley
Listen up, biters - go please stop
While I'm politicin' at Murray's Cheese Shop
Believe what you heard, when you talk
You know it's Adrock made in New York

Oh word?

What the phone booth, word to hair mouse
You're on the corner and you're selling a hog's tooth
Don't mean to dis but I've got to point out
The hogs tooth belong inside the hog's mouth
Like Ernest Shackleton said to Ord Lees
I'll have dog pemmican with my tea
Now pass me the wok cause I'm cookin'
The names MCA, made in Downtown Brooklyn
Oh word?

Yo, what the doofus, say good night
You're Snidely Whiplash, I'm Dudley Do-you-right
Times are off the hinges, leave your 2-way at the door
We're all up the creek, a long way from shore
I'm not walking around, looking to get you cake
The D is for Diamonds, not for Drakes
This is not a fantasy and I'm not Mr. O'Rourke
The name's Mike D, made in New York

Oh word?
And now my name is Adrock, I've got a story to tell
And when I rock the crowd, well the crowd will all yell
And when I get the feeling, I feel the feel swell
And when I start to rhyme, well I rhyme the rhyme well

Oh you didn't know, I got the flow
I could sing, rap, dance in just one show
With the cornbread stuffin', with the Blimpie Bluffin
Mother fuckin' Yossi with his goddamn muffins
Hey could you please, pass me the peas
And let me get a tissue if you think you're gonna sneeze
I'm the player and the coach, I'm no roach
I bought my grandma a brand new brooch

Well I'm MCA with a story to tell
When I rock the crowd, I rock the crowd well
And when I get the feeling, I feel the feel swell
'Cause when I start to rhyme, well I rhyme the rhyme well

'Cause I'm a craftsman, who ain't fastin'
I'll take you to task, everyone of y'all draftsman
I'm rehashin' and ain't maskin'
Bringin' the beat back, and keepin' it lastin'
Keepin' it topnotch, beyond passin'
Simmer in the pan 'cause, I ain't a-flashin'
I'm party crashin' so you better batten
Down those hatches stop procrastin-
Well I'm Mike D with a story to tell
And when I rock the crowd, the crowd will all yell
And when I get the feeling, I feel the feel swell
'Cause when I start to rhyme, I rhyme the rhyme well

Went to the top and never went pop and
Came back down but still not stopping
I'm not even asking, "Yo, what's cracking?"
Serving MC's on a platter like baked Alaskan
So start packin', 'cause I'm back in
The game of hip-hop representin' Manhattan

Now push the pause button, then start ducking
Shhhhh, you heard me like I'm E.F. Hutton
Hutton shhhhhhhh, Hutton shhh, Hutton shhhhhhh
Hutton SHHHHHHHHH!!!

"And I was trying on the Batgirl costume, what's wrong with that?
Now, now I was the Catwoman."

Hey, Adam. It's Felicia…
Hey, Mike. It's Felicia…
Hey, Adam. It's Felicia…
Back on the scene for the people's delight
You want peace for the people, then you say all right
'Cause George W's got nothing on we
We got to take the power from he
When I'm on the mic, I feel good to go
Like a snow day for school with hot cocoa
So don't speak what I heard, just say what I know
And my zodiac sign is Scorpio
Look what the cat dragged in
The crème de la crème without the skim
So take a rest and mind your own biz

And that's it, that's all, that's all there is

Fresh...fresh...fresh...for you...for you...for you
That's fresh...fresh...fresh...for you...for you...for you

One for Brooklyn, two for Manhattan
Let's go to work, get those hands clappin'
I'll make you bounce, rock, roll and skate
Don't underrate how I operate
It ain't what you say, it's what you mean
Intention leads to action, that is my theme
So pay attention now as I begin to recap
Puttin' words and ideas stacked back to back
Some rhymes go flat, but mine go fizz
I got no time for the drama, 'cause stress is for kids
'Cause when you're dead and buried, well, you got no biz

And that's it, that's all, that's all there is

Fresh...fresh...fresh...for you...for you...for you
That's fresh...fresh...fresh...for you...for you...for you

Brand new

The time and place for the mind is here and now
Keep the mind present, less to worry about
But like the hammer to the nail, hit the nail on the head
Well I don't shoot blanks and I don't shoot lead
'Cause I'm a freaky streaker like Winnie the Pooh
T-shirt and no pants, and I dance the bugaloo
Like George Whipple on New York One
Got a hairy ass and that's no fun
I'm in the rhyme zone, a different time zone
And on the microphone, you know that I'm at home
It's time we looked past all our differences
An' that's it, that's all, that's all there is
Come on

Fresh...fresh...fresh...for you...for you...for you
That's fresh...fresh...fresh...for you...for you...for you
An' that's
Fresh...fresh...fresh...for you...for you...for you
That's fresh...fresh...fresh...for you...for you...for you
Everybody get down huh
Everybody get down huh
Everybody get down huh
Huh huh huh huh, Shazam!

I sneak a chicken tikka
Masala at a gala event
I represent that's stupid, that's for sure
You be like, "Oh yeah Adam, real mature"
I'd like a lettuce, tomato and Munster on rye
All this cheese is gonna make me cry
Gorgonzola, provolone
Don't even get me started on this microphone
Blowin' up like my name is Joe Bazooka
I'm a super-dooper MC party pooper
On a track so sick it'll make you feel all queasy
Make you do like Fred Sanford with "I'm comin' Wheezy!"

Everybody get down huh
Everybody get down huh
Everybody get down huh
Huh huh huh huh, Shazam!
On the court I go by the name Praying Mantis
Got the edge and I've got the advantage
If you could see things from my vantage
Point then you could better understand this
I'm in the lab all day I scrabble all night
I got a bedazzler so my outfit's tight
When it comes to panache I can't be beat
I got the most style from below 14th street
Internationally known as the Keebler Elf
Can't keep a catalog up on the shelf
I splash on beats like sauce on spaghetti
Putting MC's out of business like they're Crazy Eddie
Everybody get down huh
Everybody get down huh
Everybody get down huh
Huh huh huh huh, Shazam!

I know you're sitting pretty in the Hampty Hamps
Posing like you're rolling with that camp
In layman's terms let me break it down
You're flipping and flopping just like a flounder
I'm a hip hop scholar while you're left back
So Jeckle and Rush, go back to Lefrak
I'm a simple man like Chauncey the Gardner
Working 9 to 5 Dolly Pardner
Got rhymes for jerks that's bringing on drama
Which rhyme you want first? The one about your mama?
Goodness gracious golly gee
Shazam! Freeeeeeak out with the genie!

Everybody get down huh
Everybody get down huh
Everybody get down huh
Huh huh huh huh, Shazam!

I'm gonna' tell on you!
Now, once upon a time up on this mic
MC's be really workin' on what they write
With the sound delight we rock all night
And yes we're gonna party for the right to fight
We're international like Matt Takei
Rock the mic from Munich out to Taipei
Still around the way is where we'll stay
Say what we mean, mean what we say
Trajectories from the past are taking their toll
And what we do now is future molding
Columbine bowling, childhood stolen
We need a bit more gun controlling

Right-Right-Now-Now; What is going on?
We-We-Gotta-Gotta; Get it goin' on
Be-Be-Fore-Fore; It's too far gone
We gotta work together it's been too long

When I get on you scream, "HOO, TIGHT!"
Rockin' this flow I could go all night
I'm not here to fight, or incite
I'm like the beach in the Bahamas make you feel alright
I'm getting kind of tired of the situation
The U.S. attacking other nations
And narrations, on every station
False elation's got me losing my patience
Well I'm a funky-ass Jew and I'm on my way
And yes I got to say fuck the KKK
And oh yeah hey, how about today?
If you want to set if off then let me hear you say
Right-Right-Now-Now; What is going on?
We-We-Gotta-Gotta; Get it goin' on
Be-Be-Fore-Fore; It's too far gone
We gotta work together it's been too long

I went to get a loan and they asked my race
I wrote down "HUMAN" inside the space
It's a disgrace how they try to debase
It ain't the bank's damn business how my lineage trace
Now let me drop a verse that's terse and concise
I'm an Iron Chef when I slice and dice
With the rhyme precise, the word is nice
Please pass me the Riunite on ice
Well let's go to work and not berserk
'Cause when the time comes the body goes to dirt
Try to smooth it out like Levert
I keep the mind alert and not revert

Right-Right-Now-Now; What is going on?
We-We-Gotta-Gotta; Get it goin' on
Be-Be-Fore-Fore; It's too far gone
We gotta work together it's been too long
Kickin' lyrics right through your brain
When you hear this sayin', you'll be right as rain

All right

If you (if you)
Wanna know (wanna know)
The real deal about the three
Well, let me tell you we're triple trouble ya'll
We're gonna bring you up to speed (check it out)

'Cause I'm a specializer, rhyme reviser
Ain't selling out to advertisers
What you get is what you see
And you won't see me in the advertising

See, I like to party, not drink Bacardi
'Cause I'm not looking to throw up on nobody
Known for my spiel, a wheelie one wheel
'Cause this is like having a delicious meal
And, well, moving the crowd, well, that's a must
I got some words that apply to us
And that's mesmerizing, tantalizing
Captivating, we're devastating

If you (if you)
Wanna know (wanna know)
The real deal about the three
Well, we'll tell ya
We're triple trouble ya'll
We gotta bring you up to speed
Now check it out

Here's one for the bleachers and the upper tier
Versatile All-Temp-A-Cheer
If you wanna drink, call Mr. Belvedere
Run this rap game like a brigadier

I got kicks on the one, seven, and eleven
Snares on the five and thirteen
Rhymes on time and that's the given
We're hot on the disco scene, check-it, check-it

Slow down with I-me, got to stop stingin'
The source of the problem is at the origin
You've got lyrics that have got me cringin'
You're like a fish-wife, quit your damn whingin'
If you (if you)
Wanna know (wanna know)
The real deal about the three
Well, let me tell you
We're triple trouble ya'll
We're gonna bring you up to speed (so check it out)

Bam! Super nature, god damn
Cerrone on the microphone, I am
Ad-Rock, aka, sharp cheddar
My rhymes are better
What the Helen of Troy is that?
Did I hear you say my rhymes is wack?
I'm beautiful, you can't touch me
If you pick a rose, well, you might just bleed

We're originators, you can't feign
Ignorance or pass the blame
'Nuff rhymes coming out the brain
'Nuff beats to drive you insane
'Nuff moves to make your neck crane
'Nuff skill to make the rhymes ingrain
'Nuff heat to leave you in flames
'Nuff style that you can't defame

You see, I walk like Jabba The Hutt
With the style so new y'all be like, What?
Turn the party out like a bon vivant
With the skill at will that I know you want
On a hot day with the iced latte
Devious like Wyle E. Coyote
Hot to trot-e or maybe not-e
'Cause little did they know there was a baby in her body
We're mesmerizing, tantalizing, captivating, and devastating

If you (if you)
Wanna know (wanna know)
The real deal about the three
Well, let me tell you
We're triple trouble ya'll
We're gonna bring you up to speed (check it out)
Who got the chance to make things right?
Why the politicians always want to fight?
The Christian Coalition and the right wing ooooh!
Let me tell you what you can do
Step outside the cone of silence
Too much hatred and violence
It's time to rewind
We need a military decline
Got the power of the mind focused
Government like a locust
Are we gone or just going?
Time to act on what we be knowing y'all

Who got the power to make a difference?
Who got the power to make a change?
Who got the power to make a difference?
We got the
We got the
We got the

Eyes on the prize and never wane
Take the bull by the reins
If you want it be the change
Like Gandhi and MLK
Wait up, got to change the system
Need knowledge, power and wisdom
Same way I rock this microphone
Speak up, just let it be known
Hey ladies, fellas
And everyone between
Take the power back, let them react
And let's show them what we mean; Check it out
Who got the power to make a difference?
Who got the power to make a change?
Who got the power to make a difference?
We got the
We got the
We got the

We can work, walk, march and protest
Think about how we approach this
Ask questions but they keep frontin'
Due time we change a little something
Hey yo don't you know
Won't forget Amadou Diallo
To the crooked people and the crooked cops
Got to spread love before the world goes pop
Never again should we use the A-bomb
We need an international ban on
All WOMDs gone
We need a multilateral disarm

Who got the power to make a difference?
Who got the power to make a change?
Who got the power to make a difference?
We got the
We got the
We got the
And power is the thing

When it hurts so bad (when it hurts so bad)
When it hurts so bad (when it hurts so bad)
Why's it feel so good? (when it hurts so bad)
(When it hurts so bad)
(When it hurts so bad)

[Verse 1]
I loved real, real hard once
But the love wasn't returned
Found out the man I'd die for
He wasn't even concerned
I tried, and I tried, and I tried
To keep him in my life (to keep him in my life)
I cried, and I cried, and I cried
But I couldn't make it right

[Pre-Chorus]
But I, I loved the young man
And if you ever been in love
Then you'd understand

[Chorus]
That what you want might make you cry
What you need might pass you by
If you don't catch it
If you don't catch it, if you don't catch it
And what you need ironically
Will turn out what you want to be
If you just let it (if you just let it)
If you just let it (if you just let it)

[Verse 2]
See, I thought this feeling, it was all that I had
But how could this be love
And make me feel so bad? (gave up my power)
Gave up my power, I existed for you
But whoever knew, the voo-doo you'd do

[Pre-Chorus]
But I, I loved the young man
And if you ever been in love
Then you'd understand

[Chorus]
That what you want might make you cry
What you need might pass you by
If you don't catch it (if you don't catch it)
(if you don't catch it)
And what you need ironically
Will turn out what you want to be
If you just let it (if you just let it)
If you just let it (if you just let it)
See what you want might make you cry
What you need might pass you by
If you don't catch it (if you don't catch it)
(if you don't catch it)
And what you need ironically
Will turn out what you want to be
If you just let it (if you just let it)
If you just let it (if you just let it)

[Skit: Teacher]
You ain't said nothin'
Why you ain't say somethin' to me?
(Boy 1)
I feel like love right now is like confusion
It's like people think they love somebody
When they don't really love somebody
Like I thought I was in love with this girl but I really wasn't
It's like now, I don't feel about her
(Laughter)

[Teacher]
Ok. Alright
You think that TV and music have somethin' to do with
Why people are always confused about love?
(Girl 1)
(Yes!)
Why?
(Cause today we listen to a lot of TV a lot of music
And it sounds nice but it may not always be right for you)
We need to put you on a bullhorn
Let you ride around Newark

[Intro: Wyclef Jean]
Wyclef on guitar with the Black Eyed Peas

She like a rap song (she like a rap song)

Let me "Rock them Bells" like I'm LL
I like you in a Kangol and Gazelles
Here's a ticket come and see me on my "Planet Rock"

But wait-uh every month you're the flavor
I wanna get a scoop, lat-uh!

[Chorus]
She like a rap song (she like a rap song)
She like a rap song

[Verse 2]
She was the, "Public Enemy #1"
She was my, "Mona Lisa" when we first begun
She got me, "Jump-in' Around" like Everlast
Singin a, "Rap Life" with help from Tash
She be my, metronome rhythm to my feet
And when we, when we do it do it to the beat
She like, "My Melody" done by Eric B., and Rakim
'Cause she be rockin' me steadily, yo

[Chorus]
Yo, she got hips to hops
And she ain't goin pop
She like a record that I wanna rock
When I'm rollin in my ride cruisin down my block
Yo, and if she was a rap song

And I wanna put you on

[Verse 3]
She makes me say 'ho' but she ain't a "HOE!!"
She "Got it Made" with Special Ed (??) "HOE!!"
Her bass is everlasting like Rodney O's
She "Myself and I" comin from the Soul
She like a beat that makes me wanna grab the mic
She like the lyrics that I wanna recite
She like the old school mic with the cable
You can bring your records and I'll bring the turntable yo

[Chorus]
Yo, she got hips to hops
And she ain't goin pop
She like a record that I wanna rock
When I'm rollin in my ride cruisin down my block
Yo, and if she was a rap song

She like a rap song (she like a rap song)
She like a rap song
She make me clap (how's that) 'cause she a rap song
She like a rap song
She like a rap song (she like a rap song)
She like a rap song
She make me clap (how's that) 'cause she a rap song
She like a rap song

[Outro: Wyclef Jean]
Wyclef, Jerry Wonder
With the Black Eyed Peas
Don't hurt nobody man
Takin' over the universe, I told y'all
Take' me in, don't hurt nobody

[Intro]
Yeah yeah yeah
Oooooohh
Yeahhhhhhhhhhhhh, yeah yeah yeah
Let me tell you a story now

[Verse One]
I was in front of the Apollo on Amateur Night
It was after the show, and the moon was right
The {?} was really perked off the Red Zone
I was in my MPV, I was all alone
A lot of out-of-town people askin me for
My John Hancock or my signature
I gave it to, all of them cause I was down to earth
And plus the Apollo is my home turf
So I walked across the street 'til I'm on, 125
I saw this pair of shoes that was really live
It wasn't just a pair of shoes, that was on her
From the ground up, she looked like a plate of lasagna
I said, "Hey shorty, not you, your hair"
She turned around slowly and started to stare
She said, "Why don'tcha take picture, it'll last a lil' longer?"
Me likin you grew a little bit stronger
She asked me what's my name I said, "Emmezah emmezah"
"The name that your momma gave ya is what I prefer"
She asked me what am I drivin, and how is my health
I know what you're really thinkin baby, LET ME TELL YOU!

[Chorus One - Biz singing]
I can do bad by myself
I don't need no help, to starve to death
I can do that alone
I can do bad by myself
I don't need no help, to starve to death
I ain't tryin to be funny honey

[Verse Two]
She started arguin with me, and say she's not like that
I know who you are, I don't care if you're livin fat
Because I have a mother and father that take care of me
And I'm livin in Long Island with a J-O-B
Okay okay I got you wrong, I must admit
I'ma give you a little time to see if you're legit
So we started goin out on a regular basis
I was takin her to the movies and my hangout, places
Like the Q Club, The Scene, or The Arcade
I thought this relationship was tailor-made
Cause she was sweet kind considerate I, was hypnotized
Never thought she'd try to pull the wool, over my eyes
After I smacked it and flipped it, she thought I was whipped
I know she is like a knockout but I'm not gettin bullwhipped
She asked me why I am so stingy I know you got the ends
Because you got two MV's, two BM's, an SL Benz
What are you my accountant or the IRS?
Why ya clockin everything that I posess?
She want me to waste everything and be small as an elf
Let me tell you somethin baby, let me tell you

[Chorus Two - Biz singing]
I can do bad by myself
I don't need no help, to starve to death
I can do that on my own
I can do bad by myself
I don't need no help, to starve to death
I ain't tryin to be funny honey

[Verse Three]
Now all her friends boosted her, to get my dinero
Like if I was a drunk Mexican, wearin a sombrero
I knew she had a boyfriend on the side
She told me, yo, she didn't have to hide
She said she cut him because he was too jealous
He always thought I was tryin to talk to other fellas
It's now the present, and that was the past
From now on bein with me, is gonna be a blast
I know she thought in her mind, it's gonna be great
Juicin and reducin everything I make
With her Victoria's Secrets neglice
She tried to seduce me in every way
She would come out to Jersey rain sleet or snow
She acted too true blue to be after my dough
My man, Jeff told me but I didn't wanna listen
I was too hooked, and strung out, I thought he was dissin
Then she popped the question, and asked me for some dough
I looked her in her face and said, "HELL NO!!!"
You're a head nurse and you want my wealth?
You must be CRAZY AS HELL, cause

[Chorus One]

[Biz singing]
Let me tell you know
All day long, you been talkin on the telephone
Braggin to all your friends, about all the cars that I own
But YOUUUUUU don't tell 'em, that I'm the one doin it all
While you're out there livin it up, and havin yo'self a ball

[Chorus Two]

[Biz singing]
Ummm, whoah-whoah, yeah-yeahhhh!

Come out fresh, like graANNNNNND openin

To be or not to be a celebrity

Grandmaster Flash, Treacherous Three
And the King of Rockers, Run-D.M.C
To all the girls and boys, like to make noise
Crazy gents, spendin dollars and cents
Women and men that borrow and lend
And all the children that try to pretend
To be a Prince {?}, or Jackson
Now my man Michael loves to eat cycle
Crazy wings off the gravy train
My great dane Joey, so bowl a household
With the b-boy product that'll help them grow
We don't give 'em milk because that give 'em the craps
We feed 'em um, sausages and liver snaps
But seriously, I'm in the place to be
But it ain't a place to be without me me me
Between herpes and AIDS, I'd rather have VD
Gonorrhea syphillis is a real bad case
You get goner in her pants, rhea in her face

{*fades out - thankfully*}

[Verse 1]
Get up out your seat, the grand groove is back
With a beat to sink your teeth in like Wolfman Jack
I'm bringing in the swing like ching a-ling a-ling
Guaranteed to rock and make the microphone sing
I combine funk with a make-a-monk piano
I'm nuts, I'm crazy, I lost it, and man a
Different type of bud in my veign and hey
Like I'm *cookoo cookoo* like a nappy dread
Now it's me, the B-I-Z, M-A-R K-I to the E
As you can see, going to the T-O-O, mo mo most definitely
I concoct to rock, and put you in shock
Not from the past, but I blact like Binac-a
Yeah, the one foots getting ill
Cause nobody beats the Biz still

[Hook]
The funk is back! (Repeat 4x)

[Verse 2]
Ooops, well I'm the original B-I-Z Mark
Here to let you know my bite is worse than my bark
I'm coiming out with some freakified funk
If Joanie was around, then I'd be a hump
But since she ain't, I still am the
Hellified king of the R-A-P
I'sa I'sa I'sa here to let you know
I'm the hypnotizing, mezmorizing, stealing the show
Uh-oh, I'm hitting hitting just like a speaker
My mom dropped the bomb, then God said "Eureka!"
To say a lay masterpiece that's long overdue
]From the streets of California to Kalamazoo
Don't look at me like I'm crazy or dumb
Cause my jinlge will tickle you cerebrum
My sensational delivery will give you a chill
That's why nobody beats the Biz still

[Hook]
The funk is back! (Repeat 4x)

[Verse 3]
I'm the super, duper, party pooper
With my loop I'll put you in a stupor
Chump, thump, with doctor's bump
With the trunks of funk to make the heartbeat pump
M ah Z R, K har, I har, E har
Try hard, a star, rocking the Casbah
My brain maintains with no restraints
Not John Doe or Jane, here to entertain
Feul a, deuler, plus an old schooler
Funk from the crack keep me kicking like I'm ruler
Dunky, drunky, skunky, funky, and pokey
Chunky, a junkie with the monkey on my back
Knack, opposites attract
Biz being wack? Get the bozack!
Skill to ill, plus always thrill
And I be sure that no one beats the Biz still

[Hook]
The funk is back! (Repeat 4x)

*the Biz goes off til the song's end*

[Intro]
One two, one two
This goes out to my brother dimond shell
My man jazzy jerome, def jeff
I can't forget my man kevin d and the midnight express crew
Philly, soda pop
I'm gonna run down my family tree like this:

[Verse 1]
One, two, one two three and
I got a friend by the name of Charlie
Charlie got a wife by the name of Dolly
Dolly and Charlie got a son named Wally
And Wally got a girl by the name of Polly
Polly got a sister by the name of Molly
Molly and Polly got a mother named Polly
Father named Arthur, we call him Artie
You don't understand then I'm very very sorry
Cousin named Frita, uncle named Skeeter
He's married to my fine aunt Rita
Who is the leader of the married cheaters
So I don't greet her, 'cause my uncle don't need her
Grandma Joyce drives a Rolls Royce
Of the family I'm a favorite choice
Buddy named Homer, used to be a loner
Now he's got a girl by the name of Mona
Now that Homer's married to Mona
All he does all day is bone, bone, bone her
Father named Lex, gets big respect
Driving in his Dodge 300GX
Week after next, Lex gets his check
Me and Lex will be chillin' in the x
My girl Eleanor, went to the drugstore
To get deodorant, I think it was pure
'Cause the one she used before made her underarm sore
And that's why Eleanor don't use it no more
A girl named Betty who used to go with Freddy
Asked me was I ready for us to go steady
I told Betty that I wasn't ready
To go steady 'cause it would hurt Freddy
A girl named Gwen, she's my best friend
Known her ever since who knows when
And do you comprehend, the message that I send
Of family and friend of Grandpa Ben
Like, like, like, like, like, like that
Bound to wreck your body
And ana na na na na na na na na na ana
Cool V bring it down

[Verse One]
Aiyyo here's a tale, about a female I once messed with
Or better yet, skins that I swung eps with
Face full of grace, waist shaped like Vanessa Del Rio, oh-me-oh, my but the heffer had
Big juicy lips, wide hips you had to call fat
Stacked back to mack, yo the hooker was all that
And lots more, and baby girl I had the hots for
But I'm really not sure, who she spread the twat for
Heard it was a kid across town named Hector
But I don't give a heck, so I still went and checked her
On the down low, he ain't around so
Out of sight, out of mind, get your coat and let's go
So we dipped, hopped in the whip and we was gone
Off to City Island cause they had it goin on
Two yuks a foo, now the mood was set
Caviar at the bar, Red Star, Moet
Silk suits, spendin loot like a straight up mack
When I felt somebody finger tappin me on my back
And turn around quick, but before I could begin
All I seen was a big mac-10, aiyyo it's her boyfriend

[Hook]
"Hooker got a boyfriend!"
"Why do she do this boyfriend?"
"Ohh ahhh.. why do she do this boyfriend?"

[Verse Two]
Check it, yo
I broke camp, ran like a champ, yep I jetted
Off to the trunk for the pump, time to set it
Money kept screamin some CRAP that I dissed him
So I started lettin off {*gunshots*} but I missed him
Honey got scared, and called the five-oh
So yo, you know the half Dukes, time for me to go
Cause I ain't the type to be doin no bid
For a dame or a lame-brained punk Spanish kid
So I chill, call the hooker up the next day
She told me come over yo, bet I'm on my way
Be there in a sec, yo I'm not too far
She said, "Park around the back so he don't see the car"
Met me at the door with a kiss and a smile
I said, "Sorry about last night, money kinda wild"
"Umm yeah I know, small thing don't worry"
Just show me to your room so we can do this in a hurry
Kissed her from her earlobes down to her chest
Went for the bellybutton and to hell with the rest
Got her butt-naked and before a second passed
I had her on the bed with my fingers up her {ahh!}
Now she's ready, set for a good steady bangin
Until she looked down and seen Moby Dick hangin
She told me, "Take it easy yo trust me just chill"
Knowin once I get up in it yo I'm goin for the kill
So she spread 'em, thick rich and creamy like mayo
Aiyyo, lay-o, the tip is on the way-o
Pinned her legs back, just about to slide in
When the door burst open {*SLAM*} damn it's her boyfriend!
Did it again!

[Hook]

[Verse Three]
Now I'm mad, money done spoiled all the fun
On top of that he beefin and he ain't got a gun
Flippin the jibs, I guess he wanted to brawl
So I started hookin all butt-naked and all
Threw a right, caught money dead in the jaw
BOOM with the left and his fronts hit the floor
Now I had him, time to put his head for rest
So I beat him unconcious and I started gettin dressed
Honey all hysterical and screamin all hoarse
Said she seen a box car pullin up in the yard
Just bout to jet, yo guess what I saw
Some old big black {*HMMM*} bust in the door
"Now hold up, what the hell you doin in my house?
Get your ass off the floor, put your teeth in your mouth
Now everybody better be gone by the count of one
Look, better yet, y'all stay right here
I'm goin to get my gun"
Now that's it! Enough is enough, I ain't with it
I'm catchin mad beef and yo I ain't even hit it
Honey looked good and yo the buns was fat
But ain't a coochie in the whole WORLD worth all that
So umm, I got my coat and I was on my way
That's when she started breakin down, and beggin me to stay
Knock it off, it ain't that much beggin in the world
Next time I want some skins, I'll go and hit my own girl
Man I'm out, and I ain't tryin to see you again
So eff you, eff your pops AND YOUR FAGGOT-ASS BOYFRIEND!
..

[Hook] - repeat 2X to fade

[Intro]
I'd like to introduce myself

[Verse 1]
It's me the diabolical, Biz Mark symbolical
I shakes from scripts of hits I made a while ago
Now I'm on the run again starting other capers
And people couldn't catch me even if I was "The Vapors"
I leave you in trauma with my funky personna
'Cause I'm jamming just like Teddy but I'm nasty like Madonna
'Cause me without big strong thoughts for a Biz song
Is like Patty LaBelle not singing with a wig on
I don't give a damn if my record gets panned
'Cause my style stays fresh like I rap in Saran
When I'm sure that I'm pure like Snapple
Suppose when I write my rhymes like I'm the Big Apple
Or New York or whatever you call it, I don't even care
'Cause if I can make it there, I can make it anywhere
So, I walk the walk through the streets of New York
Got more green I can hawk cause I can talk the talk
So don't try to stalk cause my style brings more
I rock it from the Billy Ocean to the Al B. Shore!
People always want to give dap to everyone
But I've been around the world so I ahhh 

[?]

[Hook]
"I'm the Biz Markie, the human beatbox and the rap king"
"Have the people stomping to my beat you bet"
"I'm the Biz Markie, the human beatbox and the rap king"
"Have the people stomping to my beat you bet"
"I'm the Biz Markie, the human beatbox and the rap king"
"Have the people stomping to my beat you bet"
"I'm the Biz Markie, the human beatbox and the rap king"
"Have the people stomping to my beat you bet"

[Verse 2]
Take a pause for the cause 'cause this is a recording
If rap was a prison, then I be the warden
I do the Gator in my snakeskin Jordan's
And when it comes to cash I flash more than Gordon
You want me to rock the rhyme cause I got the type you crave
And I heat up jams like I was MC Microwave
And when I drop a style, call it def, call it cool
As long as you don't call me when I'm on a toilet stool
I stoke and swin in a room full of women
When I trot the globe like Meadowlark Lemon
Everywhere I've been I've seen 'em fat and thin
Even girls with hair on their chinny chin chin
But you can be just a friend if you're sporting your own look
Or if you got more chins than a Chinese phonebook
Women love my style from Cali to Long Isle
Even got my mother singing "Thanks for my Child"
My temperature rises every time I'm near a stereo
'Cause I catch dance fever like my name was Danny Terio
But I go, on and on and on and on and on and!
From midnight point to the early morning, AHHHH!

[Hook]
"I'm the Biz Markie, the human beatbox and the rap king"
"Have the people stomping to my beat you bet"  (Repeat 4x)

[Verse 3]
It's my way or the highway, I'm ahead of the slow lane
But when I ride to Motown I jump on a Soul Train
Rappers like to flow with all energy and action
But I'd rather take it nice and slow like Freddy Jackson
So don't try to stick to me like somebody's gearshift
'Cause I'll hit you so far west you'll come back Easter
The style I display, but I say it a badder way
I got more rhymes than cartoons on a Saturday
You're still confused 'cause you don't know how bad he is
Like a pregnant ______ who don't know who the daddy is
Just like a snap I can whip any rapper
That's why probably my grandparents called me a whipper snapper
You're lost in the sofa trying to cross my line
Then run to the lost and found cause you lost your mind
I'm coming on strong cause I'm dropping nothing soft
Still had it going on when "The Biz is Going Off"
I'm singing in the rain cause I got the audacity
Or some kids want to sundance with Butch Cassidy
You couldn't shine on my in the spotlight
Cause your ass couldn't shine if you sat on a flashlight

[Hook]
"I'm the Biz Markie, the human beatbox and the rap king"
"Have the people stomping to my beat you bet"  (Repeat 4x)

[Cool V]
Yo Biz, let's send this out to the propmaster Kool DJ Red Alert
Bring the beat in, Todd
Yeah, this is how we're doing it for the '93, we're on the smooth tip
Ha ha, yo Biz, kick something funky for 'em, word up

[BizMarkie]
Now people always want to know my strategy plan
For me to use the weird name as "Diabolical Man"
Well I got diabolical beats, raggedy clothes
And aw hell, I'm even wearing diabolical drawers
I'm not White as Barry cauce I'm Dirtier than Harry
With a rap that's big and fat that Mariah couldn't Carey
So don't come to me with that same ol' same ol'
Cause I'll knock your butt somewhere over the rainbow
I write rhymes that jam more than jelly
So call me the Arthur without the Fonzarelli, or Nelly
Cause I am so bad when it comes to a rap jam
Even robins scream, "Holy hip-hop Biz man!"
I grab the microphone and go every which way but loose
Cause I'm the ugly ducking that seduces Mother Goose
And I don't be using flipping tounge twisters
But I still get better in time like The Whispers
But older crews you see can't stay as loose as me
Cause old school rappers just ain't what they used to be
So up your nose with a rubber hose
And every brother knows that your style's older than my grandma's clothes
But gray skies is going to clear up, so put on a happy face
Take off that frown and chear up, and put on a happy face, cause
	I'm sing-ing-ing-ing in the rain ain ain (Repeat 7x)
	Ah ah ah ah ah

I start with a rhyme as I enter your mind
I hit so hard even Michael Jackson won't remember the time
So here I come a bombing every time I home in to
Off a funky drummer boom I get hot as Donna Summers
Cause I reigh supreme as a rap brainstorm
]From corner to corner, I'm dropping some more on ya
Not Tony Toni Tone, cause I came to warn you
That I even reign in Southern California
Everybody talking bout Biz is hype
Cause I make Dirty Harry's day, hell I even make Gladys Knight's
Soon I star on ABC because rapping DEF is the best way to the G
Alphabetically I have to lead you through
Since I'm the M-izza I know to watch my P's and Q's
Like the EMT's but the B-I-Z
I rap so picture perfect I should just stop and say "Cheese"
So if I step up, who's gonna move me back?
Cause Scooby Doo can't even do that for a Scooby Snack
You think you can, you think you can, don't even try it
Cause instead you need to can it like the Jolly Green Giant
Cause trying to step to Biz, you know I'm a diss them fast
So play like 98.7 and KISS my ass!
Cause me and rap is like peanut butter and jelly
Which reminds me of a song by my man Gene Kelly
	I'm sing-ing-ing-ing in the rain ain ain (Repeat 7x)
	Ah ah ah ah ah

Now it's the universal languange that the Biz Mark is speaking
I'm down with blacks, whites, Indian, and Puerto Rican
I'm an African descendent, myself would have say
But I was "Booooorn in the U.S.A.!"
I spent the 80's duking ladies without making babies
So I guess I'm over like a fat rat that never caught rabies
Went from messing around like Tonto with no woman in 3 years
I had one little two little three little indian
B-I-Z Markie is what it is
And if it's hard for you to spell, then just say "Biz"
I'm down with the Zoo Crew, some kids who act nutty
B-Danks, Cool V, Everett, Todd, and Jeff
They're my buddies, ha, my buddies, ha
Wherever I go, we go
I pass my April Fools in monster May
I pass by so much bull I should say "Ole!"
I got friends named Raggedy Ann and Andy
Call my "Bon appetite" cause I'm sweeter than John Candy
Don't even knock it, till you try me
Cause the proof is in the pudding, you can ask Bill Cosby
Some think I'm bragging, some think I'm boasting
But even Smokey Robinson would second that emotion
That's why I take through the sky on a natural high
Cause I'm fly-ly-ly-ly-ly, ly ly ly ly
	I'm sing-ing-ing-ing in the rain ain ain (Repeat 7x)
	Ah ah ah ah ah

[Intro]
Hey hey hey, know what I heard?
Beauty's only skin deep, ugly is to the bone

[Verse 1]
Back in the days, I'm not gonna lie
They used to say I'm ugly, a hurting guy
They would crack on my lips, and my powder
Saying I look like yuck without the house or ?Wig Howard?
]From junior high to high school they thought I was retarded
Just because the way I looked, they said I farted
I was very very sad and you wonder why
Because my looks and my gear wasn't ultra fly
I wouldn't even attempt to ask a girl out
Cause she get around her friends and began to shout"
"Guess who asked me out to the movies girlfriend
It was Mark, I told him if the world would end"
But my parents told me beauty's only skin deep
If that's true then why do girls think that I'm a creep?
I even joined the football team to get some recognition
But that didn't spark the key in a girl's ignition
They said I'm so ugly I give Anican a headache
Aw man, that is the icing on the cake!
So I kick this to all the girls from houses to huts
I don't care what you think, cause you all are nuts

[Hook]
I'm an ugly nigga, so what?
If you don't like the way I look, you can kiss my butt
I'm an ugly nigga, so what? So what? Ewwwww (Repeat 2x)

[Verse 2]
I'm a tell you story that's really bugged
About a guy with a Benz and he's dealing drugs
In the begining before he got his riches
He was so ugly, he gave me the itches
I mean, if you see him, you think I might be kooky
But homeboy looked like, um, God-zooky
I used to crack and joke and say he looked like a star
And everybody laughed when I said "Mon-star"
I can't laugh now because it's a new decade
My guzu-friend got the girls and got it made
I guess having jewels, having money, having a vehicle
Makes you sexy, handsome, gorgeous, and adorable
When you're spending money, giving girls what they want
Behind your back they talk about you say you're ugly and you front
Why do you go to bed with someone that you don't like
Just because they got a nice car like Reverend Ike
It would be wrong if he heard what you're thinking
Thinking that he look like, um, Stinking Jenkins
But let me tell you a secret, he has ESP
And this is what he whispered in my ear to me

[Hook]
I'm an ugly nigga, so what?
Just because I got loot, that's why you give me the butt?
I'm an ugly nigga, so what? So what? (Repeat 2x)
Let me tell you how poor I was

[Verse 3]
Dome to the doo, and doo to the dome
For the dome I go to school and for the doo I use a comb
Now people always ask how are these things known
Cause the dome does the doing for things that are done at home
That's why I keep a pick in my nappy fro
And for lunch I eat Ragu with my sloppy joe
But at night I be starving, like Messy Marvin
I get cheap and go settle for the White Castle bargain
They offer me a lot in the army
But I'd rather get it second hand from the Salvation Army
Cause times are getting harder than boot camp
Man I'm so poor I need to print my face on a food stamp
So if my hooptie breaks down, I just have to suffer
And tell Minekie "I'm not gonna pay a lot for this muffler!"
So I keep clear thoughts as the weeks run
But even on the beaches, they call me a beach bum
Something ain't right with me, and that really frightens me
Cause nowadays girls don't even like to sprighten me
Some say I'm embarassing, but I got some comparison
Like if I was on TV, I would be Oscar Madison
Is there another like me? Only God knows
Man I should even rap in church cause I wear holy clothes
But for now I'm just going to do the strut
And this is what I say to girls from houses to huts

[Hook]
I'm an ugly nigga, so what?
Just because I'm poor, that's why you won't give me the butt?
I'm an ugly nigga, so what? So what? (Repeat 2x)

[Hook x4]
"Huh huh huh, now what was I to do?
She's crying over me and she was feeling blue, I said" - Slick Rick (Repeat 4x)

[Verse 1]
I was walking down the street, just a minding my biz
I saw this young lady, the ultimate
She had a pair of jugs that was so fine
Then I took a look at that behind
36-24-36, I looked to her and I said "I need a fix"
I asked her the same blahzay, blahzay
Her name, where she live, and how much she weigh
I got her digits and gave her my 1-800 beeper number
You can leave a message under the name of Rhumba
I know you're bugging off the nickname, I would be too
But every time she be walking, she turns the heads of the crew
Word is bond, I wouldn't be messing
With this girl if I knew she was an adolescent
To all the guys over 21, here's the news:
It's the hip-hop version of the Young Girl Bluez

[Hook x4]

[Verse 2]
As the story goes on, I get a little deeper
I got a strange message on my 1-800 beeper
Call me looney, crazy, psychotic or dumb
But I got a good message from a girl named Rum
She said come and get me from Mickey D's at 8
That's where I work after school, pick me up for a date
I was so excited that she called my pager
But never thought to ask if she was a teenager
She mentioned going to school, but I didn't think it was high
If you saw what I saw, then you'd know why
You wouldn't believe or even think of
A bird like that could be a dove
I picked her up in my Lexus coupe
Only God knows what I'm doing is an oof
Am I robbing a cradle? I'm very confused
I'm stuck in the middle of the Young Girl Bluez

[Hook x4]

[Verse 3]
Now I was seeing her for about half a year
Everything was fine and dandy without shedding a tear
Age ain't nothing but a number, that's what Chi-Ali said
Okay, then why don't you get that through the judge's head?
Proceeding along, I must have to say
It was coming very close to her birthday
I asked "What do you want?" She said "A pair of earrings"
I never knew what an avalanche the future brings
Her birthday came and she gave a party
I arrived kind of late to the place to be
People was excited for seeing my face
If my mother ever knew, I would be a disgrace
"How old are you now?" to Rhumba-reen
I was in shock when they screamed "Sixteen!"
I felt like falling apart when I heard the news
This is the never-ending saga of the Young Girl Bluez

[Hook x4]

[Biz Markie]
Everybody just clap your hands {"no stoppin"}

The Bronx {"no stoppin"}
Long Island {"no stoppin"}
New Jersey {"no stoppin, say no stoppin"}
Yo V, bring it in
Aight, this this a special dedication
To my man DJ Hollywood
Because he was one of the first ones out there
And I-I-I'd like I'd like to sing a little song
A little something like this
To all the ladies out there, this goes out to you now
Check it out

[Verse One: Biz singing]
Ooooh, whoa-whoa
No wayyyyyyyyy, no wayyyyyyyy
For you to stop me now
I'm the kind of guy that could really turn you on
Give you so much lovin, and treat you on
Just hold me close and hold me tight
And let's make love tonight
And I swear to you baby, I'll treat you right
If you're the kind of girl that I've been lookin for
Be real good to me baby, let me be adored
I don't stop the way I'm feelin
Just keep on turnin me on

Somebody say well (well) - WELLLLL! (WELLLLL!)
There ain't no way to stop me now, come on
Let me here you say welll (welll) - oh well (oh well)
WELLLLLLL-LLLLLLLL-LLLLLLL

[Verse Two: Biz singing]
Did you ever see a girl, and thought she didn't care
Did you ever feel like cryin, and think you'd get nowhere
Did you ever see her comin, when the lights were down below
Did you ever whisper GOD I LOVE HER, but how much you never know
Did you ever look into her eyes and see a little prayer
Could you sew a spot, flow to her heart
And think that you were there?
Did you ever wonder where she is, or wonder if she's true?
One day you'll be happy
But that next day you'll be blue

[Chorus]
That's why I say well (well) - it feels so good to me
WELLLLL (WELLLLL) - you know just how to set me FREEEEEEE
Say LET ME LET ME LET ME LET ME
LET ME LET ME TURN YOU ON, ooooooooohhhhh

Whenever I see her face (where you goin brotherman?)
I take a trip to a beautiful plaaaaaaaaace
Say LET ME LET ME LET ME LET ME
LET ME LET ME TURN YOU ON, ooooooooohhhhh

[Interlude Two]
Whenever we're up close
It's your perfume I love the mooooooooooost
Say LET ME LET ME LET ME LET ME
LET ME LET ME TURN YOU ON, ooooooooohhhhh

[Verse Three: Biz singing]
When all the other fellas try to run that game on you
I wanna show you baby a love that's true
A love that's good, and a love that's fine
Somethin to blow your mind
Talkin bout a love of the freakiest kind
Because you got eyes like a-water
Lips so rosey red
Everytime I see you really turns my head
And I'm the kind of guy, that love you all for me
And everybody know my name is (BIZ-MAR-KIE)

[Chorus]

[Biz singing]
Say, well, WELLLLLLLLLLLL

Well, well, well!

[* alternate version of Party to the Break-A-Day off the Weekend Warrior LP]

[Verse 1: Biz Markie]
Hey, how you're doin, it's me
The unforgettable incredible B
-i-z M-a-r-k-i with the e
I got more rhymes than Muhammad Ali
The way I get down you'll say
"Damn, the B-i-z always makes my day"
My style is untangible when you hear
Cause the brother on the mic is most debonnaire
On the DJ tip I'm like savoir-faire
Cause you can probably find me anywhere
I'm the best from the west, I'm the beast from the east
I am old school like a permanent crease
Like Scooby-Doo or a Chuckie doll
You better grab a Snickers cause you gonna be here for a while
For all the new schoolers, relax and chill
As the Diabolical just tell ya the deal

[Chorus]
Come party
With the Biz Markie
And ain't no party
Without Biz Markie

[Verse 2: Biz Markie]
Now let me tell you how I started in '92
When I was deejayin in Jersey in Howard Hughes
I did homecomings from UVa to James Madison
I did the Tunnel with Flex and caught L in Patterson
Now I graduated with DJ Love
From ( ? ) Virginia, NC and the Q Club
People looked at me and said, "Why you deejayin?
I like Just a Friend and your rhyme-sayin"
So the transition from rapper to DJ wasn't smooth
But I still pursued cause I had somethin to prove
July 4th and Labor Day in Virginia was hot
Cause Biggie Smalls and Teddy Riley was in the spot
From the relays to all the Greek picnics
And all the football ( ? ) and Atlanta Freakniks
To all the girls in g strings and thongs
If you're with me, just sing along

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Biz Markie]
I got so much on my mind like my name was Chuck D
That when it comes to deejayin I'm a Public Enemy
I rock all colors, races and ages
When the crowds see me go crazy they think I'm outrageous
I rocked Sinbad, Essence and the Grammy's
All Magic Johnson joints, even in Miami
First Fridays from Philly to the Lou
( ? ) and Alex know what I can do
Chicago with Corey, Detroit with D. Archer
New York with Gator, Lenny Smith and Lenny the Barber
I rocked all the joints for Eddie Murphy and ( ? )
Still get down and dirty in Newark, Elizabeth
Rock ( ? ) Orlando
Even go across seas to London and Tokyo
I rocked weddings from Toni Braxton to Boyz II Men's Shawn
And this is what they say on and on

[Chorus]

[INTRO: Cool V]
Uh
As we take you Uptown
Downtown
We got a little somethin for the ladies

[Biz Markie]
If you don't know what a dime is
It means that you're a 10, baby, you know what I'm sayin
On a scale from 1 to 10, you know what I'm sayin baby, yeah
This goes out to all the beautiful ladies out there
Whether you're skinny, fat
No hair, long hair, it don't matter
Peace

[Cool V]
Yeah
And that's from Cool V and the B-i-z
We're doin this strictly for the ladies this time
Word up
And to all the ladies
If we didn't you get you on this version
We got you on the remix
So just step to us, give us your name, your number
I ain't gon' say it, baby
Haha

We outta here baby
Turn me off B

[Verse 1]
Now this may sound disgusting and like very gross
But it's sure to have you trippin', so yo, listen close
It's not bright as the sun or sweet like sugar
But it's rather on the bug tip and it's called Pickin' Boogers
Now what I'm sayin' might not be kosher to you
But it's still somethin' we all have to do
So go up your nose with a finger or two
And pull out one or a crusty crew
Yo, don't try to front like it's so gloomy and gray
'Cause we all pick our boogers some time every day
Whether out in the open or on a sneak tip
With a finger, tissue, or even a Q-Tip
Take it from the Biz Markie because I'm jokin'
And also, remember this slogan
"Hey, ma, what's for dinner?
Go up your nose and pick a winner"

[Hook]
Pickin' Boogers (4x)

[Verse 2]
Let me tell you what happened on the train, man
I was coolin' one day with my partner Kane
Headed up to the Rooftop, ridin' the D train
When the man sittin' next to me was so profane
He'd stick his finger up his nose, damn near to his brain
(You should 'a moved)
I was just about, but all of a sudden, homeboy just pulled out
A big green slimy — nah, I'm not neven gonna say it
But it weighed a good pound if you tried to weigh it
He sat there for a while with it in his hand
So I tried to play cool and like ignore the man
So I laid my head back to catch a quick a nap
All of a sudden he plucked it dead in my lap
Now Kane sat there laughing like it was all a joke
But a brother like Biz Markie had almost choked
So I dug up my nose and pulled out about five
And plucked every last one of them dead in his eye
Then the man jumped up and said "What's wrong with you?"
And wiped them off his face and said "I can't mess with you!"
Like if I did something that was so full of shame
But yo, you got to know the name of the game

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Hmmm....
Now let me take a trip down memory lane
Back in public school with my partner Kane
When I was class clown, and he was my brother
Sittin' at the desk pluckin' boogers at each other
Never doin' work as we was supposed
'Cause we was too busy diggin' up our nose
And in the lunchroom you would talk about rude
God forbid the person that'd leave his food
No matter who you are we didn't give a damn
We even put teachers down with the program
Whether if it was a woman or if you a man
We put boogers on our fingers then shake ya hand
Catch anyone from anywhere
But the best fun about it catchin' Kane out there
Especially when we playin' ball in the gym
I put boogers on the basketball and pass it to him
Now we're grown up and things have changed
But we still be playin' the pickin' boogers game
Just last night, when Kane was gettin' ready
I slipped a little green one inside his spaghetti

[Hook]

[Verse 4]
Let me tell you what happened to me with this girl...
One night at Latin Quarters I was standin' at ease
I saw this gorgeous young lady that I wanted to skeez
I didn't show enough that I really did want it
So, no half steppin', I pushed up on it
Pulled out the gold cable and I knocked her with phat
Had a spotlight beamin' on my Biz Marck hat
But when she stepped in the light and she got real close
I saw a tiny weeny booger on the tip of her nose
She was dressed real def and her body was hooked
But that dried up booger just ruined her look
I wanted to tell her about it but I couldn't be bold
So I played if off and said "that's a cute green mole"
I was hopin' from that she would wipe it away
But she didn't do nothin' I guess she wanted it to stay
I said before you get my number, I don't mean to diss you
But write it in your hand because you're gonna need the tissue

[Verse 1: Biz Markie]
This goes out to all the beautiful ladies
18 to 80, blind, crippled or crazy
No matter what nationality or persuasian
Black beauty or Asian or Causasian
No discrimination, I love all the nations
Whether you're Jamaican, Hawaiian or Haitian
( ? ) what a man don't got
And just for that I wanna thank you a lot
Word is bond, y'all look so good
Every time I see ya in my neighborhood
My crew bugs out when they're in the party
Instead of baby got back baby got body
Cause you're all shapes and sizes, look good in jeans
Wanna do me somethin juicy, I know what they mean
I'm not tryin to be nasty, I'm just keepin it real
This goes out to my people who know how I feel

[Chorus: Lil' Kal] + (Biz Markie)
(All you ladies in the nice tight jeans)
You look good to me
(All you ladies in the nice tight skirts)
You look good to me
(All you ladies in the nice tight shorts)
You look good to me
(All you ladies in the nice tight ( ? ))
You look good to me

[Verse 2: Biz Markie]
Now that you kknow what I'm talkin about
I know you will agree without a reasonable doubt
Nothing's like a nice derriere
Looks so good, it's just not fair
Now let me tell you a story about a girl named Judy
Was a 5 in the face, but had a real nice booty
It was so soft and mesmerizin
I met her in Jersey by ( ? )
Oh my goodness, I almost lost my mind
When I saw this hee-haw that was so divine
Now I would usually just kept goin
But it hypnotized me the way she was throwin
I said, "You want a burger and fries with that shake?"
She said, "No, I want shrimp, lobbster and a steak"
Bein Rockefeller is not my duty
The only reason I changed my mind is because..

[Chorus: Lil' Kal]
You look good to me

[Verse 3: Biz Markie]
Tell you what happened to me while I was mindin my biz
I came across a girl by the name of Liz
Puerto Rican or Spanish, almost went frantic
For bein a 10 she was a body mechanic
I was bee-beein on what I was seein
It's like Pocahontas jumped out the TV, an
Hourglass shape that made me go ape
Ask Lil' Mo, she was a 'superwoman' with a cape
She couldn't speak no English, I had Fat Joe with me
So he could tell me what she was sayin about me
She said, "I like papi with big belly"
I said, "Why'd you tell her in Spanish that I want her tele
-phone," now you know it's on
Like hot butter on say what, the popcorn
I had to have that cause she's a cutie
And you know the other reason why is because..

[Chorus: Lil' Kal]
You look good to me
When I walk through the club what do I see
A real fly cutie
You look good to me
You look good to me
That ass is fat
Oh Lord, yeah
You yeah, oh, look good
Oh yeah
Everytime I walk by
I wanna look in your eye
And you look so fly
Oh yeah
When I walk through the club what do I see
A real fly cutie lookin at me
I wanna

[Verse 1]
On the mic at this time in the place to be
I'm the Inhuman Orchestra called Biz Markie
That made you dance, make the music with my mouth, and all
But I'm here to talk about the Albee Square Mall
A place where people shop in downtown Brooklyn
Where I can be found if you're lookin'
For me, the B-i-z, so just come check me out
'Cause 24/7 I'm mikin' the house
So when I come in the Mall, and then I start to roam
You wouldn't think it's a store, you would think it's my home
'Cause when I come in the place, then I hang up a sign
Reads "Home sweet home" - this house is mine

[Chorus: T.J. Swan]
Albee Square Mall
My house is the Albee Square Mall
My house is the Albee Square Mall
My house is the Albee Square Mall

[Verse 2]
I been to many malls from state to state
But I've never been in, say, one this great, I hate
To say, about the other shopping centers that's left
But the Albee Square Mall is the doo-doo-def
I be in there everyday, walkin' around chillin'
From when they opened all the way until when
It's about time for the place to close
I'm just running things like a pair of panty hose
They all know me, the Biz Markie
I get more respect than the average employee
Could work in every store in the mall
Because the place is my house from wall to wall
If I could move in, party people, I just might
So I could stay forever, and it won't be just like
A bum that you see sleepin' on a park bench
So how will it be when you see Biz Markie
I fade them all, been havin' fun
See, to me this mall is like number one
And any other shoppers there that try to compare
There ain't no way they could hang out with Albee Square

[Chorus: T.J. Swan]
Albee Square Mall
My house is the Albee Square Mall
My house is the Albee Square Mall
My house is the Albee Square Mall

[Verse 3]
I step in the place and shop around for a while
Buy some jewelry for Treny and Ali, and after that I'll
Go take a stroll inside of Gibb's Pups
Then buy some fresh silks, Bally's too
Next stop Olympic, wanted to buy some sneakers
Then hit the Game Room to pick me up a Cesar
Stroll around with a fly female
While security's riffin' about leanin' on the rail
After that I go eat some food at Wendy's
In the Albee cafeteria, could be shoppin' plenty
From store to store just stuffin' face
And I do the pfrr-one-two while sayin' my grace
Finally I step off all alone
Up to the top level to use the telephone
Never use a quarter, 'cause I got a calling card
So I can reach out and touch everybody I know
That's where I be until the day is done
Just coolin' in the place that's number one
So next time you'll be in Brooklyn walkin' around
Play like "Price Is Right" and "come on down"
And

[Chorus: T.J. Swan]
Go shoppin'
Go shoppin'
Go shop - let's all go shoppin' (3x)

Go shoppin'
Go shoppin'
Go shoppin' - Swan and Biz go shoppin'

La-la-lala
La-la-la-la-lala (till end)

[Biz gives shout-outs]

[Verse One]
I'm the Biz Markie, I'm known for beatboxin and rap
And now it's time, to put Long Island on the map
And lettin you know, that it'll put you in a trance
It's somethin funny made by me and it's called the Biz Dance
I think the way I do it is so unique
By the way I move my hands hips legs and feet
But if you think that you can master it you got a fat chance
Cause it's very difficult to do, what is it called?

[Hook]
The Biz Mark, Biz Mark.. the Biz Mark, Biz Mark
The Biz Mark, Biz Mark.. the Biz Mark, Biz Mark, Biz Mark

[Verse Two]
The Biz Mark Dance, is second to none
I'll explain at the moment how it should be done
Kick your legs 'til your pants almost rip
Shake from side to side, witcha arms and hips
While you're doin it, if you mess up your hair
Then you know party people that you're halfway there
They've heard of Biz Markie all the way in France
And the kids in AntARCTICA is doin my dance!

[Hook] - 2X w/ ad libs

[Interlude]
Now everybody out there that wanna learn the Biz Dance
Come up to the front, all the ladies to one side
And all the homeboys to one side
And I'mma show you how you should do it
You should throw one leg to one side
And then throw the other leg up to the other side
Then throw your leg up above your head
And then, this the way you do it
One.. two..
One, two, three, here!

"Go Biz Mark! Go Biz Mark! Go Biz Mark! Go Biz Mark!"
"Go Biz Mark! Go Biz Mark! Go Biz Mark! Go Biz Mark!"
"Go Biz Mark! Go Biz Mark! Go Biz Mark! Go Biz Mark!"
"Go Biz Mark! Go Biz Mark!"

Hempstead, Greenport, everywhere can do the Biz Dance
Manhattan, Lincoln Projects in Colonial can do the Biz Dance
Even the Bronx Co-Op City Bronx River can do the Biz Dance

[Verse 1]
Yes, y'all and, to the like beat and
You could either dance or just have a seat and
Listen to the way and, what I am displaying
A different kind of rapper language that I am saying
To all the party people that absorbs the info
When it come to rocking parties I am a nympho
Maniac, brainiac for doing my dance
And my record Make the Music will put you in a trance and
Hypnotize your body and, like you do Bacardi and
You won't be fighting or illing, you just be partying
Down, with the funky sound with yours truly
I'm the original B-I-Z M-A-R-K-I but the E
I came to have fun and, not be number one and
Just here to let you know, who's like running the place
And everywhere that I perform and do a show
As long as you know that...

Nobody beats the Biz

[Verse 2]
You know me as the B-I-Z M-A-R-K-I-E and
I go for what I know doing a show for human beings
I'm guaranteed to rock I make the ladies scream and shout
I'm bound to wreck your body and say turn the party out
The Mardi rapper toe-tapper always having fun
And when you hear the Biz Markie, I get the job done
Yes I'm the M-A-R the K-I-E you know that's me
I got the stutter step to keep in check my speed is so unique
They say I look and sound funny but I don't be caring
I rock the Latin Quarter, Rooftop, Union Square and
Roseland, the Heartthrob, Madison Square Garden
Even rocked for the World’s Fair at Javits Center
Pardon the way that I be talking 'bout the places I be rocking
I love to perform for the people that be clocking
Not sayin that you're on mine or on it like a hornet
But you pay for a good performance, doggone it, you want it
That's why I'm here, to be like letting you knowing
That I'mma highly recognized as the king of discoing
Making people laugh and have a lot of enjoyment
I'm the best person for this type of employment
That's why...

[Verse 3]
On and on to the break of dawn
When you buy food cheap, you need a coupon
Or catch a sale retail, before it gets stale
So hurry up and get the WIC check out the mail
And shop non-stop, but how I hip-hop
On the mic and like make you co-op-
-erate with the rhythm, that is what I give 'em
Reagan is the Pres but I voted for Shirley Chisholm
It might sound confusing, the style that I'm using
But in the end I'm sure that you will find it quite amusing
And funny, oh honey, it's just ridiculous
Don't try to front, come on and admit you was
Thrilled, chilled, your heart was fulfilled
So respect the architect as I begin to build
Science and my reliance is upon my rap
Like Carl Lewis I get to it, so let's go the lap

[Hook: TJ Swan]
Nobody beats the Biz
(Nobody beats the Biz)
Nobody beats the Biz
(Nobody beats the Biz)
Nobody beats the Biz
(Nobody beats the Biz)
Nobody beats the Biz
(Nobody beats the Biz)

[Verse 1]
Hey to everybody and, people that say partyin
It's time to hear a funky rhyme from me the Biz Markie again
As I just display 'em, the way I like say 'em
The stutter steppin style that I use to amuse and HEY
I'm the original, hellified king-ing
For freaky sound, for throwin down, and you know that I'm bringing
The crowd to enjoyment, by what I do
Like {*ah-oww-oww WAHHAZOOW, boom, ah one two*}
I keep the people cheerin, because of what they hearin
Movin and groovin, to a devestatin sound that's glarin
Because they're in the mood for me
The B-I-Z the Emmezah-Emmezah-A-R-K-I-E
The party rippin, never trippin, king of crowd pleasin
I can turn it out without a doubt in any season
I entertain crowds, a million and thous'
Homeboys makin noise, as I do browse through a girl's blouse
Say the funky rhyme to make the girls get naked
I can turn it out, with different sounds on my record
That I say give 'em, as y'all exault the rhythm
The magnificent record maker of Prism

[Hook]
The Biz, Mark, is, ah goin off
The Biz, Mark, is, ah goin off
The Biz, Mark, is, ah goin off
The Biz {*"Go off, go off!"*}
The Biz, Mark, is, ah goin off
The Biz, Mark, is, ah goin off
The Biz, Mark, is, ah goin off
The Biz {*"Go off, go off!"*}

[Verse 2]
Ha ha ha ha ha! Check out this bizarre
Rappin style used by me, the B-I-Z
Emm-A-R-K-I with the E and, you will be agreein
A brother ain't a brother unless he is say like G'n
Up with his technique and, keep the people freakin
Like me the Biz Markie because my style is so unique and
Guaranteed to rock the mic with rhymes that I say
I'm just as good as Clint Eastwood, so won't you make my day
Markie the original, yes I am the boss
And I can rock the microphone for you and yours
Go {*boom, ah one two*} 'til my voice is hoarse
Then take a pause, annnd you know, of course
I can rock a party, with so much force
I'm the greatest entertainer Marley came across
Puttin pictures in photomat to give 'em a gloss
And I don't eat spaghetti without the meat sauce
Whether Ragu, Prego, Hunt's or Aunt Millie
You wanna get dissed? Then try to get illy
With me the inhuman, because I'm like boomin
Reagan is the Pres, but so was Harry Truman

[Hook]
The Biz, Mark, is, ah goin off
The Biz, Mark, is, ah goin off
The Biz, Mark, is, ah goin off
The Biz {*"Go off, go off!"*}
The Biz, Mark, is, ah goin off
The Biz, Mark, is, ah goin off
The Biz, Mark, is, ah goin off
The Biz {*"Go off, go off!"*}

[Verse 3]
Now! I make rhymes, each and every day
And always seem to come up with somethin fresh to say
In January, February, March April May
And the other seven months of the year, but anyway
Hey, feel the lay okay, here's a rhyme I must display
When I'm finished you be in it sayin HIP HIP HOORAY!
I will be an emcee, 'til I'm old and grey
And I can even rock the mic with tooth decay, decay
Yo - ladies of the 80's know that I'm the
Original B-I-Z-M-A-R-K-I say with an E
You know me, and my man Big Daddy
I can't forget, Cutmaster Cool V
And my partner, my best friend TJ Swannie
Rockin the mic would say most definitely
So listen don't be missin, I will never be dissin
I just rock the mic, and always have discipline
Listen to the brother ain't no other you discover
I rock up the mic just like if I'm, your, mother!

[Outro]
Go Biz Mark! Go Biz Mark!
(Repeat to fade)
{*Cool V cuts and scratches his own name*}

[Biz Markie]
I'ma make this brief, like about 30 seconds
My DJ, gets all of his respect in
Super crazy blendin, so he can sound groovy
And it can only be the vibe of Cutmaster Cool V
When he cuts the funky record, it sounds so like def
And it can be SMOOTH, from right to left
But now I'ma shut up and step off from the action
It's Cool V give you hits, he do the funky scratchin
Cool V go ahead!

{*Cool V scratches his own name again and "I do damage!"*}

[Biz Markie]
Yo, I'd like to tell you about my DJ

So check him out without a doubt and you will agree
He goes by the name of Cutmaster Cool V
Cut the funky records, for me and the crew and
You will agree that he will be pursuin
A career, and like I have no fear
For when he cut the funky records he won't be dissapear
Now you think of rockin and MC's know

{*Cool V scratches his own name again and "I do damage!"*}

[Markie] Yo, I'm I'm bringin it back out

[Markie] It's gon' be called, "The Return.. of the Biz Mark"

[repeat 16X]
Go Biz Mark!

[Verse One]
I'm the Biz Markie, I'm known for beatboxin and rap
And now it's time, to bring my funky dance back
And once again, puttin you in a trance
In case you all forgot it it's called the Biz Dance
A movement by the body that's made like a puppet
I'm here to bring it back, and party people love it
So everybody knowin, and those who wanna learn
Get up and move your body as I return

[Chorus: Biz Markie + sample]

[Biz Markie] Wit the Biz Mark, Biz Mark..

[repeat 4X] Go Biz Mark!

[Biz Markie] Wit the Biz Mark, Biz Mark..

[repeat 4X] Go Biz Mark!

[Biz Markie] Wit the Biz Mark, Biz Mark..

[repeat 4X] Go Biz Mark!

[Biz Markie] Wit the Biz Mark, Biz Mark..

[repeat 4X] Go Biz Mark!

[Verse Two]
Well I'm here to show you like a dance that never dies
That's put inside within yo' TV Guide
A movement of the body that can't be beat
It's like done by the creatures on Sesame Street
Now I can move my body when I'm dancin at a party
Like a ballerina that's drunk on Bacardi
I start to think of pop-and-twist
You think James Brown is wild - ah - bust this!

[Chorus]

[Interlude]
Now, this is dedicated to everybody out there that know how to do it
And those who wanna learn, this how you do it
You gotta get FUNKY!  You can't get funky you got to get SILKY!
You can't get silky, you got to get DOO DOO!
And this the way you gotta do it, a little somethin
You gotta like, swing your hips like this and jump
And then you gotta throw your hand up to your head
And then your leg gotta hit your ear
And then your hand gotta hit your head
And your leg gotta hit your ear and jump
And this the way to do it
Say one.. two.. one, two, three
Go, go, go Biz Mark!  Go, go, go Biz Mark!
Go, go, go Biz Mark!  Go, go, go Biz Mark!
Go, go, go Biz Mark!  Go, go, go Biz Mark!
Go, go, go Biz Mark!  Go, go, go Biz Mark!

[Verse Three]
Now all the party people that's standin still
Get on the dancefloor and let's all get ill
Kick your legs 'til the right is into the left
And do a dance that is known as the DOO DOO DEF
Because to this day, it's still kickin live
And if I dance with y'all I will revive it
It is of the words and isn't goin away
I will make it come back like Sugar Ray

[Chorus] w/o Biz Markie

[Biz Markie]
Ah one two, ah one two
Ah one two, ah one two
I'd like to.. introduce myself..
My name is.. ah Biz Markie..

[Verse One]
Well I'm the human orchestra called Biz Markie
Makin' music orally is my specialty
When I go {*BOOM*} ah one two, girls get excited
When they hear my lyrics they wanna recite 'em
I know y'all in the mood, just go with the flow
And I can play rappin' records and all disco
Like "Beat It," "Billie Jean," by Michael Jackson
Or the Treacherous Three record, they call "Action"
When you hear me do it, you will be shocked and amazed
It's the brand new thing they call the human beatbox craze

[Hook]
Make the music with your mouth, biz!
{*Biz Markie beatboxes*}
Make the music with your mouth, biz!
{*Biz Markie beatboxes*}
Make the music with your mouth, biz!
{*Biz Markie beatboxes*}

[Verse Two]
Well I don't just do the beatbox, I rock on the mic
And all the rhymes that I say, all the people like
I get the crowd jumpin', get the girl's hearts pumpin'
All the party people say, "Isn't he somethin?"
Rock from New York City all the way down South
Sayin rhymes and makin music, with my mouth
I'mma tell you party people how I began
It started when I'm livin' in Long Is-land
Hey when I was a kid I used to play in the streets
Makin sounds with my mouth, all sorts of beats
Grown people, used to say - WHAT?
Grown people, used to say - WHAT'S..
.. wrong with that kid makin that strange noise
It was like, for all the fly girls and all the homeboys
Then I tried it at a homeboy's basement par-ty
They thought it was a record, they ain't know it was me
When they came by the DJ, and saw who it is
They said, "Make the music with your mouth, Biz!"

[Hook]

{*song continues as just a beat for a while*}

[Verse Three]
It may look and sound easy doin the human beatbox
But it's real difficult, even knocked me out my socks
It's a movement combination with your lip tongue and throat
Use your teeth and your nose for a mysterious high note
I like doin it as a hobby or a job
People treat me like a star and surround me in the mall
It's not all about, spittin', breathin' hard and chewin'
You need practice, be ambitious in the schoolin'
Let me tell you party people, you gotta admit
Anything than you want you gotta work hard for it
That's why I like doin sounds, that's hard to achieve
Makin two or three sounds at one time you can't believe
When I walk down the street, people crowd around me
And say, "HOW YOU MAKE ALL THEM SOUNDS at one time, Biz Markie?"
I tell 'em it takes a lot of practice, and lip control
I've been doin it since, fifteen years old
And everywhere I do it, the people say I'm good
I even get big respect in my own neighborhood
I'm tellin' you a fact, it's just like it is
Even moms, pops, and cops say, "Whattup, Biz?"
Everywhere I go, I always rocked the boat
Gonna end this rhyme, with this one note
Not gonna act conceited and say I'm the best
But I'm guaranteed to pass any kind of test
I say def rhymes, with funky fresh lyrics
When I do the beat the party people go into HYSTERICS!

[Hook]

[Verse Four]
You heard the beginning, now here's the sequel
All human beatboxes is not created equal
That's why I'm here, to say today
That I'm doin my beat in a special way
Makin musical tunes, orally, I have perfected
I'm very well known, and greatly respected
I like to thank people, without no doubt
Peace hi party people it's time to break ou--

[Outro - singing while Biz beatboxes]
Make the music.. make the music..
MAKE THE MUSIC.. with your mouth!
Make the music.. make the music..
MAKE THE MUSIC.. with your mouth!
Make the music.. make the music..
MAKE THE MUSIC.. with your mouth!
Make the music.. make the music..
MAKE THE MUSIC.. with your mouth!

MAKE THE MUSIC.. with your mouth!

{*Biz continues beatboxing and scatting to the end*}

[BizMarkie]
I was sittin home, all alone
When I heard the ring, on my telephone
I picked it up, to see who could it be
This girl I just met, her name was Tammy
See I was surprised, cause she called me first
She was one of the baddest in the universe
I was just buggin cause she gave me a ring
It was a Monday, and it started off with a bang
She start the conversation over how was your weekend
I did this that and the other with my friend Monique
And Shaneeda, (She need a new hairdo?) We both laughed
How you long you gonna be home?  I gotta take a bath
So I gave her two hours then I called her back
You know I was ready, when I rolled a headcrack
Cause when I asked, can I?  She cut me off so tough and
I gotta call you back - aww baby, you busy doin NUTTIN

Chorus: BizMarkie's crew and the Diabolical

	B.D.N., B.D.N., B (repeat 2X)
	You're busy doin NUTTIN
	B.D.N., B.D.N., B (repeat 2X)
	You're busy doin NUTTIN
	B.D.N., B.D.N., B (repeat 2X)
	You're busy doin NUTTIN
	B.D.N., B.D.N., B
	B.D.N., B.D.N., BEEEEEEE!!

[BizMarkie]
Let me tell you a story bout a girl named Gilda
She was from out of state, I was wonderin will the
Same thing happen to me like the deja vu
Let me keep quiet, and go into a tale
See I was chillin at the Chapter 3
Word is bond she looked divine, she looked as fly as can be
I thought she was different cause she was by herself
She looked real wholesome, and in good physical health
I walked by, she said hi
Ain't you the B-I-Z-the-emmaza-emmaza-A-R-K-I
I said yes can I have the number to your home
Are you allowed to call Jersey on your phone?
She chuckled we exchanged, I went home joked about it
How she was gonna be mine, with no doubt about it
But everytime I call I say whassup muffin?
I'm doin somethin now - aww baby, you busy doin NUTTIN

Chorus

[BizMarkie]
Ahhhh, don't give me that!
The last episode was at a club in the Bronx
I was rockin with Capri who got a good response
It was Backspin June, and Limo Driver Mike
You chill in the car, cause clubs he didn't like
So me and V went in just to look around
Seein girls that had bass with sense around
Then we all got on stage and rocked the house
There were no fights in, not even out
Slide, then we got in the car
Saw two trillzadills shinin like a star
One was with Mike, the other was with June
Yo it's not gonna be theirs for soon
So V got with Mike and hooked me with her sister
If I knew she was like that, I woulda had dissed her
Cause everytime me and V called them both up and
They both were busy?!  Nah - they're busy doin NUTTIN
Chorus 3X

[BizMarkie - speaking over last 2X]
Ahhhh, don't even give me that!
That's junk
This goes out to all you bitches doin nuttin
Ka-ka-cause that's all you be doin
Am-am-I right B, am I right Doc
Am I right Shell, am I right V
Am I right am I right Sahai, am I right ?
They don't be busy doin NUTTIN
They go nowhere fast and then go backwards
With Bart Simpson in the background
All of a sudden roll like they got shot by the Apollo though
Word up, I didn't even.. okay
Bblabaldblablballl, ah!!

[Intro]
Radio, TV, and even the press
Know the meanin' of V-A-P-O-R-S
The meanin' of this word without no doubt
Means nobody wants to be there when you’re down and out
Once you’re established and got a lot of money
Everybody wanna be your buddy and honey
Like tall buildings they call skyscrapers

[Verse 1]
Can you feel it, nothing can save ya
For this is the season of catching the vapors
And since I got time, what I'm gonna do
Is tell you how this spreaded throughout my crew
Well you all know TJ Swan who sang on my records
"Make the Music", "Nobody Beats the Biz", well, check it
Back in the days before this began
He used to try to talk to this girl name Fran
The type of female with fly Gucci wear
With big truck jewelry and extensions in her hair
When Swan tried to kick it, she always fessed
Talking about "Nigga please, you work for UPS"
Since he wasn't no type of big drug dealer
My man TJ Swan didn't appeal to her
But now he trucks gold and wear fly Bally boots
Rough leather fashion and tough silk suits
Now she stop fronting and wants to speak and
Be coming to all the shows every single weekend
To get his beeper number, she'd be begging please
Dying for the day to get skeezed

[Hook]
She caught the vapors
She caught the vapors
She caught the vapors
She caught the vapors

[Verse 2]
I got another partner that's calm and plain
He goes by the name of the Big Daddy Kane
A mellow type of fellow that's laid back
Back in the days he was nothing like that
I remember when he used to fight every day
What grown-ups would tell him he would never obey
He wore his pants hanging down and his sneakers untied
And a rasta-type Kangol tilted to the side
Around his neighborhood people treated him bad
And said he was the worst thing his moms ever had
They said that he will grow up to be nothing but a hoodlum
Or either in jail, or someone would shoot him
But now he's grown up, to their surprise
Big Daddy got a hit record selling worldwide
Now the same people that didn't like him as a child
Be saying can I borrow a dollar, ooh, you're a star now

[Hook]
They caught the vapors
They caught the vapors
They caught the vapors
They caught the vapors

[Verse 3]
Now I got a cousin by the name of Vaughan Lee
Better known to y'all as Cutmaster Cool V
He cuts, scratch, transform with finesse
{imitates cuts and scratches} and all that mess
Well I remember when he first started to rock
And tried to get this job in a record shop
He was in it to win it but the boss fronted
Said, "Sorry Mr. Lee, but there's no help wanted"
Now my cuz Vaughan still tried on and on and on
'Til the like break of dawn
To put this J-O-B in effect
But they'd look right past him and be like, "Next"
Now for the year of '88
Cool V is making dollars so my cousin's like straight
He walks into the same record shop as before
And the boss be like, "Vaughan, welcome to my store"
Offering him a job but naw, he don't want it
Damn, it feels good to see people up on it
'Cause I remember when at first they wasn't
Now guess what they caught from my cousin
The vapors

[Hook]
They caught the vapors
They caught the vapors
They caught the vapors
They caught the vapors

[Verse 4]
Last subject of the story is about Biz Mark
I had to work for mine to put your body in park
When I was a teenager, I wanted to be down
With a lot of MC-DJ'ing crews in town
So in school on Nobel Street, I say "Can I be down, champ"
They said no and treated me like a wet food stamp
After getting rejected I was very depressed
Sat and wrote some def doo-doo rhymes at my rest
When I used to come to parties they'd make me pay
I would have to beg to get on the mic and rap that day
I was never into girls, I was just into my music
They acted like I wanted to keep it instead of trying to use it
But now things switched, without belief
"Yo, Biz, do you remember me from Noble Street, chief?
We used to be down back in the days"
It happens all the time and never cease to amaze

[Hook]
They caught the vapors
They caught the vapors
They caught the vapors
They caught the vapors
Hey I'd like to tell you a little story
About my man named Dee
Yo, even from when he was little
He was like kinda on a tough tip
Doin all that stuff
But, I'mma tell you the way..
.. it should really go like..
.. the way he would say it now check this out

When I was young, he always dreamed of bein rich
But compared to then, that'd been a big switch
Drivin big cars, wearin rings and ropes
But man without a plan all he had was hopes
So he sat down, and thought, what he wanted to be
But it seems, no occupation had appeal to Dee
He didn't wanna be a doctor, he don't like school
It wasn't that he was dumb, he just thought he was too cool
Cause all the moneymakers and the big-time crooks
He never ever seen NONE of them carryin books
He used to be on the block, do whatever they pleased
Never had a nine to five, but STILl clocked G's
Harold Reuben, Freewood Ave would make a man of them too
And he thought, yeah that's the life, he wanna do like they do
So he start to flip and cut class with the big boys
Take other kids toys, cause he didn't dig noid
He'd rather run the block and watch the hustlers play
And he'll say, he wanna be just like that one day
He used to run in the stores, steal cookies and candy bars
Watchin the pimps roll by in they fancy cars
But never did the thought even pass
At the time, he 'posed to have his behind in class
So when report cards came, all he received was a F jack
And he got his neck smacked, for cold gettin left back
But yet and still, he didn't care
Cause to him, school's for the birds so he didn't belong there
When he was only eight he hung out with the pros
And he went, from stealin candy, to boostin clothes
He used to dip out the class, go straight to the mall
And he'll take, ANYTHING from anybody at all
His neighbors used to ask his mother "Brown what's WRONG witcha child?
He done ROBBED my damn house again, yo that kid is buck wild.."
Yo, I don't know whassup, but he be BUGGIN word up
Yo that yo.. I'm just sayin like this
I don't whassup, but
I think you will understand a little bit more of the situation
I'mma say like he would say it, on this second part
So just check this out aight?
Just kick it one two three, go head, go head man, go head

He was a crook -- at the age of nine
Do whatever it took -- he'll ROB YOU BLIND
Snatchin pocketbooks, robbin blind ol men
Way back WHEN.. when he was only ten
Then when he was in 5th grade, he carried a switchblade
Tried to stay rich to keep him and his bitch paid
And if he ever had to travel somewhere far
Take a bus? PSSH - HE'D GO STEAL HIM A CAR!
He'd always choose to live his life the wild way
Tag?! Russian Roulette is what he'll play
His moms and pops told him when he first reached Junior High
The way you live determine just how soon you die
And he didn't care because to him it was fun
And he was only THIRTEEN when he got his first gun
He robbed stores and did stick-ups frequently
Gave a new name to juvenile delinquency
And yeah you know that, he, was on the go
Seven days of the week, he kept his pockets full of dough
But he was headed for a dead end fast
Cold riskin his ass for petty cash that didn't last
Went back and forth to jail six times
For stolen cars and stick-up and various crimes
So when he sit in his cell, he reminisce as a child
It don't pay to do crime today, so don't be buck wild..
Ay that that that's a little bit of a lesson
For all the kids out there you know now
Yeah yeah yeah you know what I'm sayin
And this is comin from
The Grand High Exalted Mystic Ruler
Ain't no one cooler
In 7th grade I had a teacher named Mr. Dulah
Who used to wear his pants up to his chest
And I want you to just listen
Cause.. this is no joke, so don't be buck wild..
Once about a time there was a kid

Who didn't have a bicycle or a car that skid

Only thing he had was Pat and Turner

He didn't know the future but the lesson to learn-ah

Way to get started in the music biz

Just listen to the story as I tell it like it is

I was a youngster from East Junior High School

Who thought somebody with Adidas sweat-shirt was cool

It symbolized somethin, but I don't know

I wanted to be down really really bad so

I asked one of my best friends Derek Mangareu
"C'mon man can I be down can I be down witcha crew?"
He had one by the name of Masters of Control

I wanted to be down, so I could play the role

He said, "No you're not good enough we have ours Mark"

I went home and sat in the room with no lights in the dark

And this is gonna be a rough rendezvous

And that's why I sing this song to you


I'm a lonely soldier.. yeah..

Many miles from home..

With a heart that's heavy..

And with.. a will that's strong


I got a little older, three years to be exact

When a crew named Midnight Express gave me a crack
It consist of one MC and two DJ's

And the way Kevin D cut had me amazed

It was like I just joined the Lakers

Or even Rock Steady or the New York City Breakers

I was in 11th grade, at ?? High

They was sayin they was sayin hey what's wrong with this guy

Because all he do, is bang on tables and mumble

And doin music with his mouth like a band ensemble
Or the human beatbox wasn't thought about

And the teachers they thought I was crazy without a doubt

I guess they didn't understand what I was comin from

Since I was into MC'n, they thought I was dumb
Then there was a teacher by the name of Ms. K Parke

Since I was good at rememberin numbers she said I was smart
But that don't got nothin to do with this rendezvous

And THAT'S why I sing this song to you!


I'm a lonely soldier.. yeah..

Many miles from home..

With a heart that's heavy..

And with.. a will that's strong


I was a walkin son of a gun before the day I begun

I'mma tell you how it started, from day one

Well me, I lived in ]??

[, they lived in C.I

I was ambitious and devoted til the day I'd die

I used to get on Fair Islip, take the S-42

Get off at Bunanan Street, and go to the house of the crew

I would walk from C.I., to Bay Shore

Just to see if I really had the rhymes galore

I'd go to house parties here, go to house parties there

Walk the ?? ?? pants off my derriere

Like if I was David Carridine who played "Kung Fu"

Who would walk from China to Japan without a shoe

Hummin beats, sayin rhymes, kept me goin

From givin up or bein crazy, or just stop flowin

My teachers and parents said, I should just stop

Just go to army go to college get a job witcha POPS?!

I can't take no more of this rendezvous

And that's why I sing this song to you!


I'm a lonely soldier.. yeah..

Many miles from home..

With a heart that's heavy..

And with.. a will that's strong


I'm a lonely soldier..

Many miles from home..

With a heart that's heavy..

Ahhh-yew-whayaeuwwww

Yo Doc, I'mma count it on three

Just check out what the heck I got to say
It's not the same ol', rhythm and rap cliche
Markie the king of a rec, I rock and put you in check
Hypnotizin recognizin plus I get respect
And if you think you can, mess with the magical man
I rock the mic do what I like and plus I got a plan
So don't be missin don't be listenin to the format
Determined like a German like a head is to a hat
That's why I qualify, as the better MC
I never treat people like they were fleas
But if you think that I got a big head though
EHHHH AHAHHHHHH! Let go my emehamahmmm EGGO

Best in zing, the man appointed rap king
Down to wreck your body, I make the 'phone sing
That's why I say zzznoahh, MC shower
Hey, in Junior High School I say Shenandoah
And, bedknocks and broomsticks
With my DJ Cool V, that is on the mix
I do it out of my head-n, from hear to Homestead'n
Or even Belleport cause it is my sport

{Cool V cuts "I'm the BizMarkie, yo known for beatbox and the rap and.."}
{Cool V cuts again}
{Cool V cuts again}
{Cool V cuts "I'm the Biz" over and over}
{Cool V cuts "I'm the BizMarkie, yo known for beatbox and the rap and.."}
{Cool V cuts again to fade}
I was on my way, to 125th
I saw this def Benz, yo that's my man Cliff
As I flagged them down, he pulled to the side
At this moment I had to swallow my pride
Cause usually I wouldn't ask for a lift
But it was cold as hell, and my legs was stiff
He said, "Hey Biz, what you want, a ride?"
I said, "Hell yeah," he said, "I can't cause my girl's inside"
So he jetted off, leavin two tracks
Not at one time did homeboy look back
It took me an hour, to get where I was goin
And to top it all off, it had to start snowin
My sneakers was old, and my coat was thin
But my determination kept me goin within
I had nobody to help me as you can SEE..

I'm alone again, naturally
Alone again, naturally

So I went into the show, and started maxin
People came up to me, and started askin
Whassup wit me, and when I'm gettin on
And how many records is Shante gonna perform
I don't know, but now I gotta go
Cause Shante is callin me to do the show
First she was on, and then she called me out
I did a lot of funky beats without no doubt
I put the mic on my head, and began to riff
The crowd began to flip, cause I was rockin the shift
When we was done, I started to laugh
Massive people come to me for my autograph
After the funk was over it was time to break
If I was rhymin it would be the icin on the cake
As I saw Shante, get into a limo
I had to walk home, I wrote it in my memo
I'm alone again, naturally
All alone again, naturally

Now I'm a-ight, nothin to worry
Wherever I wanna go, I get there in a hurry
That's right I'm big time, very well known
Now I'm sayin rhymes instead of beats on the microphone
Right about now, I'm gonna explain
It was Cool V, TJ Swan and the Big Daddy Kane
Doin shows all together, as one group
None of us actin big headed, or souped
Then after that, we all formed a block
I paid everybody, told them how they rocked
They all grabbed they props, and when they seperate
Swan said, "I'll see you later Biz, in a couple of days"
When people see me leave, like a mamma-jamma
It's like if I was swoll with stars lights and glamour
But when Vaughn came home, he thought I was in somewhere
With a girl was in bed.. nah..

Alone again, naturally
I'm alone again, naturally

Ahh ahh..
Romeo, Romeo, wherefor art thou?
That's what Juliet asked, but I don't know now
Maybe he went to get some roses for you
Yo, I'da I'da I-don't know where he's at Ju-li-et
Don't regret, cause he will be back
To come and get you, and bring you to the crillzab
But, there's an obstacle that's in his way
I think it's the-the-the ? that won't decay
Well, I'm the B-I-Z-M-izza-A-R-K
Let me tell you what I hear most people say
That you two people are a part of life
It explains why Romeo died by the knife
Or was it - the poison on Juliet lips
Or vice versa I don't know it make my mind flips
Whichever way it was, it's very educational
So look at the movie and listen cause it's sensational
And if you hear the music you could never go wrong
I want EVERYBODY sing a long, now come on now

	Romeo and Juliet get-tin bu-sy (repeat 4X)
To the R-O-M-E-O, and the J-U-L-I-et
I think the thing he did was to get respect
The way that I see it, it was a great deed
Because if wasn't, he wouldn't succeed
At getting Juliet's heart, and loving care
And all of the moments they had to share
But I really want you just to check out the plot
Of the movie it is groovy it will hit the spot
It will make you laugh, it make you cry
And that's when you know you will be satisfied
Cause you know I wouldn't tell you nuthin that wasn't right
Cause the Diabolical is outta sight
Yo, Romeo and Juliet should be household names
They names should be in the hall of fame
With my funky beat, you can never go wrong
I want EVERYBODY sing this song, now bust it out now

	Romeo and Juliet get-tin bu-sy (repeat 3X)
	Romeo, Romeo, HAH!!
	Romeo and Juliet get-tin bu-sy (repeat 3X)
	Romeo, Romeo, HAH!!

Charlie got a wife by the name of Dolly
Dolly and Charlie got a son named Wally
And Wally got a girl by the name of Polly
Polly got a sister by the name of Molly
Molly and Polly got a mother named Holly
Father named Arthur, we call him Artie
You don't understand and I'm very very sorry
Cousin named Freida, Uncle named Skeeter
He's married to my fine Aunt Rita
Who is the leader, of the merry cheaters
So, I don't greet ehr cause my Uncle don't need her
Grandma Joyce, drives a Rolls Royce
Of the family I'm a favorite choice
Buddy named Homer, used to be a loner
Now he got a girl by the name of Mona
Now that Homer's marries to Mona
All he does all day is bone bone bone her
Partner named Lex, get big respect
Drivin in his black 300 Z-X
Week after next, when Lex his get check
Me and Lex will be chillin in the X
My girl Eleanor, went to the drugstore
To get deoderant, I figure for sure
Cause the one she used before made her underarms sore
And that's why Eleanor, don't use it no more
Her girl named Betty, who used to go with Freddie
Asked me was I ready, for us to go steady
I told Betty, I wasn't ready
To go steady, cause it would hurt Freddie
A girl named Glen, she's my best friend
Known her ever since who knows when
And do you comprehend, the message that I send
Of family and friends of Grandpa Ben
Like this like that like that like this
You know the Biz Mark's on top of the list

'Member when they had a place called Shanendoah?
Shanendoah, and St. Noah
Biz Markie, the def rhyme flower
Yo I would not rely on Noah

Cause I will rock say immediately
That's why I'm chillin in the L-I-N-D, E with the N
With the MC street
You will agree it's me, cause I rock a funky beat
The, oh-riginal B, I-Z-M-A-R
K-I with the E, are a superstar
They are I am me, is it because I
Know how R-A-P, no, I think it's deep
Cause my DJ Cool V is a rockin
And a guaranteed to rock and be always clockin
So listen to the hyper, MC fifer
Is it because, yo, I'm not the type of guy
That know how to make a B-I-Z-M-A
R-K-I-and you know that the rhymes fly
Now I go on, zest and sing
Man appointed rap king make the 'phone sing
I'm Biz Mark, the microphone king-er
Down to wreck your body, super-educated
Like swinger of a rap, make your hands clap
Soon to adapt; hey - say, oh Jack
With the rhyme of the MC time
Will agree it's me, Aries is my sign
So is Cool V, nine-teen
Down to wreck your body and on the scene
We went to the fight with Foreman/Holyfield
All of a sudden, we saw a shield
Of girls comin round with the MC sound
Will agree it's me, (??) just around
Just listen to the S-K-V
And ain't another MC messin with me
Even though I got my haircut, down to wreck your body
And make all your girls shake your butt
Just listen don't be missin cause I won't be dissin
On Z-100, Hot 97
KISS and 'BLS'n I got the profession of
{*beatboxing*} AHH AHH AHH, BPP, ah one, chk two and
The lesson with the rhyme of a MC time
Will agree it's me, Aries is my sign
I said that say once, I'm not a dunce
It don't matter to me, nu-ance
Was a per-fume, go and consume
Is it because I'm Biz and I'm in a room
Just (??) to my vocal, I'm not a local
I'm Biz, you can call me a yokel
I'm not from California, I'm not from Kansas City
I'm not not part of the itty titty bittie
Committee with the rhyme, you will agree it's me
The original, M-U-D, D-F-double-O-T hey it's me
Ahh, ahh, P-E-C-E-E
I spell it wrong goin on
To the break of dawn, word is bond
It sound kind of funky, don't it Kevin?
'Member when me and you used to go to 7/11
.. when Shelton worked there?
He used to give us food, and he was fair
Not because we was on the wel-fare
Just because we were down, and we didn't care
But now I'm a millionaire makin my rap
And I'm freakin that dance, make your hands clap
Now are, you, gonna keep the vocal
B-S I hope so cause I'm B(?)
Yo Doc, drop the beat in!

This is a incident that always occur
With the opposite sex, other word is her
No matter what nationality color or creed
Or wherever you at, there's always a bad seed
They're always talkin about wantin to be alone
You're spendin too much time witcha friends, all night long
I'm sayin yo what the heck, I am single
It's no reason why I shouldn't try to mingle
So I met this girl by the name of Maxine
Her breath didn't stink she used Listerine
She looked crazy a-ight, and the whole nine
But this situation was one of a kind
Because I wanted her.. all to my own
So I called her on, my Mickey Mouse telephone
I said, "Hello pretty momma it's the guy you just me
Uhh what are you doin tonight?"  She said, "Nuttin," I said, "Bet"
So when I went to pick her up, I was in shock
Cause she brought her friend along for a ROAD BLOCK
	

[Biz sings]
	AMERICAN WOMAN!  Why you do it to MEEEEEE?
	AMERICAN WOMAN!  Why you do it to MEEEEEE?
	Is it because I'm the BIZMARKIE?
	No I think it's because I have the R-A-P
	I think you think I'm UGLY makin CASH MONEY
	Yo I think all the girls is funny..
	AMERICAN WOMAN!  Why you do it to MEEEEEE?
	AMERICAN WOMAN!  Why you do it to MEEEEEE?

(Yo Biz you know you don't usually be with things like that
Why you let her get away with that?)
I thought she was buggin just to see what I'd say
I said nuttin, let her friend come anyway
Okay now listen what she wanted me to for her friend
(What she want Biz?)  Expected me to pay her way in?
It's not like kid from stingy cheap or my name's Ebenezer
But I'm here to please Maxine, not to please her
So I still let it go by, and got her in the movie
Thank the Lord I bumped into my cousin named Cool V
I said please Vaughn, take her friend off my hands
So I can be alone, and get my man
He said alright I'll introduce, she act like she was wit it
But when we try to split, she looked and said forget it
I don't know whassup Vaughn, she must be buggin
I thought you was in the way she was kissin and huggin
Soon as I said - wanna make music like Sebastian Bach?
I'm not leavin my friend with a guy but it's another road block
	

[Biz sings]
	AMERICAN WOMAN!  Stay away from MEEEEEE!
	AMERICAN WOMAN!  Why you do it to MEEEEEE?
	Is it because I'm the BIZMARKIE?
	No I think it's because I can R-A-P, no
	I think you think I'm UGLY makin CASH MONEY
	All of this is funny..
	AMERICAN WOMAN!  Stay away from MEEEEEE!
	AMERICAN WOMAN!  Stay away from MEEEEEE!

So I was highly upset, and you would be too
If an icicle's in your way, stickin to you like glue
I mean it's the end of the night, time to move on
I'm tryin to kick ballistics so she'd come to my home
I went to, yo bust it, call her when you get to your crib
She said, no and started cryin like a baby with a bib
Now why you wanna bat me up and ruin my night?
I coulda said no but I was bein polite
She tried to pull the I'm stayin over her house bit
Not tonight baby you gon' be stayin at a Parkway Exit
So they went into the bathroom to get in a huddle
If you keep playin you're both gonna take the shuttle
They both came out the bathroom with a glance
Like the bathroom they were goin to dance
They both approached me with the look of a rock
I look and tell my senses ahh it's another road block..
Goes around
What comes around goes around

Sittin here reminiscin back to high school
When everytime I see you, girl, you know that I drool
Day-dreamin in class thinkin what would I say
When I saw you, but you never looked my way
It started freshman year and lasted straight to the 12th grade
I have to give it to you, though, you was top-shelf, babe
I asked myself time and time again: what was it
About me that made me treat me like a buzzard
I speak to you in the hall and you ignore me
You keep walkin and talkin like you never saw me
You didn't have to conversate with me, I can say that
It woulda made my day if you just had waved back
I used to buy you candy, lollypops and gum drops
I even pack a extra-sandwich in my lunch box
You're treatin me like dirt and everyone in the school knows
You call me out my name and crack jokes on my school clothes
If anyone could make you feel good, girl, I could
But you give me that look like you don't wanna be bothered
But that's okay, just keep on frontin, see
Cause one day I'mma make it, and you'll be wantin me
Been tryin hard ever since I graduated
To make it big, and yes, I finally made it
Been doin shows, videos and tv
Now everywhere you go everybody knows me
Now the tables have turned and now it's me you're hawkin
Now I turn up my nose, and keep on walkin
You see, ladies marvel me in clubs frequently
And you make it your duty to come and speak to me
Rememberin how she played me in the past
Yeah, we can talk, I'm in a rush, please make it fast
And we can start off with all the men you been with
And don't come poppin that just-a-friend bit
Remember how you used to diss me and play me out, how
Come you got so much stuff to talk about now?
The word's around town that you're on the money tip
But sorry, I can't do nothin for ya, honey dip
So pardon me as I make my way to the dancefloor
And over to the bar because that's what I came for
Cuties pamperin me with champagne and roses
As I think to myself: thank God for showbiz!
Everywhere I turn girlies throwin me rhythm
Drinkin and thinkin who will be my victim
Here comes that girl that used to diss me
She whispers in my ear could she come home with me
Yup, get your coat and we could shoot north
Took her to the crib, and cold knocked her boots off
After i got it, yo, I never did call back
Thinkin how she used to front like she was all that
It's a new game, and the odds are in my favor
She caught the vapors and nothin could save her
What comes around goes around
You know what I'm talkin about
What comes around goes around
What comes around goes around
What comes around goes around
This is for those who didn't believe
That me, myself they said I couldn't achieve
My goal or even get to my destiny
To be the S-K-B-I-Z
It was a rough road, for me to pursue a
Career in rap to make you say hallelujah
For those who did, I'm not talkin to you
Cause I couldn't be there with-out you
Everytime I see you they always say
I knew you was gonna make hits someday
But then when I was strugglin hard, word
A peep of help from them was never heard
I always knew that, I was gonna make it
No matter how much beef and aggravation I take it
And if you try to hold back me and my crew
Remember, I told you..
I told you..

I'ma give you one incedent from my past
When I had short money, goofy pants off my ass
I used to go to block parties my cousin had served
And see how people who made it, kicked OTHERs to the curb
And then I said if I was in their spotlight
I would treat everybody, equally right
To get where I'm at now, I used to hand out flyers
From school to school, for New York and L.I.ers
It was me and Mike from Ike and then they used to do it
He said if you wanna be like them you gotta keep to it
So I kept at it, cause it was hard work
I told em I was makin a record, they gave me a smirk
Like if I was incapable of doin the deed
Or virtually impossible for me to succeed
You must be crazy if I wouldn't pursue
Only thing that I can tell you is I told you..
I told you..
Now now now this is how it's endin
Just like any other story, it is splendid
I said to Ty if you let me come out with a cut
They will never ever stop shakin they butts
So I came out with "Make the Music With Your Mouth Biz"
An introduction to me, and told it like it is
Some said it was beginner's luck, with this record
Then I showed em with "Nobody Beats the Biz" and got respected
I threw em off with my song "Pickin Boogers"
It was acquired taste, for different kind of sugars
I got international like twin skyscrapers
With my album "Goin' Off" and my single "The Vapors"
Since I produced my own, they said it would end
Cause it took a year and half to come out with "Just a Friend"
It went platinum, my album went gold
Altogether it was one point five records sold
So don't EVER try to hold back me and my crew
Only thing that I can say is, I told you..
I told you..

So when anybody try to, mess with your head
Just go for what you wanna go for in life, aight? Chill

[Verse 1]
This is another hit from Biz Markie
Dedicated to the radio, not he or she
Be-cause it's time for them to get recognized
This is my version of the Nobel Peace Prize
That's why I'm comin out my face like this
Far as negativity, you never get dissed
If it wasn't for you, nobody would know
That's why this is something for the radiohhhh

[Verse 2]
This rhyme is dedicated to the radio DJ's
That play all the hits on seven days
And even on the weekends, the DJ's will be freakin'
Without a doubt because everyone is unique-and
The way they cut the records, and be talkin
It sound doo doo EXTRA CRAZY DEF on the Walkman
To all the disc jockey's that's on the go
This is something for the radiohhhh

{*Biz ad libbing a harmony of "for the radio" randomly*}
Now I'ma kick it like this

[Verse 3]
I'd like to thank all the people state to state
For requestin' my records on the radio great-ly
Appreciate what you've done for me
And my reward to you is my M-U-S-I-C
Straight up, I make the music just for you
So you can do the extra crazy Biz Mark dance too
Or even do the dance made up by yourself
As long as you're in good phy-sical health
Because you're the one that make the radio hype
Like fresh tobacco and a brand new pipe
A program director always pick the right hits
Like puttin' some salt and pepper and butter on grits
I ALWAYS look up to program directors
'Cause they're the ones, the jam selectors
A couple of years ago when I didn't have a record player
On the radio I thought to myself sayin
If I ever get the chance to playin my stuff
I'm gonna make everything extra tough
'Cause radio will last to infinity
As long as my name is the B-I-Z
Emmezah-A-R-K and I'm hear to say
Number one entertainment form in the like U.S.A
'Cause if it wasn't for you, nobody would know
That's why this is something for the radiohhhh
{*Biz ad libbing a harmony of "for the radio" and singing shoutouts*}

[Verse 4]
This is the conclusion of just the beginnin'
Of hip-hop on the radio, mix never endin'
Story and fightin', just to get the right and
Have our respect on a station that's excitin'
In about two years, I will be a superstar
Be able to buy anything I want, even a car
Cause if it wasn't for you, nobody would know
That's why this is something for the radiohhhh

Yo I'd just like to say it like this

{*Cool V scratches to fade*}
Y'all know me as the B-I-Z
That roc the microphone most definately
Bringing you styles that you never heard
Like brother thug like brother nerd
I'm real super, high in the 80's
Even Austin Powers'd say "yeahh baby"
The hip hopper unpredictable showstopper
Whatever I say, ya know its proper
Cuz when I kick it, I kick it like a field goal
Like Erik B and Rakim ya know I got soul
I got funky rhymes that blow your mind
Buggin you out without a doubt every single time
I'm cookoo for cocoa with my vocal
When I'm in san francisco or when I'm local
The "M-a forever"? just doin my thing
I'm guaranteed to rock and make the microphone sing

Chorus
Ladada Ladadada (4x) with scrathing

Biz in charge and, yo I'm livin large and
Oooh I like it like el debarge and
In the tune I can croon with a bank and a ?
So hurry up and get the sick smokers out the room
Before I catch asthma or emphysema
You can catch me in a playsport or a beamer
I rip and rag, play freeze tag
But since I got older its all such a drag
But it dont matter now like purina cat chow
The first beat I did was meow meow meow meow
Dont have a son or daughter even though I oughta
Its almost ten years since I rocked at the quarters
Roof top program ? baby what a man
Now I plays the tunnel ??
Yo paul, let the music cease
When I count to three everybody say peace
Chorus til end

[Intro]
Yo.. this is kinda slow
But I know the Jeeps gon' be pumpin it
But this is, this is one subject, that nobody don't know about

[Verse 1]
Check him out, check him out, check him out, check him out
With the beat I'm gonna rock the house
When you hear my golden voice, you know it's me
The poetical, energetical rap MC
Well that's not the subject matter of to be cool
I'm just tellin you girls and fly kids, stay in school
I always reminisce when I was in class well
But you feel like a simpletone when you get expelled
Or, even if you have a couple of days in detention
It's just as good as one bad suspension
So when you're grown up, you'll say the same thing
To your kids, be in class before the bell ring
But you know, kids is kids
To them high school is like a three year bid
I'm not gonna tell a lie, I used to cut class
Until the principal straight got in my ass
He said, "Biz the only way you're gonna get a BM
Is to get your education instead of hangin with him"
So I got my head together, and chilled the hell out
And now all the break-breakers says is check him out

[Hook]
Check him out, check him out, check him out, check him out
With the beat I'm gonna rock the house
Check him out, check him out, check him out, check him out
With the beat I'm gonna rock the house! {*echoes*}

[Verse 2]
Now this is the second part of this lesson
I'm sayin it this way cause it's my profession
You don't have to go to high school to be an MC
But you got to know the value and means, of money
Cause a lot of parents, they are taxpayers
So it's real stupid, when you disobey a
Principal, vice principal or even a teacher
Cause when you do that, you know you'll never reach a
Higher level, or even your goal
Because, you don't wanna listen to what you're told
So please take heed, to what I say
I hope I'm not sayin it for my health today
Cause if I am please tell me, so I can stop
It's not like I'm your mother sister brother or pop
So come on and listen to me without no doubt
So you can be educated and have, clout

[Hook]
Check him out, check him out, check him out, check him out
With the beat I'm gonna rock the house
Check him out, check him out, check him out, check him out
With the beat I'm gonna rock the house! {*echoes*}

[Verse 3]
I'm just tellin young people to stay away from drugs
Cause if you mess with that it'll make you bug
Whatever you wanna, like call it, I'm tellin you
Don't become a drug addict or alcoholic
Because it will mess with your mind and brain
And only thing you wanna do is feen and complain
Cause I'm tellin you just like this off the top of my head
Don't mess with it, cause you will be misled
By other people, devils and demons
I'm Biz Markie, I'm not Alfred Simmons
I'm just tellin you to do this, without no doubt
Cause I'm the Biz and I got the clout

[Hook]
Check him out, check him out, check him out, check him out
With the beat I'm gonna rock the house
Check him out, check him out, check him out, check him out
With the beat I'm gonna rock the house! {*echoes*}

[Outro]
This'll go out to my man Def Jeff
My man Back Spin, my man El Caban
Can't forget my Doctor Bombay

[Intro: Biz Markie]
"Just here to let you know"
This is Primo
"Just here to let you know"
My man Black Indian
"Just here to let you know"
I can't forget Makigo
"Just here to let you know"
From U.S.A. to Japan

[Verse 1: Biz Markie]
On the week days I be in school
Be in school learnin', the golden rule
I wake up in the morning and get out my bed
I don't do a thing till my grace is said
And when it's said, I wipe my ass
And think off all the fly girls in my class
Pay off the don say it can't hurt
I put on my Lee's and my blue sweatshirt
Walk around the corner seem to catch the bus
And if the bus ain't there I don't dare fuss
Just tell mama I missed the bus today
And she take me to school in a white OJ
But when I get to the school and the bell ring
I don't even worry 'cause it ain't no thing
Walk in the room and said "You're late for class"
The teacher marked me late, I'm gonna kick his ass
You know the teachers gonna listen to me
'Cause I'm the diabolical, the B-I-Z, and I rock

[Chorus]
"Just here to let you know" "B-I-Z M-A-R-K-I to the E"
"Just here to let you know" "B-I-Z M-A-R-K, don't try to front"

[Verse 2: Black Indian]
Yo, now that's classic, I ain't worry 'bout you bastards
I'm at home in my boxers watchin' Tom Warner classics
It's just a rhythm I kick
While I strangle out the beat, while you hear that kick
High drums and snares, puttin' you right here
Met your chick and then I booked it then I hit that rare, air
You don't wanna see Black when I get mad
'Cause I come and Black axe, square Black maks
It's a real thing while I hold my hands on this microphone
I get it open till the break of dawn
Or maybe to the sky kerr Caucasian
Y'all be rockin' for rhythms, I rock for blacks and asians
I leave you all in a daze
I'm pickin' up these flows like pimps that brush waves
Get it for all days my broke cup pawn flows
'Cause I'ma keep it on the real, yo

[Chorus: Biz Markie]
And I Rock
"Just here to let you know" "B-I-Z M-A-R-K-I to the E"
And I Rock
"Just here to let you know" "B-I-Z M-A-R-K don't try to front"
And I Rock
"Just here to let you know" "B-I-Z M-A-R-K-I to the E"
"Just here to let you know" "B-I-Z M-A-R-K don't try too front"

[Verse 3: Biz Markie]
Me and Superman we had a fight
I punched him in the face for all my might
Punched him so hard he fell to the floor
Picked him up, and ragged him some more
Turned around, and who did I see?
It was ah Lois Lane she was lookin' at me
She said: "Yo Biz Markie you are the best
Cause you knocked the S off Superman's chest"
She took my hand and led me to the room
We smoked three joints and cracked the core of the brew
I looked her up I thought she was fine
I knew the deal; what was on her mind
We took off the clothes and clicked off the light
And we rocked the bed, till the sky was white
When it came to the break of day
She said: "Yo Biz Markie why don't you stay?
I've cooked you some breakfast with some orange juice"
That's one thing I couldn't refuse
At around eight I kissed her goodbye
She said: "Whoo! Biz Markie you one hell of a guy!"

And I Rock
"Just here to let you know" "B-I-Z M-A-R-K-I on to the E"
Biz and Premo and you know we do, ROCK
"Just here to let you know"
New York to Japan, Japan and New York, we rock
And you do and you do and you do and you do and you do, WE ROCK
*Beatboxes* Rock!
*Beatboxes* We Rock!
*Beatboxes* R-r-r-r-r-r-rock!
*Beatboxes* Ah Premo, ah Premo, Premo, we rock!
*Beatboxes* Ah Premo, ah p-p-premo, Biz Markie and Premo etc
G-goobely-goo
Ah-h-h-hm

Ah yeah
Now check it out

I would walk into the bathroom to take a crap
I sit down, and then I write me a toilet stool rap
Whether I'm constipated or have diarrhea
I always come out with a funky fresh idea
Even if you don't think it's funky fresh, and
To all the little kids I'm makin a good impression
Cause a lot of my hits are written on the john
I hope my legendary style of rap lives on
This's a hidden secret where classics come from
Everybody has done it, even my man Run
Only in there I am the king of the throne
Hey, hey, you know I can't be alone
No girls, no guys, no dogs, no cats
No parents, no nieces, no nephews, no brats
That's the only way that I can get privacy
And you know where I write my funky fresh rhymes live, you see...
Me sittin on a toilet
Waitin for my bowels to move
I got a doodoo rap
I got a doodoo...

Yo, bust it
Let me tell you a little something bout this episode
It was four in the morning, chillin on my commode
It was me, my pad, and pen, and my bad breath
All of a sudden I came up with somethin that was real def
I was thinkin, what a real beatbox could do
What if I put a hype beat with the "p-pf 1-2"?
Then I write some words, so I really can use it
I think I would name this one Make The Music
Like if I was the man that they call Clark Kent
Cause I go into the bathroom for rhymes I invent
Then I come out on stage like Superman
But never show the people my masterplan
Instead of movin towels, or movin vowels
Only think I'm doin, is movin bowels
A tv in the bathroom just might spoil it
Only thing I can say is...

I'm sittin on a toilet
Waitin for my bowels to move
I got a doodoo rap
I got a doodoo
Doodoo
Doo-oo-oo
Doo-doo-doo-doo
Rrrhaaa
Ah yeah
The diabolical is back again
But now I want the Killerforce Connection
And we gonna do it in harmony like this

We're the Killerforce MC's
The best in New York city
So let us put it to perfection
While we change it to the Biz Mark connection
Other crews in this section always try to ban the connection
They got together and they combined
Tried to hurt us from time to time
But it didn't work.. as you see
The Biz Mark is in the place to be
So come on party people, get into the groove because-
Biz Markie is gonna bust the mood

Biz Markie.. hey that's me
You know that I body rock to the T-O-P
And I'm the born sureshot you can't resist
I'm gonna take your girl with my sweet kiss
And he's TJ Swan that's his name
And if you're rockin to the beat, I'm the blame
I got the power to get you up off the wall
And get you on the floor, so you can have a ball
The cut master Cool V
He is the man that's at the top of the key
Of course he is fast you know that he is slick
So many fly girls jumpin on his dick
So let's rock, until we reach the top
And we'll never stop, the rhythm of the rock

{*shout outs until the end*}

[Biz Markie]
Huh?
Yo this is funky!
We gon' get down to the point
And I'm just gonna say - I'd like to thank my man Rashad
But we gon' get down like this, and you don't stop
A twink-twinkle, a rock the house
And my man Diamond Shell, a rock the house
Can't forget my man Sal, rock the house, and
Felle Fel, rock the house
I can't forget, Capital, rock the house
My man Capital T, will rock the house
And to my man B, a rock the house, and
My man Frankie, a rock the house
I can't forget Doo G, rock the house
And my man Cool V, a rocks the house y'all
Ah to the beat y'all, you don't stop
I'm Biz Markie with the funky sound
And right about now, here's the countdown
One.. two.. one, two, three

[Hook]
Yo B take it from the top
Yo B take it from the top (sayyy whaaaat?)
Yo B take it from the top
Yo B take it from the top (wellllllll)

[Verse One]
Well I demand respect, so everybody salute
And by the way Backspin, is my attribute
You may or may not, know who I am
But frankly my dear.. I don't give a damn!
You may know me from "Rockin' With Biz Markie"
Or Shante, when she used to battle Sparky
You might have seen in some videos with other folks
Sittin on the bench while me and Biz was tellin mother jokes
The meaning of my name some people may, try to guess
Yes yes I'm fresh to the flesh, so let me manifest
I make romance, I'm not a freelance
I spin records; BITCH I don't breakdance!
I scoop girls around the world that's what B does
The name Backspin means that B was
Born.. as a creative, cut king
Supreme poet, inferior to nothing
Call me the teacher, since I'm the one who taught you
(What's that?) Myyyyyyy DICK! (CAUGHT YOU!)
I'm signin off because my rhyme's complete
I say peace to Chancellor Avenue and Bergen Street

[Hook]
Yo Cap take it from the top
Yo Cap take it from the top (sayyy whaaaat?)
Yo Cap take it from the top
Yo Cap take it from the top (wellllllll)

[Verse Two]
Well get a grip and, yeah the Capital's rippin
More than just a ordinary style, cold flippin
Those that attempt to diss, or try to take this
Title away what? I think you better forget it
Pit-pat this Jack, get off of the crack black
It's the true fact, your record hit the pillow sack
And now you're wonderin how make a comeback
But don't make me laugh, your studio's a two-track
Biz hits the bassline, then I rip the real line
Together it's combined and designed to a master rhyme
A little touch from Cool V himself
An overnight process then it's ready for the shelves
Perfect shit on wax is made
Then bring it to the radio and let it get played
There's no joke and only time to get fanatical
So listen up or pay attention to the Capital
I'm done with the rhyme for the time, so you can have 'em
Aiyyo guys, why don't you throw somethin funky at 'em

[Hook]
Yo Shell take it from the top
Yo Shell take it from the top (sayyy whaaaat?)
Yo Shell take it from the top
Yo Shell take it from the top (wellllllll)

[Verse Three]
Y'all know me, as the Original D
Like to the I say with the A and hey
Bust this, M-O-N-D
I grab the mic and recite rhymes in your left ear
It's always def and different
Never somethin from the previous years
I'm quite slim, but rougher than a pair of Timbs
The Diamond Shell will never trip stagger fall or bend
I don't smoke and never ever have I drank no liquor
Bein smooth keeps my rhyme style, that much quicker
So yo hey chief, bust this technique of speak
I'm feelin sheik and also rather unique
I'm smooth as (?), you can't deny I'm
Innovative with style, and bound to hit primetime soon
As I tour from Kalamazoo to the moon
Give props to the rapper, the brother dresses Dapper
Than Dan cause I'm the man I'd like to make ya toes tap
With the, funky type of flow, I'm smooth as a Lambo'-
-Ghini I dream of Jeannie her hands on my jam
So, once but not twice, this brother's precise
When it comes to snakin girls I get as crooked as loaded dice
Pullin women can't no man compete
I nut 'em all from the Great Wall down to Wall Street
So..

[Hook]
Yo Fell take it from the top
Yo Fell take it from the top (sayyy whaaaat?)
Yo Fell take it from the top
Yo Fell take it from the top (wellllllll)

[Verse Four: Force Fell]
Ready for the riot I rip rap rapacious
Crews don't slip you're payin penalty slashes
Clashes crashed, but I crash ass or
Ravish the mic, and then I'mma pass all
Hard to handle run a gamble like Vegas
But I never lost the force be runnin wages
Of pages, and pages, biters think I'm cajun
Spice cause I'm so nice and eighteen is my age is
Rappers crumble when I tackle they crackle I ramshackle
Don't even know why they waste time on the pack'll
Of nine cause my rhymes do 'em in like rifles
Stress the word, so you know I live trifle
MC's, metamorphosize to digest
Days from a faze and my praise is like a rajah
I reckon, that crews that step over this way
Think life is a game and they just too pissed to play
Some say, on mics I'm a master
A snatcher, a catcher, a very well matcher
But crews better know that I hit like after
Effects who's next I wreck from now til then
And then when the then comes, I'mma go hit again
Like rat-a-tat-tat of the tickedy eatin dick-er whore
So every move I make I make sure, it's riggydiggyraw
Biz

[Verse Five]
Mar, kie the original
Everytime I see V, yo I got material
I was just kickin funky records for you
Cause I'm down with the rhythm of a, ah one chk two
Singin, on records, I get respected
It don't matter to me cause you know that I'm connected
With B-M-V Biz Mark and Vaughn
Down to wreck collect and then jet, to the break of dawn
Discombobulate, sentence ain't complete
Unless I go {*beatbox*} AHH AHH AHH UHH {*cough*} on beat
Zip-zop-a-zigga-lah, zagga-zucka-zaii
No matter what I say, I always come out fly
Because my records get respected as I like jettin
You will agree it's me, cause you know I'm inventin
A different kind of rhythm of rhymin state
That's why you like everything I create
"Pickin' Boogers", "The Vapors", "Just a Friend"
That's just some of the things you can comprehend
So just check it, MC's wreck it
You listen to the Biz Markie, don't disrespect it
Just listen!
One two, one two
You're listenin to the grand groovin sounds
Of the diabolical energetical B-I-Z
Emmezah-A-Rrrah-K
And this goes out to my DJ
The cutmaster that no one cuts faster than
C-double-oh-L V
Drumroll V

[Verse One]
It's a different kind of sound that's in the air
It's not shots, firecrackers, or a car that's there
A little different noise for your listenin pleasure
A sample from a record that's a four bar measure
Adults think this music is just a big headache
They think all this hard work, is just a piece of cake
They must be buggin, right out of they socks
Why don't they get up and try to do, the human beatbox
Cause back in the days when there was just block parties
A DJ would set up his equipment, and start these
Live performances, and DJ tricks
A lot of different DJ's was on the mix
It is a proven fact, music is a universal language
From the tip of Long Island to the Verrezano Bridge
We won awards and served them by the millions
The more more years go by, the more we be killin 'em
They said it's just a fad, it will never last a year
All of a sudden, ten years later - "I hear music"

[Chorus: Cool V scratches "I hear music in the street" over and over]

Cool V, give me a drum roll

[Verse Two]
I can't believe how hip-hop has progressed
With more and more groups that have finesse
We have groups on the East and West coast with different names
We all play a part if we didn't we'd go in flames
We all got to stick together as one
But at the same time, still have fun
Cause you don't wanna lose the love for the music
When you have it keep it, and make use of it
This is a lesson from the S-K Biz
Cause nobody else is gonna tell you like it is
Everyone thought that rap was just a phase
But it still continue, to muse and amaze
It gives people chance to show they true talents
Instead of submittin to the crime and violence
People said to me the S-K-B
Is rap gonna stay until infinity?
As long as me and V be makin up the beats
You will hear people sayin - "I hear music"

[Chorus]
Cool V, give me a drum roll

[Verse Three]
This is the ending, conclusion, kapiche?
Of this new hip-hop masterpiece
About people countin chickens before they're hatched
Recollatin on somethin that they can't match
They're creatin sounds of a hip-hop human bein
Whether you're American or European
Or even if you're from the West or East coast
I'd like to thank all of you, save the most
Don't diss each other by sayin who's better
Just do it the best way, and stick together
With different rhyme techniques and DJ cuts
And be crazy ambitious, and have a lot of guts
And the people buyin, thanks for your support
Cause if it wasn't for you, we'd all fall short
As long as there's radio, cars and jeeps
You know what you will hear?

[Chorus]

What, what?  What, what what what what?
Yo V, yo yo what what what what what what what you hear?
I can't hear you man, scratch it up one mo' time!
Yo what you hear?
Yo Paul Sea, yo yo, what wha-what you hear?
Yo Godfather D, I ain't hear what he said, what you hear?
{*scats*} Biz {*scats*} Mark
{*beatboxes*}

[Verse One]
I'm the original B-I-Z
The Emeza-Emeza-Emeza-Emeza-A-Rrah-K-I-E
Everywhere I go, I always G
I'm thinkin somethin that you never could see
Doin the beatbox and the R-A-P
That's why I'm the Inhuman Orchestra, Biz Markie
I'm here just doin my J-O-B
So I can reach the T-O-P
As soon as I get to the T-O-P
Then I will be D-O-N with the E
I rock New Jersey and N.Y.C
Whether it's at a club or a block party
To my man Capri, Starchild and Brucie Bee
{?}, Baby J, and DJ Marty
The title of the song in the place to be
Is not this or that, it's "Me Versus Me"

[Chorus: repeat 4X]
{*Biz Markie beatboxes*}
Me versus me

[Verse Two]
I think it's time to act up and throw a fit
Cause I'm rockin to a beat that just won't quit
This is the real thing, not counterfeit
Cause everything you hear, I'm doin it
The name of a baseball glove is a mitt
And what I need on my BMW is a kit
A preacher preaches from a pulpit
And my man Benny Hill, got a lot of wit
The rhymes that I say are the ultimate
And the way out anywhere is called an exit
A real short play is called a skit
And New Balance sneakers are legit
The past tense for bite, is called a bit
Everywhere that I go, all attention I get
I used to live by the North conduit
The Biz Markie will always make a hit!

[Chorus]

[Verse Three]
This is one thing, that I like to say
This is a different kind of rhythm and rap display
I'm not Frankie Crocker or Lamarr Renee
Cause both of them are radio DJ's
Otis Redding be sittin by the dock of the bay
I'm bound to wreck your body to the break of day
And if you wanna see me at a show, you gotta pay
Cause if you don't you will have, a little delay
Zip-de-doo-dah, zip-de-day
I'm the S-K the B-I-Z the Emezah-A-R-K
And even if I'm buggin on out, around the way
You'll never see me drinkin Tanqueray
Swan, G. Rap, Kane, Shan and Shante
Always been down with the capital J
I got a homeboy by the name of Dr. Bombay
My favorite color - is GREY!  Uhh

[Outro]
I can't forget I like reggae
I'm Biz Markie, and my DJ
C-double-O-L V to the break of day
Hold up, bricka-bricka-bay
Rockin to the rhythm, to the break of day
The original B-I-Z, the Emeza-Emeza-A
Best to sing, and appointed rap king, to the break of day
Everywhere I go I like break your way
And it don't matter to me, as long I give you a display
Zip-a-dee-do-dah rock the microphone and you say
The king of romance will like break your day
I'm Biz Mark, I'd like to say okay
And my favorite drink is called OJ
Hippin to hop then to break your way
Listen to me as I rock and I, say okay
To my man Rud and Superlover Cee ay
I rock to the rhythm and oh say okay
Can't forget my man, G-A, U-L
Hold up - it don't matter to me I rock swell
Hold up - you know it's, me, the
Original B-I-Z, the Emeza-A-Rrah-K-I-E
The original with the material and the ladies always know
I'm bound to wreck in like a Lincoln, always steal a show
To kick it with swing, to rock the thing, ha-heh-ha-ha-ha-hee
Known to me as the original B
It don't matter long as I say stuff you see
Kickin records of a rap technique and..
.. down to wreck your body, your moms be freakin
To my man Godfather Deeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee-AHHH!

[Verse 1: Biz Markie]
Now this is a difficult subject
About something that's crazy - oh, what the heck
They know they have something that people don't like
And they still continue to disrespect
The thing I'm talking about is an essence
A foreign fragrance with a presence
That you can't see with the naked eye
But to the nose it's a nuisance

It comes in so many forms, it's camouflaged
And it will sneak upon you like espionage
You might not know it cause it won't show it
And you will swear it's just a mirage
It can be with you when you're talking
It will be so close, you think it's hawking
With a bit of a twang it got its own slang
Is even known in New York, and

Everybody know what I'm saying
From here to the Himalayan
If you don't know, you must be doo-doo
This is what I'm saying
About the dragon

[Verse 2: Biz Markie]
I think I should go more into depth
About a secret that is quiet as kept
If you have it like Richochet Rabbit
It can ruin your rep
There are ways of preventing this
Check your hygiene and your dentist
You might think I'm messing, but this is a lesson
Godliness is cleanliness

But if you think I'm misguiding you
By saying there's something inside of you
That bothers everybody when you're at a party
And your reactions to it is: "pee you!"
You're sitting there baffled and puzzled
Whatever you have, you wish you was muzzled
But if you want a clue, between me and you
It could be the beverage you guzzled

But if you listen to me
The diabolical energetical B
The I-Z Mza-Mza-A-R-K-I-E
I'm tryina give you H-E-L-P

So I'ma end it off like this
Before you give somebody a kiss
For the one you adore, check them before
You get a crazy whiff
Of the dragon

[Verse 3: Biz Markie]
I once knew a guy by the name of Tock
He was one of them kids from like around the block
The kid was cool, had the right gear, and slim
The only thing was wrong, he smelled like a gym
His secret telling rumors, his right guard went left
And his band was playing a song that was funky to def
He was kicking like Bruce Lee and Jim Kelly
Word is bond, that kid was smelly
Even if he would shower and shower
A sprinkle a day, wouldn't last for a hour
He would always wanna like hang around
His underarms had bass with Sensurround
I tried to tell him, but he just wouldn't listen
He thought from my heart I was trying to diss him
I started beating around the bush cause he thought I was nagging
I said, "Yo Tock, you got the dragon!"
Yo this one aight though
Yo, me and Cool V
Dis dis dis gon' be dis gon' be our new single
And when you hear this story you'll say it's aight though
Yo yo yo yo Cool V, why don't you give me a cue
One more cue, and then I'm ready to go in

[Verse One]
Don't you like when the winter's gone
And all of a sudden it starts gettin warm
The trees and the grass start lookin fresh
And the sun and sky be lookin their best
Birds be singin, flowers be bloomin
A lot of brand new cars be zoomin
Fly girls lookin the best they can be
And the guys be dukey dukey Dan you see
Besides all that I like the warm weather
Cause that's when you can get yourself together
But I like Easter time with a grin
Cause when I was little we used to go to Coney I-sland
We used to eat a lot of stuff like cotton candy
Cause back then, it was like fine and dandy
You used to get dressed up in double knits
And your plaid suit jackets, they were the shits
The good ol' days, was back then
And the reason I reminisce, cause..

[Chorus: Biz sings - voice slowed down]
It's spring again
Everybody know it's spring again
To the girls and boys and people above
This is the time to fall in love

[Verse Two]
Now girls - have you ever broke up with your boyfriend
And you felt that the world was comin to an end
Sittin around the house poutin for no reason
Just because you thought your man was skeezin
For a couple of days, look gloomy and gray
Thinkin about the ol' happy days
All of a sudden, the telephone ring
He beg for your forgiveness and you know what that brings
Joy and happiness into your life
Before you felt like your heart was stabbed by a knife
I'm tellin you girls, keep the man that you got
Cause if he cheats, you might need a VD shot
You know two wrongs don't make a right
And if you did somethin wrong, don't do the same it's not polite
Please don't make this breakin up a trend, BECAUSE.. BECAUSE..

[Chorus]

[Verse Three]
Now fellas - have you ever met a girl that tried to front
And wanted you to act like you was on a hunt
I used to see my homeboys frown and fret
For a girl that always tryin to play hard to get
I know I caught it myself, I must admit
And said - anything you want you gotta work hard for it
Me the Diabolical, be obsessed?
And go after somethin that a girl posess?
They're really on yours like a pair of drawers
They want you to be like Santa Claus
They want drug dealers, and four-wheelers
Truck jewelry, they expect you to steal her
Sheeeeit, I know they must be buggin
They better hit the streets and do their own muggin
But in this case, you would just overlook her
Send her on her way and say I can't help you hooker

[Chorus]

{*Cool V scratches to the end*}
One two, one two
The Diabolical's back again
With the Cutmaster Cool V
At the boards my man Paul Sea
But this goes out to my man Danny Dan
The beat man that makes you understand
He want me to tell somethin bout this girl named Kim
I'ma do it like this

[Verse One]
Well it was one of those days when nothing's right with the world
I was half broke, bored, and fed up with my girl
Lookin for somethin to do but wonderin how long
It would take for the next thing to go wrong
So I decided to hang, go out and ease my mind
I told myself you would never know what you might find
I took a hot bubble bath, instead of a shower
Got rid of "The Dragon," it took me a hour
Decided on a sweatsuit, Gucci red and white
Some rings and some ropes, and then I'm on for the night
The Gucci sneakers some cologne, I think Aramis
I look in the mirror and said, "Biz you look - marvelous!"
I jetted out the door, and hailed a taxi
And said "54 in a hurry," and jumped in the backseat
We arrived he said, "$8.50 and that don't count my tip"
I said, "Don't drink and drive -
GIMME MY CHANGE before I bust ya lip!"
The club was jumpin and word is bond
I saw girls walkin around with jeans painted on
Splittin they skirts up the middle, tight leather and lace
Both me and Jimmy agree, we're gonna like this place
Took a seat at the bar, the girl said what are ya drinkin?
A Coke and a smile child, and slid her a Lincoln
Took a sip of my four dollars, she looked at me strange
I said, "Psych I bet you thought you was gonna keep the change"
I made my way through the crowd, it was plain to see
Same everywhere I go, all eyes on me
I sat down at the table, and one of the staff
Said, "Ain't you the Biz" I said, "Yeah but no autographs"
I sat alone in the corner, and sipped my drink
Happened to look across the room and somebody winked
I did the only thing the Diabolical could do
Looked down to see what that I was attached to
Sure enough it was a girl, a sweet female
Her hair and eyes sparkled like ginger ale
I looked lower to her lips, her chin and her neck
And fantasized about the rest, then decided to check
I sent champagne to her table, the waiter asked her name
He returned with Kim, and I almost came
I checked myself and made sure, I looked alright
And told my dick, "Don't worry - we're fuckin tonight!"
Threw her the Kool-Aid smile, and a dash of charm
I stepped to the lady and tapped her arm
But when she turned around, my smile turned to gloom
She didn't look none like she looked across the room
She had big broad shoulders and her titties was big
They were filled with silicone, and her hair was a wig
She had more makeup than Boy George and Phyllis Diller
Ugly enough to be a monster in "Thriller"
Had hair on her chest longer than King Spade
Even though I got a band, I don't need the AIDS
So I hurried out and left, she said, "Please stay"
I said, "Sorry money grip, I don't go that way"
So I stepped out in a hurry, to gather my wits
And thought that's a damn shame, he had nice tits
And that's the last I ever saw of Kim
You wanna know why?  Cause she's a he and her's a him
Like that and-a, like that and-a
I'm not the man called Dantana
You go on and on and on and on and on and on and on
Don't go to Getty, go to Exxon.. {*echoes*}

[Biz Markie shout outs and ad libs]
"Hey Mudfoot, you know what we're here for, lay some treats on us!"

Yo, dis is one of the, dis dis

Oh, now you don't know who it's from now right?
Okay, now I'ma just tell you
You know this is from the diabolical energetical
Poetrical numerical new lyrical man, B-I-Z
Emmezah-emmezah-A-R-K-I-E
Best on the scene, man appointed rap king in effect
If you EVER try to disrespect the Biz Markie
Disability checks you collect, BUT ANYWAY!
I'm just bringin you you somethin
A new, a new a little somethin
Because you remember me from y'know, "The Biz Mark, Biz Mark"
And from the {*beatboxing*} and all that mess
And you know all the other stuff from like, "Make the Music.."
But yo, but I'd like to dedicate this to, my best friend TJ Swan
My cuz-n, my cousin Cutmaster Cool V
My man, my man, and my man, DJ Marley Marl
Cause we in the studio doin this, this is for my NEW DANCE
So check it out, everybody ready
I think he's ready to get, I-ah-I
I-I just think he's read', I think I'm ready to get hype

[Biz Markie]
I'm the Diabolical, Biz Markie
From "Pickin' Boogers," the "Vapors" - "Make the Music" you see
But now I'm bringin to you for your enjoyment
It's an animated dance for my employment
You might remember him from Saturday afternoon
He was my favorite character on any cartoon
But when you do the dance, you can't stay kaput
EVERYBODY GET UP.. and do the Mudd Foot
C'MON!  Get up and do the Mudd Foot
C'mon, yo yo, yo c'mon and do the MUDD Foot
"Hey hey," yo hey, yo, do the MUDD Foot

[Interlude]
Now bust this out
I'm not even gonna get into no rhymin
I just want everybody to listen to the funky beat
While my DJ Cutmaster Cool V, cut up what the name of this dance is

{*Cool V scratches "Mudfoot"*}

[Outro]
You know, I can't really do all that stuff
You know I'm not into that cuttin, but
I want everybody to the dance, let me show you
You see, you gotta act like you crippled
Like you just got one leg, and you know you just gotta just
You gotta just, ge-ge-ge-ge-ge-just gotta relax
And just, let the music take over your body and just chill
Cause this is the Diabolical B-I-Z, Emmezah-A-Rrrah
You know me from, "The Biz Mark, Biz Mark"
I already said that already, but it don't even MATTER
Bring the bassline back in, now bust this out
I'm just talkin about, this is gon' be the new thing to take over
The next century, cause it's gettin ready to be the 90's
And I want this to be one of the hottest dances comin out
It's called the "Mudd Foot"
You know, you you can't do "The Butt" off this music
You can't do "The Wop," can't do nuttin else off it
Can't do the "Michael Jackson"
Only thing you can do off this music is the "Mudd Foot"
Can't be doin that "Arsenio Hall"
I don't know I don't know how he do that, m-heh-heh
Or that I.O.U.'n, Scoob and Scrap'n
And anybody else dancin
Only thing you can do off this, is, the "Mudd Foot"
So c'mon, do the MUDD Foot
Yo, I, see, you know I been here
I been in this studio for about a month
I'm tryin to teach Swan how to do the "Mudd Foot"
I don't know what the heck he doin, he-heh-heh
Marley can't even do it, yo
I'm tryin to teach, Cool V how to the "Mudd Foot"
He doin the "Butt Foot" I don't know what the heck he doin
But, the way you gotta do the "Mudd Foot"
You gotta just kick it, it gotta be like flowin y'know?
It gotta be flowin!
I know everybody from Uptown, by the Apollo, Uptown
Way Uptown, the Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens, Manhattan, Staten Island
Long Island!  Everybody from out of state like Kansas City
California, everywhere, I can't forget New Jersey, Newark y'know
{*fades out*}
And yes y'all, yes y'all
This is, a different kind of dedication
To my man Marcus from Kansas City
But I'm just tellin ya straight on up
Don't be messin with no drugs
Whether you're young, whether you're old
Whether you're bad, whether you're bold
Don't mess with it cause it's not for the soul
And we gonna do it a little somethin
With three subjects like this..

[Biz Markie]
Subject one is about a brother by the name of John
Who was sellin crack, just like it was Avon
And you know, y'know the reason I say "was"
Because that's no longer what my man John does
There was a time when he was wearin much gold
Drivin a Benz, Jaguar and a Rolls
The lifestyle he lived was far from penny ante
Yo-ho-ho-ho-ho, word to granny's panties
Cause he would make dough grow, and sling it like a yo-yo
Being broke, was just a no-no
But then the day came when John got caught
And he was dropped like pantyhose without support
You shoulda thought about, what you did in the past
To realize, this fast livin wouldn't last
But, the same guy that was a big time hoodlum
Is now in jail, waitin for someone to duke him

[Hook - kids singing 4X]
Things get a little easier
Once you learn to understand it

[Biz Markie]
Subject two, and this one is a doozy
A messed up story about a girl named Suzy
Now when you're on WIC, as problems may seem enough
But you know she had to get Scotty to beam her up
On a crack mission, no type of ambition
Make blunts disappear better than a magician
Her eyes got dim, her body got slim
She said there's nothin in the world like a good ol' stem
On and like on and, and it was strong
Grabbed her pipe and sung a song
"I want to get HIGH.. so high!"
"I want to get HIGH.. so high!"
She'd go out buy a nice rock just to suit her
Then hit the weed spot to be blessed by buddha
Bum offa Lucy to complete her stimulation
Put it all together for a perfect combination
I mean this girl would actually buy a rock with
The very last dime she got in her pocket
And when she saw her friends, comin from the spot
Like Prudential, she got a piece of their rock
That's why

[Hook]

[Biz Markie]
Subject three, finally, the
E-N-D about a girl by the name of Marie
She used to be hot, most beautiful to the utmost
I mean this girl was blessed with an overdose
Of curves, swerves, word to the mother my brother
And boy did the B-I-Z love her
But then.. {*singing*} those.. were.. the.. DAYS
My friend.. we thought they'd never end
And she looked alright, to the S-K Biz Markie
But then she got on drugs
Started wearin extensions and rugs
And let me tell you what say happened to Marie
{*rapping*} because nowadays Marie don't look so hot
Everytime that I see her, she's headed for the spot
Her hair is all knotty, cause Scotty got her body
And her underarms kickin like the ho know karate
Her clothes are real dirty, and usually the same
As for money she don't have a dime to claim
Because when I saw the girl the other day
She was puttin a pack of Now-or-Laters on layaway

[Hook] - fades out

[Biz Markie]
This is a different type of dedication
To a guy that was a different kind of inspiration
Only people that knew him, know what I'm talkin about
And at the end of the story, you will say without a doubt
This wasn't your typical case, of fast livin
Anything he was makin, he was givin
To his moms, pops, his brother and his girl
Cause they, meant, the most to him in the world
Around Suffolk he wasn't known
But in Eastern Long Island, he did have a home
Called L.I., is where he stayed
Where there was no need for D-Con or Raid
He was cool with everybody, he had no enemies
I'm makin this record, cause he's a friend of me
Cause he's a hard workin kid, I've just stated
That's why this record, is dedicated
To my man Rich

Yo yo, this is for you my man
God bless you

[Verse Two]
Let me tell you what happened in the early 80's
When we wasn't thinkin about gettin all the ladies
Me and Rich was thinkin about survival of the fittest
You can ask Keith or Kevin, cause both of them were with us
We'd try to get a job everyplace that it takes
We was even at the factory they call {?}
Everywhere we went they said they'd call us back
Or even said they're not hirin to throw us off track
But Richie Rich said, forget that stuff
Even though, times was rough
We kept searchin searchin lookin and lookin
It seems everywhere we went, the jobs was tooken
Still Rich didn't give up the faith
He found a job that wasn't safe
Even though it was dangerous, it wouldn't switch
That's why this is dedicated to my man Rich

Yo this is to you my man Rich
Cause you know you go way back, you go way back
Word up, God bless you

[Verse Three]
The way the story end, is just a tragedy
I wish upon a star that it didn't have to be
Endin this way for my man Richard
Cause still in my mind, he's still as pictured
Like, he just had gone yesterday
For sellin, C-R-A-C-K
His dream was.. to be a boxer
So, he could knock the socks off of
An Iran Barkley, or even Mike Tyson
But on the streets, he was sacrificin
For his family, and his wife
Cause he struggled, he struggled all his life
He wasn't a straight up, criminal or villain
Or even tryin to get, stupid or illin
Was messed up for takin somebody's life and shit
That tried so hard, and just wouldn't quit
This is a slow record, with a switch
Because it's dedicated, to my man Rich
To you my man
This is to you, Rich
Peace

[Verse One]
I once knew a girl by the name of Monique
She was my childhood sweetheart every day of the week
Whether PS46, or 151
After school I'd go to her house, to have some fun
We both lived in Colonial Projects
I lived in building 48, she lived in building 26
We used to play Ringling, Coke or 1-2-3
But when I'm in Monique's presence, I would just freeze
The relationship began when I was five startin
She was in nursery school, I was in kindergarten
We was more closer than a hand and glove
This is what you call real puppy love
When we'd go trick or treating, I would carry her bag
When we moved to Long Island, it was all such a drag
Cause I know it would be difficult to see her again
I wouldn't miss her more than I'd miss all of my friends
Even though we was little this love was unique
And this is what I say to my love Monique, because

[Chorus - repeat 4X]
"She's not, just another woman..
She's not, no no!"

[Verse Two]
Let me tell ya a little somethin, about Monique
Even though we was little she had a physique
Indian brown skin with a nice complexion
She always gave me tender love and affection
I knew she was different in her own little way
I used to knock at her door bout every single day
I remember when we used to go trick or treatin
I used to snatch bags, so she could sink her teeth in
Crazy big variety of a lot of candy
She would share it with her friends Kim Ron and Fran and
Lee-nette, the girl she called her cousin
We never had an argument, oh we was never fussin
That's why me and her got along so good
Anything I asked her to do, you know she would
We would have family day, in back of building 70
I would win her a prize, so she could treat me heavenly
I don't care what nobody say, because
This girl would make my day, and

[Chorus]

[Verse Three]
Now this is the epilogue of this story
About a young little girl, especially for me
No matter how many years ago I can't forget
But then again 1986 hit
She looked just the same, but in a bigger version
My mind started goin on a love excursion
I started reminiscin to her bout old times
She began to smile, I guess I rang her chimes
I didn't see her again until 1988
And I saw her again, and she still was straight
Now this time I had enough courage to speak to her
I told her would you be with me, and what would occur
Then I asked was, she swingin any capers
She said - no not me, nobody got no papers
I couldn't believe, after all of these years
I was so happy she waited it brought me to tears, cause

[Chorus] - quickly fades out

[Intro]
Yo, you know this is funky
I'd like to say rest in peace, to Aaliyah (sweet thing)
And 'Left Eye' Lopes
But, you know, shout out to my man Bruce Lee
Jackie Chan, check it out, Jet Li

[Verse 1]
I'mma bring it to you like this
Drop a three pointer from the corner like swish
Walk around with a name belt and a funky new rap
Shell tops new and Space Invaders cap
Old school like bread and gravy
Me and Monty roll together like Fred and Grady
Ain't nothin' you can say to stop this mad man
Play Defender, Centipede and Ms. Pac-Man
Just like Martin Luther I had a dream
In a house with no heat, just kerosene
Call Biz Mark, so you get the better connection
The type to wear Timbs to a wedding reception
I'm so smart I even got a GED
Plus a vide-oh-oh, BET, and MTV
I'm the best thing out now go ask your moms
Spendin' money on cars just to pass the time

[Hook]
Four chicken wings with shrimp fried rice, that's good
(Egg foo yung)
Beef and broccoli with a little white rice, that's good
(Fried one time)
Chicken chow mein with a little white rice, that's good
(Mix it, mix it up nice)
I need a coupe of egg rolls in my neighborhood, that's good

[Verse 2]
I'm the Uptown rhymer, large like Big Momma
Keep three girls on the couch like "Oh Drama"
End every line with period, no comma
Hidin' out 'til I'm found like Osama
Walk on water, filled with pirahnas
Want the tie within coats with no liner
If I ever lose my girl, I go find her
If not, I got Shirl' and Tawanna
Right back on ya, yep the old timer
Any contract you got, I no sign-a
Don't smoke or use drugs, of no kind-a
Everything that I wear, is de-signer
Just like Dolce, hang with Gabbana
Biz Mark play his part, the show timer
Make any party hot like your sauna
Still keep the crowd controlled with no drama

[Hook]
Four chicken wings with shrimp fried rice, that's good
(Egg foo yung)
Beef and broccoli with a little white rice, that's good
(Fried one time)
Chicken chow mein with a little white rice, that's good
(Mix it, mix it up nice)
I need some egg rolls in my neighborhood, that's good

[Verse 3]
It's the Mmah, Zah-aYYAH, Rrah, Zah-KaYYAH
When Guiliani leave I will be the Mayor
In the year two-thou', I'm gonna house
I'm still tryin to look up a girl's blouse
Got a Hummer for the summer, Benz for my girlfriend
When it comes to ice, I got a lot of diamonds
I'm hangin at the Rucker, watchin skip-to-my-loo
Girls askin me to do the {*puh, ah one-two*}
Weather is good, about eighty degrees
My X-Ray vision seein thongs and G's
Thankin the Lord for the beautiful day
I seen people sippin' on Tanqueray
Everything's the same in the new millen'
Seattle is where they got a Hip-Hop Museum
So listen to the way I rock the spot
Right about now I'mma make you hot

[Hook]
Four chicken wings with shrimp fried rice, that's good
(Egg foo yung)
Beef and broccoli with a little white rice, that's good
(Fried one time)
Chicken chow mein with a little white rice, that's good
(Mix it, mix it up nice)
I need some egg rolls in my neighborhood, that's good

[Biz Markie]
Rrrrrah! The Emmezah..
Hey, Bruce Lee! Jackie Chan! My man, Jet Li!
Five Deadly Venoms, the Master Killer
Huang Yu, Angela Mayo, okay
I'm the Bizz Markie and I came to rock
To {???}
I can't forget my man by the name of 

[?] he rock, he rock
I'm the Biz and I stop

[Biz Markie singing]
My name is the Biz, everywhere I go
I rock the party, from head to toe
Lot of MC's wanna hear the way that I do rock
Is it because I put the party people into shock
I think it's because I am the original B
Ain't no other MC like the B-I-Z Markie (hit it Kev)
On the guitar is my man Monty
And Tex don't know how to dance for S-H-I-T (fuck you)
But every time you hear me I am on the go
Right there in Germany is my man Dajabo{?}
Every time you hear me rhyme, I know they know how to sing
That's why a lot of girls cling to the ding-a-ling
{*everyone breaks down in laughter*}

[Verse 1]
I saw this girl from like around the way
I told her I was the B-I-Z Emezah-A
She said she know my reputation, know I got clout
And like to get to know me, without no doubt
So we started havin' long telephone conversations
Tryin' to feel each other out, showin' a lot of patience
Was a hook-up from my man, word bond she was bad
If I met her whole family I would kiss her dad
So in my mind I was thinkin' "She really likes me"
She got a good head on her shoulders and she's no dummy
Me and her had compatible horoscopes
But she bugged me out so bad I was on the ropes
Now when I was with her, my shoulders shrugged
Because when I reached out for a kiss and hug
She mushed me in my face, and smiled with a grin
And said this question...

[Chorus]
Why can't we be friends?  We can't we be friends?
Why can't we, be, friends?  We can't we be friends?
Why can't we be friends?  We can't we be friends?
Why can't we, be, friends?  We can't we be friends?

[Verse 2]
I knew she was different, a very special gal
For the time being, hmm I shall
Respect her wishes, she wasn't a groupie
I understand, she said she just had met me
I liked her for that, a woman with morals
She called me every day, so I saw she was loyal
It bugged me out cause I don't usually wait
But on a scale of one to ten she was a twenty-eight
We was goin' out on the reg', movies and dinner
Always stay at my house, way past ten o', clock
I thought she really really liked me
I did the right thing, like my name was Spike Lee
She had her own car so I walked her to the door
Like Busta Rhymes I said, "Gimme some more"
So I put my lips out, to get a kiss
And she said just like this...

[Chorus]
Why can't we be friends?  We can't we be friends?
Why can't we, be, friends?  We can't we be friends?
Why can't we be friends?  We can't we be friends?
Why can't we, be, friends?  We can't we be friends?

[Verse 3]
I knew somethin was wrong because my mack is correct
Talkin' for six months and didn't hit it yet?
I thought I was slippin', or maybe in a slump
I felt like Eddie Murphy when he was Professor Klump
Naw it can't be, she's here every day
So I don't know why she'd wanna treat me this way
I gotta investigate like Magnum P.I.
I just don't understand, why? Oh, why?
So the next time I saw her she was unhappy
She had a frown on her face and real jumpy
I said, "Yo what's wrong?"  I was real concerned
The way she looked her life had took a real turn
She said, "I went to court today," and I said, "What?"
"If I tell you this, you're gonna go nuts"
I said, "Tell me I can take it I won't pretend"
"I gotta go to jail for life, so.."

[Chorus]
Why can't we be friends?  We can't we be friends?
Why can't we, be, friends?  We can't we be friends?
Why can't we be friends?  We can't we be friends?
Why can't we, be, friends?  We can't we be friends?

[Biz + P. Diddy]
And you don't stop
And you can't stop

[P. Diddy] Yeah, yeah - I like this

[B-I-Z] If you

[Diddy] If you

[B-I-Z] Wanna know

[B-I-Z] The real deal, about the Biz

[B-I-Z] So you know what time it is

[Diddy] A-come on

[B-I-Z] If you

[B-I-Z] Wanna know

[Diddy] Wanna know

[Diddy] And that's comin from me, the P. Diddy

[Diddy] And you know what time it is, RIGHHHT

[P. Diddy]
So come on Diabolical
Don't stop and don't you dare quit
Just get on the mic, sit on the mic
Spit on the mic and don't you dare quit!

[Biz Markie]
When I get on the mic, I guarantee
There's no better MC than Biz Markie
Everything I say, or anything I do
Will move yo' posse or your crew
When you me hear me say, and what I play
Affects a lot of people in the strangest way
Well I'm too cold to freeze, too hot to burn
And I never miss a tag when it's my turn
Cause I can, rock the mic if you give me a chance
Cool V'll cut the record, make you do the 'Biz Dance'
I can - flip the crowd with a wave of my hand
I'm the Diabolical, "And you know this MAAAAAAN!"

[Hook]
You can do your thang, and any-thang you choose
But please, please, leave my thang alone
You can do your thang, and any-thang you choose
But please, please, leave my thang alone

[Biz Markie]
I'm the court jester, the manifester
I used to buy my clothes at A.J. Lester's
The rhymerator, the beat creator
Whack rappers get dropped like a hot potato
The dime repeater, the MC greeter
Knuckle bleeder, no need for a heater
The only MC in history
Who didn't even have to R-A-P
The bum destroyer, I'm comin for ya
Got took to court and didn't need a lawyer
Make James Brown get down (yeah yeah)
Made Beretta go get her (yeah yeah)
Made Laverne and Bill Cosby (yeah yeah)
Go change they sweaters (yeah yeah)
I fought Mike Tyson, dropped him in 4
Went to Fort Knox and kicked down the door
Rocked seven continents with all this flow
"And this is somethin for the radi-ohhhh"

[Hook]

[Biz Markie]
Got ladies screamin STRANJE STRANJE
With the rhythm and rhymes and style that I display
If rap was sex, I'd be a porno star
With Sade, and Janet, in a menage-a-trois
Merrily merrily, life is just a dream-ah
First car, I ever had was a Beamer
First girl, I ever had was a screamer
I got out of breath and almost caught emphysema
Put the party people in a state of shock
While Biz compose songs like Sebastian Bach
This is the end of this scenario
Like Robin Harris, "I gotta go - gotta go!"

[Hook] - repeat 2X w/ ad libs

[Sung ad libs before a quick fadeout]

[Verse 1]
Now that Biz Mark's inside the joint
Guaranteed to rock and always prove a point
Doin' what I do cause it gotta be done
About the Prince of Boogie and the Master of Fun
My rap technique is most very unique
Your toes start to squeak by the way that I speak
My rhymes are more sporty than the ESPN
And the way that I spit, you like again and again
From here to the Hima', I'm like a Lil' Kim-ah
Notorious and glorious, way above the rim-ah
I'm not a gangster rapper, and I don't get freaky
Never drunk or high or don't a-smoke ciggy's
I'm just self-assertive, BORN crazy
When I came out my momma they said, "A whoopsy daisy!"
As you see, you know I, I keep it goin'
So take it from me, ha, the king of disco'n

[Chorus]
Get down, get on down, get-get on down
"I'm bound to wreck your body and say turn the party out"
Get down, get on down, get get on down
"I'm bound to wreck your body" - get, you gotta get on down
Get down, get on down, get-get on down
"I'm bound to wreck your body and say turn the party out"
Get down, so get on down, get-get on down
"I'm bound to wreck your body" - get, you gotta get on down
Get down, get on down, get get on down
"I'm bound to wreck your body and say turn the party out"

[Verse 2]
I'm the type of guy that be keepin' it hot
Wherever you see me, I be rockin' the spot
Big belly and all, y'all be havin' a ball
People gather 'round me like I'm Pope John Paul
We can't party like it's 1999 no more
Cause it's 2 2 baby, and the future's in store
So let, olden ways be forgotten
And felt just grab a girl 'cause she's soft as cotton
Get on the dance floor, back that ass up, girl
And act like you don't have a care in the world
Rock around the clock, hickory dickory dock
Shout to B.I.G., Pac, L, Tah and Scott La Rock
I'm glad I made it to the Y2K
So what can I say?  Salate!
You look at me funny and say, "Whadda you say?"
I'm the B-I-Z Emezzah-A-R-K

[Chorus]
Get down, get on down, get-get on down
"I'm bound to wreck your body and say turn the party out"
Get down, get on down, get get on down
"I'm bound to wreck your body" - get, you gotta get on down
Get down, get on down, get-get on down
"I'm bound to wreck your body and say turn the party out"
Get down, so get on down, get-get on down
"I'm bound to wreck your body" - get, you gotta get on down
Get down, get on down, get get on down
"I'm bound to wreck your body and say turn the party out"

[Verse 3]
Get down, get on down, withzzzah
Inhuman Orchestra that you would prefer
Singin funky records for him or her
Only thing to say is I'm spectacular
Let me get busy so I can make you dance
Shake and bake and put you in a trance
Make you forget all your stress for five minutes or less
Like a vacation in Jamaica or France
Have you happy and jumpin for joy
Whether you man, woman girl or a boy
You will agree, it ain't no other like the B-I-Z
I'm up with the Jones, like my name's Roy
But, yo, no, it's got to be the Original
Milky like cereal, funky fresh material
The L.I.'er for yo' desire
But right about now, I gotta retire

[Chorus]
Get down, get on down, get-get on down
"I'm bound to wreck your body and say turn the party out"
Get down, get on down, get get on down
"I'm bound to wreck your body" - get, you gotta get on down
Get down, get on down, get-get on down
"I'm bound to wreck your body and say turn the party out"
Get down, so get on down, get-get on down
"I'm bound to wreck your body" - get, you gotta get on down
Get down, get on down, get get on down
"I'm bound to wreck your body and say turn the party out"

[Outro]
Your moms'll save this like your name is Sammy Davis
Cause I'm guaranteed to rock the microphone
And hit you like {?}
I don't gotta bald head
But I'm guaranteed to rock and spread love
Super educated from above
MC guaranteed to hold you just like a glove
I'm not Johnny Bench
But I hit yo' ass with a big-ass wrench
Biz!

[Biz Markie singing]
My name is Biz Markie, I rock for Queens, Astoria
My new album is called Weekend Warrior
But every time that I always hit a note
Just like DJ Kool, "eh-ah," let me clear my throat
But let me tell you that my name is the
Original the B-I-Z Markie

[Chorus]
Games, you don't have to play, games with me girl
You, know, how, I feel
Oh, games, you don't have to play, games with me girl
You, know, how, I feel - ohh
.. games, you don't have to play, games with me girl
You, know, how, I feel
Oh, games, you don't have to play, games with me girl
You, know, how, I feel
Oh, games, you don't have to play, games with me girl
You, know, how, I feel
Oh, games

[Verse 1]
Hi there good lookin', pretty sweet thang
I really want to put you under my wing
But every time I try you give me a hard time
Like I'm a murderer, or committing a crime
I try to do everything right for you
You're always givin' me excuses, makin' me blue
When I met you at Cancun, at Fiesta Americana
You lookin' tasty like strawberries and banana
I asked you your name you said "Lee-Lee from San Fran"
She said, "I have friends but I don't got a man"
I said, "Really?!  As good as you look?
Lookin' like somethin' out a Playboy book?"
I thought I struck gold, ching-ching, the jackpot
Just the thought of you it be makin' me hot
When I step to you, you act funny style
You need to marinate on this for a while

[Chorus]
Games, you don't have to play, games with me girl
You, know, how, I feel
Ohh games, you don't have to play, games with me girl
You, know, how, I feel - ohh

[Verse 2]
Now let me tell you like this, baby doll
I never guessed you would act off the wall
Give me a chance for a little romance
We can dance and dine in Jamaica or France
Somethin' in the way you make me feel
I like your personality and your sex appeal
But it's all hard, not bein with you
You're playin' hard to get like catch 22
Some people got time to play them games
But I don't, so don't call me no names
Like all I want is sex and take you no places
And, why you always up in girls face?
You know, I'm the B-I-Z, this is my job
Fans nibble on me like corn on the cob
Let me tell you somethin', my word is bond
Like "Bonita Applebum," you gotta put me on

[Chorus]
Games, you don't have to play, games with me girl
You, know, how, I feel
Ohh games, you don't have to play, games with me girl
You, know, how, I feel - ohh

[Verse 3]
If I didn't feel you, I wouldn't send you roses
Jewelry, furs, and designer clotheses
You know you got me, that's why you do what you do
Stressin' and depressin', me and my crew
You know it's got to be real like Cheryl
Or you wouldn't be askin for an encore again
I know you like me
So you might as well do the right thing like Spike Lee
Because I love you more than human eyes can see
'Cause you got what I need, "Oh baby!"
I don't know why you give me real rough times
'Cause you're the one that rings my chimes
You bring me joy like Mary J
I wanna do the same thing to you every day
So stop playin' your games like Barry White
You know, you know, you know!  AIIIGHT?

[Chorus]
Games, you don't have to play, games with me girl
You, know, how, I feel
Ohh games, you don't have to play, games with me girl
You, know, how, I feel - ohh

[Intro: Biz Markie]
In what?  In stereo
How long, until it's time to go?  Baby doll
It's the Biz Markie, and the Def Squad!
Oh see, we gotta do this again like this, check it out

[Verse 1: Biz Markie]
You keep on knockin' but you can't come in-ah
My way of rhymin', cause you're a beginner
You know with my flow, I bring the ill freak funker
I'm so unforgettable like Archie Bunker
I be catchin' wreck like my name was Randy Moss
And always be flossin', my funky diamonds costin'
My, my my repertoire
Is so bizarre you go hardy-har-har
My jingle bell-ah always Roc-A-Fella
Even if I go acapella it will still be a best seller
I got super sperm, eat wheat germ
Never had a cameo, never had a perm
I'm not Billy Dee, or R. Kelly
Or, Markie Dee or B.I.G
I'm a, LITTLE somethin' like Heavy D
Because "girls, ah girls they love me"

[Chorus: Biz Markie & (Erick Sermon)]
I'm not a freak, but I can't help myself
I'm not a freak, but I can't help myself
I'm not a freak, but I can't help myself
I'm not a freak (Yeah), but I can't help myself

[Verse 2: Erick Sermon]
Yo, I'm that '88 "It's My Thing" rapper
You that one year scream "Bling" rapper
Dapper than Dapper Dan, my interior's Gucci
Overdosin', call me John Belushi
Never liked Lucy and I beat Little Ricky
Made him cry a river like his name was Britney
I rock gold chains, I never wore the platinum
Unless records was jewelry and it come from rappin'
(WOW!!) Like the Diabolical Biz
I'm followin' his, style - how are you kids?
This here is real, Mobb Deep underground
Take me to Funkytown, and drive around
I hop out the Hum mer, the same color as the truck
Fake cats lookin' Biz like "Hey whassup?"
I'm a vet, and never wore a green suit
The only army is Def Squad, believe troop!

[Chorus: Biz Markie]
I'm not a freak, but I can't help myself
I'm not a freak, but I can't help myself
I'm not a freak, but I can't help myself
I'm not a freak, but I can't help myself

[Verse 3: Biz Markie]
Ah let's do it, let's do it
Work your mind, put your body in-to it
I rock the microphone, most definitely
I got mo' rhymes than Muhammad Ali
I got mo' toys than Mr. Spock
I put the party people in a state of shock
Listen listen listen to the Emmezah-A
Rrazah-K, always makin' your day
Without further adieu for you and yours
Luckier than a gambler throwin' 3's and 4's
Just like Martin Luther I had a dream
That I could turn the party out, make the ladies scream
With the with the whoa quick unpredictable
Like Daffy Duck, I'm diss-pic-a-ble!
This is the end, and I'm lettin' you know
"I love it party people, but I got to go"

[Chorus: Biz Markie]
I'm not a freak, but I can't help myself
I'm not a freak, but I can't help myself
I'm not a freak, but I can't help myself
I'm not a freak, but I can't help myself

[Intro: Biz Markie]
Huh-huh, uh-huh, yeah, uh-huh
Y'all know, uh-huh, uh, uh-huh
Y'all know, uh, uh uh-huh
Check it out (Come on!)

[Verse 1: Biz Markie]
Don't go to Getty, go to Exxon
Like "Bonita Applebum," ya gotta put me on
Got good luck like Lucky Charms leprechaun
Can't believe Freaky Tah and Big L is gone
You think I'm a mailman with my delivery
Ain't no other brother like the B-I with the Z
Emezah-A-Rrrah, say K-I with the E
I got mo' rhymes than Muhammad Ali
Not number one but here to have fun
Guaranteed to proceed and get the job done
Y'all know my competition is none
Funky funky fresh from the day I begun
You rock with me, you're guaranteed to have a ball
Got a big belly, over six feet tall
My favorite team is the Vikings when I watch football
Here's another one to get you off the wall

[Chorus]
He's Biz Markie, as you can see
He came to tear-tear-tear-shit up (Come on!)
He's Biz Markie, as you can see
He came to tear-tear-tear-shit up (Come on!)
He's Biz Markie, as you can see
He came to tear-tear-tear-shit up (Come on!)
He's Biz Markie, as you can see
He came to tear-tear-tear shit up-up-up (Come on!)

[Verse 2: Biz Markie]
Soon to be elected in the Hall of Fame
I rock the microphone, emceeing's my game
I flip so many styles, my name should be Flipper
On Three's Company, I wish I was Jack Tripper
Back in the days, I used to eat {?}litina{?}
Back in the days, my sister had a Thumbelina
Back in the days, I liked a girl named Angelina
Back in the days, I wanted to get in between her
My jingle bella, always Roc-A-Fella
Even my acapella will be a best seller
She couldn't believe what I had achieved
Funky like ring around the collar, doo doo on the sleeves
Enquiring minds always want to know
How did I get my ill freestyle flow?
I just tell 'em straight up without no B
Ask me no questions yo, here's my ID

[Chorus]
He's Biz Markie, as you can see
He came to tear-tear-tear-shit up (Come on!)
He's Biz Markie, as you can see
He came to tear-tear-tear-shit up (Come on!)
He's Biz Markie, as you can see
He came to tear-tear-tear-shit up (Come on!)
He's Biz Markie, as you can see
He came to tear-tear-tear shit up-up-up (Come on!)

[Verse 3: Biz Markie]
I'm not Captain Kirk, or Mr. Spock
When I put the party people in a state of shock
I'm like Mark Twain, or Shakespeare
'Cause when I'm on the stage, people throw they hands in the air
Wavin 'em wild, like in a frenzy
Dog in the house like I'm Spuds MacKenzie
I'm just doin it, just rockin' the house
Sucker MC's is quiet as a mouse
Comin' off the top of my head
I'm not dumb so don't be misled
When I was young, I never pissed in the bed
Always listened to what my moms and pops said
Love reggae so much, you could call me a dread
Got a big belly so you know I'm well-fed
And I'm a lover-lover like my name is Ed
And I'm too awesome like K and Teddy Ted

[Chorus]
He's Biz Markie, as you can see
He came to tear-tear-tear-shit up (Come on!)
He's Biz Markie, as you can see
He came to tear-tear-tear-shit up (Come on!)
He's Biz Markie, as you can see
He came to tear-tear-tear-shit up (Come on!)
He's Biz Markie, as you can see
He came to tear-tear-tear shit up-up-up (Come on!)
He's Biz Markie, as you can see
He came to tear-tear-tear-shit up (Come on!)
He's Biz Markie, as you can see
He came to tear-tear-tear-shit up (Come on!)
He's Biz Markie, as you can see
He came to tear-tear-tear-shit up (Come on!)
He's Biz Markie, as you can see
He came to tear-tear-tear shit up-up-up (Come on!)

[Chorus: Lil' Kal + possibly others]
It's like a dream, you can say what you wanna say about me
But at the end of the day I'll be countin' my mo-ney
It's like a dream - yeah, it's like a dream - yeah
Cause at the end of the day I'll be countin' my mo-ney

[Verse 1: Biz Markie]
It's the M-zah, A-ah, R-zah, K-ah
Like the internet, I am here to stay-ah
Been a long time, I know it's been years
Oops! I did it again, like Britney Spears
Like The Matrix and Keanu Reeves
Ringed around the collar and doo doo on the sleeves
I'm explosive like dynamite
I should be on "Entertainment Tonight"
Or "Access Hollywood" or "Soul Train"
I'm so on fire, I fart propane
Don't use Rogaine, got a head full of hair
Cause the brother on the mic is so debonair
I'm so cool, the Fonz say "EYY!"
Cause I'm the best MC from around my way
Never listen to what haters say
I just stay focused like Kobe in L.A

[Chorus]
It's like a dream, you can say what you wanna say about me
But at the end of the day I'll be countin my mo-ney
It's like a dream - yeah, it's like a dream - yeah
Cause at the end of the day I'll be countin my mo-ney

[Verse 2: Biz Markie]
I'mma do it like I never have done it
Never got drunk and never got blunted
The Redox in my ear, they cost about a hundred
If the record's a hit, you know the Biz spun it
Super educated master rap techniquer
Ill funk freaker every day of the week-ah
Whether it's Kim, Agnes, Monique or Tamika
My unique physique make 'em all weaker and weaker
Cause I'm hung, like Mighty Joe Young
They all get sprung, from the joy that I brung
I drive a Hummer, I'm hot like Donna Summers
I'm one of the first human (rum-a-pum pummers)
No matter what they say, I always sound flyer
Than anyone you heard, or even de-sired
Yes it's me, I'm the Original B-I-Z
M-A-R-K-I with the E

[Chorus]
It's like a dream, you can say what you wanna say about me
But at the end of the day I'll be countin my mo-ney
It's like a dream - yeah, it's like a dream - yeah
Cause at the end of the day I'll be countin my mo-ney

[Verse 3: Biz Markie]
The beat don't stop 'til everybody's gone
I'm old school like a bag of Bon Ton
Like the Mary Jane Girls I go "All Night Long"
Hit you in the head like El Kabong
My style is masculine, far from feminine
I got soul like James Brown and Rakim and 'em
I don't know what you came to do
I came to rock the house for you
From sunny California to Kalamazoo!
Been rockin parties since ninety-two
I know you heard that Reality Bites
But I'm liver than the show called "Saturday Night"
I stay on, it looks like city lights
Chicks cling on me like ballerina tights
Like Minute Mouse and Courageous Cat
You can't beat that with a baseball bat!

[Chorus]
It's like a dream, you can say what you wanna say about me
But at the end of the day I'll be countin my mo-ney
It's like a dream - yeah, it's like a dream - yeah
Cause at the end of the day I'll be countin my mo-ney

[Biz Markie]
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!
One-two, doin the do
This goes out to my man Truck, my man Jerome
Bilal and the whole Long Island crew
And it goes like this

[Verse 1]
Hey how ya doin it's me
The incredible unforgettable B
Izzah give me Rrah K-I, with the E
I got mo' rhymes than Muhammad Ali
Hey!  The way I get down you will say
"Damn that nigga Biz always makes my day"
My style is untangeable when you hear
Cause the brother on the mic is most debonnaire
On the, DJ tip I'm like savoir-faire
Cause you can probably find me anywhere
I'm the best from West, I'm the beast from the East
I'm the OLLLLLD SCHOOL, like a permanent crease
Like, Scooby Doo or a Chucky doll
You better grab a seat because you're gonna be here for a while
So for all you new schoolers, relax and chill
As the Diabolical tell you the deal

[Chorus]
"They know I par-tay to the break of day"
"They know I par-tay to the break of day"
"They know I par-tay to the break of day"
"They know I par-tay to the break of day"
"They know I par-tay to the break of day"
"They know I par-tay to the break of day"
"They know I par-tay to the break of day"
"They know I par-tay to the break of day"

[Verse 2]
"I got so much on my mind" like my name was Chuck D
That when it comes to DJ'n, I'm a Public Enemy
I rocked all colors, races and ages
When you see the crowd go crazy you will say I'm outrageous
I rocked Sinbad, Cancun, Essence and the Grammy's
Magic Johnson parties at Superbowl in Miami
First Friday, Philly, Dallas and St. Lou'
My bars{?}, Alex and Kenny Johnson know what I can do
Chicago with {?}, Detroit with D. Archer
New York with Gator, Lenny Smith and Lenny the Barber
I do all the hot joints like Eddie Murphy and will flip it
Still get down and dirty in Newark and Elizabeth
Keenan and {?} brothers, Pat in Orlando
Keyshaun Walker and Di-ane, Valentine{?} yo
I rock weddings from Toni Braxton, to Boyz II Men Shawn
And this is what they say, word is bond

[Chorus]
"They know I par-tay to the break of day"
"They know I par-tay to the break of day"
"They know I par-tay to the break of day"
"They know I par-tay to the break of day"
"They know I par-tay to the break of day"
"They know I par-tay to the break of day"
"They know I par-tay to the break of day"
"They know I par-tay to the break of day"

[Verse 3]
Let me tell you how I started in ninety-two
When I was DJ'n from Jersey to Howard U
I did homecomings from U-V-A to James Madison
And did The Tunnel, Reflect, or Kordell and Patterson
Now I graduated with DJ love
From rockin' from Virginia and seein' the Q Club
People looked at me and said "Why you DJ'n?"
"I loved +Oh Baby You..+ and you're a rock singer"
So the transition from rappin' to DJ wasn't smooth
But I still pursued cause I had somethin' to prove
July 4th and Labor Day in Virginia was hot
Cause Biggie Smalls and Teddy Riley was in the spot
From {?} to Jones Street to Philly Greek Picnic
Florida and Bayou Classic and Atlanta Freaknik
All the girls, in G-strings and thongs
If you would, please just sing along

[Chorus]
"They know I par-tay to the break of day"
"They know I par-tay to the break of day"
"They know I par-tay to the break of day"
"They know I par-tay to the break of day"
"They know I par-tay to the break of day"
"They know I par-tay to the break of day"
"They know I par-tay to the break of day"
"They know I par-tay to the break of day"

[Verse One]
I'd like to tell a story and it goes like this
Before I was makin money hand over fist
The mid-80's is what I'm talkin about
You will agree without a reasonable doubt
As I tell this tale, sittin on a pail
This is one you'll like when it's done
Only certain people know about Union Square
The Rooftop, Latin Quarter, cause I was there
Red Alert downtown, Brucie Bee uptown
Grandmaster Vic had a different sound
You had block parties, with free gifts
Mr. Magic and Marley gave radio a lift
You don't understand, but we do
That's why I'm tryin to explain it to you
So sit back and listen, to what I say
As I tell the story of this beautiful day

[Chorus: sampled]
"We'll go dancing in the dark" - HEY!
"Walking through the park, and reminiscing"
BREAK IT ON DOWN!

[Verse Two]
Before Versace and DKNY
There was a lot of clothes that was fly
Like Polo, Benetton, Coca-Cola and Osh Kosh
Guess jeans and others that's acid washed
D.C. wore K-Swiss and Sergio Tacchini
Girls wore tennis skirts, that was mini
Spot{?}, Ewings, Le Coq Sportif
New Balance, Fila, Nike and Ellesse
African clothes and medallions was worn
And when Rakim came out, knowledge was born
In the midst of it all, I almost forgot
There was a brother uptown makin his own spot
Makin Gucci, leather and suede tailor made
That had more flavor than mom's Kool-Aid
I'm gonna tell you, the name of this man
He goes by the name of the Dapper Dan

[Chorus]

[Verse Three]
See at this time, you might think I'm strange
Cause I wore a four-finger ring, and big gold chains
Like I was Mr. T from the A-Team
It was just a sign of me makin cream
But the cars and jeeps was incred-a
Like the Audi, 280 Z's, 98's and Jettas
Cherokees, Wranglers, Suzuki Sidekicks
L.A. and West coast cars was doin tricks
Now the dances was crazy to match
Like the Pee Wee, The Wop and the Cabbage Patch
The Prep, The Snake, and "The Biz Mark, Biz Mark"
The way the Gucci Girls gave shows a spark
Now listen, to what I got to say-ah
Reagan was Pres', and Koch was the Mayor
You can't beat that with a baseball bat
And you'd never see me without my Biz Mark hat

[Chorus] - 4X w/ ad libs

[Verse 1: Biz Markie]
This is a story about without a doubt
When I'm done, you will all scream and shout
They always say time is on our side
If it is, why is it a rough ride?
If I could save time or return to the past
I would bring back the good times, hate to last
Like when I was the size of Jay-Z
Back when Ra was still with Eric B
Remember when friends was friends, and LL had a Benz?
And cell phones and beepers was the new trends?
When Koch was the mayor and Reagan was the Pres?
We listened to what other enemies said

[Chorus: Lil' Kal]
I wish there was somethin' made, or somethin' designed
Where I could turn back the hands of time
I wish there was somethin' made, or somethin' designed
Where I could turn back the hands of time

[Verse 2: Biz Markie]
I know y'all remember goin' to Great Adventure
On Labor Day on the Beach in Virginia
The beginnin' of the summer, at Jones Beach
When t-shirts, were ten dollars each
Didn't matter if you had a Lex, Beamer or a Benz
As long, as you had room for, all of the friends
Mr. Softee came through, or the Good Humor truck
When ice cream, was less than a buck
If it was up to me and I could turn back the clock
I'd bring Masterdon, Buffy, and Scott LaRock
So - please listen to my song and rhyme
If I can turn back the hands of time

[Chorus: Lil' Kal]
I wish there was somethin' made, or somethin' designed
Where I could turn back the hands of time
I wish there was somethin' made, or somethin' designed
Where I could turn back the hands of time

[Verse 3: Biz Markie]
If I could turn time back in a rhyme
I'd bring back Bird, Magic, Jordan in their prime
Remember the days, oh, remember the days
When they had the high-top, fade craze
Want back Big Daddy Kane, Fresh Prince and Kid & Play
"Oh, what a beautiful day!"
When parties was parties, and clubs was clubs
You could tell the real MC's from all the scrubs
When havin' your own style and originality
And your character and real personality
But I have to go, and off I sign
If I can turn back the hands of time

[Chorus: Lil' Kal]
I wish there was somethin' made, or somethin' designed
Where I could turn back the hands of time
I wish there was somethin' made, or somethin' designed
Where I could turn back the hands of time
I wish there was somethin' made, or somethin' designed
Where I could turn back the hands of time
I wish there was somethin' made, or somethin' designed
Where I could turn back the hands of time

[Outro: Biz Markie]
I wish there was somethin' made to bring back Aaliyah (Jam Master Jay)
I wish there was somethin' made to bring back Biggie and 2Pac
I wish there was somethin' made to bring back Scott La Rock
I wish somethin' bad, I wish there was somethin' made to bring back, Left Eye (Barry White)
I wish there was somethin' to bring back my man Dahsil Masterdon {?}
I wish there was somethin' made to bring back my man Keef Cowboy {?}
My man B.O., my man Step from Baltimore
I wish there was somethin' to bring back
All the strange people that I knew that, was a part of my life
(For all of our loved ones that have passed away)

When I DJ, I turn the bass up the tick-o
The girls with the big big booties
I'm straight chillin', coolin' out with cuties (hey!)
21 and over, ain't messin' wit juvies
Girls always talkin' 'bout "I ain't no groupie!"
I ain't stupie, I know what the truth be
You was up chillin' with Yeezy last week
You nasty; admit it, you nasty
Tryin' to act classy, askin' for a glass... please
Grab a glass and get wet
Asked for some bubble so I gave her Moet
I said I don't want trouble, but she said won't get
Busy 'cause she dizzy, so I said let's jet

[Hook 2: will.i.am & Fergie]
We did it and we did it and we did it like this
Did it and we did it and we did it like this
Did it and we did it and we did it like this
Did it and we did it and we did it like...

I said I betcha can't, betcha can't rock it like that
Betcha can't, betcha can't rock it like that
Betcha can't, betcha can't rock it like that
Betcha can't, betcha can't...

[Verse 3: will.i.am]
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do
Do it like me, so fresh so clean

This shit's nice, this shit's so mean
Mean, mean, y'knahmean?
This beat's cracked, that means y'all fiends
This shit's hot nigga, lettin' off steam
This is like a movie action scene
Ring, ring, ring like a machine
This shit's money, nigga this shit's green
This shit is terrifyin' - Halloween
This shit is gimme your Qu-qu-qu-qu-queen
And that means I'm the what, what? King!

[Hook 4: will.i.am + Fergie]

Mega nigga, this nigga bigger
Why hold the gun if you kyan't pull the trigger?
Why you say you do it when you know you can't deliver?
Why you drink vodka if you got a weak liver?

PART 2 :

[Intro: will.i.am]
Can't rock it like this

[Verse 1: apl.de.ap]
I'm the new enig-matic, black acrobatic
Alien about to invade, galactic
Ladies climaxin', off of my axin'
Filipino comin' to the US, mashin'
Laser, flashin', big ghetto blastin'
Vodka, water, down for some action
Check it out now, the funk soul brother
And right about now, you know I'm on that other
Shit, but you can't rock it like me though
Niggas say I'm dope, white girls say I'm neat-o
I rock wave forms, ain't fuckin' with no needle
Music revolution like underground Beatles
Yeah... you can't rock it like us
Bitch, you need to shut the fuck up!

[Verse 2: apl.de.ap]
I'm on a mission, I'm on a mission
Start the ignition
Let's blow it up like nitroglycerine
It's the new definition, of club demolition
Check the new composition
Let's shoot 'em down with the killer ammunition
I got a proposition
Stop, listen
'Cause this beat bangs
A banger, knock 'em out to submission
I got an intuition
Tonight's gonna be a good good exhibition
Hope you don't have no heart condition
Think you can rock it like this, you're wishing

[Outro: apl.de.ap]
You can't rock it like this
You can't rock it like this
You can't rock it like this
You can't rock it like this
You can't rock it like this
You can't rock it like this
You can't rock it like this
You can't rock it like this
You can't rock it like this

[Intro: will.i.am]
Right now...

[Verse 1: will.i.am]
Right now is the right time
For the good things in life
Let's celebrate, let's bring upon the better times
And let the sadder time disappear
Ohhh, I feel like a champion, in the stadium
There's love and pandemonium
I'ma put this in my memory
As the best time ever

[Chorus: Fergie]
This is the best one yet... and I'm so happy
How could we ever forget?
This is the best one, this is the best one
This is the best one yet... and I'm so happy

This is the best one, this is the best one
This is the best one yet

[Post-Chorus: will.i.am]
Let's celebrate...

Let's do it right now and not hesitate
We gonna rock it to the top like elevate
Bottoms up, here we go, let's intoxicate
I was feeling good but now I'm feelin gr-gr-gr-great
Best ever, and no I don't exaggerate
This moment is a moment I'll appreciate
Today is the day I, will remember

[Chorus: Fergie]
This is the best one yet... and I'm so happy
How could we ever forget?
This is the best one, this is the best one
This is the best one yet... and I'm so happy

This is the best one yet

[Post-Chorus: will.i.am]
Let's celebrate...

[Verse 3: apl.de.ap, will.i.am, Taboo & Both]
This is your moment, this is your moment
This is the time, this is the time
To get it right tonight, to get it right
You don't want to let the moment pass you by
So c'mon and take this one in a photograph
Everything that made us cry, and made us laugh
The night's young and we raise our glass
We'll make it count like the best one we ever had

[Bridge: The Black Eyed Peas]
The best one yet, the best one yet
The best one yet, the best one yet
The best one yet, the best one yet
(This is) The best one yet, the best one yet
The best one yet, the best one yet
The best one yet, the best one yet
The best one yet, (this is) the best one yet

[Chorus: Fergie]
This is the best one yet... and I'm so happy

Damn, baby, I'm feenin'

Let me love you down this evenin'
Lovie lovie, yeah, you know you are my demon

My mind's dirty and it don't need cleanin'
I love you long time, so you know the meanin'

[Pre-Chorus: will.i.am]
Oh, baby, I can't come down, so please come help me out
You got me feeling high, and I can't step off the cloud

[Chorus: Fergie]
Boy, I think about it every night and day

[Post-Chorus: will.i.am]
I just can't get enough, I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough, I just can't get enough

[Verse 2: Taboo]
Honey got me runnin' like I'm Flo Jo
Signs her name on my heart with an "XO"
Love so sweet, got me vexed though
I wanna wish it right back like Presto, yes
Meantime, I wait for the next time
She come around for a toast to the best time
We LOL back and forth on the text line
She got me fishin' for her love, I confess I'm
Something 'bout her smile and the convo
Got me high and I ain't comin' down, yo
My heart's pumpin' out louder than electro
She got me feelin' like Mr. Roboto​

[Pre-Chorus: will.i.am]
Oh, baby, I can't come down, so please come help me out
You got me feeling high, and I can't step off the cloud
And I just can't get enough

[Chorus: Fergie]
Boy, I think about it every night and day
I'm addicted, wanna jam inside your love
I wouldn't wanna have it any other way
I'm addicted, and I just can't get enough

[Breakdown: will.i.am]
This is mega switch-up
Switch-up, switch-up
I just can't switch-up

[Verse 3: apl.de.ap & will.i.am]
Locked, sunk in your bedrock
Heart, pumpin' your love-shot
Knocked out by your cold-shot
I'm, stuck in your headlock (Switch up)
Can't stop, won't quit
Makin' me fiend, give it to me
I want it all, you know what I mean
Your love is a dose of ecstasy (Switch up)
Addicted, I can't get away from you
Afflicted, I need it, I miss it (Switch up)
I want your lovin' right next to me
And I can't erase you out of my memory

[Outro: will.i.am]
I just can't switch-up

[Intro: will.i.am]

[Verse 1: will.i.am]
This is that original, this has no identical
You can't hack my digital, future aboriginal
Get up off my genitals, I stay on that pinnacle
Kill you with my lyricals, call me verbal criminal
Send you to that clinical, subscribe you some chemicals
Audio and visual, can't see me; invisible
I'm old school like biblical, futuristic next le-vel
Never on that typical
Will I stop? Oh never, no

[Pre-chorus: will.i.am & Fergie]
I ain't gonna stop until I'm done (don't stop it)

[Verse 2: apl.de.ap]
You could call me crazy man, everyday I'm partyin'
You could find me at the club, poppin' bottles minglin'
Ladies dancin' to the jam, actin' naughty, man oh man
Got me in the mood again, afterparty partyin'
Yeah, I keep it happenin', takin' shots whatever, man
Party like a veteran, music is my medicine
You won't find me settlin', can't be stopped; I'm steppin' in
Keep it goin' 'til the end, yeah, that's right, here we go again

[Verse 3: Taboo]
I'm that one that lights it up, we red hot like firetrucks
Burn that book cause that's whassup, tell that DJ turn it up
We droppin, that music, for people all around
Keep rockin, head knockin, cause they can't shut us down

[Bridge : will.i.am]
And ain't no stoppin, we gon' keep on rockin
Baby ain't no stoppin, you can not stop us now

And I never felt this way before
And I swear, this is true
And I owe it all to you-you

[Chorus: will.i.am]
Dirty bit

[Outro: will.i.am]
Welcome
This is the beginning
For every ending, is mega starter
When they bring the dark
We bring the light, let's go

[Intro: will.i.am]
I pledge, my allegiance
To rhythm, and sound
Music is my medicine
Let the rhythm pound

[Chorus: will.i.am]
And play it loud, baby play it loud
Play it loud, baby play it loud
Rock the crowd, baby rock the crowd
And play it loud, baby play it loud

[Verse 1: will.i.am]
I found a love, it's in the music
Drop all your guns, drop all that bullshit
We found the love, inside the instruments
John Lennon, Bob Marley are my presidents
The sound of trumpets wake up people sleepin now
The drummer boy is drumming beats to shake the ground
The violins will pick you up when you are down
The melody will spin around and round and round

[Pre-Chorus: will.i.am]
And who's gonna stop us?
Who's gonna stop us from rockin with this sound?
Oh who's gonna stop us?
Who's gonna stop us from break-b-b-breakin it down?

[Chorus: will.i.am]
Gonna play it loud, gonna play it loud
Play it loud, baby play it loud
And rock the crowd, baby rock the crowd
And rock the crowd, baby play it loud

[Verse 2: will.i.am]
Hot beats coming from the city streets
MP3's via internet from overseas
DJ's play 'em, you, dance to 'em, swayin stayin up
All night, zombie life, audio delight, ohh
The sound of trumpets wake up people laying down, oh
The drum and volume playing gonna shake the ground, oh
The violins will pick you up when you are down, oh
The melody will spin around and round and round

[Pre-Chorus: will.i.am]
And who's gonna stop us?
Who's gonna stop us from rockin with this sound?
Oh who's gonna stop us?
Who's gonna stop us from break-b-b-breakin it down?

[Chorus: will.i.am]
Gonna play it loud, gonna play it loud
Play it loud, baby play it loud
And rock the crowd, baby rock the crowd
Play it loud, baby play it loud

[Outro: will.i.am]
I pledge, my allegiance
To rhythm, and sound

[Album Outro]

A wise man once said
Tomorrow does not equal yesterday

[Verse 1: Fergie]
Love, through the trees, past the sky

Whenever you call me, I'm there when you call
Whenever you're fallin, I'm there when you fall
Wherever you going, I'll be right there showing
Our love's always growing and growin and growing

Don't wanna miss the magic that is you and me

An introduction to a rapid ray
Will explode like grenade

Any MC that claims that they can be
Tend the mic when we strike precisely
We freak the level with the funk from the inner
Heaven, give me inner, black as I present a
Flock a rhyme that rock you off an ass
Powerful, power flows that'll leave your soul paralyzed

[Pre-Chorus: will.i.am]
Yo, I respect that you be G-in (...in)

Interluding with the powerful matter scatter your frame
You fallin' (Yo) check out what we do
We be all in on the microphone never stallin'
Rhythm is my ride for the voyage of the mind
Exclusive rhyme patting us for what we design
I am my own Picasso when I roll
Rhyming is my art for my heart and soul

We goin' worldwide, across the nation
Now that we've activated our communication
Wantin demonstration, ask the activator
Before one more walk-a-meter, funky motivator
And I be the Will, APL from the Phil
We contain the hypnotical skill that'll kill
You dealin' with the G-R-E-A-T
Black Eyed Peas guy, hella in a G
'Cause we holler in an energetic motion with the potion I supply
Applyin' to the beat that Alligator you combine
With me and my crew incredibly and super spectacular

BEP's production always complete
With this sounds activate online
And I'm on time to motivate your mind

Wonder if it's, where does it last, say "Here it is"
Should be all up in your ear, with a test and a quiz
See ya dance, say "Damn, now what it is?"
Want to in sync with all the Pea body kids
You be nodding your head back and forth like this
If you're feelin' my move, then your mind is in bliss

[Verse 4: apl.de.ap]
So put your hands together now we ready to bounce
Got the whole world waiting for this, to be announced
No indication just satisfaction by the ounce

[Verse 5: apl.de.ap]
Recite more poetic, a tactic from the attic
Apl.de.ap, gets critical and droppin' shit
Like a dimensional picture
You architect, so I free you to get the scripture
But when it hit ya, I got you turning like elixir
Back a glass of cog-n-ac, we divide the mixture
I'm about to fix you up, with a new texture
More information better down like a lecture
And in the sector

[Chorus]

Clap your hands now, people clap your hands

When you doin', what you doin'
I like the way you do it when you do it
When you doin', what you doin'
I like the way you do it when you do it
When you doin', what you doin'

[Verse 1: will.i.am]
Check this out right here, son
We about to move to make you feel some
A lot of positive vibrations to build from
'Cause all I wanna do is move some and win some
Have a little of prosperity and then some
Livin' my life handsome, has always been a dream but
Now it's time to really achieve by all means (Bust it)
I keep my shit, plus thirty in between
When an arm reach out to grab the supreme
'Cause I won't stop, and ap' won't stop
And Tab won't stop until we reach the top
That means we won't quit
So we stay thick so you can enjoy it
I know you like the way it's goin' down, honey, honey
I know you like the milky-mellow sound, honey, honey
Doin' this ain't all about money, money
I know you like the way I sound, right, right

[Chorus: will.i.am]
I like the way you do it when you do it
When you doin', what you doin'
I like the way you do it when you do it
When you doin', what you doin'
I like the way you do it when you do it
When you doin', what you doin'
I like the way you do it when you do it
When you doin', what you doin'

[Verse 2: Redfoo]
As I enter the room I absorb the mood
Positive vibe supplied by a positive crew
And negativity exist and you must acknowledge
You can be intelligent and never go to college
'Cause the way we live in society
It ain't really the way that it's supposed to be
And don't get close to me if you're contaminated
Take a picture of your soul and get it laminated
Put it in your wallet next to your money
Money represents your whole and soul represents your honey
Ain't got honey then you ain't got bees
And if you ain't got no money I'ma still MC
Then empty L-O-V-E all over the track
Once you go R-E-D then you never go back
'Til the end of studio with the Peas as Black
With Adam, Taboo, and alligator apl.de.ap

[Chorus: will.i.am]
I like the way you do it when you do it
When you doin', what you doin'
I like the way you do it when you do it
When you doin', what you doin'
I like the way you do it when you do it
When you doin', what you doin'
I like the way you do it when you do it
When you doin', what you doin'

[Verse 3: apl.de.ap]
I wanna travel the world and stop on every city
Rejuvenate your burnt out seed, put down your Philly for a sec
Close your eyes and don't fret
Listen to the audible sounds and just let
Your soul feel the free feelin'
Reprovide you with the ride, free fallin'
To make your heart beat, skip, hypnotize you and
APL take you on a trip where your mind's at ease
Forget ballin' 'cause I won't quit, and Will won't quit
And Tab won't quit so you can enjoy it
That means we won't stop
And I won't stop until we reach the top
I'd rather be ready for the future
Do it for yourself 'cause no one else will suit ya
I juxtapose for mine to maintain
And segregate myself from evil and pain

[Chorus: will.i.am]
I like the way you do it when you do it
When you doin', what you doin'
I like the way you do it when you do it
When you doin', what you doin'
I like the way you do it when you do it
When you doin', what you doin'
I like the way you do it when you do it
When you doin', what you doin'
I like the way you do it when you do it
When you doin', what you doin'
I like the way you do it when you do it
When you doin', what you doin'
I like the way you do it when you do it
When you doin', what you doin'
I like the way you do it when you do it
When you doin', what you doin'

[Intro: will.i.am]
BEP, I know you feel it, huh
I know you feel it, huh
I know you feel it, huh
I know you feel it, huh

[Verse 1: will.i.am]
Oh my goodness, I know you feel the vibration
Across the globe no matter your location
Ain't no difficulty or complication
Just as long my niggas in the celebration
Celebrated the musical liberation
The Peas then demonstrated the demonstration
And you will feel the flush of relaxation
I'mma wax these and then get heavy rotation
I got you in bliss and ain't no aggrevation
When you bump us, we bring the stimulation
So hurry up and get your daily fixation
But make sure that it's handled, it's a moderation
One dose should bring you to a limitation
So put your back into it, baby, that's right, huh
I'm about to plug in some dedication
This goes out to my brothers and my coalition

[Chorus: Kim Hill]
All I want is to be free
You keep pushin' up on me
All I want is to be free
You be you let I'll be me
Let me do what I feel inside
Won't get taken for a ride
Do just what I feel inside
Everything will be alright

[Post-Chorus: Kim Hill]
Everything will be alright
Everything will be alright
Everything will be alright
Everything will be alright

[Verse 2: will.i.am]
Oh my goodness, it's obvious now you feelin' me
Envious niggas plan on killing me
Frontin on my niggas and also my family
Fienin for my capability, it's tragedy
My technicalities die hard like battery
Try to cross us, I blast 'cause you flattin' me
You oughta be on something like PCP
To come against a crew like BEP
Oh my goodness, oh no you didn't try to contest me
Come out delivery, won't control your body
I'm breakin' down y'all mathematically
Yes mentally, physically and spiritually
Actually, I'm rippin' your anatomy
'Cause literally you be in the cemetery
I'm about to throw a shout-out to my peeps
Dedicated to the DJ's that pump it in their streets

[Chorus: Kim Hill]
All I want is to be free
You keep pushin' up on me
All I want is to be free
You be you let I'll be me
Let me do what I feel inside
Won't get taken for a ride
Do just what I feel inside
Everything will be alright

[Post-Chorus: Kim Hill]
Everything will be alright
Everything will be alright
Everything will be alright
Everything will be alright

[Verse 3: will.i.am]
Whip it good like DeVoe we whip it good
You understand (Yo man, it's understood)
We be winnin' tournaments like Tiger Woods
Openin' your suburbs and bump it in your hood
Rock it in your box or your hooptie-hoop
Bump it in your hot beamer 850 coupe
'Cause I'ma inform y'all on what to do
Hop in your ride and drive down in your avenue
It's bumpin' in your barbeque and your venue
At a journey, feelin' that ease, is why I sent you
'Cause ain't no stoppin' this, stoppin' it
'Cause we be rockin' it (Rock, rock, rock)

[Bridge: will.i.am]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

All I want is to be free
You be you let I'll be me
Let me do what I feel inside
Won't get taken for a ride
Do just what I feel inside
Everything will be alright

[Post-Chorus: Kim Hill]
Everything will be alright
Everything will be alright
Everything will be alright
Everything will be alright

[Verse 3: apl.de.ap]
Gather up the team, now we ready to go
Any minute we'll be all over your box and video
Niggas wanna stop me and my amigos
But we still roll all over your acapella goes
Leave it or this one here like meteor
Your mediocre scene, you feel the roar
Vibration that's headed for your store
For a change, not bragging about close to more
Instead brain fusion, I lace you up confusion
Relax and feel the groove it's the solution
We straight cruisin' while the beat is still cruisin'
You're here so clap your hand to what we're doin'

[Chorus: Kim Hill]
All I want is to be free
You keep pushin' up on me
All I want is to be free

Won't get taken for a ride

[Post-Chorus: Kim Hill]
Everything will be alright
Everything will be alright
Everything will be alright
Everything will be alright

[Outro: will.i.am]
Whip it good

[Intro]
Just watch me (fallin up)
Just watch me (fallin up)
Just watch me (fallin up)
Just watch me..

[Verse 1: apl.de.ap]
Focus on this, the ear seductionists
More than lyricists in this rap metropolis
More like an activist, we give it to you all
Presentation will make you have a ball
Sounds start conceiving causing you to meditate
Manipulate the line with hypnotical legislate
We far from the fakes, we never fake moves
But jealous motherfuckas seems to just disapprove (and talk shit)
And who the hell he be havin' a fit
Yo, he ain't got shit, that's why he set trips
I identified what he rips
Which consists of nonsense nothing less than bullshit
(Westside!) The fool can't hang
With the all around remainders, a real entertainer
Reviver of the true art form of, hip-hop
Explore non-stop, entertain ya till you drop

[Chorus: apl.de.ap]
We be fallin' up (up) never fallin' down (down)
We keep it at a higher level elevated ground
(Whether in your) area, (city or your) town

We be fallin' up (up) never fallin' down (down)
We keep it at a higher level elevated ground

[Verse 2: Taboo]
Pick the course that ya take, is it fake
There's no remorse for a fake we must break
Time of rap sold some dough what we make (ah)
Yo, collapse, feel the force, full intake
Witness the Peas, as we innovate
Will's extraordinar, expose, instillate
Patternin' pioneers, premier by cross the lake
Apl in fact if it's not my mistake
Taboo's unexplained means there's no escape
From it, hate it, love it, rate it as great
God gifted talent showin', that we create
Enough of bein' deep, it's time to motivate

[Chorus: apl.de.ap]
We be fallin' up (up) never fallin' down (down)
We keep it at a higher level elevated ground
(Whether in your) area, (city or your) town

[Bridge]
(Just watch me..)
(Just watch me..)

[Verse 3: will.i.am]
I see you try to diss our function by stating that we can't rap
Is it cause we don't wear Tommy Hilfiger or baseball caps
We don't use dollars to represent
We just use our inner sense and talent
If you try to diss the Peas you'll get handled by Apl De the
Alligator, numero uno creator
Black Eyed Peas be more than a player
Don't got ta represent no set
Just so I could get some respect
Ga Ga Ga Ga Ga Ga got, cooooool
A lot of talent so I can get through
We're doin cause the way that you did it I think that you done corrupt
The whole hip-hop sound so now we gotta follow up

[Chorus: apl.de.ap]
We be fallin' up (up) never fallin' down (down)
We keep it at a higher level elevated ground

We keep it at a higher level elevated ground

Children growin', women producin'
Men go work, and some gon' steal
Everyone's got to make a livin'
Children growin', women producin'
Men go work, and some gon' steal
Everyone's got to make a livin'

[Verse 1: will.i.am, apl.de.ap & Taboo]
Nineteen-ninety-two and, you and I were fightin'
LAPD beatings got the whole world frontin
My man Rodney King and the Reginald Deeney
You could look for justice but I bet you won't find any
Because people getting beatin', news keep repeatin'
Chaos and anger, just surely peakin'
Yo everybody's runnin', some of them are gunnin'
Avalanche the block, feel the anger, wantin' something
'Cause some of them are frontin', they didn't know the reason
Emotion in the end made it feel like revolution
And yeah, yeah, you can yell out your brains
I tell you right now, we got eight years of chains

[Pre-Chorus: will.i.am]
So hurry up because I'm runnin' out of clip, runnin' out of time
Runnin' out of clip, runnin' out of time
Runnin' out of clip, runnin' out of time
Runnin' out of clip (what), runnin' out of time

[Verse 2: will.i.am, apl.de.ap & Taboo]
Nineteen-ninety-seven, reduction of a nation
The government is slayin', new laws is what you're facin'
Next comes the clonin', they're makin' new creation
Secretly forming soldiers of you and they station
No more free education on former segregation
Politics's about affirmative activation
So make a run for the border, caught by the deporter
The immigration caught you but you got to leave your daughter
We are slowly being slaughtered
So be prepared for the new world order
Yeah, yeah, you can yell out your brains
I tell you right now, you got three years to change

[Pre-Chorus: will.i.am]
So hurry up because I'm runnin' out of clip, runnin' out of time
Runnin' out of clip, runnin' out of time

[Verse 3: will.i.am, apl.de.ap & Taboo]
Year two-thousand, what's it really holdin'
Or is it really right, live beyond on what you're knowing
Or is it that technology is what keeps on going
Could it be that the end of time is what I'm showing
I don't see any grass growin'
Everything's conquered, we're running out of land
And goddamn yo, I'm runnin' out of clip
I'm almost out of time
Runnin' out of
Damn, I'm almost out of time
We could all try now but just look up in the sky
We ain't got no ozone left, we are gonna die
Crime and corruption, is the only season
Is it cause the reason is that we out of time

[Chorus]
Children growin', women producin'
Men go work, and some gon' steal

Men go work, and some gon' steal
Everyone's got to make a livin'

[Verse 1: will.i.am]
I'm hard to handle like bikes with no bars
We excite stores that got dykes leaving doors
Unlock the heated 'cause they know when I sex well
Left them breathless now they're waiting to exhale
Waiting to exhale with some competition
So come in and test well
The next one gets hung and chip of a chisel
I'm making chicks' nipples sizzle
There's no question to the way I rip the riddle
I'm awesome, I bring on monsoon when I bloom and blossom
And run over niggas like opossums
Froze on the road with my bike on they cornea
Man I'm warning ya, look, the Black Eyed Peas is formin up
Ring around your throat that's made up of razor blades
Put the slice and let nice and easy humble days
On out, over, well known Casanova
Can I put on an army, quick to take it over
Nine on my niggas, count all my figures
Money on the street went entertainment
Nowadays brothers are getting paid doing nothing
Reciting the same line with the lame rhymes
Frontin rappers actin like their pops' was Orville Redenbacher
They quick to go pop
But when it's time to fiend for the green they flop
We do it from the heart like blood
Create rhymes that flood, and blow up like the Scud, Miss-ILE! (Ha!)

[Chorus: will.i.am]
You can bop your head like this (Ha!)
When we're dropping bombs like this (Ha!)
You can bop your head to this (Ha!)

My flotation over tracks smacks like no other disciples
Riddle the action of satisfaction brought to you by APL
Alligator now, 'bout to take you on a lyrical voyage
And bend your sure form I would saturated fat
The Alligat is on the move
I rhyme to be exact, not exactly on the groove
Savoire plus kinetic
My beat's energetic when reseted
You wonder why, we put our friend through calisthenics
So check out the fiery, I'm livin' not misery
Supply you with remedies for all these sick whack MC's
That this is song lurks now, time to go to work
To senegrate the ignorant, or shall I say the jerk
Time to contradict now, dig deep to the core
All I sick can be, but I still rip it raw
With the composition, with the position on steady
I'm ready for the mission of freestylin acting shitty
Converse you with the energy enemy I focus on ya
Every styles you make I will take and break in front of ya
Irratic gets your presence you've been replaced by my essence
The sunshine survive, 'cause that's what we produce
Refuse negativity ability I use
To bruise up your brain with lyrics
Ungh, ungh, ahh, uh, aarggh, ah, ahh, uhh (Like this!) (Ha!)

Lovely entertainment's what we enter
Feel the force, where we enter like Splinter
Black Eyed Peas be the fools that'll injure
Whole career and your body will be injured
Get dealt quick, and I got one for, uh
How you like me now
W-I double L rippin' up a style
That's cool and calm, we droppin' a bomb
And you can nod your head to the rhythm where we are
Some whole new (uh) that's well improved
When I'm over 'cause you know I'ma relax in a rule
That soothes your body, really really hardcore
Double-double Ta-ta for a while or for raw
Tap-a-tap a skill, it's the whip appeal then
APL-APL coming-coming in with the gill
Let's rock this set exceed to terminate
Time to eliminate the whack that you create
Arm atticulate, when I circulate over tracks
Let me get down and just relax

And when you hear a cut baby doll I know you

Get down and dirty 'cause that's my joint
Ha! We preferably make all points
Through a nation we build off the musical field
Or a visual thrill, we do what we feel
Any time or place, on stage in ya face
Over tea in Earth and outer space

[Verse 4: will.i.am]
Because we rock that *shit*, we flip that *shit*

There's electricity in here
With enough watts to shock the southern hemisphere
I put a surge in your city with my lyrics in the air
Shock hazardous, take caution and beware
Of high bolts and killer hertz, lyrics will kill, they hurt
Blast those, my energy's converted to a rhyme
I maximize in no time
Electrify the sky and go way be over now, uh
Just an MC, I'm not your average MC
I do more than MC, that's what suckers envy, and E
And every movement contains concepts that ain't nobody doin'
Come over these dramas or whack, and dirty
They tryin' to call me, perform track quality
Give me some punts, 'cause you really muddy
You move slowly 'cause of no electricity
I got my shit on overflow
When I ever find you, my overload
Oh, overflow
I got my shit on overflow (Overflow)

[Chorus: will.i.am & apl.de.ap]
The whole globe's gonna feel the effect of the

We gonna keep your party jumpin' while your heart is steady thumpin' to the
Movement (Movement) Movement

[Verse 2: apl.de.ap]
We grip the pleasure from small things
Not from a Lex nor diamond rings
I just wanna crib in they studios set
Build my enterprise connection projects
Cover all angles and higher aspects
Break more barriers than new concepts
'Cause what they can't stop me, no way
The time is now, we ain't got time to play
Hey, you, listen to what I got to say
Let's get together and form a parade
Just delete what you create over plates
Make sure it's measured the right way
With the right ingredients, construct more deviant
Things to prosper for your brain to capture
Now what I'm after is to learn from all things
Building full swing, no strings
You got me thinking about things that I don't need to think about
You wanna change my appearance for the masters, scope me out
Undress me, then rearrange me
Yo I can't go for that (No...)

[Chorus: will.i.am & apl.de.ap]
The whole globe's gonna feel the effect of the
Movement (Movement) Movement
Yo DC, London, Tokyo, feel the wrath of the

[Verse 3: Taboo]
You gotta jump back, jump inside BEP music
Shake what your mama gave you, don't abuse it
If you abuse it, come change the music
If it's the bomb, no need to defuse it
Let us demonstrate the real coordination
While we improvise, giving you time and sensation
Mastering the art form of motivation
Musically we're in touch with our creation
Takin' over land, and we takin' over nation
Family reunite, cause for celebration
Gotta find us on your channel, find us on your station
We bring the movement of Black Eyed Peas-ilation

Part 1:

[Intro: will.i.am]
You gotta keep it on the positive
Na, na, na...

[Verse 1: will.i.am]
Nowadays it's hard to make a livin' but easy to make a killin' 'cause
People walk around with just one itchy feelin'
I feel nauseated from your evil drug dealin', bless feelin'
The definition of top billin'
It's illin' my vocabulary, diggin' your lifestyle scary
No wonder why you carry a two, to retaliate
Tryin' to annihilate, the one a two annihilate you
They got some dude just to get you bugged
Really y'all, this shit is all out of whack
You can't go out at night yet and you won't come back
And this verse that I'm kickin' someone might take it personal
And come out and get me, but worst of all
These rap fans are taking this shit serious
It ain't New York versus L.A
'Cause really it's hip-hop, with a big ole' problem
Now let's see what we could do to solve them (Solve them...)

[Chorus: will.i.am]
Na, na, na...
We gotta keep it on the positive (Positive...)
Na, na, na...
We must keep it on the positive (Positive...)

[Verse 2: will.i.am]
Lucifer's got your little mind twisted
'Cause God once gave you the meaning of life and you missed it
You've been listed in the devil's books
Livin' the life of crooks and hoes and in such and such
All that shit, that don't mean much
You got one hand on your gat while your genitals are being touched
Livin' the life that's plushed and glamorous
Drunk and high with your little soul's crushed
Don't you know that life is a mirage
I keep myself sober so my soul is camouflaged
If the devil cannot see me tell me how can he attack me
If he can't grasp a hold tell me how can he try to snatch me
I ain't talking about the white man, the black man or a Jew man
'Cause the devil can exist in every human
Look how Biggie went out, and 2Pac went out
And Martin, and Malcolm, and Kennedy, and Squeek
And Adam, and Rene, and so on, and so on...

[Chorus: will.i.am]
Na, na, na...
We gotta keep it on the positive (Positive...)
Na, na, na...
We gotta keep it on the positive (Positive...)

[Bridge: will.i.am]
Even though we got problems
We gotta find some way to solve 'em
I hope you come and follow me now
(Keep it on the positive)
Even though we got problems
I hope you find some way to solve 'em (Solve 'em...)
(We gotta keep it on the positive)

Part 2:

[Verse: apl.de.ap & Taboo]
We're currently located over Los Angeles scene
While you see a lot of niggas perpetrating like they're kings
With this so-called God complex
But when I see they mind they only see checks
So let's get our heads together
Let's form a foul weather
Proclaim against perpetrators
Well said, Alligator
Our realm, no perpetrator
A society choose the elevator
Of success by identity cross-fader
Complex thinking they're really much greater
Plain raw, harness all, maybe rough radar
Tough enough to perpetrate, I talk to you later
But wait, what about that midget brains?
Unable to see reality too unreal
I'm sealed with mind, body and soul
Connected together, we tougher than leather

[Chorus: apl.de.ap, Taboo & Both]
We much more than you think we are
We are the product of our own environment repent
With equality, plus duality
And taken all kind of possibilities ('bilities)
I sing the song from the soul, let it rise from the tone
Let it rhythmically grow, into it's own life
Let it become you, then you become it
Once you become it everything will be infinite
Will be infinite, will be infinite, will be infinite...

[Chorus: apl.de.ap, Taboo & Both]
We much more than you think we are
We are the product of our own environment repent
With equality, plus duality
Mainly we represent positivity
I sing the song from the soul, let it rise from the tone
Let it rhythmically grow, into it's own life
Let it become you, then you become it
Once you become it everything will be infinite
Will be infinite, will be infinite, will be infinite...

[Verse 1: apl.de.ap]
We be fallin' up like growin'
Niggas don't be knowin' our styles we be showin'
Extraterrestrial complete show 'em
Sure, shoney men bring on the spear flow 'em
Up in the air, into their athmosphere
Let 'em know we tooken some shit right here
There's no way of knowing where we going from here
But we're prepared to enter war they declare
Motion to motion, we be like ghostin'
Black Eyed Peas contain the rhyme with the potion
Got your emotion mingling with us
Any animosity now it's time to hush
Feel the fuckin' rush

[Interlude]
¿Qué?, ¿qué?
¿Qué dices?

[Chorus: will.i.am]
Say "what" if you feelin' it (Say what, say what, say what)

[Verse 2: will.i.am]
Really y'all, here's how to be free
Just open your mind and relax with the Peas
Let us call our mellow crew, help you out to peep the ease
Like a thirty-five mile cruise, steady summer breeze
Run into your town, run into her town
Feelin my sound spreadin' around
We spreadin' around like the plague
I got you movin' hips, necks and legs
I'm closed to the end
So push me, we magic like hocus
We be fallin' up like oh shit
Some shit that you won't see
Some shit that you can't lose
Some shit that can only be down by you know who
Whatever double the W-I to the L-L
For owning the extraterre-es-tre-el-el
Rockin you the cool-ass rhymes
The cool-ass rhymes, some cool-ass rhymes
Some cool-ass rhymes

[Verse 3: Taboo]
My job is to mainly hypnotize
I'ma take over the charts and maneuver through the eyes
Visually on stage, the Peas, we multiply
While equalling the sums of only one try
First is my scarf that presented of the pile
Second adjust my bust that really sound fly
Third gain the zone, the Washa has arrived
Fourth keep my mind and my song online
We purchasin' dues that remain state of mind
Equipped with all cultures, a piece of color blind
We keep it on the positive 'cause it is hard to find
Keep it on the positive 'cause it is hard to find

[Interlude: will.i.am]
¿Qué dices?
Say what?

[Chorus: will.i.am]

[Intro: will.i.am]
Yeah, yeah
Watch out

[Chorus]
Ain't no running from
Karma, and no running
Ain't no running from
Karma, and no running
Ain't no running from
Karma, and no running
Ain't no running from
Karma, and no running

[Verse 1: will.i.am]
I'm the caboose of the wrong doings you produce
The wild tail of the tornado running loose
You tie the noose, I kick the chair
I'm the cyanide that snatch your life while you gasp for air
The echo of the "Fuck you" that boomerangs to hurt your loved ones
The thief that took your son, held by ransom (Gimme back my son!)
The pervert that raped your wife
The hand that held the knife that took your life
You shot 2Pac and Biggie
Now I'm coming after you like V-W-X-Y-Z
This is cause and effect, the domino effect
The "What goes up, must come down" effect
You hopin', though, that you had a hand in doin' the doin'
The conclusion of the evil that you ended and started pursuing

[Chorus]
Ain't no running from
Karma, and no running
Ain't no running from
Karma, and no running
Ain't no running from
Karma, and no running
Ain't no running from
Karma, and no running

[Verse 2: apl.de.ap]
This is the payback from the past
You threw me down like I was just a piece of trash
You gave me cash every week just enough to live
But didn't get what I deserved instead I was deceived
Still young and didn't know about this in the street
Of the acts, so crass and shady
Don't crush your dreamshow and your whole entity
Subliminally you're on the hire from a slavery
Remember that "What goes around, comes around"
God is watching you and everything that you do
Do you remember everything that you did before?
The way the bad action opens karmic door
I'ma leave it up to God what he got for you
I'ma leave it up to Him what he got for me
And he's watching you

[Interlude: will.i.am]
Yeah, yeah
Watch out

[Chorus]
Ain't no running from
Karma, and no running
Ain't no running from
Karma, and no running
Ain't no running from
Karma, and no running
Ain't no running from
Karma, and no running

[Bridge 1: Taboo]
Yeah, yeah, you can't run away (No, no, no)
You know, it's gonna get ya (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
And don't ignore it (No, no, no)
You know why, it's gonna get ya (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Yeah, yeah, you can't run away (No, no, no)
It's gonna get ya (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Don't ignore it (No, no, no)
It's gonna get ya (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Bridge 2]
'Cause one way or another
It's gonna find ya
It's gonna get ya-get ya-get ya-get ya
One way or another
It's gonna find ya
It's gonna get ya-get ya-get ya-get ya
One way or another
It's gonna find ya
It's gonna get ya-get ya-get ya-get ya
One way or another
It's gonna find ya
It's gonna get ya-get ya-get ya-get ya

[Interlude: will.i.am]

Don't ignore it (No, no, no)
It's gonna get ya (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
You can't run away (No, no, no)
It's gonna get ya (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Don't ignore it (No, no, no)
It's gonna get ya (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 1: will.i.am]
Yo, this is the way it's goin' down
We come in compound, releasin' double-rounds in hound
Like heat sensors, your defense techniques are no match
When I begin to draw back, cover up your cardiac
'Cause I'll arrest ya, when I penetrate feel the pressure
The critical perfectionist, rhythmic expressionist
We comin' deadlier than venom
And you'll be scared to pick the mic up again
Lyrically, you on the level of "Green, Eggs and Ham"
Your best bet is fold 'cause I gots a bigger hand
Plus I'm steppin' like a monster so go-go and scram
You ain't experienced, you lucky if you ride the ambulance
'Cause when you dealin' with fool Will is quite fatal
Shape-shiftin brothers like Play-Doh
Your rhymes are anal, and we ain't got no time to play, no
Games, put the mic down, boy, try not to say no
More o' them rhymes 'cause you duplicate like Kinkos
You're a carbon copy with the wrinkles
You whacka than that nigga that be rhymin' in the Pringle commercials
Put your career in reversal

[Chorus: Kim Hill]
No need to front, that's what it is
I gotta get into you
Oh, I gotta show you what it is
Gotta get into you

[Verse 2: apl.de.ap]
Strong communicator called the Black Eyed Peas
Hard illustrator co-coordinate with ease
And duplicator crew, we put 'em all on freeze
Lock 'em in the cell, then throw away the keys
Another lost identity in disease
Entity with a so-called MC enemies
Will decrease when I step into your sceneries
Of course now you off-course lost up in the source
I'm running out of time, there's no time for no scrimmage
A race to raid the diamonds and replace it with the real image
Picture that, I know where I'm at
I know where I'm going and I'll be back
With a stronger impact lyrics be intact
Get you intoxicated when black attack
With the full-force pressure, hard to measure
On a rated scale, whack MC's won't prevail
On a dream of makin' cream, braggin' about infrared beams
But it seems all they really pullin' is pullin' them schemes
I take it back to the essence of hip-hop
Never will I stop with my beat-box

[Chorus: Kim Hill]
No need to front, that's what it is
I gotta get into you
Oh, I gotta show you what it is
Gotta get into you

[Bridge: Kim Hill]
Can you feel it?
Hmm, I gotta get into you
Oh, I'm gonna show you what it is
I wanna get into you

[Chorus: Kim Hill]
No need to front, that's what it is
I gotta get into you
Oh, I gotta show you what it is
Gotta get into you
No need to front, that's what it is
I gotta get into you
Oh, I gotta show you what it is
Gotta get into you

[Refrain: Macy Gray]
I love you love, but I'm thinkin' 'bout leaving
So far you treated me so bad
I love you love, but I'm thinkin' 'bout leaving
So far you treated me so bad

[Verse 1: will.i.am]
I call my baby to tell her I'm on my way
Call her 'til I pass we going out today
It was a beautiful Sunday
I had plans on going to watchin' the matinee
But as soon as I step to the door
She hit me with some stuff that I just couldn't ignore
(Talk about) That she had to up and leave
'Cause I was a fool foolin' her on what she need
Check it, yo from my point of view it was kinda whack
She said even when we're reminiscing there's no bringing it back
And for her, it's really beyond that
Talkin about she been through emotional combat

[Chorus: Macy Gray & will.i.am]
All the years that I been back
You were never around
And now, love won't wait
(It's like that now, oh, it's like that now)
Let's stop all my love to you
Baby, I'm through with you
'Cause now, love won't wait
(It's like that now, oh, it's like that now)

[Refrain: Macy Gray & will.i.am]
I love you love, but I'm thinkin' 'bout leaving (what she talkin' 'bout? what she talkin' 'bout?)
So far you treated me so bad (what she talkin' 'bout? what she talkin' 'bout?)
I love you love, but I'm thinkin' 'bout leaving (what she talkin' 'bout? what she talkin' 'bout?)
So far you treated me so bad (what she talkin' 'bout? what she talkin' 'bout?)

[Verse 2: will.i.am, apl.de.ap & Taboo]
Yo, Will, that's kinda whack, I know how you be feelin'
My girl's also trippin' about the same reason
'Cause we out for two seasons on the road makin' G's and
I figured it out these women there's no pleasin'
Yo, Will, I feel the pain, that you're going through
She got you stuck on a yam and she's splatting too
Plotting on leaving you, yo, are you feeling cool?
And if you're not you can always hang with the crew (That's right)

[Chorus: Macy Gray & will.i.am]
All the years that I been back
You were never around
And now, love won't wait
(It's like that now, oh, it's like that now)
Let's stop all my love to you
Baby, I'm through with you
'Cause now, love won't wait
(It's like that now, oh, it's like that now)

[Verse 3: will.i.am, apl.de.ap & Taboo]
I call my baby to tell her I'm on my way
Call her 'til I pass we going out today
It was a beautiful Sunday
I had plans on going to watchin' the matinee
And she dissed you, up and left you
Packed her bags and went and upset you
She was like "I'm leaving" (Oh it's like that, now)
"I'm leaving" (She was always like that)
Check it, but from my point of view it was kinda whack
She said even when we're reminiscing there's no bringing it back
And for her, it's really beyond that
Talkin about she been through emotional combat

[Chorus: Macy Gray & will.i.am]
All the years that I been back
You were never around
And now, love won't wait
(It's like that now, oh, it's like that now)
Let's stop all my love to you
Baby, I'm through with you
'Cause now, love won't wait
(It's like that now, baby, it's like that now)

[Refrain: Macy Gray]
I love you love, but I'm thinkin' 'bout leaving
So far you treated me so bad
I love you love, but I'm thinkin' 'bout leaving
So far you treated me so bad
I love you love, but I'm thinkin' 'bout leaving
So far you treated me so bad
I love you love, but I'm thinkin' 'bout leaving
So far you treated me so bad

[Outro: Macy Gray]
I love you love, but I'm thinkin' 'bout

[Intro: will.i.am and DJ Premier]
Three, four..
Chk-u-chk-u-chk-chk-chk
Chk-duh
Chk-uh
I'm the W-I, double-L-I-Am
Linkin' up with the Preemo, do it (do it)
He's the T-to-the-A-to-the-B-oh-oh
Linkin' up with the Preemo, do it (do it)
He's the A-P-L-to-the-D-E-Ap
Linkin' up with the Preemo, do it..
And we the B-to-the-E-to-the-P
Hookin' up with Preemo don't do it (do it)

[Verse 1: will.i.am]
We comin' through to take control of each zip code
Bridgin' the gap from rap to calypso
We gonna strike each city from 'Frisco
Tokyo then back to San Luis Obispo
(??) data, descendants of Amadeus
Transmitted through your CD's, tapes and record players
We the crusaders, attack like alligators
Yo, we're known to elevate like escalators
Yo, we comin' through to control your area
Black Eyed Peas control your area
Bringin' the vibe that create hysteria
Wack MC's vacate your area
We 3D, comin' out of yo' speaker
I bust through your woofer and tear through your tweeter
Every rapper's talkin' 'bout killin' somebody
But they ain't hip-hop to be (check it out)

[Chorus: will.i.am]
This is the hip hip hip, the hop hop hop
We keep it keep it movin', non non stop
(Black Eyed Peas), yo, we keep it movin'
Yo, we keep it movin'
The hip hip hip, the hop hop hop
We keep it keep it movin', non non stop
(Black Eyed Peas) , yo, we keep it movin'
We got to keep it movin'

[Verse 2: apl.de.ap and will.i.am]
It's the Black Eyed Peas (?) climbin' up the Empire (yeah)
State Tower livin' is the mission desired (yeah)
I see a lot of liars holding them mics cross and fire (yeah)
And they lyrics soundin' tired, repetitious and expired (*yawn*)
Cool 'em down troop before they time get picked (yeah)
I can't take 'em serious talkin' about boom-shit
Got money and cars but, can't bullshit
And your lyrics are soundin' like, some doo-doo shit
While I'm holdin' the mic tight, recite livin' insight
So we can all benefit from the art-form
Many took, (??) on you to make dough
But forgot the main goal, almost lost the soul and got norm
'Cause everybody's talkin' 'bout, high profilin'
But it ain't hip-hop to me (why? why? why?)
'Cause everybody's talkin' 'bout, high profilin'
But it ain't hip-hop to me (so check it out y'all)

[Chorus: will.i.am]
This is the hip hip hip, the hop hop hop
We keep it keep it movin', non non stop
(Black Eyed Peas), we keep it movin'
Yo, we keep it movin'
The hip hip hip, the hop hop hop
We keep it keep it movin', non non stop
(Black Eyed Peas), yo, we keep it movin'
We got to keep it movin'

[Bridge: will.i.am, apl.de.ap and Taboo (samples from "Joints and Jams")]
"I like the way the rhythm makes me jump"
"Got Black to Asian, and Caucasian sayin'...
'That's the joint, that's the jam'"
"Let your body collide to the rhythm provided by the
"Black Eyed Peas"
"Through a nation we build, off the music field
Or a visual thrill, we do what we feel"

[Verse 3: apl.de.ap, will.i.am and Taboo]
Yeah, your style's dated and you ain't came out yet
Don't think you're fresh 'cause you're rockin' them outfits
I think you're lost, 'cause you don't know where your route is
Pick up the mic, put your money where your mouth is
I pick up the mic and put my lyrics where my mouth is
Hit your spirit, make you jump out them pouches
Quick agility to slow-like slouches
With more bounce to the freak of (deaf fouses?)
And we announce this, follow us and show you what the sound is
Preemo and the Peas collaboratin' like great
Ayo let's do this, let's do this, we show you who the crew is
Black Eyed Peas is like the rulers leavin' all you brothers clueless
Haters hate us if you wanna, we gon' speak on it
We gon' tell the world why hip-hop is haunted
Money is a drug and MC's is on it
We gon' take it back to the days of Soulsonic

[Chorus (x2): will.i.am]
This is the hip hip hip, the hop hop hop
We keep it keep it movin', non non stop
(Black Eyed Peas), yo, we keep it movin'
We got to keep it movin'

We be the connection to
Everything from calypso to
Hip-hop down to the bee-bop
Now come rock slip slide to mine
B-boy niggas are gonna push butt
Rock-n-roll brothas are bound to serve it up
Got the leak so put the Peas on turf
So get your waterproof Walkman and go surf
John Mcenroe get the kids all wacky
Jamal Anderson knew the Peas from back in
The day now he runnin' over niggas for the Falcons
Instead of lookin' over all y'all brothas from the balcony
But we constructin' the bridge
So y'all could come and visit
This goes out to every Pea that exists
How we doin' it?
Yo, it's like this

[Chorus: will.i.am]
We bridging the gaps
We brought a lil' somethin' to
Start bridging the gaps
We brought a lil' somethin' to
Start bridging the gaps
We brought a lil' somethin' to
Start bridging the gaps
And it goes like
Ahhhh-ah-ah-ahhhh

[Verse 2: apl.de.ap]
We direct, revolutionizing new concepts
Emerging binaries to prove success
Stereotypical, they won't get it
We breakin' the barriers, some sonic shit
LA to Kingston to London Bridge
New York to Germany to Brooklyn Bridge
Also my people in the Golden Gate Bridge
Innovators creatin' new rich
Got them skate kids sayin' (let's rock)
Got them brothas sayin' (yo let's get fly)
Got the whole south sayin' (ya feel me?)
Got them chulos sayin' (ya feel me?)
Every type of people be feelin' my section
'Cause we be expandin' to a wider selection
Now this goes out to everything that exists
Yo how we doin' it?
We do it like this
C'mon

[Chorus: will.i.am & Kim Hill]
We bridging the gaps

Do do do do do do do
Do do do do do do do
Do do do do do do do
Do do do do do do do

[Verse 3: Taboo]
Legacy must live on
Legacy must live on
Legacy must live on
Make sure that the bridge is strong
Make sure that the gap is wide
Supply the future that we provide
Won't commit and just go inside
Give me room so I can dip and dive
Show you how we hypnotize
Angry Foot is gonna tell you why
We built this bridge for the people in the park
We built this bridge for the dummies in the dark
And we built this bridge for the children in the light
We built this bridge for the sisters with sight
And we built this bridge for my brothas that are blind
We built this bridge for the ones that use their mind
And we built this bridge for everybody
For everybody

[Chorus: will.i.am & Kim Hill]
We bridging the gaps
We brought a lil' somethin' to
Start bridging the gaps

As soon as A La stepped off (the floor)
People started hollerin' (for more)
Beggin us to bless 'em with an (encore)
You know the Peas they game to that (for sure)
No matter what the coast we, be on
Pacific or Atlantic we, stay strong
Foreign or domestically, we conquer
All obstacles professionally and rock on
And that's exactly how we made it rock (made it rock)
We turn this on and then we make it hot (make it hot)
We also known to cause a state of shock (state of shock)
We start at 2 then go to 10 o'clock (10 o'clock)
10 o'clock the next day that is (day that is)
No matter what city or state that is (state that is)
Don't ask no questions, that's the way that is (way that is)
Don't ask no questions, that's the way that is

[Chorus]
Back, back, back, back, and forth
From Ca-li to New York
Back, back, back, back, and forth
From Ca-li to New York

Back, back, back, back, and forth
From Ca-li to New York

[Verse 2: Pos]
Introduce Posdonus y'all ('Nus y'all)
Sticky like cous-cous y'all (cous y'all)
Be the words that I ap-ply (ap-ply)
My peeps mass, karma N.Y. (N.Y)
Check it out, you see you other emcees, sound like brother emcees
Raised by the same pop and mother emcees
While I got a lot of brand in my name, I'm recognizable
Leavin me the cash amount, that's quite sizable
Rich in that english that's broke as hell
That's why my niggas in the hood understand me so well
Its the modern rap type talk
Used to walk, all over your ears
You hear the  thump, this track pumps like, well order
Some others fell short of the line of finish
You didn't practice harder at the scrimmage
Now my image is the golden cup
My career is dirty compared to yours, it's all washed up

[Chorus]
Back, back, back, back, and forth
From Ca-li to New York
Back, back, back, back, and forth
From Ca-li to New York
Back, back, back, back, and forth
From Ca-li to New York
Back, back, back, back, and forth
From Ca-li to New York

[Verse 3: Dove]
We, we, we, we regulate and cross plates, destruct ya
Toss coins to distract it and we bust ya
Minds blow bigger than tempers out in Russia
Cuss like a sailor, make you shame like thelya
Stitch a verse tailored to fit
Spray paintin' your spit
On the deco we art, spread apart
I raid mo' tracks than flicks in "Beat Street"
With kicks until the sole/Soul wear out, never that!
We weather that, you light in the ass and feather that
Heavy like black leather coats, you pleather that
Last dick on the line, we way ahead of that
Squeezin' like Freddie Foxx, and his two Glocks
Rocks don't impress niggas who speak to God

[Intro: will.i.am]
What?

[Verse 1: will.i.am]
A lot of brothers, claimin' they hard (huh?)
I grab the microphone and leave 'em scarred (scarred)
But not scarred physically (what?)
More like scarred mentally (yeah)
I correct your ego (your ego?)
I'ma show you how it go (go)
'Cause you killin' me, ain't no skill in you
With my hands on you I wouldn't be feelin' you
Yeah you platinum, but you wack as hell
I dubbed over your single like a Maxell
You need to
Stop now, get original
Start practicin', master your flow
You might as well, turn in your mic
And start collectin' dollars at the turnpike
Cause the rhymes you kick, need to be fixed
But you couldn't even fix them (in the mix)
If you ate pebbles, your shit wouldn't rock
You one of them balloons made to go pop
You need to

[Chorus: will.i.am]
Stop now, get original
Start practicin', master your flow
Stop now, get original
What?
Stop now, get original
Start practicin', master your flow

[Verse 2: apl.de.ap]
There is really nothin' you can do
We about to hit you in your face with my kung-fu
Risky on the microphone, I am
Got the energy of Goliath unravellin'
I'm about to let you know the deal on how I feel
Many people can't be real, so they gotta chase the steel
What the deal? Is it really all about the bills?
What's the thrill? I'd rather have my soul fulfilled
You gotta
Stop now, get original
Start practicin', master your flow
We delegate the skills to conversating
The loss of motivation of MC's to create
Sent it in for quick hit, waitin' for the break
You didn't pay your dues, so you got on Rikki Lake
How does it feel to be the man on top
When everything you got ain't any of your props?
You need to

[Chorus: will.i.am]
Stop now, get original
Start practicin', master your flow
Stop now, get original
Stop now, get original
Start practicin', master your flow

[Verse 3: Chali 2na]
When you think about rap in its entirety
Violence became variety
Silently personalities differ from what they try to be
2na be on the frontline, one rhyme shall I hit you with
Sluggish like a barbituate, we can make you admit you bit
A hectic thrill, connect with Will
And we create with the calm cool collective skill
The checks get real, people think this shit is hunky-dory
It's another story while we be fightin' for re-
-demption pimps and prostitutes get the break they need
With breakneck speed, the fakes succeed indeed
Thinkin' life is a party and it's a must to please
But many pop MC's work for Mephistopheles
Choppin broccoli happily for your company
Publically sellin' Satan when really you should be bumpin' the truth
So stop now

[Chorus: will.i.am]
Stop now, get original
Start practicin', master your flow

[Chorus: Les Nubians]
All on my own
All on my own
All on my own
All on my own

[Verse 1: apl.de.ap]
We gonna build this bridge on our own
Original creation and let it be known
No duplication that I can condone
Constant elevation till I'm fully blown
I'm on my own now in my own world feeling free
Can't change the way I am with your insanity
I'ma stay who I be can't nobody change me
Got my soul to protect and support my family

[Bridge: Les Nubians]
Tu cries à la folie
Et c'est moi qui subis
Ce que tu n'as pas compris
C'est laisse moi seule, chéri

[Chorus: Les Nubians]
All on my own
All on my own
All on my own

[Verse 2: will.i.am]
I'm all by myself no one can help me out
Plus I'm the only one that know what it's about
I gotta stay calm to figure it out
It's gonna relax, stop, shout
You know you gotta breathe in to breathe out
I stay cool and collect of ??? cool out
I can't end on my own or go out that way
So why I gotta listen to what people got to say
I stay I stay

[Chorus: Les Nubians]
All on my own
All on my own
All on my own
All on my

[Verse 3: Mos Def]
Yo I know self own self
To control self
Avoid or destroy
Whatever did to po' self
When brother's right Muslim right and compose self
Stay on the grind to protect feet and clothe self
Stay true to self do for self do improve the self
To elevate the next man we need-could use some help
For long time I got a plan to see the root to self
So when the strong wind come it don't remove the self
We born alone and die alone but we don't strive alone
B E P 'N M O S blaze the trail and we ride it

[Chorus: Les Nubians]
All on my own
Tu cries à la folie
Et c'est moi qui subis
All on my own
All on my own
All on my own
All on my own

[Verse 1: apl.de.ap]
It's so amazing when a show is captivatin'
Gettin' everybody jumpin' and celebratin'
Only one's own musically be overlayin'
Connecting energy circulatin' inspiration
Together movin' in a synchronized formation
And if you're feelin' down this is survival from depression
You see the lesson is we're rhyming for our mission
Abolish circumstance transmitting from a piston
Taking what I can but keeping peace in moderation
Ap is like an eagle with the alligator patience
Ready to attack any mic that I am facin'
No limitation where I'm takin' my creation 'cause

[Bridge: will.i.am]
We got we got we got it like that
We got we got we got it like that
We got we got we got it like that
We got we got we got it like that

Hot, hot, hot (c'mon now)
You're so amazing, you're so hot and so blazing
You're hot, hot, hot (ooh wee)
Hot, hot, hot (c'mon now)

[Verse 2: will.i.am]
I'm more than ready to slice like machete
Leave ya like confetti
Break hearts like Tom Petty
Are you ready?
'Cause I am every metaphor
You are nearly ready for
The media predator
'Cause I'll bust in your session and kick my own raps, yes
Grab the microphone and show you where the forms at
Tell your girl adapts 'cause the rhyme contact
And she easily attracted to it just like that
It's like this 'cause the way we capitvatin'
We put her in a situation where she debatin'
If she gonna up and jump and leave her mate and
Go promote for us down at the radio station
She likes the
She really likes the music we be makin'
She likes the
She wants to be down when we creatin'
She likes the
She likes the way the vibe's vibratin'
Yo, yo
She likes the way the vibes y'all ratin'

[Chorus: will.i.am]
You're so amazing, you're so hot and so blazing
You're hot, hot, hot (c'mon stop)
Hot, hot, hot (c'mon now)
You're so amazing, you're so hot and so blazing
You're hot, hot, hot (ooh wee)
Hot, hot, hot (c'mon now)

We got we got we got it like that
We got we got we got it like that
We got we got we got it like that
We got we got we got it like that
We got we got we got it like that
'Cause we got got it like that
We got we got we got it like that
We got got got we got it like that

[Verse 3: Taboo]
1,2, 3 Taboo is on the set
It's the family clique Broshiggez (aw shit)
Boy don't fret everything's aight
We gonna fall on up when Luis in flight
Yo, fuck the rhyme tryin' we on poetic control
Nevermind the behind and step ahead of your soul
And move on to the next with the words we bless
'Cause Black Eyed Peas is comin' hotter than sex
We're writin', rhymin', makin' the beats
Okay, hip-hop blazers bringin' the heat
Motivate cut, cut and scratch the groove
Elevate then make them powerful moves
How amazin' is it?
It's so amazin' the blind be gazin'
Even got deaf people listenin' and sayin'
Keep on
And ya don't stop
We got the music that makes your body hot

[Chorus: will.i.am]
You're so amazing, you're so hot and so blazing
You're hot, hot, hot (c'mon now)
Hot, hot, hot (ohh wee)
You're so amazing, you are so hot and so blazing
You're hot, hot, hot (c'mon now)

[Verse 1: will.i.am]
Yo Tab and Ap let's go interact
Matter of fact let's attack 'em with the contact
Make the ultimate impact leave 'em hunchbacked
Light 'em up with the mic like we pyromaniacs
Feel the power when I unlash exact
There's no kinda act tactics that can stop that
When I climax I'ma like kick a hole in that
Sympathetic non-poetic crap you callin' a rap
And I might revitalize your cardiac
So you can realize the heart of rap recited by the Black
Eyed Peas, I'ma seize your income
And freeze all the competition and then some
I flip a show up in the Hamptons
Rip it down to Compton
Performin' my anthem
Ya know, ya know
You know that's the joint that's the jam
Look I got some new shit
We came to do it again

[Chorus: will.i.am]
Ahhhhhhhhhhh
Scream if ya need to just let it out, let it out, let it out, let it out

Eruptin' volcanic lyrically meaning something
All you muthafuckas sayin' nothin' need to stop them
Time to break forth, ain't no goin' back now

Uproar uncontrollably make you say Apl
Tunay na MCs naririnig mo d'yan sa radyo
Creates so soul sonically makin' you bounce your
Energetic created terror shakin' your dance halls
One in a million with the mission, bringin' in back, raw
Talent on the mic will excite better than dropped bras
Anybody lost follow the source of course
BEP the family bringin' you the strongest force
Bridgin' it on every angle and make ya (dance)

Me and microphone go like source for me and warn
My delivery is news like paper on the lawn
When it's on then it's on step on stage and perform
If you're scared then step off, cuz your pride be all gone
If it's time that you leave, go ahead then proceed
If it's skills that ya lack
Take twenty steps back
It's a slap you will get
If you try and disrespect
The crew is the Peas
And we bout to do the next
Es asi si asi musica es para mi
Para ti parate si tu quieres entender
Muevele muevele para hombre y mujer

Yo self just let it out, y'all just let it out, holla and let it out

[Verse 1]
I know I'm not the only one that's filling the void
Creatively hip-hop is being destroyed
A lot of rappers really need to be unemployed
Because the topics that them talk about has got me annoyed
You see I heard it all before, there's no need to repeat it
The forms I vacated, might as well delete it
Put your program in and open a new file
You shoulda took your record advance and bought a style
We the only crew that came original
While a lot of other brothers just mimic the pile
The pile that's only designed for pop charts
That contradicts thought, that's the reason we brought
It back cause honestly it lacks
Talent and creativity, in fact
These are symptoms to somethin' that's wack
And your system senseless to witness that
So, hear me if you wanna, we gon' speak on it
We gon' tell the world why hip-hop is haunted
Money is a drug and MC's is on it
We gon' take it back to the days of Mantronix

[Chorus]
Yo *snap* we bringin' it back
Check it out cause we bringin' it back
All DJ crews that's cuttin', you bringin' it back
We bringin' it back
All b-boys breakin' and bustin', bringin' it back
We bringin' it back
I'ma do the cabbage patch to solidify we bringin' it back
Black Eyed Peas straight bringin' it back, check it out

[Verse 2]
Y'all, your rhymes ain't ready, you dead like Kenny
Approachin' on the mic soundin' hefty
Ummmmmm, lustin' for them pennies
Far too many, MC's wanna praise they Bentley's
Yo, we breakin' it down with the art
DJ and breakin' up on the chart
MC's pull out your mic, rip it apart
Writers hit up the wall, put up your mark and
Set get ready, hold yourself steady
Tryin to make a turn like Aunt Betty
Sharp on the mic and slice like a machete
Feelin the beat, real deep, down to my belly
Back in the essence, rhyme with the reasons
Too many MC lost the true meanin'
Hip-hop, bringin' it back with the feelin'
Y'all, we're bringin' it back with the feelin'
So love me if you wanna, but I'ma speak on it
I'ma tell the world why hip-hop is haunted
Money is a drug and MC's is on it
We gon' take it back to the days of Soulsonic

[Chorus]
Yo *snap* we bringin' it back
Check it out cause we bringin' it back
All DJ crews that's cuttin', you bringin' it back
We bringin' it back
All b-boys breakin' and bustin', bringin' it back
We bringin' it back
I'ma do the cabbage patch to solidify we bringin' it back
Black Eyed Peas straight bringin' it back, check it out
Yo, we bringin' it back
Check it out look we bringin' it back
All DJ's scratchin' and cuttin', you bringin' it back
We bringin' it back
All b-girls breakin' and bustin', you bringin' it back

Black Eyed Peas steady bringin' it back, check it out

And it's true, girl

[Chorus: will.i.am]
You make me feel alive, you make me feel alive
You make me feel alive, you make me feel alive

[Verse 1: Fergie]
You say that I'm the only one
You say that I'm your number one
Now you're gone and I feel numb
Tell me where do we go wrong?
You are my best friend and boyfriend
Now it seems like you're my worst friend
I gotta do soul searching
Without you I'm a whole different person
I ain't acting like I used to, I don't feel loved like I used to
It was your love I was used to
Why did I have to lose your love, your love, your love?
Your love is what it was, that had me feeling buzzed
You are my true love

[Hook: will.i.am]
And it's true that I love you
And it's true, you're the only one, and I do, I adore you

Hey girl, you're the only one, supposed to be my number one
Now you're gone, I feel so numb
Tell me how did we go wrong?
First friends, then we became best friends
Used to be my girlfriend, now you're my worst friend
Yeah, I gotta do a little soul searching
Without you I'm a whole different person
I don't even act like I was used to
I don't even feel loved like I used to
I guess it's your love that I'm used to
Damn, I feel bad I had to lose you
I got so many things I wanna say
I guess this mean that I'm missing you
Sorry for the things that I did to you
I'm so lost without you

[Hook: will.i.am]
And it's true that I love you
And it's true, you're the only one, and I do, I adore you
And it's true, girl

[Chorus: will.i.am]
You make me feel alive, you make me feel alive
You make me feel alive, you make me feel alive

[Chorus: will.i.am]
You make me feel alive, you make me feel alive
You make me feel alive, you make me feel alive

So easy to fall in love with you
And all the things that you do
Baby girl, you're so remarkable
So special, so wonderful
So special, so wonderful
So special, so wonderful
Baby girl, you're so remarkable
So special

[Verse 1: will.i.am]
I called Tab on Wednesday night
So we could make plans for Thursday night
He said "we could go hit the peapods"
I was like yeah, that's my favorite spot
Plus I like it there, 'cause I got love on the list
High powered juice, where I don't even get frisked
Walk up in the place and get love from the misses
Pounds from my brothers, 'cause they knowing that this is
The place to be to let it all out
But when the weekend come, the weekend come, y'all could come
So go tell ya momma come and ya papa come
Go to spin the record so we can get dumb
Place packed, capacity maximum
Due to my man Polo Promotion
And I can't wait to go out and hear some

[Chorus: Esthero]
Jumping music, swift DJ's
Smoke machines and laser rays
Look out weekend 'cause, here I come
Because weekends were, were

[Verse 2: apl.de.ap]
Walk in the club at like 10 o' clock
And the spot is hot, blowing up rooftops
Its Thursday night and the night is young
Four day weekend, time to have some fun

[Hook]
Lapit mga kaibigan at makinig kayo (Listen up y'all)
Ako'y may dala-dalang balita galing sa bayan ko (Listen closely y'all)
Nais kong ipamahagi ang mga kuwento
Ang mga pangyayaring nagaganap sa lupang pinangako

[Interlude]
Yo, every place got a ghetto
This is my version of it, check it out

[Verse 1]
Listen closely yo, I got a story to tell
A version of my ghetto where life felt for real
Some would call it hell but to me it was heaven
God gave me the grace, amazin' ways of living
How would you feel if you had to catch your meal
Build a hut to live and to eat and chill in?
Having to pump the water outta the ground
The way we put it down utilizing what is around
Like land for farming, river for fishing
Everyone helpin' each other whenever they can
We makin' it happen, from nothin' to somethin'
That's how we be survivin' back in my homeland

[Hook]
Lapit mga kaibigan at makinig kayo (Listen up y'all)
Ako'y may dala-dalang balita galing sa bayan ko (Listen closely y'all)
Nais kong ipamahagi ang mga kuwento
Ang mga pangyayaring nagaganap sa lupang pinangako

[Interlude]
Yo, it's been a while, but
I've been back home to my homeland (check it out)
To see what's going on

[Verse 2]
Man it feels good to be back at home
And it's been a decade, on the journey all alone
I was fourteen when I first left Philippines
I've been away half my life, but it felt like a day
To be next to my mom with her home cooked meal
Man I felt complete, my emotions I feel
Now life has changed for me in the U.S
But back at home man, life was a mess
I guess sometimes life's stresses gets you down
On your knees, oh brother I wish I could have helped you out

[Hook]

[Verse 1: will.i.am]
I took your picture, with one particular reason
And it's to capture your character
I like to sit and stare at 'cha
Ain't nothing wrong with starin' at 'cha
Girl, don't get scared that I envision us getting married
And I ain't tryin' to rush nuttin'
'Cause I ain't rushin'
It'll take a time like, "What's them things that move slow you know them...
Damn..I can't think 'cause you on my mind..."
And when you on my mind
Can't find anything to rhyme with rhyme
I'll gotta rhyme rhyme with mixture
And speakin' of mixture
With you, I wanna get mixed up
I'm like a record and you're like a record
So let's let the DJ mix us
You're like an elixir
That's got me tipsy
This is just like Ripley's
Believe it or not girl, but I love you...

[Chorus: will.i.am & (Fergie)]
Girl, you really got me goin'

I don't know what I'm doin'

For you, I'm a fanatic

You're sexy antics turn me on like automatic
No need to get dramatic, but I gotta have it

Gimme some of them sexual acrobatics
Pharmaceutical, girl, anything that suits you, girl
Stuff you ain't used to, girl
Come over here and let me show you just how willy do it

You're a freak and I knew it
Baby let's get to it

[Chorus: will.i.am & (Fergie)]
Girl, you really got me goin'

[Verse 1: will.i.am]
In this context, there's no disrespect
So when I bust my rhyme, you break ya necks
We got five minutes for us to disconnect
From all intellect collect the rhythm effect
Obstacles are inefficient, follow your intuition
Free your inner soul and break away from tradition
'Cause when we be out, girlies pull they weave out
You wouldn't believe how we wow shit out
Burn it 'til it's burned out, turn it 'til it's turned out
Act up from north, west, east, south

[Pre-Chorus: The Black Eyed Peas]
Everybody, everybody, just get into it, get stupid
Get retarded, get retarded, get retarded

[Verse 2: Taboo]
Lose control, of body and soul
Don't move too fast, people, just take it slow
Don't get ahead, just jump into it
Y'all hear about it, the Peas will do it
Get started, get stupid
Don't worry about it, people will walk you through it
Step by step like an infant new kid
Inch by inch with the new solution
Transmit hits with no delusion
The feeling's irresistible and that's how we movin'

[Pre-Chorus: The Black Eyed Peas]
Everybody, everybody, just get into it, get stupid
Get retarded, get retarded, get retarded

[Chorus: The Black Eyed Peas]

Let's get ill, that's the deal
Ap the gate, and Will bring the thugged out drill (Just)
Lose your mind, this is the time
Y'all can't stand still, trust and bang your spine (Just)

Up inside the club or in your Bentley
Get messy, loud and sick
You mind pass normal on another head trip
So, come them now, do not correct it
Let's get ignorant, let's get hectic

[Pre-Chorus: The Black Eyed Peas]
Everybody, everybody, just get into it, get stupid

[Verse 1: will.i.am, Fergie & will.i.am]
When I step in the room
I bring the heat like the month of June
Crank the volume, make the bass go boom
Wild out like we some wild baboons
We go bananas to the tune
I wanna throw 'bows, give me elbow room (move nigga)
When I'm out my cocoon I'm ready to consume
Let's hit the saloon cos
It's a holiday pardon me as I celebrate
And that's the way we do it
We get a little loopy off the ignorant fluid
And act a little stupid just in case you didn't knew it
That's just how we do it, don't ask why we do it
That's just the way it be
Lovin' double d's, up at the A-D
When I party in Hollywood, V-I-P
I don't understand the S-T-O-P 'cause

[Chorus: Fergie, Fergie & will.i.am]
We party forever and get down together
We don't stop, no, and we don't quit
Let's get it going cos you know we gon' celebrate
'Cause it's a holiday, I don't work today, or the next three days
So let's celebrate, 'cause it's a holiday, I don't work today, nah
Pardon me as I celebrate

[Verse 2: Taboo]
It's time to celebrate
Servin' up beatbox on a hot plate
Like that y'all, we on a festive date
Make you go ape then raise your heart rate
We gon' stay out late
Party 'til the morning and wake up late
We do it to the day break
Go on and on and then on and on and
Dance to my rhyme
I could holla a-cappellas deaf 'til you're blind
You're mine, baby
Take it to the moon for your behind, baby
Take us to the moon and just recline. baby
Cock my gat and stroke my nine. baby
We don't stop, girl, we don't quit, no
We don't quit, no, we don't quit

[Chorus: Fergie, Fergie & will.i.am]
We party forever and get down together
We don't stop, no, and we don't quit
Let's get it going cos you know we gon' celebrate
'Cause it's a holiday, I don't work today, or the next three days
So let's celebrate, 'cause it's a holiday, I don't work today, nah
Pardon me as I celebrate

[Bridge: will.i.am, Fergie & will.i.am]
Don't stop it, just push it
Don't stop it, just push it
Move your body and push it
Get naughty and push it
We gon' party and bullshit
We gon' party and bullshit
Move your body and push it
Get naughty and push it, 'cause
It's a holiday, pardon me as I celebrate

[Verse 5: apl.de.ap & (will.i.am)]
It's time to get wasted and scope the whole place for girls with cute faces
'Cause I see some fly mamas so pack your pajamas but don't bring the drama
But you could bring your melody, I'll plug in my mic and sing my harmonies (Lalala)
For how many times we gonna hit it
How many times we gonna split it
How many times you gonna get it (Get it)
Or else you are gonna wanna come over
You're gonna have to wanna (man)
'Cause I'm the alligator champ
Driving the train, driving the tram
Or you could bring your friend and I switch my lane
And get buddy buddy with your friend Mary Jane
She really blows my brain (Brain)
She really blows my brain (Brain)

[Chorus: Fergie & Taboo]
We party forever and get down together
We don't stop, no, and we don't quit (yeah)
Let's get it going cos you know we gon' celebrate (Said we do it everyday)
Cos it's a holiday (and we do it every night)
I don't work today (and we do it at the club)
Yeah, uh, it's my birthday
Celebrate, cause it's a holiday
I don't work today, nah
Party as I celebrate

[Verse 1: will.i.am]
What's wrong with the world, Mama?
People livin' like they ain't got no mamas
I think the whole world's addicted to the drama
Only attracted to things that'll bring you trauma
Overseas, yeah, we tryna stop terrorism
But we still got terrorists here livin'
In the USA, the big CIA
The Bloods and the Crips and the KKK
But if you only have love for your own race
Then you only leave space to discriminate
And to discriminate only generates hate
And when you hate, then you're bound to get irate, yeah
Madness is what you demonstrate
And that's exactly how anger works and operates
Man, you gotta have love just to set it straight
Take control of your mind and meditate
Let your soul gravitate to the love, y'all, y'all

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
People killin', people dyin'
Children hurtin', hear them cryin'
Can you practice what you preach?
And would you turn the other cheek?
Father, father, father, help us
Send some guidance from above
'Cause people got me, got me questioning
Where is the love?

[Post-Chorus: will.i.am & Fergie]
(Love) Where is the love? (The love)
Where is the love? (The love)
Where is the love, the love, the love?

[Verse 2: Taboo]
It just ain't the same, old ways have changed
New days are strange, is the world insane?
If love and peace is so strong
Why are there pieces of love that don't belong?
Nations droppin' bombs
Chemical gases filling lungs of little ones
With ongoing sufferin' as the youth die young
So ask yourself, is the lovin' really gone?
So I can ask myself, really, what is going wrong
With this world that we livin' in? People keep on givin' in
Makin' wrong decisions, only visions of them dividends
Not respectin' each other, deny thy brother
A war is goin' on, but the reason's undercover
The truth is kept secret, and swept under the rug
If you never know truth, then you never know love
Where's the love, y'all? Come on (I don't know)
And where's the truth, y'all? Come on (I don't know)
And where's the love y'all?

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
People killin', people dyin'
Children hurtin', hear them cryin'
Can you practice what you preach?
And would you turn the other cheek?
Father, father, father, help us
Send some guidance from above
'Cause people got me, got me questioning
Where is the love?

[Post-Chorus: will.i.am & Fergie]
(Love) Where is the love? (The love)
Where is the love? (The love)
Where is the love? (The love)
Where is the love?
(Love) Where is the love? (The love)
Where is the love? (The love)
Where is the love, the love, the love?

[Verse 3: apl.de.ap]
I feel the weight of the world on my shoulder
As I'm gettin' older, y'all people gets colder
Most of us only care about money-makin'
Selfishness got us followin' the wrong direction
Wrong information always shown by the media
Negative images is the main criteria
Infecting the young minds faster than bacteria
Kids wanna act like what they see in the cinema
Yo, whatever happened to the values of humanity? (Yeah)
Whatever happened to the fairness and equality? (Yeah)
Instead of spreading love, we spreading animosity (Yeah)
Lack of understanding leading us away from unity
That's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' under
That's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' down
It's no wonder why sometimes I'm feelin' under
Gotta keep my faith alive 'til love is found
Now ask yourself

[Post-Chorus: will.i.am]
Where is the love?
Where is the love?
Where is the love?
Where is the love?

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
Father, father, father, help us
Send some guidance from above
'Cause people got me, got me questioning
Where is the love?

[Outro: will.i.am & Justin Timberlake]
Now sing with me, y'all (One world, one world)
We only got (One world, one world)
That's all we got (One world, one world)
And something's wrong with it (Yeah)
Something's wrong with it (Yeah)
Something's wrong with the w-world, world, yeah
We only got (One world, one world)
That's all we got (One world, one world)

[Intro: Fergie]
I can't stand another night
Stand another night without you

[Chorus: Fergie]
Since you've been away
Everything don't seem like they used to be
Between you and me, cause I'm missing your
I'm missing your love
I'm missing your, I'm missing your love
I'm missing your love, I'm missing your love

[Verse 1: will.i.am & (Fergie)]
Yo, yo, yo
Everyday, everyday that you're gone, I'm singing that sad song
If loving you is wrong, then I must be wrong
Even when I'm gone (don't go away) our love is strong
(Don't go away) You the one I want (Don't go away)
You my num, you my num, you my number one
And yeah, our love ain't going out of fashion
I need to love your passion, the love is everlasting, lasting

[Chorus: Fergie]
Since you've been away
Everything don't seem like they used to be
Between you and me, cause I'm missing your
I'm missing your love
I'm missing your, I'm missing your love
I'm missing your love, I'm missing your love

[Verse 2: will.i.am & (Fergie)]
When I'm out, on the road (I'm missing you)
Rocking them shows (missing you) up in Monaco
(I'm missing you) Making dough
When it may seem plush (I'm missing you) and glamorous (Miss kissing you) But I miss your touch
(I'm missing you) Yeah, I miss your touch
I spend all my time (missing you) with you in mind
(Missing you) My mind's on you, cause all I am is missing you (I'm missing you, missing you!)
(I'm missing you! I'm missing you!)

[Chorus: Fergie]
Since you've been away
Everything don't seem like they used to be
Between you and me, cause I'm missing your
I'm missing your love
I'm missing your, I'm missing your love
I'm missing your love, I'm missing your love

[Verse 3: apl.de.ap]
Girl, I ain't never had nothing like this
When I'm all sprung, caught up like this
Maybe it's your face, girl, maybe it's your lips
Maybe it's the way you shake them hips
Baby, it's the way you do what you do
Got, got me all lovestruck on you
I be just like an umbrella the way I'm all over you
I know them other boys be calling you
But they just want a piece, I want all of you
Take my time just spoiling you
Cause I know I'm in love with you

[Bridge: Fergie]
Please, baby, don't go
I'm needing you now!

[Breakdown: Fergie]
I'm missing you oh, oh, oh
I'm missing you oh, oh, oh
I'm missing you oh, oh, oh
I'm missing you, missing you!
I'm missing you!
I'm missing you!

[Outro: will.i.am]
Hey! I miss your love, girl
I miss, I miss your love
I miss, I miss your love, Hey!
I miss your love, girl
I miss, I miss your love
I miss your love, girl
I miss, I miss your love

[Intro: Fergie]
Shut up, just shut up, shut up
Shut up, just shut up, shut up
Shut up, just shut up, shut up
Shut it up, just shut up, shut up
Shut up, just shut up, shut up
Shut up, just shut up, shut up (Oh no)
Shut up, just shut up, shut up
Shut it up, just shut up, shut up

[Chorus: Fergie]
We try to take it slow
But we're still losin' control
And we try to make it work
But it still ends up the worst and I'm crazy
For tryna be your lady
I think I'm goin' crazy

[Verse 1: will.i.am & Fergie, Both]
Girl, me and you were just fine, you know
We wined and dined, did them things
That couples do when in love, you know
Walks on the beach and stuff, you know
Things that lovers say and do
"I love you, boo", "I love you too"
"I miss you a lot", "I miss you even more"
That's why I flew you out when we was on tour
But then something got outta hand
You started yellin' why I would break plans (What did you say to me?)
Even though I had legitimate reasons (Bullshit)
You know I had to make them dividends (Bullshit)
How could you trust your private eyes, girl?
That's why you don't believe my lies and quick to say

[Chorus: Fergie & will.i.am, Both]
Shut up, just shut up, shut up
Shut it up, just shut up, shut up
We try to take it slow
But we're still losin' control
And we try to make it work
But it still ends up the worst and I'm crazy
For tryna be your lady
I think I'm goin' crazy (Why, why, why)

[Verse 2: Taboo & Kurtis Blow (& Fergie)]
Why does emotion gotta move so fast?
Love is progress if you could make it last
Why is it that you just lose control
Every time you agree on takin' it slow?
So why has it got to be so damn tough?
'Cause fools in lust could never get enough
Of love; showin' him the love that you be givin'
Changin' up your livin' for a lovin' transition (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Girl, it's a mission tryin' to get you to listen
Screamin' at each other has become our tradition
You yell, I yell, everybody yells
Got neighbors across the street sayin', "Who the hell?!"
Who the hell? What the hell's goin' down?
Too much of the bickering, kill it with the sound and

[Chorus: Fergie & will.i.am]
Shut up, just shut up, shut up
Shut it up, just shut up, shut up
We try to take it slow
But we're still losin' control
And we try to make it work
But it still ends up the worst and I'm crazy (For what?)
(Crazy for what?) For tryna be your lady (Oh yeah?)
I think I'm goin' crazy (Uh, uh), woah-oh

[Chorus: Fergie, will.i.am, Both]
Shut up, just shut up, shut up (What?)
Shut up, just shut up, shut up (Whatcha say?)
Shut up, just shut up, shut up (Say what?)
Shut it up, just shut up, shut up (Girl, whatcha say?)
Shut up, just shut up, shut up (Girl, whatcha say?)
Shut up, just shut up, shut up (No, girl)
Shut up, just shut up, shut up (Shut up, you shut up, shut up)
Shut it up, just shut up, shut up

[Bridge: will.i.am & Fergie]
Girl, our love is dyin'
Why did you stop tryin'?
I never been a quitta
But I do deserve betta
Believe me, I will do bad
Let's forget the past and start this new plan
Why? 'Cause it's the same old routine
And then next week I hear them scream
Girl, I know you're tired of the things they say
You're damn right
'Cause I heard them lame damn excuses just yesterday
That was a different thing
No, it ain't
That was a different thing
No, it ain't
That was a different thing
It was the same damn thing, same ass excuses
Boy, you're useless, woah, oh!

[Breakdown: Fergie & will.i.am]
Shut up, just shut up, shut up (Just stop)
Shut up, just shut up, shut up (Oh no) (Just stop)
Shut up, just shut up, shut up (Just stop)
Shut it up, just shut up, shut up (Just stop)
Shut up, just shut up, shut up (Stop all the talking)
(Don't go - no, please go - I don't know)
Shut up, just shut up, shut up (Stop all the talking)
Shut up, just shut up, shut up (Stop all the talking)
Shut it up, just shut up, shut up (Stop all the talking)

[Outro: will.i.am & Fergie]
Stop the talking, baby (Just stop)
Or I start walking, baby (Just stop)
Stop the talking, baby (Just stop) (Yeah, yeah)
Or I start walking, baby (Just stop)
Stop the talking, baby (Stop all the talking)

[Intro: Fergie]
Mmm
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Mmm

[Hook 1: will.i.am & Fergie]
You was foolin' me once before, but I tell ya
There's no foolin' me twice no more
Cos when I open up my third eye, my third eye
You can't get away with murder, murder (yeah)
You was foolin' me once before, but I tell ya
There's no foolin' me twice no more
Just stop your oppression, oppression
Check it out, I got a question, a question
If Bush is Pinnochio, Pinnochio
Who the hell is Geppetto, Geppetto
Beware of Geppetto

[Verse 1: will.i.am & Fergie]
'Cuz he got knives and clips
And a dagger that's shaped into a crucifix
And he'll stab your back with it
Give it to your brother as a necklace for Christmas
Welcome to the valley of the beast
Where they sing in harmony, but never speak no peace
Keepin' their eye on the feta, your cheddar
Things that ain't really for the better
I could point out their behaviour
To keep you immune from the poisonous flavor
But once you're caught, I can't save ya
They’ll manipulate your mind, so you enjoy danger
He can sell sand to Iran
Ice to an eskimo, water to a dam
And he is akin to Uncle Sam
The one that taught him how to scam

[Hook 2: will.i.am & Fergie]
He was fooling me once before but I tell you
There's no fooling me twice no more
Cause when I open up my third eye, my third eye
I get away with murder, with murder
Know what I'm saying

[Bridge 1: Fergie]
No, no, no, no, no, no
Can't fool me again
No, no, no, no, no
I'm into games you play
I know your game
No, no, no, no, no, no
Don't fall down again
No, no, no, no, no, no
Won't trip on games you play
I know your game

[Bridge 2: will.i.am & Fergie]
You can fool me once (no, no)
But you can't fool me two times (no, no)
Cause I got three eyes (yeah, yeah)
One up from the left side (yeah, yeah)
The other from the right side (yeah, yeah)
One eye on the inside (yeah, yeah)
And I can see you outside (no, no)
Plotting to come in

[Outro: will.i.am & Fergie]
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la (you can't fool me)
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la (you can't do me)
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la (you can't run through me)
Mmm (yeah)

[Outro: Fergie]
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la
Sometimes we need to change, to change, to change
Leave the past behind
Leave the past behind, mon chéri
Look into the future
Look ahead, that's right

[Intro: will.i.am]
Yeah, that's funky, funky
Yeah, that's funky, funky
Yeah, that's funky, funky

[Chorus: will.i.am & Fergie]
If it smells like funk, it must be us
The funk, funk, funk, fat stinky stanky stuff
If it smells like funk, it must be us
The funk, funk, funk, fat stinky stanky stuff
If it smells like funk, it must be us
The funk, funk, funk, fat stinky stanky stuff
If it smells like funk, it must be us
'Cause nobody's funky as us, 'cause we keep it stinky, stinky
We keep it stinky, stinky
We keep it stinky, stinky
We keep it stinky, stinky, stinky, stinky, stinky

[Post-Chorus: will.i.am]
The funk phenomenon, we funk you on and on
There's no need to hold your nose 'cause this funk stinks like a rose

[Verse 1: Taboo]
Big booty funk, toe jam funk
Underarm funk, like you headlocking a skunk
Reaking like diseased athlete's feet
The stench didn't come till after this beat
Smellin' like drawers, no weezin', no pause
Put your hands up on the speakers get smelly ass paws
You knew we was coming before we entered the door
'Cause you could smell the rhyme when we was walkin' down the hall
We bring the funk worse than a wet dog
Stinkin' like fat ladies shittin' out logs
We drop enough shit and keep them toilets clogged
Keep the people jumpin' like them bullfrogs
The first one who smelt, it ain't the one who dealt it
Black Eyed Peas keep the scent blind like delta
Funky like onions you fryin', sure is funky, girl, you ain't lyin'

[Chorus: will.i.am & Fergie]
If it smells like funk, it must be us
The funk, funk, funk, fat stinky stanky stuff
If it smells like funk, it must be us
The funk, funk, funk, fat stinky stanky stuff
If it smells like funk, it must be us
The funk, funk, funk, fat stinky stanky stuff
If it smells like funk, it must be us
'Cause nobody's funky as us, 'cause we keep it stinky, stinky
We keep it stinky, stinky
We keep it stinky, stinky
We keep it stinky, stinky, stinky, stinky, stinky

[Verse 2: will.i.am]
Y'all, you funking with the funk family
The non-fabricated factual faculty
We formulating up in a factory
Focusing on the energy of fluid flow free
We flawless, everything is for free
We flourish and we flaunt our flavor freshly, ha
Can you believe we flip the frequencies and
Freak MC's, they leave all frantically, but
Our intent is all to be friendly
But they fighting when we start the freestyling frenzy
I funk up your flat till your girlfriend beef
Filling all anatomy, bringing me flattery, ha
She'll be digging these rhymes, phat ease beats
Like cellulite lyrics, all flappy
We bring the funk to your festivities
If you think something stank, then it must be the Peas

[Chorus: will.i.am & Fergie]
If it smells like funk, it must be us
The funk, funk, funk, fat stinky stanky stuff
If it smells like funk, it must be us
The funk, funk, funk, fat stinky stanky stuff
If it smells like funk, it must be us
The funk, funk, funk, fat stinky stanky stuff
If it smells like funk, it must be us
'Cause nobody's funky as us, 'cause we keep it stinky, stinky
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la

[Verse 3: apl.de.ap]
Cellulite overweight stankin' MC's
Stench smells so strong it's insanitary
'Cause you can sense me a mile away so chanky
With the jungle funk sound from Seringhetti
Meaty, fat, nasty like Miss Fat Booty's tights
Gettin' dirty like mud fights and dirtbikes
Turning these drawers black that used to be white
And we shittin' on these tracks that you gonna need to wipe
The odors so contagious that it shows up in your dream
Man you could pick me out like food in between
Your two front teeth 'cause you be lacking the streets
We got beefy ass beats that we bumpin' in the streets
We salty, not sweet, like stank boxing feet
Sour underarm funk you ain't washed in a week
And man we be reakin' every day and weekend
We could all bounce to the funk and the season

[Chorus 2: will.i.am]
Bounce, bounce, bounce, hahahaha
Yeah, that's funky, yeah that's funky
If you smellin' somethin' funky then you know
It gotta be nobody other than Apl, Will and Taboo
'Cause you know that
If it smells like funk, it must be us
If you smellin' fat funk then it must be us
If you smellin' somethin' funky then you know
It gotta be nobody other than Apl, Will and Taboo
'Cause you know that
If it smells like funk, it must be us
If you smellin' elephants then it must be us
If you smellin' somethin' funky then you know
It gotta be nobody other than Apl, Will and Taboo
'Cause you know that
If it smells like funk, it must be us
If you smellin' elephant shit then it must be us

[Intro: apl.de.ap, (Fergie) & Both]

And runnin', runnin' and runnin', runnin' and runnin', runnin'
And runnin', runnin' and runnin', runnin, and runnin', runnin'
And

[Verse 1: will.i.am with Fergie]
In this context, there's no disrespect
So when I bust my rhyme, you break ya necks
We got five minutes for us to disconnect
From all intellect, collect the rhythm effect
To lose your inhibition follow your intuition
Free your inner soul and break away from tradition
'Cause when we be out, girlies pull they weave out
You wouldn't believe how, we wow shit out
Burn it 'til it's burned out, turn it 'til it's turned out
Act up from north, west, east, south

Lose control, of body and soul
Don't move too fast, people, just take it slow
Don't get ahead, just jump into it
Y'all hear about it, the Peas will do it
Get started, get stupid
Don't worry about it, people will walk you through it
Step by step like an infant new kid
Inch by inch with the new solution
Transmit hits with no delusion
The feeling's irresistible and that's how we movin'

At the gate, and Will bring the bugged out drill (Just)
Lose your mind, this is the time

Bob your head like me, apl.de
Up inside the club or in your Bentley
Get messy, loud and sick
Y'all mind pass normal on another head trip
So, come them now, do not correct it
Let's get ignant, let's get hectic

Welcome
Welcome to The E.N.D
Do not panic, there is nothing to fear
Everything around you is changing
Nothing stays the same
This version of myself is not permanent
Tomorrow, I will be different
The energy never dies
Energy cannot be destroyed, or created
It always is, and it always will be
This is the end, and the beginning..
Forever infinite
Welcome

So we could make plans for Thursday night
He said "We could go hit the Peapods"
I was like yeah, that's my favorite spot
Plus I like it there, cause I got love on the list
High powered juice where I don't even get frisked
Walk up in the place and get hugs from the misses
Pounds from my brothers cause they knowin' that this is
The place to be to let it all out
But when the weekend come, the weekend come
(Owww yeah) y'all could come
So go tell ya momma come and ya poppa come
Go to spin the record so we can get dumb
Place packed, capacity maximum
Due to my man Polo Promotion
And I can't wait to go out and hear some

Jumping music, swift DJ's
Smoke machines and laser rays
Look out weekend cause, here I come
Because weekends were, werrrre

[Verse 2: apl.de.ap]
Walked in the club at like 10 o'clock
And the spot is hot, blowin' up rooftops
This is Thursday night and the night is young
Four day weekend, time to have some fun
DJ's cut it up, drop them joints
Everybody's been waitin' to dance and make noise
B-boys, let me see you break it down
And ladies, let your hips move around
It's the sound of the B-E-P family
Got a poet named Life and a sister (Fergie)
And the blood of Abraham
So let's get ready for the jam

Jumping music, swift DJ's
Smoke machines and laser rays
Look out weekend cause, here I come

[Verse 1: will.i.am]
One tri... one tri...
One tribe, one time, one planet, one race
It's all one blood, don't care about your face
Color of your eye or the tone of your skin
Don't care where ya are, don't care where ya been
Cause where we gonna go is where we wanna be
The place where the native language is unity
And the continent is called Pangaea
And the main ideas are connected like a spear
No propaganda, they tried to upper hand us
Cause man I'm lovin this.. peace!
Ma-man I'm lovin this.. peace!
Ma-man I'm lovin this.. peace!
I don't need no leader that's gonna force feed a
Concept that make me think I need to
Fear my brother and fear my sister
And shoot my neighbor with my big missile
If I had an enemy (enemy)
If I had an enemy (enemy)
If I had an enemy, then my enemy
Is gonna try to come and kill me cause I'm his enemy
There's..

[Hook: will.i.am]
One tribe y'all
We one tribe y'all
We one tribe y'all
We are one people
Let's catch amnesia, forget about all that evil
Forget about all that evil, that evil that they feed ya
Let's catch amnesia, forget about all that evil
That evil that they feed ya, remember that we one people
We are one people
One people, one people, one people
One people, one people, one people
One people, one people, one people

[Verse 2: will.i.am (Fergie)]
One tribe, one tribe
One tribe, one time, one planet, one (race)
Race, one love, one people, one (and)
Too many things that's causing one (to)
To forget about the main cause
Connecting, uniting
But the evil is seeded and alive in.. us
So our weapons are colliding
And our peace is sinking like Poseidon
But, we know that the one (one)
The Evil One is threatened by the sum (sum)
So he come and try and separate the sum
But he dumb, he didn't know we had a way to overcome
Rejuvenating by the beating of the drum
Come together by the cipher of the hum
Freedom when all become one (one) forever

[Hook]
One tribe y'all
We one tribe y'all
We one tribe y'all
We are one people
Let's catch amnesia, forget about all that evil
Forget about all that evil, that evil that they feed ya
Let's catch amnesia, forget about all that evil
That evil that they feed ya, remember that we one people
We are one people
One people, one people, one people
One people, one people, one people
One people, one people, one people

[Verse 3: apl.de.ap]
One love, one blood, one people
One heart, one beat, we equal
Connected like the internet
United that's how we do
Let's break walls so we see through
Let love and peace, lead you
We could overcome the complication cause we need to
Help each other make these changes
Brother sister rearrange this
Way I'm thinkin that we can change this
Bad condition wait
Use you mind and not yo' greed
Let's connect and then proceed
This is something I believe
We are one we're all just people

[Hook]
One tribe y'all
We one tribe y'all

We are one people
One people, one people, one people
One people, one people, one people
One people, one people, one people
One people, one people, one people

[Outro: Taboo, wil.i.am]
Let's, let's catch amnesia, Lord help me out
Trying to figure out what it's all about (what it's all about)
Cause we're one in the same (one in the same)
Same joy, same pain
And I hope that you're there when I need ya
Cause maybe we need amnesia
And I don't wanna sound like a preacher
But we need to, be one
One world, one love, one passion
One tribe, one understanding
Cause you, and me, can be-come one

[Deep Voice]
There is no longer a physical record store
But we will continue to let the beat rock

[Album Interlude]
The most powerful force on the planet
Is the energy of the youth
One can stimulate the economy
But when this powerful youth becomes activated
And stimulated
And collectively decides not to buy things
What will happen to the economy?

[Intro: Fergie]
One plus one plus one equals three
One plus one equals two
One plus three equals four (one, four, one, four, one)

Thought love was the reason we was here fo'
Turn around and you givin me an earful

And stop blowin me up on my phone yo
And you know I'm not stressin one bit yo

You keep blowin me up, keep blowin me up

God damn why it so many issues?
Ease up baby, ease up baby, cause

Love ain't technological like AutoBot, AutoBot
Love ain't robotic like AutoBot, AutoBot
Love ain't complicated like arithmetic, 'rithmetic

Love is elementary like one-two-three, one-two-three
Love is really simple just like A-B-C, A-B-C
Love ain't technological
Love ain't technological (technological)
Love ain't robotic like AutoBot, AutoBot

[Chorus: Fergie]
Tell me where ya wanna go

Maybe you could fall for me

Take private planes to Saint Tropez
And Wonderlands like Alice
We'll travel to the stars

So grab upon this penis
Make my Milky Way go Mars
So baby come with me
Explore these galaxies
I'll show you that I love you
Cause girl you the one for me, yeah

[Intro: Fergie]
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oahhhahhh
Shut up, just shut up, shut up
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-AHHH-oah-oahhhahh

[Chorus: Fergie]
We try to take it slow
But we're still losin control
And we try to make it work
But it still ends up the worst
And I'm crazy... (crazy...)
For tryin to be your lady...

[Verse 1: will.i.am & Fergie]
Girl me and you were just fine, y'know
We wined and dined, did them things
That couples do when in love, y'know
Walks on the beach and stuff, y'know
Things that lovers say and do
I love you boo (I love you too)
I miss you a lot (I miss you even more)
That's why I flew you out when we was on tour
But some things just get out of hand
When you start screamin for no reason
Just because I'm up in the club with my friends
Have a little trust and believe in your man
And just because I look at a girl don't mean nuttin
And just cause we talk don't mean that we...
Word, so just shut up, shut up
Shut it up, just shut up, shut up

[Chorus: Fergie & Taboo]
We try to take it slow
But we're still losin control
And we try to make it work
But it still ends up the worst
And I'm crazy... (crazy...)
For tryin to be your lady... (why, why, why?)

[Verse 2: Taboo]
Why does emotion gotta move so fast?
Love is progress if you can make it last
Why is it that you just lose control
Every time you agree on takin' it slow?
Why does it have to be so damn tough?
Cause fools in lust could never get enough
Of love, showin the love that you be givin
Changin up your livin for a lovin transistion
Girl, it's a mission tryin to get you to listen
Screamin' at each other has become our tradition
You yell, I yell, everybody yells
Got neighbors across the street sayin "Who the hell?!"
Who the hell? What the hell's goin down?
Too much of the bickerin', kill it with the sound and

[Chorus: Fergie]
We try to take it slow
But we're still losin control
And we try to make it work
But it still ends up the worst
And I'm crazy... (crazy...)
For tryin to be your lady...

[Bridge 1: will.i.am & Fergie]
Don't even talk, to me
Don't even speak, to me
Cause if you keep talkin', I'mma start walkin'
And you don't wanna see me leave
Well if you'd start leavin', I'mma stop believin'
You ain't really in love with me

[Interlude: will.i.am]
Girl our love is dyin'
Girl our love is dyin'
Girl our love is dyin'
Girl our love is dyin', why did you stop tryin'?
Girl our love is dyin'
Girl our love is dyin'
Girl our love is dyin'
Girl our love is dyin', why did you stop tryin'?

[Bridge 2: Fergie]
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oahhhahhh
Shut up, just shut up, shut up
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-AHHH-oah-oahhhahh
Shut up, just shut up, shut up

[Verse 3: apl.de.ap & Fergie]
Love is full of emotion and games
A thin line between good bad and insane
People goes through this just to obtain
A perfect relationship and maintain
But sometimes things just get out of hand
We all make mistakes, ain't no perfect hu-man
Starts from a little lie on top of the other
Makin up excuses to tie your loose ends
Then you wonder why things ain't never the same
Then you try to re-erase, but it's just too late to chase
Like chasin' a wonderful scene while I'm dreamin'
But when I wake up ain't nothin' but screamin'
Yellin', fightin', throwin' things at each other
Situations like this make me just wanna tell you to
Shut up, just shut up, shut up
Shut up, just shut up, shut up

[Chorus: Fergie]
We try to take it slow
But we're still losin control
And we try to make it work
But it still ends up the worst
And I'm crazy... (crazy...)
For tryin to be your lady...

By the mind state affairs, classified to make y'all
Heat up and flare, I swear

Feelin a piece of mind, let your spine unwind
Maybe in time we can stop this crime

Orbiting in Earth, and outer space

When the music hits you
You'll feel no pain except for pleasure
We put it on you, we from
California la la-la-la-la
Los Angeles natives creating
Things that take you higher
Elevate you past the stars
Infiltrating clubs and bars
End this now and act a fool
If your loss is what to do
Bounce, shake, wiggle and break
Let yourself go, open up the gates
And proceed the stampede
Ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya

[Chorus: will.i.am & Fergie, Both]
Start it up and load it (load it)
We about to unfold it (-fold it)
Bring that dynamite, baby, 'cause tonight
We're about to explode it
Get moving, moving
Get your body grooving

[Post-Chorus: will.i.am]
Do what you want (yeah)
Do what you want (yeah)

[Verse 2: Fergie]
Hey yo, it's me F-E-R-G-I-E
That's Fergie baby
In the place to be with BEP
We keep it locked and sturdy
We always rocking never stopping
No, la-la-la la-la-la la
We keep it constant shocking
Often from Boston to Austin

[Verse 3: Taboo]
It's T-to-the-A, B-double-O
Tab magnetic, rocking this show
Taking over beat when sees frequent
On the radio, it's the delinquent
Cause Tab be nimble, Tab be quick
Watch the girls fall in love with Taboo's stick
I watch it like that, and I watch it like this
You can't catch it and it's something that you can't miss

[Chorus: will.i.am & Fergie, Both]
Start it up and load it (load it)
We about to unfold it (-fold it)
Bring that dynamite, baby, 'cause tonight

[Verse 4: apl.de.ap]
Mayday, no delay, deliver the rhyme
Express rate, next day, get to you on time
Make way for the mash out when we roll out
My crew, we don't fall out, we just pass out
(Wake up!) time to get moving
Time to get the body live, body live moving
Party powerful flows, the way we rocking them show
The way we spittin' the rhymes and break it on down to the floor
Break, bounce, boogie and wiggle it
Do it, now, time to get into it
Break, bounce, do what you feel
Do what you want and let it all out

[Bridge 2: will.i.am]
Oh, just do what you want today...
'Cause it's OK...
To leave responsibilities...
Sometimes...

[Chorus: will.i.am & Fergie, Both]
Start it up and load it (load it)
We about to unfold it (-fold it)
Bring that dynamite, baby, 'cause tonight
We're about to explode it
Get moving, moving

[Outro: will.i.am]
Beat ignorance
Beat ignorance

[Intro: will.i.am & Fergie]
Yeah, uh-uh
La, da, da, da, da-da
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry

[Verse 1: will.i.am]
Hey baby, my nose is gettin' big
I noticed it be growin' when I be tellin' them fibs, now
You say your trust's gettin' weaker
Probably 'cause my lies just started gettin' deeper
And the reason for my confession is that I learned my lesson
And I really think you ought to know the truth
Because I lied and I cheated and I lied a little more
But after I did it, I don't know what I did it for
I admit that I've been a little immature
With your heart like I was the predator
In my book of lies, I was the editor
And the author, I forged my signature
And now I apologize for what I did to ya
'Cause what you did to me I did to you

[Chorus: Fergie]
No, no, no, no, baby, no, no, no, no, don't lie
'Cause you know, know, know, know
Yeah, you know, know, know, know, you gotta try
What you gonna do when it all comes out
When I really see you, what you're all about?
No, no, no, no, baby, no, no, no, no, don't lie
'Cause you know, you know, you know, you know
You know you gotta try (Stop, st-stop, stop, st-stop stop lying)

[Verse 2: apl.de.ap]
She said, "I'm leaving"
'Cause she can't take the pain
It's hard to continue this love, it ain't the same
Can't forget the things that I've done inside her brain
Too many lies committed, too many games
She feelin' like a fool gettin' on the last train
Tryna maintain, but the feeling won't change
I'm sorry for the things that I've done and what I became
Caught up in living my life in the fast lane
Blinded by lights, cameras, you know the fame
I don't know the reason why I did these things

[Pre-Chorus 1: apl.de.ap, Fergie, will.i.am]
Oh, and I lie and I lie and I lie and I lie
And now our emotions are drained
'Cause I lie and I lie and a little lie, lie
And now your emotions are drained

[Chorus: Fergie]
No, no, no, no, baby, no, no, no, no, don't lie (Don't, don't you lie)
'Cause you know, know, know, know
Yeah, you know, know, know, know, you gotta try (Got to, got to try)
What you gonna do when it all comes out (What you gonna do, baby?)
When I really see you, what you're all about?
No, no, no, no, baby, no, no, no, no, don't lie
Because you know, you know, you know, you know
You know you gotta try

[Bridge: will.i.am & Fergie]
Ooh-ooh ooh ooh, ooh-ooh ooh
Ooh-ooh ooh ooh, ooh-ooh ooh
Ooh-ooh ooh ooh, ooh-ooh ooh
Ooh-ooh ooh ooh, ooh-ooh ooh
Ooh-ooh ooh ooh, ooh-ooh ooh (Ba da, ba da, ba ba ba ba)

Ooh-ooh ooh ooh, ooh-ooh ooh (Ba da, ba da, ba ba ba ba)
Ooh-ooh ooh ooh, ooh-ooh ooh (Ba da da, ba da da, ba da da, ba da da)

[Verse 3: Taboo]
Hmm, yo, I'm lyin' to my girl
Even though I love her and she all in my world
I give her all my attention and diamonds and pearls
She the one that make me feel on top of the world
Still I'm lyin' to my girl, I do it

[Pre-Chorus 2: Fergie & Taboo, Both]
Oh, and I lie and I lie and I lie and then I lie
'Til there's not turning back
I don't know why I lie and I lie
'Til I don't know who I am
But then I tell myself

[Chorus: Fergie]
No, no, no, no, baby, no, no, no, no, don't lie (Don't you lie)
'Cause you know, know, know, know
Yeah, you know, know, know, know, you gotta try (You know, you know you gotta)
What you gonna do when it all comes out
When I really see you, what you're all about?
No, no, no, no, baby, no, no, no, no, don't lie
No, no, no, no, baby, no, no, no, no
(Stop, st-stop, stop, st-stop stop lying)

Dum diddley dum - so dance to the drum

[Bridge]
Sim sim sim, blum blum blum
The Black Eyed Peas begun with action
Repeating rhy-rhythm in satisfaction
No need for asking, that's what's happening
The blip blip blip, the blah blah blau
You didn't know me then and you'll never know me now
I'm the Apl.De.Ap, the Filipino Ap
If you need to know my style, yeah let me show you how

[Verse 1: will.i.am]
Johnny wanna be a big star
Get on stage and play the guitar
Make a little money, buy a fancy car
Big old house and an alligator
Just to match with them alligator shoes
He's a rich man so he's no longer singing the blues
He's singing songs about material things
And platinum rings and watches that go bling
But, diamonds don't bling in the dark
He a star now, but he ain't singing it from the heart
Sooner or later, it's just gonna fall apart
'Cause his fans can't relate to his new found art
He ain't doin' what he did from the start
And that's putting in some feeling and thought
He decided to live his life shallow
Cash in his love for material
And it's gone

[Chorus: Jack Johnson]
Gone going
Gone, everything gone, give a damn
Gone be the birds when they don't wanna sing
Gone people
Aw-awkward with their things, gone

[Verse 2: will.i.am]
You see yourself in the mirror, and ya
Feel safe 'cause it's looks familiar, but 'cha
Afraid to open up your soul, cause ya
Don't really know, don't really know who is (Who is)
The person that's deep within
'Cause you content with just being the name brand man
And you fail to see that it's trivial
Insignificant, you addicted to material
I seen your kind before
You the type that think souls is sold in the store
Packaged up with incense sticks
With the vegetarian meals, to you that's righteous
You're fiction like books
Need to go out to life and look
'Cause, uh, what happens when they take your material
And you already sold your soul
And it's...

[Chorus: Jack Johnson]
Gone going
Gone, everything gone, give a damn
Gone be the birds when they don't wanna sing
Gone people
Aw-awkward with their things, gone

[Verse 3: will.i.am]
They say that "Time is money and money is time"
So you gotcha mind in your money and your money on your mind
But what about
That crime you did to get paid
And what about
That bid you can't take it to your grave
Tell me about it

[Bridge: Jack Johnson]
What about those shoes you in today?
They'll do no good
On the bridges you walk along the way

[Verse 4: will.i.am]
All that money chu got
Gon' be gone
That ear that chu rock
Gon' be gone
That house upon that hill
Gon' be gone
The gold burns on your grill
Gon' be gone
The ice on your wrist
Gon' be gone
That nice little Miss
Gon' be gone
That whip that chu roll
Gon' be gone
What's worse is your soul already gone
Yeah, it's gone

[Chorus: Jack Johnson]
Gone going
Gone, everything gone, give a damn
Gone be the birds when they don't wanna sing
Gone people
Aw-awkward with their things, gone
Gone
Gone

[Hook]
(One for all, one for all)
(It's all it's all for one)
Let's start a union, calling every human
It's one for all and all for one
Let's live in unison, calling every citizen
It's one for all and all for one

[Verse 1]
We don't want war- can't take no more
It's drastic time for sure
We need an antidote and a cure
Cause do you really think Muhammad got a problem with Jehovah
We don't want war imagine if any prophet was alive
In current days amongst you and I
You think they'd view life like you and I do
Or would they sit and contemplate on why
Do we live this way, act and behave this way
We still live in primitive today
Cause the peace in the destination of war can't be the way
There's no way, so people just be a woman, be a man
Realize that you can change the world by changing yourself
And understand that we're all just the same
So when I count to three let's change

[Hook]
(One for all, one for all)
(It's all it's all for one)
Let's start a union, calling every human
It's one for all and all for one
Let's live in unison, calling every citizen
It's one for all and all for one

[Verse 2]
Got no time for grand philosophy
I barely keep my head above the tide
I got this mortgage, got three kids at school
What you're saying is the truth, but really troubles me inside
I'd change the world if I could change my mind
If I could live beyond my fears
Exchanging unity for all my insecurity
Exchanging laughter for my tears

[Hook]
(One for all, one for all)
(It's all it's all for one)
Let's start a union, calling every human
It's one for all and all for one
Let's live in unison, calling every citizen
It's one for all and all for one

[Verse 3]
I don't know, y'all, we in a real deposition
In the midst of all this negative condition
Divided by beliefs, differences and religion
Why do we keep missing the point in our mission?
Why do we keep killing each other, what's the reason?
God made us all equal in his vision
I wish that I could make music as a religion
Then we could harmonise together in this mission
Listen, I know it's really hard to make changes
But two of us could help rearrange this curse
Utilising all the power in our voices
Together we will unite and make the right choice
And fight for education, save the next generation
Come together as one
I don't understand why it's never been done
So let's change on the count of one

[Bridge]
It takes one, just one
And then one follows the other one
And then another follows the other one
Next thing you know you got a billion
People doing some wonderful things
People doing some powerful things
Let's change and do some powerful things
Unity could be a wonderful thing

[Hook]
(One for all, one for all)
(It's all it's all for one)
(One for all, one for all)
(It's all it's all for one)
Let's start a union, calling every human
It's one for all and all for one
Let's live in unison, calling every citizen
It's one for all and all for one

[Intro: James Brown]
They don't want music, they don't know how to use it
All they want is (a boom, boom, boom, boom)

[Verse 1: will.i.am, apl.de.ap]
Hey y'all, John Coltrane yeah he plays the sax
Me, myself I love to max
Up in the studio laying tracks
Burn it on the CD, melt the wax (Spinnin' it)
And now I'm feeling fine
Cause daily music's on my mind
And I feel mellow
When I watch the girl play the cello
Hello to all my fellow peers in here for the quality
Music quality, yeah
That'll be the focus in the top pick of the day
So pass the peas like we used to say
Pass the beats like they used to say
Pass the phunk like they used to say
That's my joint like we used to say
Syncopation the true school way

[Pre-Chorus: Fergie]
Don't know what you came to do
I came to drop the phunk on you
Depends on that sonic sound
But you know what?

[Chorus: James Brown & will.iam]
They don't want music
They don't want music
They just want (a boom, boom, boom boom boom)
They just want (a boom, boom, boom boom boom)
They don't want music, they don't know how to use it
They don't want music
They don't want music
They don't want music, they don't know how to use it
The good back horn
They don't want music, they don't know how to use it
All they want is (a boom, boom, boom, boom, boom boom boom)

[Verse 2: will.i.am, apl.de.ap]
Oo, lala aw wee wee
Nowadays music is all about fee
The soul is caged no bits now free
Unless the rhyme was rocked by me
I got the balls to bang (baw ba-ba-baw, ba-ba-baw, ba-baw bang)
Yeah, steady, just doing my thang (steady, just steady, just doing my own thang)
I just do it (ha!)
I just do it you know
My momma said to do what you know
So I'ma do what I know
James Brown gave me the fluid
That means a baby could do it
The Peas will do it so
Do it, do it, do it
Get up on the stage and release my fluid
Do my thing, do it through the music
Phunkafied and therapeutic

[Pre-Chorus: Fergie]
Don't know what you came to do
I came to drop the phunk on you
Depends on that sonic sound
But you know what?

[Chorus: James Brown & will.iam]
They don't want music
They don't want music
They just want (a boom, boom, boom boom boom)
They just want (a boom, boom, boom boom boom)
They don't want music, they don't know how to use it
They don't want music
They don't want music
They don't want music, they don't know how to use it
The good back horn
They don't want music, they don't know how to use it
All they want is (a boom, boom, boom, boom, boom boom boom)

[Bridge 1: James Brown & The Black Eyed Peas]
Wait a minute!

You got to dance with the phunk (if you wanna be sweet and fine)

You've got to shake with the phunk (if you wanna have a good time)
Shaking shaking shaking with the phunk (if you wanna have a good time)

Dance everybody move your body through the music

You've got to dance through the music
People doing what you're doing
People grooving with the music
You've got to roll with the phunk

[Outro: James Brown & The Black Eyed Peas]
Roll with your phunk (if you're wanna have a good time)
R-O-double-L keep rolling with the phunk (if you're wanna have a good time)
And roll! To a phunky place

Cuz I be like the lyric and she be the beat
The kind of beat that make me freestyle to it
Make me rock rhymes to it make me dance all through it
Yea, and I be doin it right
Time that I love her down's like every night
Everything about her is why she the one

Lifted me up like Killian
Cupid stuck my heart like we just begun so

Baby yaaa, you and me gon be together most definitely
Always, be with you for the rest of my days
My love for you is infinite you're all I ever wanted

[Chorus sung in foreign language (french?)]
Every breath of yours is my life
You're my life
My girl's like way past another one's
Ain't really no such thing as a better one
She takin me to limits like way beyond
Got me tappin on that ass like a Savion
Cuz she all fine and stuff
Make a brother like me lose my mind and stuff
Yo, me and my girl stand tough
The hell with conserving cuz I can't get enough
Matter of fact, to hell with your friends too
They don't really understand the things that we've been through
I know we tussle but my love I'ma send you
Your friends can't wait til me and you is through but
You better tell em we ain't breakin up
The best thing about fightin is makin up
And my love for you is infinite
You're all I ever wanted in a girl, are you it?

Sex on the net, got my girl in the mood
And you know our connection is long overdue

[Refrain: Fergie & will.i.am]
Cause I got my needs and I need them right now
And I ain't too proud to show it
See I've been on the road with my fuckin' hormones

You know I love to love you, love you permanently, permanently
You got me feigning for your love, you got me yearning, yearning
You turn me on and turn me off, so keep on turning, turning
Till my turn you know that I'll be learning, learning
New love tricks to make you go (ooh)
My magic stick can make you go (ooh)
I love you from the bottom to the top and make you go (oh)

[Pre-Chorus: will.i.am]
If you want some loving send a request
I'ma send it over to you next day, U.P.S

Knocking on your door, you know what the business for

When I leave you be like 'give me more', but remember
W-I-double-L spells pleasure

Wiggle them hips and do-cee-do

Of course I'm dedicated to the city of L.A
I open up a circle and rock it in the Bay
Take it down to London and rock the same way
Down under to Perth then back to Sydney
We rock the Earth cos we don't play
We do it like this the Black Eyed Pea way
Do as we do, do what we say-say
Get on the floor and shake your thang-thang
Do that, do that, do that, do that (ah)
Do that, do that, do that, do that (ah)
Do that, do that, do that, do that (ah)
Do that, do that, do that, do that (ah)

Y'all lookin' for a festival I know the spot
Come across the bridge over here to where it's hot

You have the bobs a lot, bombience is infinite
Baby doll no need to front, we the exquisite
We could be your favorite, yeah you could come brassiere
What you aah-bout to witness ain't no kind of fear
It's immaculate, look at what we're comin' with
Yeah I tease you when I hit you with them tidbits
But you tease me when you be wearing them outifts
Every angle of it IS so perfect

Apl.de.ap on the mic, let me set it right
Take you on a ride flight to the other side
One point to the other we providin' ya
You could cross the same bridge if ya wanted ta
Sometimes gotta take time to do
New things can be trapped outta move
Do what you wanna do, who to tell you not to
You wanna make jams go ahead I got you
Don't be afraid no matter who you are
No matter who you be, you're a star

[Chorus: will.i.am & Esthero]
Every little thing we do's like magic
Anything we do will not go wrong

(Everywhere we go) We motivate, (everywhere we go) and we captivate
{WE ROLL} Here, {WE GO} there, {WE GO} here, {WE GO}
Everywhere, every everywhere
Black Eyed Peas is like the hip-hop Fred Astaire
Spread it out from over there to over here
Descendent of the all makin' all a y'all aware that

Ill embrace them like it was one of my own
Plus she raised em all alone, that I condone
But, all, this lonliness need to stop, I love ya down and put that hip into ya hop...

[Chorus]

Hey baby girl I want your loving every day
Cuz you be hittin in a special type of way
I guess your aura got me actin for the push
It ain't the lust I got the apl on the rush
And when you smile at me you got me goin cra-zay
You got me up on sugar inside my soul
Ill be the cup that you could pour in all your love
I won't spill it in a minute that you shove
Instead I will withstand the pain
Understand you is the main goal to aim
If you really need me just call my name
I'm hear all the time for you babe-ay

Bridge:
I'm your love you my woman I'm your man right?
I'm your world you my woman I'm your man right?
No matter the problem we stay damn tight
I'm your love you my woman I'm your man right?

[Chorus] (repeating)

[bridge]

[taboo]
And if I could i'd give my girl the world, world
A world without a war could ?unfural?, ?fural?
Our love could stand the testament of time, time
Till death do us part is that line
I could be with her till my son is 99
The love I feel for her is unbearably unique
Being away from her, yo it makes me kinda weak
Its like being on the desert with nothin to drink

[Verse 1]
Goodbye my love
The country is in need of me
And I heard there were signs for war
So I'm going overseas
So don't cry my love
The skies above will cry for you
And I'll be safe so hopefully
I'll come back home for you
Yeah, yeah

[Hook]
So please
Tell me it's not true
After all the love I've given
You found someone new
And oh, of all the things I've seen
This has got to be, got to be the greatest tragedy
Oh you, you let it all slip away
But soon you'll find
Soon you'll find (yeah)
What you can't replace

[Verse 2]
I gave away my love
That I promised you I would keep
A thousand deaths I died that day
When two became one
A greater force pulled you away
So I got on my knees and begged
The silence replaced my tears
So goodbye, my love
August 1, 1965
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah

[Hook]
So please
Tell me it's not true
After all the love I've given
You found someone new

But soon you'll find
Soon you'll find, yeah
What you can't replace
Yeah

Hey, hey, do you wanna be famous?
Everywhere ya go, people know what ya name is
Everyone ya know, tryin' to tell ya, ya changin'
They wanna taste that (fame), that (fame), that (fame), that (fame), that (fame)

[Verse 1]
Famous, everybody wanna be famous
Most people wanna just taste it
Other people try to just sneak in the VIP and chill with the big faces
That don't really see them changes, when the fame hit
When I'm up on the stage they sing it but soon as I step off they hate it
And I'm sayin', I really ain't with that complainin'
Just look at the picture I'm paintin'
Yeah I pay my rent, vacation then
Take trips all around the equator then
Come back to the A, hit the stage again
Then I go up in the booth, where they cage me in
Feel regular but then I go insane again (fame)
If you witness the condition that my brain is in
You will see I'm in Hell where Satan is
Hardest thing to do is to maintain a friend
'Cause everybody tryin' to get paid from it
But fuck it, this the entertainment bus', so let the games begin
I mean let the flames begin
But hey, I'm just trained at this
Lie to everybody, then get paid from it, I'm famous

[Hook]
Hey, hey, do you wanna be famous?
Everywhere ya go, people know what ya name is

They wanna taste that (fame), that (fame), that (fame), that (fame), that (fame)

[Verse 2]
Popular, everybody wanna be popular
Little kids just be watchin' us, through binoculars
And then they go to school and copy us
But hey, I'm not knockin' ya but how can y'all not see it's obvious
'Cause, cops just be plottin' on us and paparazzi be spottin' us
Plus, everybody just wanna be, on MTV or BET
Or, maybe season MVP or maybe even just Prom King or Queen
But, everybody can't be a G-O to the D
And everybody can't be O to the B
But I don't know, maybe this is just how we supposed to be
But this is what'll happen to y'all
You can go crazy and beat up trucks
The tabloids sayin' that ya hooked on drugs
You cuttin' up your face, then sew it back up
But look, it's plain to see, ain't nothin' in this game gonna be changin' me
I'm a always be, O to the B, me, me, I'm famous

[Hook: B.o.B]
Hey, hey, do you wanna be famous?
Everywhere ya go, people know what ya name is
Everyone ya know, tryin' to tell ya, ya changin'
They wanna taste that (fame, fame, fame, fame, fame)

[Bridge]
Everywhere ya go they just wanna be stars
Everyone ya know wanna drive fancy cars
Everyone ya know wants you to buy out the bar
They wanna taste that (fame), that (fame), that (fame), that (fame), that (fame)
Everywhere we go, everywhere we go now
Everywhere we go, everywhere we go now

[Hook]
Hey, hey, do you wanna be famous?

No I don't need no lingo
Cause I'm on this mic I chicka-pow-pow chicka-pow-pow to the beat though
Yeah shoot it up like a free throw
Where?
From the west to the east coast
Like Ne-yo in a pea coat
Motherfuck like Danny DeVito
Lemme get a second just to reload
Cause I'm cool in the pocket like Tebow (yes!)
Cooler than the cheetahs on the Cheetos
Don't think that I lost my touch by much
I just been chillin' at the bank like aye!
Show me to the safe
Had to get my papers straight
Now I'm okay
Now it's back to the lab, yes back to the basics
So don't think that I ain't sick
That I'm in places you can't get
When you're inside of the matrix
High is my vibration
High like levitation
High like every race in

I see ya (yeah yeah, yeah, yeah yeah yeah, yeah)(I see ya)
I see ya (I see ya)

[Verse 2]
Hold up, hold up, hold up
It's Bobby Ray
I mean my name B.o.B
When I'm on this mic I melt that fire
That's my job
I am a bomb
Try if ya want
Tick me off and I'm likely to (boom)
So I wouldn't do that
I'd would sit back
Unless you got tricks, inside of a hat
Then I would eat
Still wouldn't defeat
The fact that I'm insane, yes literally
I spit on the beat
I shit on the beat
Then I wipe with an MC
Throw them in the trash
B.o.B stop
Wait a minute maybe just switch up the flow
I was on a whole different level but now I'm ready to level
With a hellfire venomous flow
Here's the thing
Clearly
I'm in a place you can't really be
I'm in a space
Called a zone
And when you inside you just kinda know
And you don't stop
Cause you just float
And if you will then I know you don't
And if you not then you go for broke
But this a jungle let me go for those
I see ya

[Hook]
I see ya, yeahyeah, yeah, yeahyeahyeah, yeah (I see ya)
I see ya, yeahyeah, yeah, yeahyeahyeah, yeah (I see ya)
I see ya, yeahyeah, yeah, yeahyeahyeah, yeah (I see ya)
I see ya (I see ya)
I see ya, yeahyeah, yeah, yeahyeahyeah, yeah (I see ya)
I see ya, yeahyeah, yeah, yeahyeahyeah, yeah (I see ya)
I see ya, yeahyeah, yeah, yeahyeahyeah, yeah (I see ya)
I see ya (I see ya)

[Outro]
I spit on the beat, I shit on the beat, then I wipe with an MC

[Chorus]
Tell me, where am I supposed to go?
And who am I supposed to believe?
If only you knew what I knew
Then you could see just what I see
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

[Hook]
So I grab my bags and go
As far away as I can go
'Cause everything ain't what I used to know
And I try to hide
But I just can't hide no more
There's nothin' worse than feelin' like a ghost

[Verse 1]
You say I look fine
If only you knew what was on my mind
You'd see a whole different side
I couldn't show you even if I tried
I must have got lost in time
When I found out I was solely free to be
Wherever I want to be
Some say I'm out of sight
How ironic that we're all so blind
If you could open up your eyes
You could see what I couldn't describe
And then, you'd see the signs
And then your soul would be set free
And then you'd be released

[Hook]
So I grab my bags and go
As far away as I can go
'Cause everything ain't what I used to know
And I try to hide
But I just can't hide no more
There's nothin' worse than feelin' like a ghost

[Chorus]
Tell me, where am I supposed to go?
And who am I supposed to believe?
If only you knew what I knew
Then you could see, hey, yeah

[Hook]
So I grab my bags and go (I go)
As far away as I can go (which way to go?)
'Cause everything ain't what I used to know
(It ain't what I used to know)
And I try to hide (Hide, hide)
But I just can't hide no more (No, no, no)
There's nothin' worse than feelin' like a ghost
(There's nothin' worse)

[Hook]
And I'm terrified (Terrified)
Like I've seen a UFO (A UFO)
'Cause everything ain't what I used to know
(It ain't what I used to know)
And I try to hide (I try to hide)
But I just can't hide no more (No, no, no)
There's nothin' worse than feelin' like a ghost

[Breakdown]
I go
A UFO
And I'm so tired, tired of hiding
I've been running, I've been trying
To get away
To get away

[Outro]
So I grab my bags and go
As far away as I can go
'Cause everything ain't what I used to know
And I try to hide
But I just can't hide no more
There's nothin' worse than feelin' like a ghost

[Verse 1]
Maybe one day we can go
Hand in hand down a golden road
And if I get there before you go
I'll be waiting at the do'
In the future, hopefully
We'll be together, you and me

[Refrain]
Don't you worry, baby, please
'Cause honestly

[Chorus]
If I could rewind
Both the hands of time
Still I would never find
A lovelier design than you

[Hook]
Nothing's lovelier than you
Nothing's lovelier than you
Nothing's lovelier than you
Nothing's lovelier than you

[Verse 2]
Maybe one day, girl, I pray
We could float off to space
Hold my hand I'll lead the way
I won't let go or fall astray
Ain't no 'ifs', 'butts' and 'maybes'
You're my baby, my lady

[Refrain]
Don't you worry, baby, please
'Cause honestly

[Chorus]
If I could rewind
Both the hands of time
Still I would never find
A lovelier design than you

[Verse 3]
I'm dangerously, dangerously, dangerously in love
I love her more than I love myself but still that ain't enough, hmm
If this a dream I don't wanna wake up
We go together like the tub and the shower head above, huh
Not even thousands and thousands of miles
Could amount to my love, I'd have countless sky miles
I'd climb up a mountain, climb right back down
I'd run across the world then jog back around
A noun and a verb is just a sound, and a word is not profound
Enough to show my urge, for her smile
I'd shout on a curb with a loud speaker
Till the entire town heard how I felt, and I'm out

[Hook]
Nothing's lovelier than you
Nothing's lovelier than you
Nothing's lovelier than you
Nothing's lovelier than you

[Verse 1]
Maybe one day we can go
Hand in hand down a golden road
And if I get there before you go
I'll be waiting at the do'
In the future, hopefully
We'll be together, you and me

[Refrain]
Don't you worry, baby, please
'Cause honestly

[Chorus]
If I could rewind
Both the hands of time
Still I would never find
A lovelier design than you

Systems go
Satellite, satellite
Minus 10
Twilight, twilight

[Verse One]
I feel the moon
Pulling me away
Into the blue
Of the midnight sky
If you can do
What I can do
Things stay in tune
And just feel the vibe

[Hook]
So can we get a systems go?
And blast off like a satellite, satellite
Launchin' in minus 10 (T minus 10)
Headed straight to the twilight, twilight
So can we get a systems go?
And blast off like a satellite, satellite
Launchin' in minus 10 (T minus 10)
Headed straight for the twilight, twilight

[Verse Two]
Well as I'm headed to the sky way up above me
I feel my body spinnin', feelin' free and lovely
I am the rumblin' sea so come with me
On this midnight vibe
And you can feel it if you tune into your radio
Look at the sky look at the moon look at the way it glow
I ain't no ghost so don't be afraid to go on this midnight vibe

[Hook]
So can we get a systems go?
And blast off like a satellite, satellite
Launchin' in minus 10 (T minus 10)
Headed straight to the twilight, twilight
So can we get a systems go?
And blast off like a satellite, satellite
Launchin' in minus 10 (T minus 10)
Headed straight for the twilight, twilight

[Verse Three]
Like an astronaut floatin' off into the beyond
Enterin' into dimensions no one has ever yet seen before
I do not need an engine I can ascend into the dark
Remember a dream is never a dream is never a dream y'all

Is never a dream y'all 

[x3]
Midnight vibe

[Hook]
So can we get a systems go?
And blast off like a satellite, satellite
Launchin' in minus 10 (T minus 10)

Midnight Vibe
(Over and out)
Ahhh, man look
Check it out
I step into the place like so
Feelin' real calm cool collected and composed
She lookin' like "Nigga, whatcha here fo'?"
I'm like, "Don't be actin' like I don't be givin that doe."
That thing that you need
That thing that you know
If we was at sea I would not be a boat
Cause I would go deep

Yes down deeper low
Right next to the P like L M N O
There is no expression
No word or phrase I know
That would accurately describe
The way I feel the most
'Bout them curve and the thighs
You know I like the most
And if I ever were to t-try to quit I'd just keep goin'
Cause just like Clarence Carter baby +I Be Strokin'+
And you like, "Oh my God", I got you soundin' holy
I got a s-s-surprise. yeah that right there is golden
So hold it
Cause this is my job like it ain't nobody's business
Tell me whose is this?
B-o-Bizzless
Yeah yeah real dirty real gritty
Haha

And you know we like move
In the bedroom like boom-ba-boom-boom
Haha

Now we change up the tune
Now we got a new one rockin' in ooohn
I think it's noon and we still ain't through
While she in the zone I be up in that poon
Ewww

And it's just so nasty
That's why the sex is so damn fantastic
Trashy, trashy

You ain't gotta ask me
Kids close your ears cause this right here is graphic
Then we sit down and we brown on that cali-cali
Like we in Atlanta in the Caddy
I am not a father but she calls me "Daddy"
Now my confidence feels awfully fantastic
Ha
And that's why she the Cooter Club Captian
Cause like this beat she cla-cla-cla-clappin'

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
Okay, so I'm on the beat, what am I supposed to rhyme?
What am I supposed to do in this booth? Am I to flow a line?
What am I, a spokesman now? What am I, a poster child?
What am I supposed to smile?
What am I supposed to be the dopest MC to hold this down?
What if I wasn't poor as a child?
What if I didn't grow up in doubt?
I probably shouldn't be smoking so much, my mind is over fried
But still I notice how them same folks will smile
In your face, but behind your back them same folk will frown
But that's enough about them, talk about me
Yes, B to the O, I said B to the O
And to the B, I owe it to the streets
And I ain't trying to brag, but you know your boys a beast
And yeah I gotta eat cause my groceries on this beat
And my song will carry on 'til I no longer speak
My soul is also Kosher added to the fact I'm cheap
And I put that on my grandma, Othella, so rest in peace
Hater

[Ad-Libs: J. Cole]
Yeah, nigga
Hey, yeah, nigga
Hey

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Ayy, many blessings sent from heaven, thanking God to be alive
Flight attendant woke me up said, "Mr Cole you have arrived, welcome"
In this game the price of fame is steep, Lord help 'em
Keep 'em sane, prayin' that the heat won't melt 'em
I'm headed to the top, I couldn't be more welcome
Took the lead role, now look I'm right outside your peephole
That's for the crown holders, never would I dethrone
But if you ever leave home, don't worry, I keep your seat warm
So yeah, I'm Simba in a sense, I'm the prince
You impostors no Mufasa's, but there's Oscars for you gents
When I say I'm better then you niggas don't mean no offense
But is clear with no tints, man, just check the fingerprints
You'll see we not the same, I got a shit list with lot's of names
And plus hit list with of rappers I'ma cock and aim
Then it's who shot ya, mane? Finally figured out the game
Got nuttin' to lose, and a whole fuckin' lot to gain

Everyone calls me Bob but I'm still my mother's son
And I'm low key when I'm out now, hell no, fame ain't fun
But I stay Live like NBA on yo' Playstation
And I entertain' cause I'm in the game
It's easy to see I ain't into fame
Cause I ain't

Please allow me to demonstrate
But no matter what they say

Really maine?

Go head then

[Verse 1]
Allow me to introduce myself again
Bob's out the office but Bobby Ray is in
Please leave a message wait, let me get a pen
I don't really need it cause I spit it off the lid
And every time I come around I look like I'm a pimp
Really that's the dip because the ? is on my hip
They love me cause I tell 'em what they really wanna hear
Slap her on that booty with a hundred dollar bill
WHAT!?
Nah I'm just playin' man sometimes I kid
Just so that my job doesn't get monotonous
Crumble up the bud, put it in a spliff
Put it in the air like I'm levitating shit
They say, "Bob how you feel about the fame?"
Really ain't famous till Obama know my name
The game's in a drought
It was going down the drain
When I come around man its prolly gon' rain (so what's you sayin'?)
Maybe I'm just sayin' I can switch up the flow
How you can't feel me when I'm rocking this show?
Going over seas to a whole 'nother coast
Come back get a sack full of that like whoa
Yeah I can take you way back like +Whoa+
So listen two me rap sit back like whoa
And every time I rip they be like, "That's dope"
Yeah that's dope
Nitro like colt, my flow lets go
Haha Haha

Yeah
(Is that it?)
Hell naw, we ain't done
(Let's do it)
Need to get round two in

[Verse Two]
Oh oh oh
Well the biz, the biz I'm in the music biz
I really couldn't tell you what the main objective is
Cause really that depends
On if you got a hit or just a good song that they never ever spin
And then that depends on the genre that you in
If you're a rock artist or a hip hop blend
That's where I come in
They try to box me in
But I am not a square nor a parallelogram
Yes I got several fans through Japan to Maryland
They try to shoot me down but I never ever land
And no man could never ever walk in my pants
Or live what I've lived
Or be what I am
Damn
I don't give a damn
All up in this booth try to lay this shit down
Yeah, so let me turn it down
We all around it;s a mixtape now
Stay tuned for more
And don't turn the dial
Bloaw

[Verse One]
I was in Miami Beach
Saw the girl of my fantasy
She was into finer things
Bathing suits and diamond belly rings
She was something like I never seen
Made me blow the whistle like the referee
Beside her is where I plan to be
And so to get her I'd do anything
Maybe even start a family
Or even get a house in Sandy Springs
She's so lovely like a melody
So baby, won't you come and jam with me?

[Hook] 

[x2]
And she was so cool
Like the other side of a pillow
So baby, let's groove
Like an instrumental

[Verse Two]
Well come on over to my place
No need to be wasting time
You really must be from outer pace
Cause you really is blowing my mind
Now I done been from state to state
But I ain't never seen your kind
Cause every single time I look at you
Sends a tingling down my spine
Well girl, you must be mighty exhausted
Running these laps through my mind so often
Cause I been fallin', and I been callin'
I think I need a map cause' I'm so lost in
The things you do when you brush your hair
When you take it to the side and toss it over there
And it ain't that fair, cause the way she move
I stare

[Hook] 

[x2]
And she was so cool
Like the other side of a pillow
So baby, let's groove
Like an instrumental

[Verse Three]
And she's so cool
Cool like a pool in the middle of June
I sweep her off her feet
I guess you could say that I give her the broom
And she gets so international with it
Whenever she get in the mood
Cause she's so Australian
Down under on my didgeridoo
And she be killin' it too, yeah
When she go in for the gold
Like a gymnast move
Oh, and what they saying is true, yeah
A lady in the bed but a freak in the room
That's why she's cooly, cooly, cooly
Like a smoothie in a jacuzzi
The opposite of Judge Judy
When she on duty
And she feeling me too

[Hook] 

[x2]
And she was so cool
Like the other side of a pillow
So baby, let's groove
Like an instrumental

[B.O.B]
Well you know who it is
You ain't even got to ask it
I am not the best I am the next level past it

[X3]

Haters see me passing like damn that bastard (dammit)
Cause they outta style like the water bed mattress
Yeah yeah, they thought I'd fade to the blackness
Now they see me everywhere like Samuel L Jackson (mothafucka)
But I ain't actin=', I'm only givin' classes
And by the looks of these grades niggas ain't passin'
No, it's crazy how these niggas think
They be actin' like I ain't like Howard in the paint
Like trees and Cali man, all I do is blaze
And they say I'm like a zombie
Cause all I want is brains
Mine
Yes, mine mine mine
Yeah you look good girl but what is on your mind?
Think about it
Cause all these dimes
Like Nationwide, they just wanna be on my side
But baby this is all I can provide
The whole town'll have water if I lay this pipe
I'm on top of the world and I'm so high
I gotta drop down just to catch my flight
Yikes
What amazing heights
Gee wilikers Batman, holy satellites
Who the hell are you to tell me ease up on this mic?
You, sadly have mistaken me for someone that I'm nite
I mean not
I messed up
But I rock with this stuff
So my stocks just went up
You know my flow
Yeah it's B dot O
Yeah it's B dot O
Yeah it's B dot O
And you know my flow
Yeah I hear them talkin' with that raspy shit (shhh)
But what's an upper class man to a graduate?
I said {mumbling} and you laugh to it
I'm just playin' with these niggas I ain't mad at 'em
But since you critics want to be that adamant
I guess I give you reason to type on your keypad again
Yeah Bob buzzin, and got the whole web chatterin'
How ironic? In my past it ain't matter then
Well, it comes with the territory
My life is not an ordinary story
Naw, and I ain't talking big
This is just how I feel about the situation that I'm in
Yeah
No you can never walk in my shoes dawg
Even if I got my dude to make your shoes dawg
You know about that south we act like fools dawg
Your girl says she like that country smooth drawl
That's why there's groupies ready to remove draws
They be going heavy duty til that Goose gone
Every single day I wake up to a new song
That's the sound of my formal introdushon
I mean "tion"
What's up?
You know, my flow
Cause it's B dot O
And it's B dot O
And it's B dot O
And you know, my flow
So to all the people that's about to hate it
Here's how I feel about you {burps}
There, I demonstrated
Ha, a politician so opinionated
So my style is addictive like simple lemonade is
I'm in the building and I'm finna hit the stage
You can feel the tension and the sense of mental stimulation
If she's with me than she's not your lady
And as we can see, she loves my babies
Me go so crazy
Me go so loco lately
Mostly because they raised me
No heat, no cold, no A.C
Yeah I'm just saying how I feel up in this booth
One of y'all surprise me and do something new

[Intro]
Yeah, look

[Verse 5: B.o.B]

And I'm-and I'm gonna quit this, quit this (Quit this)
Crazy scene

And it roughs me up, so much I could cuss
But enough's enough, I want out of these cuffs
I'm gonna...

Well, I'm a make a lot of money (Make a lot of money)
And I'm-and I'm gonna quit this, quit this (Quit this)

[Verse 7: B.o.B]
Sometimes I just feel hopeless

So I'm always smokin' in the booth recordin'
'Cause my mind races like Jeff Gordon
I'ma...

[Hook]
Well, I'm a make a lot of money (Make a lot of money)
And I'm-and I'm gonna quit this, quit this (Quit this)
Crazy scene

[Verse 8: Asher Roth]
It ain't supposed to be so hard
I always said I'd quit if it felt like a job
I'd rather be pissed than pretend that I'm not
And try to play along with the whole façade
I wanna...

[Hook]
Well, I'm a make a lot of money (Make a lot of money)
And I'm-and I'm gonna quit this, quit this (Quit this)
Crazy scene

[Verse 9: B.o.B]
It ain't a question to me

This is spiritual y'all, I'm wrestlin' beasts
But pretty soon I'll be restin' in peace
I'ma...

[Hook]
Well, I'm a make a lot of money (Make a lot of money)
And I'm-and I'm gonna quit this, quit this (Quit this)
Crazy scene

[Verse 10: Asher Roth]
And I don't even wanna be famous
And all my close friends become complete strangers
Don't try to tell me this is one of these stages
Man you don't know me, you only know what my name is
I'ma...

[Hook]
Well, I'm a make a lot of money (Make a lot of money)
And I'm-and I'm gonna quit this, quit this (Quit this)
Crazy scene

[Verse 11: B.o.B]
But still it just ain't enough

But those who asleep still hatin' on us
'Cause I'ma

[Hook]
Well, I'm a make a lot of money (Make a lot of money)
And I'm-and I'm gonna quit this, quit this (Quit this)
Crazy scene

But when it comes time to decide your fate
They'll sign you on the line right next to Satan

And I'm-and I'm gonna quit this, quit this (Quit this)

[Hook]
Well, I'm a make a lot of money (Make a lot of money)
And I'm-and I'm gonna quit this, quit this (Quit this)
Crazy scene

Right when I...

[Hook]
Well, I'm a make a lot of money (Make a lot of money)
And I'm-and I'm gonna quit this, quit this (Quit this)
Crazy scene

[Verse 15: B.o.B]
Look, this is my stress reliever
But somehow it became my stress for demons
So I get up in this booth and I'm heated
Like 'Ye said "I'm turnin' atheists into believers"
I'ma...

[Hook]
Well, I'm a make a lot of money (Make a lot of money)
And I'm-and I'm gonna quit this, quit this (Quit this)
Crazy scene

[Verse 16: B.o.B]
Look, a lot of haters attack but
It's my job to speak the truth on the track
So say what you like, you just givin' me gas
So by now, I got enough to drive to Venus and back
So I'ma..

[Hook]
Well, I'm a make a lot of money (Make a lot of money)
And I'm-and I'm gonna quit this, quit this (Quit this)

I'ma...

[Hook]
Well, I'm a make a lot of money (Make a lot of money)
And I'm-and I'm gonna quit this, quit this (Quit this)
Crazy scene

[Verse 18]
Well, I guess I got problems
Dropped outta school ain't think about college
So apologies to my mother and father
For being stubborn ever since I was a toddler

[Hook]
Well, I'm a make a lot of money (Make a lot of money)
And I'm-and I'm gonna quit this, quit this (Quit this)
Crazy scene

[Verse 19]
Well I'm a quit this crazy dream
'Cause when I hit the stage all the ladies scream
And when I pass by they all waving at me
But I be getting tired, y'all pray for me

[Hook]
Well, I'm a make a lot of money (Make a lot of money)
And I'm-and I'm gonna quit this, quit this (Quit this)

You're now watchin Pepsi Max NFL Audible
Yeah, uh-huh

Welcome to Atlanta where the big boys roam
Comin live from the Dome down in B.o.B's home

[Verse: B.o.B]
Green Bay to the A, Atlanta comin off of a bye week
Packers hittin a new high beatin the Eagles
In the city of brotherly love now they're lookin up
Birds of prey hoverin above
Packers again huntin the big bird, Howard Aaron's baby
How ready will Clay be?
Well maybe, AJ Hawk can beat the Falcons
But Matty Ice is ready to rip it out of his talons
Rodgers will probably rob a few TD's
But Matt Ryan's plannin on firin through his D
Michael Turner's likely to earn him a couple yards
But the Packers are holdin the wildcard
And meanwhile, the Dirty Bird, Rowdy Roddy White's
Got his winning wings on, he's about to take flight
But according to Charles Woodson, that'll never happen
Battlin for 13 years and feel the passion
Not like red and black is; it'll be tough
To beat the one scene where the tundra doesn't freeze
If you lose you're no longer remembered
Lockers are cleaned out, we'll see you in September
Or be a contender, NFC Championship awaits
It's a, game of inches so even the little breaks
Can be the difference between the losers and all the greats
Who's real and who's fake? Who's sealin who's fate?
Difference between the losers and all the greats
Who's real and who's fake? Who's sealin who's fate?
It's bed time (bed time) tuck yourself in
I can tell that you're terrified (terrified)
Check my rep and you'll see that it's verified... {*fades*}

[Intro: sample from Kanye West's "Pinocchio Story"]
"Do you really have the stamina?
For everybody that sees you that say, 'Where's my camera?'
For everybody that sees you, to say sign a autograph
For everybody that sees you cry, and say you oughta laugh
You oughta laugh!"

[Hook: Kanye West sample & B.o.B.]
"Do you really have the stamina?"
Do you have the stamina
"For everybody that sees you that say, 'Where's my camera?'"
Where's my camera
"For everybody that sees you, to say sign a autograph"
Sign an autograph
"For everybody that sees you cry, and say you oughta laugh"
You oughta laugh "You oughta laugh!"

[Verse 1: B.o.B.]
Well, posing for pictures and living on a poster
The hardest thing for me is to keep my composure
I ain't always happy, and I ain't always sad
But when the spotlight is on, you have to handle the task
And even the people who swear they love so bad
A go and put your dirty laundry on the cover of mags
Then everyone sees it and gets a good laugh
And now your whole persona is just a thing of the past
Now, when people see they ignore all the pain
They only think about the rumors and mistakes you made
So that's why I don't read all the comments on the blogs
Everybody's a fan if you boo me or applaud
Now give me your energy, even if you're my enemy
Or trying to be friends with me, aggressively or timidly
Put my next to anyone in this industry
You still will never find someone that's in my league

[Hook: Kanye West sample & B.o.B.]
"Do you really have the stamina?"
Do you have the stamina
"For everybody that sees you that say, 'Where's my camera?'"
Where's my camera
"For everybody that sees you, to say sign a autograph"
Sign an autograph
"For everybody that sees you cry, and say you oughta laugh"
You oughta laugh "You oughta laugh!"

[Verse 2: B.o.B.]
Celebrity this, celebrity that
Reality TV fiends addicted like crack and smack
My business is rap, and my business is politicing with that
And then my business is put on the map
Yeah, the bigger I get, the better the hat
The better the slacks, the better the shirts, the more I adapt
The more you pay attention to my sentences
The more you'll realize why I'm a lyricist
And why I sacrifice my time for this experience
And why my album still isn't in your speakers yet
You think you know me now, and you ain't even seen me yet
Well, except maybe on your TV set
Bring the bridge

[35 second Instrumental Break]
{*Scratched: "Bring the bridge"*}

[Hook: Kanye West sample & B.o.B.]
"Do you really have the stamina?"
Do you have the stamina
"For everybody that sees you that say, 'Where's my camera?'"
Where's my camera
"For everybody that sees you, to say sign a autograph"
Sign an autograph
"For everybody that sees you cry, and say you oughta laugh"
You oughta laugh "You oughta laugh!"

[Hook: B.o.B]
My soul is getting weary, weary
And I know the ending is nearing, nearing tonight
So just say goodbye and kiss your dreams goodnight
So just say goodbye and kiss your dreams goodnight

[Verse One: B.o.B.]
So just say goodnight to your dreams
Because tonight is the night of the beast
I am not frightened, I'm delighted to speak
When the time comes, until the light we will lead
That's why I decided to B. O. to the B
So, one time for the streets
One time for all the minds hypnotized by TV
Because everything is just a spiral to me

[Break]
Goodbye, say goodbye
Say goodbye

[Hook]

[Verse Two: B.o.B]
So get your hands up high
No, don't be shy, raise em up to the sky
Because we will survive
Yeah, storm after storm, there's still sunshine
So can you feel the vibe?
Yeah, just like yeast, I'ma make you rise
So just say goodbye
And just kiss it goodnight when the day arrives

[Break]

[Hook]

[Break] - repeat 2X

[Hook]

[Break]

[B.o.B.] So just say goodbye and kiss your dreams goodnight

[Verse One]
They say, "Bob why not put the guitar down and rap?"
It's easier to sing than put my soul on a track
Cause the media has made a competition out of rap
So constantly they comparin' me to 3 Stacks (Andre 3000)
I try to grow freely but they hold me to my past
Sayin' the music that I'm makin' doesn't appeal to the mass
What am I to do about that?
When the syndicated radio is always playin' trash
Every single song is the same old track
About Patron, Patron, Patron and swag, swag, swag
Patron and swag and the whole hood is singin'
"Patron and swag"
And everybody wonder why the kids so bad
Cause they only thing they know is Patron and SWAG!

[Hook]
And there you are standing all alone, in the rain like oh no
And you don't know where to go, cause you're in the rain
And there you are standing all alone, in the rain like oh no
And you don't know where to go, but you're in the rain

And it keeps pouring down on you ,the suns gone and your feelin' blue
And it's pouring down on you, but you keep on movin' through
And it's pouring down on you, the suns gone and your feelin' blue
And there you are standing all alone in the rain

And the rain comes pouring down
Yeah yeah

[Verse One]
By no means am I livin' in vain, but I
Sit in the rain, I'm addicted to pain yeah
It feels good when it enters my veins
And every time I wake up it's a similar day
Cause I'm stuck in my ways
And everywhere I go the suns runnin' away
But this is what I get for my troublesome ways
So here comes the rain to fuck up my parade
I ain't got nothing to say

[Hook]
And there you are standing all alone, in the rain like oh no
And you don't know where to go, cause you're in the rain
And there you are standing all alone, in the rain like oh no
And you don't know where to go, but you're in the rain

And it keeps pouring down on you ,the suns gone and your feelin' blue
And it's pouring down on you, but you keep on movin' through
And it's pouring down on you, the suns gone and your feelin' blue
And there you are standing all alone in the rain

And the rain comes pouring down
Yeah yeah

[Verse Two]
And as I fall into the rain
Swimmin' through the flood, tryin' to unclog the drain
If you tryin' to find me my address is Memory Lane
Livin' amongst the darkness, so the dungeon is my domain
Higher than the mountains feeling lower than the plains
But this is what I chose so how can I complain?
And tryin' to find some brain is, really not my aim
Stuck inside my head, so it replays again

[Hook]
And there you are standing all alone, in the rain like oh no
And you don't know where to go, cause you're in the rain
And there you are standing all alone, in the rain like oh no
And you don't know where to go, but you're in the rain
And it keeps pouring down on you ,the suns gone and your feelin' blue
And it's pouring down on you, but you keep on movin' through
And it's pouring down on you, the suns gone and your feelin' blue
And there you are standing all alone in the rain

And the rain comes pouring down
Yeah yeah

[Intro 2X: B.o.B.]
Well I live in a no man's land
I don't know where I'm going trying to gain a fan
I hold on the best that I can
Because the deeper I go the quicker the sand

[Hook: B.o.B]
Yeah, and everything, it all comes crashing down
And every deed, it all comes back around
And every thing and every single cloud
Becomes the sea and it all comes crashing down
And in the midst of everything, I drown
As the sky above comes crashing down
And in the midst of everything, I drown
As the sky above comes crashing down

[Break: B.o.B]
Sweet dreams, I hold on to
Memories, I hold on to

[Verse One: B.o.B]
I don't think they really, really understand
All the pain I feel just to make em dance
Now here I go, in the studio
Can you feel my heart? Now can you feel my soul?
That's they way that I think with every line
And I'm a be that deep til the day I die
So if you feel me now, sing one time
(Ooooohhhh)

[Verse Two: B.o.B]
The doc said I need to take these everday
But I'd rather ride around in a chevorlet
I don't wanna pray, I don't wanna meditate
I broke up with my girlfriend yesterday
If I wanted to, I can do anything
I could rap a verse, but I think I'd rather sing
Everything comes around like a boomerang
Boomerang, rang, boomerang, rang, rang

[Hook]

[Outro 8X: B.o.B]
I try to hold on, on to everything
Sweet memories, but that was yesterday

[Break] - repeat 2X over the end of the outro
Lady (Um humm)
Oh baby (Um humm)
My sweet baby (Um humm)
You're the one (Fury)

[Hook]
Lady (Oh yeah)
Oh, baby (oh yeah)
My sweet baby (oh yeah)
You're the one

Uh huh... I know

[Verse One]
Well it's Mr. Obituary, put beats in a cemetery
I rip a beat to pieces, like sheets in a dictionary
The teachers try tried to teach me but I was sleepin' in every class
I never passed, it didn't seem necessary
I'm super psychedelic
I'm smokin' weed with the fairies
And if drugs are bad, throw away every CD you carry
Cause drugs have inspired every musical visionary
And this ain't even the album
So the thought alone should be scary
I do this for the geeks who feel they need to compare me
I swear I'll push this button, give me a reason or dare me
And everything gets blown and everybody gets buried
And there you have it, I shot the track like Berry

[Hook]
Lady (oh yeah)
Oh, baby (oh yeah)
Oh, baby (oh yeah)
Oh, baby (oh yeah)
My, my baby (oh yeah)
Oh, baby (oh yeah)
My sweet baby (oh yeah)
You're the one
I know, I know, I know, haha

[Verse Two]
They tryin' figure out, what's my business incentive
I'm simply tryin' speak to who or whatever will listen
And reach out to the kids who the doctor prescribed with Ritalin
So this for all of my aliens and all the Indigo Children
And anyone who said I would never see this position
Allow me to drop my pants and turn around for you to kiss it
Huh
But that was the motivation I needed for me to get it
And this has been a Bobby Ray Power Point presentition
I mean... presentation...
Aww, whatever you don't care

[Intro: C-Murder]
Man, fuck them niggas, haha

[Chorus: C-Murder]
Fuck them other niggas 'cause I'm down for my niggas

Nigga any-fucking-time, nigga any-fucking-where
"Make 'em bleed" is the motto that I live by
If you fuck with me, it's a must, you die
Them niggas might go run, but them niggas can't hide
It's like shooting yourself, it's a suicide
KLC rock the beat, hitting hard like Burt
Niggas in the 'Nolia know him as "Big Hurt"
Just like Soulja Slim, he'll put you in the dirt
And have your picture on front of a T-shirt
And when I make moves, I got a hundred niggas with me
Just in case a nigga out there trying to get me
All my niggas is down to squeeze the trigger
That's why I'm down for my motherfucking niggas

[Chorus: C-Murder]
Fuck them other niggas 'cause I'm down for my niggas
Fuck them other niggas 'cause I'm down for my niggas

Did a drive by with my .45 cause I'm down with these niggas
Snoop Dogg and Bossalinie
Don't shoot, nah, nigga, just call me when you need me
Believe me, I never bite the hand that feed me
Just point them niggas out
And I'll leave 'em all on the street bleeding
Bitch, you fucking with a grown man
How I be done waxed you in your house
And then buried you on your own land
See, the cops is scared to come and get me
But I don't blame 'em cause they know
I got a bunch of dog niggas with me
Looking for trouble, starting shit
I'm riding solo, and I'm busting and getting rid of your clique
See you boys ain't about beefing
When you fucking with niggas
That'll definitely get you eternal sleep
But if you didn't get the fucking picture, *gunshots*
Bitch, I'm down for my niggas

[Chorus: C-Murder]
Fuck them other niggas 'cause I'm down for my niggas
Fuck them other niggas 'cause I'm down for my niggas

[Cee-Lo Green]
The wine is white, and the lights are dim
They warned you, don't go home with him
These guilty feet'll never dance again
(I know, but will I ever get the chance again?)
I've been held in contempt for an incident
But it takes two to be intimate
So by no means was she innocent
(Well it wasn't a crime if I didn't witness it)

[Hook]
They said, that chivalry is dead
Then why is her body (body) in my bed?
At sunrise, the morning papers read
They found a body (body) in my bed (ahhh)

[Cee-Lo Green]
Ahhhh! Can nonchalance be ambiance? Of course
I lean toward her and whisper the choice is yours
Need I remind you that I'll have no remorse
(I understand)
Here's a kiss, sweetheart this won't hurt a bit
I can kill it with kindness or murder it
Then I would face the time a murderer would get
(Or get away with it) Life

[Hook]

[Cee-Lo Green]
Yes, ahhhh!
May I?
You're so good looking
Let me touch you
Ohhh {*inhaling*}
You taste so good...
Yeahhhh {*fades out*}

[Verse 1]
I've been living for the weekend, but no not any more
Cause here comes that familiar feeling, that Friday's famous for
Yeah I'm lookin for some action, and it's out there somewhere
You can feel the electricity, all in the evening air
And it may just be more of the same
But sometimes you wanna go where everyone knows your name
So I guess I'll have to wait and see
But I'm just gonna let something brand new happen to me

[Hook]
And it's alright (it's alright)
It's alright, it's alright, it's alriight (it's alright)
Bright lights and the big cityy
It belongs to us toniight (tonight, tonight)

[Verse 2]
Now Friday is cool, but there's something about Saturday night
You can't say what you won't do, cause you know that you just might
I'm alive this evening, it was love at first sight
A-this Saturday, and every Saturday for the rest of my life
And everyone's standing in line, uh
Yeah lookin good, and lookin for a real good time
So I'll never have to wonder if
I'll have someone to share all of this with

[Hook]
And it's alright (it's alright)
It's alright, it's alright, it's alriight (it's alright)
Bright lights and the big cityy
It belongs to us toniight (tonight, tonight)

[Bridge]
Yes I need it, everybody doees
Cocktails and conversation, music and making loove

[Outro]
And it's alright (it's alright)
It's alright, it's alright, it's alriight (it's alright)
Bright lights and the big cityy
It belongs to us toniight (tonight)
Bright lights, bright lights

It belongs to us toniight (tonight)

[Intro]
Yeah, let me hold you
Don't cry baby

[Verse 1]
If this makes you cry
Girl I didn't mean it
Next time I should lie
The truth is inconvenient
I bet if you try
You could live without me
I really don't know why
You bother to cry about me

[Hook]
Cry, cry baby
I guess that I'm the bad guy now
Cry, cry baby
And just like all the other ones
Cry, cry baby, oh

[Verse 2]
I hate to see you cry
Sad to say I've seen it
We should say goodbye
And this time really mean it
When some time goes by
I'm sure that you'll feel better
But if she needs to cry
Then maybe I should let her

[Hook]
Cry, cry baby
I guess that I'm the bad guy now
Cry, cry baby
And just like all the other ones
Cry, cry baby, oh

[Bridge]
Now, help me find a way, yeah

Heyyyyyyyyyyyyy there!
I wish I was the winnnnnnnd that, blows your hair
Don't cryyyy
If I could, I'd walk right across the sky

[Chorus One]
I see the woman for me
On the other side of the Grand Canyon
Could that beeeeee the woman for me
On the other side of the Grand Canyon

[Cee-Lo Green]
I'm screaming, to to the top of my lungs
No one has heard a word, I had to say
The wind, blew them awayyyyyy
Heyyyyyyyyyyyyy there!
I love youuuuuuuu
And oh it's not fairrrrrr
Whyyyy, can't I flyyyyy?
Cause

[Chorus Two]
I see the woman for me
On the other side of the Grand Canyon (Grand Canyon)
I couldn't see clearly, the woman for me
On the other side of a Grand Canyon, ooooh

{*Cee-Lo skats and harmonizes to fade out*}

[Cee-Lo Green]
Yeahhhhhhhhhh, ayyy yeahhhhhhhh
Well - that real, that deep, that burning
That amazing, unconditional insufferable love
That feel like forever, that always emotional
But still exceptional love
Can't nobody tell me nothin, it is what it is - annnd
Any mistake you make I I just may forgive, ohhh!
Right now right now at this very moment
Still love her like I loved her then
Ohh I love her in and out then up and down
And round and round and, over and over again
So rare they swear that YOU! just don't exist - annnd
There's only one person I can think of make me feel like this

And I'm a fool, such a fool, for you

Well, that deep, that sweet, that soft and that wet
That fire that's the funky stuff
Ah that up and that down, that front and that back
Baby I can't seem to get enough
Ohhh, baby let me do it, let me do it 'til I'm satisfied - ahhh
Oww baby now please baby I ain't got no more pride
Ohhh! Sweet sugar I surrender
I don't want no other woman, ohh baby you win
And you ain't never got to worry, ever got to worry
You'll never been alone again
There's nothin there's nothin that OOH! that I wouldn't do
Ahh-ohh, I wrote a song 'bout it momma
Everybody know who I'm talkin to, mmmmmmmmmmmm
And I'm a fool, such a fool, for you...

Have mercy
Have a little mercy on me
Oooh-wee
I'm a fool yeah, I'm a fool in love, for you
For you, oh you, oh you!!!

[Cee-Lo Green]
Well I wandered around after our war of words
And I've waited in vain here for weeks
The ghost of a girlfriend that's here in my room
I still smell her perfume in my sheets
But that's not her in my bed, no she's out on the town
And I don't anyone to see
There's a tattoo of my name on her body but obviously
The man holding her hand isn't me
Oh honey how could you regret me when you can't even forget me babe

[Hook]
It's okayyy, to say that you love meeee
Cause I think of you (all night long) still think of you (all night long)
Ohh it's okayyy! To say that you love meeee!
I think of you (all night long) still thinkin of you (all night long)

[Cee-Lo Green]
I thought that once you've had one, you've had every woman
Until I lost this legendary woman
(Shit) Now I'm sure
That they don't make 'em like her any more
So PLEASE~! baby, PLEASE~! lover
Let's find a way to forgive each other
I've gotten around ever since you've been gone
But without you I'm still alone
Ohh how can you regret me when you know you can't forget me and

[Hook]

[Cee-Lo Green]
I make mistakes, I'm only hu-man
And I am not ashamed to sayyyyyyy
That you, are, the onnnnnnnnnnne
... and

[Hook] w/ minor variations, followed by dub Chorus

[Outro]
Oooooooooooooooh
Said I love you

[Cee-Lo Green]
Well hello there!
My name is... not important
And I'm often asked, what do I do for a living?
And I answer, I do what I want
Spontaniety is, the spice of life
And I've indulged quite a bit
But, I'm not above the law
And I'm certainly not lawless
But when it comes to ladies...
I have a license, to kill

Lady KILLERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRrrrrrrrrrrr

Got her~! (ohhh)

Lady KILLERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRrrrrrrrrrrr

[Cee-Lo Green]
Hey, I love the night life yes I do it's so much fun
And before you know it ah, here comes the sun
Sweetheart it's been real but, the thrill is gone
Mmm-hmm, and inside us
Is like a spirit, that picked my house to haunt
But I know it's there so I am nonchalant
Now the question is, just what do I want?

Well, I want you
To run away with me and experience something new
Anything you've already done, just won't do
I want you

Would a trip to a remoted island ease your mind?
Oh, you look like a solitaire in the sunshine
I like her 'cause she's fun
She's fearless, she's a friend of mine
Oh, and I'm not trying to say you need any help
You can have anything you want wit'cho bad self
I like her 'cause she's smart, but she's still sexy
She is something else, ooh
And that's why I want you
To run away with me and experience something new
Anything you've already done, just won't do
I want you

And I want you
To tenderly and sincerely want me too
You can believe in me baby, don't be cruel
I want you

Oh, one rarely finds a lady
That happens to be three times a lady
God is good, but he took his time when he designed you, baby
That's why I want you, and
Oh, I'll even quit my job
Loving you I'll make it my job
Thank you Lord, thank you Lord, this is it, my God
Thank you Lord, this is it, my God

And that's why I want you
And I want you
Sail away and experience something new
Anything you've already done, just won't do
I want you
And I want you
To genuinely and sincerely want me too
You can believe in me baby, don't be cruel
(I want you)

[Lauren Bennett]
Bay-bay! Baby; right where I wanna be
Bay-bay! Baby; don't let love make a fool of me
Yeah, I want it AND, I need it
Oh my body just won't lie
And oh yeah, I feel it when you try and kill it
My body just won't die
Who knew that one to the head and then one more to the heart
Can make you feel, al-right
Oh won't you come set me free, take me out my misery
And make me feel, al-right

[Hook: Lauren] + (Cee-Lo)
Love gun! (sexy, sexy, sexy)

Well bay-bay! Baby; oh tonight it's gonna gooooo down

I want you dead or alive
If you promise to surrender, I'll love you tender
Go on and I'll let your survive
Hit you with one to the head, and then one more to your heart
And make you feel, al-right
I'm gonna come set you free, put you out your misery
And make you feel, al-right - with my

Hush child! And just listen, mmm

Cause true love doesn't go out of style

(Right on time) OOOOOOOOOOOOH
Ohhhhhhhh yessssss~!
Ohhh right on time

[Cee-Lo Green]
You know what I want~!

[Chorus One]
I want a red, hot, a-lover {*2X*}
Loverrrrr!
Please, please, please, ohhh

[Cee-Lo Green]
I'm up early in the morning
Love me, let me go
Uhh she didn't let me sleep at all last night
And I already want some mo'
I said uhh, yeah, that's the way I like it
Sugar baby can't you see
Big and bad and burning hot
Is all you'll ever have to be

[Chorus One]

[Cee-Lo Green]
Now when the woman know she want it
Her body's gonna tell you so
Ahh soaking wet and I ain't touched her yet
All that heat tamale so
I said uhh, yeah, that's the way I like it
Wouldn't change it if I could
And baby because you took a chance on me
I promise I will fuck you good

[Chorus Two]
I want a red, hot, a-lover {*2X*}
Loverrrrr!
Red, hot, a-lover

[Cee-Lo Green]
They got a sound that's bad
Open up and let me say
She can get, whatever she want
Just save a little piece for mee
I said uhh, yeah, that's the way I like it
Wouldn't change it if I could
And baby because you took a chance on me
I promise I will get it good {*fades*}

[Verse 1]
It's looking like a limb torn off
Or all together just taken apart
We're willing through an endless fog
We are the everliving, ghost of what once was

[Chorus]
But no one
Is gonna ever love you more than I do
No one's gonna love you more than I do

[Verse 2]
And anything to make you smile
It's a better side of, of you to admire
But they should never take so long
Just to be over then, back to another one

[Chorus]
But no one
Is gonna ever love you more than I do
No one's gonna love you more than I do

[Bridge]
Someone should have warned you
When things start splitting at the seams and now
The whole thing's tumbling down
Things start splitting at the seams and now
If things start splitting at the seams and now
It's tumbling down hard

[Verse 3]
Did anything to make you smile
You are the ever-living ghost of what once was
I never want to hear you say
That you're better off, or you liked it that way

[Chorus]
'Cause no one
Is gonna ever love you more than I do
No one's gonna love you more than I do

[Bridge/Outro]
They really should have warned you
When things start splitting at the seams and now
The whole thing's tumbling down
Things start splitting at the seams and now
If things start splitting at the seams and now
It's tumbling down hard

[Intro]
Oh, mm-mm
Well, well, mm-mm-mm, mm-mm, hey-hey

[Verse 1]
Little boy, you're not allowed to stay
You have to evolve inevitably
And I've sure come a long way
Hey
The road up ahead was so unclear
Backslidin' down a bottle of beer
Nobody knew if I would make it here
And, hey
Sweet music set me free
From the statistic that I started to be
I wish my mama was alive to see
Mm-mm-mm
The memories of pain have scarred
And when I fall it's usually hard
But I get up and keep followin' God
Hey

[Chorus]
I'm gettin' grown, (La, la, la-la, la, la, la, la, la-la, la, la)
I'm gettin' grown
Mm, gettin' grown (La, la, la-la, la, la, la, la, la-la, la, la)
I'm gettin' grown, hey, ah-ha-ha-ha, ha-ha

[Verse 2]
And I remember the good ol' days
Broads and boxes of blunts to blaze
But I got three children to raise
I-I-I, I-I'm never gon' be perfect, I know
But workin' on it is worth it, I know
Life is just learning as you go
Mm-mm
Been selfish once or twice
I had to learn how to sacrifice
To live to my late nineties'd be nice
Ooh, mm-mm
Every day that goes by is divine
Resentment just robs you blind
God, I owe you this life of mine

[Chorus]
I'm gettin' grown, (La, la, la-la, la, la, la, la, la-la, la, la)
I'm gettin' grown
I'm gettin' grown (La, la, la-la, la, la, la, la, la-la, la, la)
Gettin' grown

[Bridge]
And ooh-ooh-ooh

[Verse 3]
Time's changed, but it feels the same
There's no tellin' what tomorrow will bring
Even if I could I wouldn't change a thing
And, hey
Lord, I know I'm not here to stay
But thanks for wakin' me up today
Preparin' me for what may come my way
And, hey
Say, young man, there's no need to cry
'Cause I know you will get by
Look your destiny in the eye
And ooh-ooh-ooh
Every day my heart burns to try
You've got to walk before you learn to fly
And we all got to earn to die

[Chorus]
I'm gettin' grown, (La, la, la-la, la, la, la, la, la-la, la, la)
I'm gettin' grown
I'm gettin' grown (La, la, la-la, la, la, la, la, la-la, la, la)
Gettin' grown
I'm gettin' grown, (La, la, la-la, la, la, la, la, la-la, la, la)
I'm gettin' grown
I'm gettin' grown (La, la, la-la, la, la, la, la, la-la, la, la)
I'm gettin' grown

[Outro]
I'm gettin' grown, (La, la, la-la, la, la, la, la, la-la, la, la)
I'm gettin' grown
I'm gettin' grown, (La, la, la-la, la, la, la, la, la-la, la, la)
I'm gettin' grown

[Cee-Lo]
I don't know what you came to do
(I don't know what you came to do)
But I came to get this thang crunk for you
(But I came to get this thang crunk for you)
And I don't know who you came to see
(And I don't know who you came to see)
But ain't another muthafucker bad like me
(But ain't another muthafucker bad like me)
Wait a minute
Hey, get up, cause...

I'm a bad muthafucker (4X)

Refrain:

[Female Voice]
You think you bad
You really think you bad

[Cee-Lo]
Well I'm bad, I'm bad, I'm bad
And I know I'm bad

[Female Voice]
Gotdammit you think you bad
You really think you bad

[Cee-Lo]
Well I'm bad, I'm bad
But don't get mad

What can I say that you don't already know
I stay dead fresh all the way to the floor
I ain't never ever been beaten before
You get a bullet hole in your soul fuckin' with Lo
I'm from Southwest whip a Jaguar S 1100
Crucifix on my chest
I could just stand still and shine like glass
I got a mansion sittin' on 10 acres of grass
I cannot stop
I will not quit
And nigga don't like it
Got to deal with it
Don't cross the line shawty let me be
I got 100 niggas a kill 'bout me
Yes y'all
Yes muthafuck the rest
If you lookin' for the shit SugaBaby the best
You can talk all you want but betta not touch
You can't handle me
Ho, I'm just too much
Rock
(Refrain)

I'm one of a kind
I can read your mind
Give soul to a stick
And sight to the blind
I can make the sun shine in the pouring rain
I can even make the dead breath life again
I can walk on water
Take off and fly
I'm a bad muthafucka
I ain't gone lie
My mother is nature
This is why
And my father is God
We got a house in the sky
I can touch your heart
I can soothe your soul
I can give your body warmth
In the freezing cold
I can give you joy
When life got you low
I can take away the pain and you'll hurt no more
I can make every dream you got come true
When you believing in me
You believing in you
And one last thing
So you don't forget
You got to be bad as hell to do that shit
Rock
(Refrain)

Clap yo hand in the air like this
Boogie down and stomp just twist
Don't dare miss a minute of this
This the funk that you can't resist
Wave your hands high in the air
Boogie down like you just don't care
After I'm done you will agree
Even a blind man can see
That I'm a bad muthafucker

[Cee-Lo Green]
Baby - where's the road taking us?
And baby - that's why they call it making love
Darling I will do my best
I'm fallin at the feet of your highness
No need to ask; the answer is always yes

[Hook: repeat 2X]
The least I can do is try
I, want, you, to, be, a, satisfied
Oh let me satisfy you

[Cee-Lo Green]
Baby (baby) baby just ah wait and see
And maybe (maybe) it just takes a little faith in me
Friend of mine, follow my lead
I want to make sure that I succeed
A little encouragement is all I'll need

[Hook]

[Cee-Lo Green]
Oooooh, I want to satisfy youuuu, youuuu, youuuu
I want to satisfy youuuu, youuuu, youuuu
I want to satisfy youuuu, youuuu, youuuu
Oooooooooooooooh

[Hook] - 2X

[Cee-Lo over second repeat]
I've got to satisfy you!
I want to satisfy you baby
Ooooh girl
Please, please, let em satisfy you ma

[Intro]
Mm hmm
Ok, Ok
Yeah
Y'all thought I lost it

[Verse 1: Cee-Lo]
In no fashion have I lost my passion for the pen
It's just that lately life has been a lost less inspiring
To tell you the truth trials
And tribulations is very tiring
I gotta play a little game of gimmick and gun firing
I'm not inspiring to be any lower or higher than
I get equal as in to eye to eye again
I'm the truth, I'm complicated I'm all ready but try again
I've got to die once to never ever die again
And what I believe within I engrave within my skin
And one thing that I ain't is a saint without a sin
How could there be a now if there never was a then?
That is unbalanced just like the yang without the yen
I am distinguishably deeper as opposed to the paper-thin
And I breathe oxygen, and you rhymin bout rocks again
You stagnant, standing still enough to feel the world spin
I'm beginning to smell the end in the path of the blowing wind
Hopefully I'm fortunate enough to spend forever with a friend
I'm slow dancing with destiny every day until then
When I first got my big break I said that I would never bend
And discredit my character to keep up or contend
And my belief beat baseline secrete such a special blend
I am not like them at all and I cannot pretend
I am not like you at all and I cannot pretend

[Hook]
DAMN
That shit was funky (Ohh)
You heard that nigga?

DAMN
Shawty Lo
(yup, c'mon)

[Verse Two: Cee-Lo]
I get off on an extension or compare comprehension
I'm in a classroom of my own, I'm too far gone for competition
Yet I'm never obnoxious with my obvious ambition
Perfectly imperfect is my dimension's definition
I engage my pen pierces the page so that it bleeds my intention
With honorable mention of God's divine intervention
I'm incredible I'm inevitable and there's no possible prevention
I'll hardly (have to) scream my dream and I'll have your undivided attention
The powers that be will be beaten into submission
And you will be able to see my revolution on television
You'll get an aneurysm fuckin around with my head on collision
With the power to get you dead and have the dead risen
I remember when my development was arrested
I was doin time on my mind misguided and misdirected
I was sick, so sick if I spoke to you you'd be infected
Then my conscience was cleared of all charges and I came out corrected
Reinvented, refined, replenished and well rested
On a mission for a medium to manifest the thoughts I collected
After that everything I breathed upon, I blessed it
I committed crimes of passion and my soul was suspected
But it was thrown out of court
Because of course the Creator and I connected
He told me, "fear not for thou art protected. Your life is being requested
And you are being tested, so make every attempt you can to expect the unexpected."

[Hook]

Mm mm mm
Boy that Lo boy

DAMN
Oh Lawd
Cee-Lo why you do it like that?
You ain't have to bustin all like that, man
Makin these niggas feel like they can't rap

DAMN
I got some more, I got some more if you want some

[Verse Three: Cee-Lo]
I am internally evolving entirely
Extensive eclectic expression eloquently
Instantly innovative, Courageously creative
I'm driven, this God given gift it comes naturally to the native
Not a need for the dramatics or the systematic
Simplicities, strictly science and mathematics
The mastermind of the mighty mystical and magical moves
And metaphors manifests masterpieces
Thoroughly fury through the
Inner mind's eye establishes this thesis
Of these innermost, insightful
Intriguing interpretations of extreme intelligence
My common sense is no co-incidence
Caution: competitors approach carefully
I'm able to see
Rare ranges of distance, I expect respect
There's no tolerance for negligence, never
You'll forever
Feel the wrath of the pure and powerful poetry, permanently
Pre-meditative, political, critical, compelling, storytelling
Defining desire, faith fuelin the fire
Brilliance, For Blacknes philosophical, psychological willingly waging warfare
Withstanding, commanding, demanding the listening ears to hear without forcing
Instead endorsing education. Equality, not hate
Just revolution of the mind state
Not mere words but emotions
Which is essential, influential provin my people's potential
Militancy, innocence, insight, listen to God then write
Since my birth date I been tight!
Shit

[Hook]

[Outro]
Now I don't want never hear nobody else say
Goddamn a nigga from the South can't rhyme
NEVER!

DAMN
Hehehe...Now can I do my shit??

[Cee-Lo Green]
Who should I be?
Whether I am good or bad, should lead us both to be
So I pray for the rain
And if I had her every day, I'd still praise her the same...

All it takes is the moonlight, and as long as the weather's fair
Reacts through a river, romance by the evening air
A fragrance on her flesh, this is who she is, don't apologize
You are to awe but you'll only have to be beautiful in the beholder's eye

[Hook]
Won-der-ful wild-flow-er
Op-en up, let me see
Se-xy is, in seaaaason
Share your sun-shine with meeee

[Cee-Lo Green]
The picture is perfect, a keepsake cause the occasion's rare
It's poetry in motion, I'm just proud to say that I was there
To pull her out of the ground, standin out in the crowd, oh my how she's grown
Hold her with both my hands, and put her right on the table when I get her home

[Hook]

[Cee-Lo Green]
Show those pretty colors baby
Show them all to everyone
Everybody's got a
Little light under the sunnnnnnnn...

[Hook] - 2X

[Intro]
Basshead jazz

Basshead
Feel like I'm walkin' across the sky
Getting high on Basshead jazz
The world is spinning so slow
We ain't got nowhere to go
Basshead
Let your mind be free
Enter a new zone of understanding
Gotta get high to get down
Feel like I'm walkin' across the sky
Getting high on Basshead jazz
I ain't leaving, I ain't leaving
Came to put the God in your body this evening
You can't run, you can't hide
Buckle in and enjoy the ride
For beyond all space and time
Jump on in y'all we wasting time
If you can't hang it's an awful thing
Such an awful thing

It's OK, it's alright
Came to put the boogie in your body tonight
Don't be scared, don't be scared
Just grab my hand and hold on tight
I'll be the light that will guide you there
You probably hate me but I hardly care
'Cause if you can't hang it's an awful thing
Such an awful thing

I said a sham a lama, shama a lama ding dong
You put the umm, whaw, whaw
Back into my smile child

Mmm uh, you so freaky shorty..
HAH HAH!!

[Cee-Lo]
Now everybody that's grown got skeleton bones they got hidden away
Yes y'all there's a freak in us all, yet some choose not to say
You can't let those who ain't yet, make you they lil' ball of clay
Be free and express yourself, nastiness comes naturally
Listen to me now
It could be the way I wanna freak a song, tattoos, or the way I dress
Or it could be; I wanna walk my way and refusin to follow the rest
Or when people haven't been where you been
And they say you still going too far
Or when you wit ya girl and
Pull over and fuck somethin in the back of the car

[Hook]
I'm a freak!
A closet freak!
A freak!
Awwww a freak!

[Cee-Lo after each pause in hook]
I'm so excited, y'all all invited
Oh I'm a freak, yes I'm a freak, and just can't fight it
I'm so excited, go on and say it
If you a freak, say you a freak, don't try to fight it

[Cee-Lo]
You got to let the music freak your mind
Otherwise, it's the blind leadin the blind
You know a good freakin is hard to find
Get on the floor mama and bump and grind
Ain't nuttin wrong wit it, if you want it gon' get it
But it ain't no fun if you just freakin all alone with it
I'll turn you on to it - if you want you gon' do it
All you got to do is find somebody like you

[Hook]
A freak!
A closet freak!
A freak!
Awwww a freak!

[Cee-Lo after each pause in hook]
I'm so excited, go on and say it
Oh I'm a freak, yes I'm a freak, and just can't hide it
I'm so excited, go on and say it
If you a freak, say you a freak
(Wait a minute, where the God-damn horns?)

{music plays with Cee-Lo vocalizing and singing}

[Cee-Lo]
La-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la

FREAK! - I'm a freak
FREAK! - Big ol' freak
{music plays till fade}
Shocka locka...

[Cee-Lo]
Shit, behold it is me, it is the epitome of extraterrestrial energy
Experiment and enter the internals of the inner me
The art of gone, and heart of stone, and own's worst enemy

Intellect shapeshifta, God's gift a Soul slippa
Hone in on clones and blow them out of my zone
International Fanatical, the radical tactical movements
Sounds are congruent to it

Work

It is what it ain't to these, infected disease
Thought of automatons deceived, by the Decepticons indeed
Who mechanically breed at methodical speeds
Distorting your genes, aborting your dreams
As coarse as it seems

Aiyyo, Work

[Cee-Lo]
I could scream, I can't seem to sleep long enough to dream
It's life on a laser beam
But I fiend for the future at my finger tips
One of the minor technicalities of my head trips

You Better Work

The Barea Soul terror, been told since stories of old
Come on let's go and then I'll show how to beat down a rhyme
And wrestle a tempo
Hold on tight, but still let yourself go

Work

This is what I'm talking about
Should I begin to spit it just like the wind
Show my power take flight and quickly ascend
Like a bird beating my wings to the pulse of nature
Scarring spiritual devils while evoking the maker
Is it wrong for me to curse in the name of right
Is it wrong for me to speak life into this mic
That's all I'm asking baby
How come the new millennium brings fright
Something wicked approaches tonight
Work

It's automatic, static battle star galactic
Microhard
It's the upgraded, complicated, premeditated
Microhard
It's the transplanted, peaceful panic, bass mechanic
Microhard
It's the psychotic, mean melodic, nod-narcotic
Microhard
(repeat)

What good is a call on the phone if you can't speak
And you find it hard to breathe
Paralyzed by my essence, mere presence I put forth
Inherently legends record all souls of expressions
Evil as evil does, better than good was
A spirit of music that once was, born out of the pool of your love
Baby I'm an agent with a flow that's so contagious
And all and all true patience, my brotha Lo told me makes for perfection
While you feeling bound by this matrix
That's why when it comes to protecting mine
I'm a brother you can call over zealous
And I lust and thrust out my staff and wet
Till the motherfuckin' rains get jealous
You Gotta Work

It's not coincidental I use my soul for a stencil to outline the rhyme
That connects machine and a mind
Until the end of time the one my kind, the message will now be profoundly
Spoken, rules are meant to be broken, therefore it's my pleasure to mentor
But once learned you must learn you must yearn to discern
The mechanical glitch of artificial intelligence
But the consequence of your ignorance is the reality I now see before me:
"maybe in time we'll see"

Don't Stop, Work

The degree you'll see will cause casualty when the codes download
The truth will unfold uphold until the end
Cause our destiny will be to win, you're still free to sin within

[Cee-Lo]
I am the melody, the metaphoric prehistoric
The pre-meaning before it, preparing for war shit
Their god's only a graphic, the sky's computer blue
There is a moral malfunction, what will the machine do to you
They maliciously monopolize the mass
Niggas sleep rap and fuck they surprise you last
When you sell them your soul they supply you cash
But you can die for all they care, with your expendable ass
Because they know a new nigga, a brand new nigga
Will jump right in them tap shoes even if his feet bigger
Ain't shit sweet nigga, it's deeper than the street nigga
You and I just a virus they gonna delete nigga
Some people say go on and join what you can't beat nigga
I won't take the mark so I can't eat nigga
Holla if I'm talking to ya, (AH!)
I'll walk straight through ya
Cause I want the motherfucker that did this to ya

Our comrade Cee-Lo is considered by many as a modern day Neo
And opposing forces known as agents will like him dead for what he know
He is The One, at least that's who Morpheus say he is
He can free the mind of a machine and give God to an atheist
But he's a daydreamer, it's all in his head
Still today's music has become the Matrix
And the real rhythm is in the red pill
So I chose it knowing I can never return once I'm gone
And I hope you got this message
I'll be waiting by the phone

[Verse 1]
I'm goin crazy. (I'm goin crazy)
Would you like to come with me? (Would you like to come with me?)
Oooh its never to late to your mind
I've forgotten where I've come from, (Forgotten where I've come from)
I can't remember where I'm goin. (I can't remember where I'm goin)
So when you take my hand, just got to trust me eventhough I'm blind

Follow me. Follow me. Follow me. Follow me

So take my hand I've seen the promise land eventhough I'm blind

[Hook]
Follow me. Follow me. Follow me

So why not believe in me?
Because of everything, you've probably seen
Is not what it seems, cuz life is a dream
You've got to believe in something. (Believe in something)
So why not believe in me?
Because of everything, you've probably seen
Is not what it seems, cuz life is a dream

Take my hand I'll understand eventhough I'm blind

[Hook]
Follow me. Follow me. Follow me
Yeeaaaah I can set you free if you
Follow me. Follow me. Follow me. Yeeeeeeah
Well I'm extremely cheap
I snore when I go to sleep
The little bit of nothin have left
I'm strugglin trying to keep
Your friends may all agree
You could name a million things I'll never be
If you feel like flyin feel free
You know that you could do better than me
I'm a simple man
I'm doing everything I can
When God sent you my way
It was the moment my life began
You stood by me through the storm
Well I was hopin you'd have my hand
I wish I understood how you were strong enough to undestand
Cuz see no one is crazy enough to love me but you

Never thought myself as much to see
Material things don't mean much to me
A good father, husband, and workin man
Are sometimes so much to see
And all them bills are due
I can't afford to buy you nothing new
We don't talk like we used to
I know that loving me is hard on you
But you know I try
You are the completion of I
As long as we're in love
I'll never be ready to die
We've come such a long way
And sometimes I want to ask you why
You continue to be the only star in my entire sky
Because no one is crazy enough to love me but you
You see, girl you know I try
You are the completion of I
As long as we're in love
I'll never be ready to die
We've come such a long way
And sometimes I want to ask you why
You continue to be the only star in my entire sky
But see no one is crazy enough to love me but you
I want to thank you (yeah)
(chorus x8) Super Chicken

(Verse 1)
Listen now, I got a story to tell
About a bird who wanted to fly away
You see he knew that he could and he probably would
But his family said they needed him to stay
But his spirit is strong and he's been waiting so long
And he don't really want nobody to tell him daddy wrong
So excuse me I wanna go and kiss the sky
Cause these wings that I was given were inteded to fly

(chorus x8)

(Verse 2)
Everybody mad at lil' ol' me
Cause I ain't the same bird I used to be
Oh but if you had a dream, something you wanted to do
I sure wouldn't be the one to keep it from you

(singing)
I can't let nobody hold me down
This is my life and that's my sky
I was born to fly
(chorus x8)

(Verse 3)
Look it here
This is nothing I should fear
This should down and disappear
I done lost my fear
I don't know if you seen what I saw
But I hope someday you'll see it my way
I believe
I believe
I can breath
I believe I can find some happiness
I know that ya watch me grow but don't worry 'bout me
Cause I'm gonna be ok
I wanna sing, wanna dance, wanna scream, wanna shout
I wanna be everything I am
I ain't nobody's fool
Nobody's child no more
I'm a full grown man
I used to wonder if I could
If I would
If I should and I know I got to know
And now three ain't no doubt in my mind
I can do it, I can do it, I know I can
(chorus x8)

(singing)
If I couldn't fly
I might well die
Let me go human, can't go hold my hand no more
Let me go
Let me be, set me free
Let me go

(chorus x8)
(more singing)
(chorus x20,fading until end)
Rock! Roll! Roll! Roll! Roll!
Well every time that you're allowed to see the morning sun
It's a reminder that your life ain't done
Wake Up and Live
Wake Up and Live RIGHT NOW

I keep believing I can fly find my reasons why
The only way you'll ever earn to die is if you live
You Got To Live RIGHT NOW

And don't you let nobody tell you what you can do
Ain't another minute promised to you
You Better Live
I Said Live RIGHT NOW

You got to cherish every moment, carelessness is a crime
Revelation gon' be right on time
You Better Live
You Better Live RIGHT NOW

Yes sir, yes sir, yes sir, yes sir
LIVE! I Said Live RIGHT NOW
Yes sir, yes sir, yes sir, yes sir
LIVE! I Said Live RIGHT NOW
And to the hustlers grindin' on the block every day
I know sometimes it got to be that way
You Got To Live
You Got To Live RIGHT NOW

And every day is like a test you say you doing you best
And you see a nigga dying for less
Try To Live
Start Livin' RIGHT NOW

(Chorus)

And all that in and out of jail is getting old
Let this song here save your soul
Brother Live
Start Livin' RIGHT NOW

I bet you never thought you would hear it from me
But I done change from how I used to be
I Want To Live
I Want To Live RIGHT NOW

(Chorus)
Well...
I'm a species so rare the human eye's hardly seen
A thin line between divine and killing machine
A dark side of the light that no one should ever see
Oh, I feel for the foolish for fucking with me
There is a war inside me but the water is still
You'll be safer every time assuming it will
But to lose my composure I don't normally do
I just thought that you should know
I've been sicker than you

You don't know me
A record can't tell ya
Uh-oh, I'm the Great Pretender
(repeat)

You say you want my pain
My own personal pain
A lot hurt, heartache, and hard times it's hard to explain
I can feel the anger starting to happen again
I'd bust your head and break your brain for five minutes of fame
A-ha ha
My heart beats with unconditional love
But beware of the blackness that it's capable of
Oh yeah, Oh yeah
You got to travel the road of a troubled soul
I'm trying so hard not to lose control
Oh yeah, Oh yeah
You don't know me
A record can't tell ya
Uh-oh, I'm the Great Pretender
(repeat)

They said in life you shouldn't worry
Just got to let the wind blow
Ha, ha, ha
You see every day I'm struggling
For the strength to let it go
Ha, ha, ha

You don't know me
A record can't tell ya
Uh-oh, I'm the Great Pretender
(repeat)

[Cee-Lo]
Hey say lil' buddy
Come love... good god
With your sugar brown hairs
Girl my {?} m'm'm'...
Where you at y'all
With my coolness I roll with my m' you look so good girl
I had to go and ask something to you
You so damn fine
Shawty where you from? (Get it on now)
Oh who me?
Shawty I'm from the south side of town (I'm from the south)
Where you said you from? (Get it on ya'll)
What's up now let me holla at you for a minute

I said uh, uh sugar pie
What your name is?
I been staring at you shawty all God damn night!
Can we uh conversate for some Hennessy straight
Or we can boogy-oogy down
Til' the morning light (Show your ride)
Say lil' momma I usually don't clown
Usually sit smoke a lil' bit or drink some brown liqour down
But see it's something bout the way you make a playa wanna play
So grab your glass of chardonnay and now lets go dance the night away

[Chorus]
Shawty shake it (shake it shake it)
Shake your sugar for me (shake it shake it)
(repeat 7X)

[Backbone]
Now let me introduce myself
Call me Jimmy Supa-fly
I say working them to death (Punches thrown)
You hear the linen in the falling in place
Tip-toe through the door then vacant the premesis without a trace (Oh lord)
Pardon me please, excuse my negligence
But to what do I owe the honor standing
In the presence of elignece in its essence
Simply beautiful are the words you deserve
My lil' peanut butter jelly jam preserve

[Chorus]

[Cee-Lo]
I like the way you wear you hair (Your hair)
And girl you know you look so good to me
Wait a minute girl stand right there (God damn)
You know you look so good to me
And you still gonna pay your fare
Because you know you look so good to me
Call me anytime I don't care
Because you look so good to me
Shawty let me see you shake it

[Chorus]

[Big Gipp]
Yeah
76 degrees night light Gippp
Mrs. Lady I get you out the cryer like a florist pick a tulip
She pursuaded my intervention
Kept my attention
Focusing in on every motion body
That is more blowing me kisses
Chocalate chip cookie lover
Who taught you how to shake that
Candy bows so loveley I could watch it for many moons in the same room
Consumed and enticed by your sexual foreplay
Girl.. shake it for me c'mon

[Chorus]
Yeah, mmm mmm mmm, yeah that sho' feel good
Hello! I go by the name of simply Cee-Lo Green - how do you do?
Welcome. I thought I'd seize this opportunity to tell you a little
Bit more about myself if you don't mind. This is my vision
YouknowhatI'msaying? Check me out now. Uhh

I have millenniums of material and rivers of rhythm
An entire ocean of emotion that's enlightening to swim in
Also a forest of feeling, beaten paths of peace
Trapped inside my silhouette I have to speak to release
Demanding more from the pen than a whore from the pen
The line between playing to win and sin is thin
But I walk it with grace and I talk it with taste
I am that raw, simply put, and I rest my case; it's elementary
Yet far more than resources to pay the rent for me
Everything that I've done is divine
Ask God, he'll tell ya, yeah, he mine
So, you see, you don't need another thug out of me
That is the last thing I plan to be on this LP
But I'mma go slip into something mo' comfortable and continue the lesson
No inconvenience at all, I insist on leaving an impression
So relax, and ride out. Relax, okay, and ride out
Just relax, and ride out. Players, relax, and ride out

I also solicit visual verbalism worth a visit
Intensely exquisite artism inquire all. Who is it?
It's a deliciously daring delicacy I eat to exist
Oh, his way with those words, I want seconds and thirds
Oh, hush. That's awful kind of you, you're making me blush
I could use some competition, but they not making me much
Man, this beat is like my master, it's making me bust
Hip-hop is suffering, meaning I'm a necessity, if nothing
But you like every other rapper - cornrows and a bandana
But I get a hundred and fifty thousand dollar check
Every three months off Santana
Don't you fuck up, though, my family is the whole side of Atlanta
Now, how can I say? Okay, let me just put it this way
If anyone ever contests my conquest my gun bless
Yo son just, takes one time to be one less
So you run and tell the rest that I'm the best
I sang sweet, but brang heat to bang meat
We all on the same street
And it's not that often I verbalize the essential element of surprise
I am not one of these thug rapper guys
But this one will help you realize, and use both eyes to recognize
The type of action that this amount of money buys
Now listen son, let me drop some shit on you man
I can just "do-do-do-do-do-do-do" and put a hit on you man
With hot heat that will make your heart beat quit on you man
And Mr. Dawson'll find a pretty box to fit all you man
So relax, and ride out. Just relax, young man, and ride out
Hey, you better relax, and ride out. Okay? Just relax, and ride out
I could take that shit all day
But if I only had sixteen more bars to live
I'd get high, and hopefully O.D. on an alternative
I'd give a dim lit dream, a colour scheme
And I'd swim for the sun (for fun) no matter how impossible that may seem
I'd bury my feet in the foundation of a forest Becoming one with
Everything there
I would be long. I would be right and wrong. But I'd be rare
And then I would pretend I didn't care. Use my fear
And pray that my forever would be fare
And I love you all, unconditional, I get misty already missing y'all
And then I forgive those who rhyme to kill the time
While mine cultivate the consciousness and
Chill the spine, heal the mind, yet still sublime

Ride out. Relax, and ride out. Relax, and ride out. Relax, and ride out
This is one for the road. Yeah. One time for your motherfucking mind
I told how you motherfucking play. D.F. y'all. Believe this. Yeah
Shouts out to Outkast, Goodie Mob. Yeah, Backbone, where ya at brother?
(Hey) Hahaha. Alright. (Easy now) Hahaha. Yeah. Can't nobody stop me now
No, sir. Yeah. I'm gone, y'all. Oh, man. It's lovely. Ahahah. Yeah
Somebody better stop me. Hahaha. Cause I'm good. Heheheheh. Yeah. Hahahahah
Alright now. Heheheh. Yeah. Alright, we gonna relax, cause it feels so good
Everybody doing their godamn thing. Yeah

[Intro: Timbaland]
Oh! Cee-Lo
You ready to rock with Timbo?
Oh! Let's go, boy!
ATL, talk to 'em, 'Lo!

[Verse 1: Cee-Lo Green]
How could I possibly, be inconspicuous
When my flow is fuckin ridiculous?
"That's quite an accent"—See, I'm from the South
But some of the most beautiful things come out my mouth
And I'm on stage just as soon as I come out the house
So I might as well give them something to talk about
I bust a rap to make a blind man believe in the boogie
And if you came here to move with Cee, then boogie on

[Hook: Timbaland (Cee-Lo Green)]
When you want me to come (Holla)
When you want me to come (Call me!)
When you want me to come (I'll be around)
(When you want me to come, yeah, woo! Holla)
When you want me to come (Holla)
When you want me to come (Call me!)
When you want me to come (I'll be around)

[Verse 2: Timbaland]
Here comes Timbaland, I'm also from the South
I like them girls with big butts and golds in they mouth
I come from the back road and a dirty house
If you leave the door open, moms'll cuss you out
I got a big dog in the front yard
Best buh-lieve that bitch bite hard
I got a grandaddy who think he Joe Clark
And that's how we do around these parts—oh!

[Hook: Timbaland (Cee-Lo Green)]
When you want me to come (Holla)
When you want me to come (Call me!)
When you want me to come (I'll be around)
(When you want me to come, yeah, woo! Holla)
When you want me to come (Holla)
When you want me to come (Call me!)
When you want me to come (I'll be around)

[Verse 3: Cee-Lo Green]
You see, I do what they won't do and can't do
But gon wish they did when I'm done
And with a smile on my face, give the trophy for second place rite after I won
Shake his hand, firm like a man but talk to him like a son
And this way I can still be a little somethin to everyone
And with that elegance, I rock climb to reach hints from God of relevance
Poise, position, and the plush of a revalance
And I'm outstandin, outpsoken, which is the unequivocal evidence
It is then instant vintage as it has been, ever since, ah!

[Hook: Timbaland (Cee-Lo Green)] (2x)
When you want me to come (Holla)
When you want me to come (Call me!)
When you want me to come (I'll be around)
(When you want me to come, yeah, woo! Holla)
When you want me to come (Holla)
When you want me to come (Call me!)
When you want me to come (I'll be around)
When you want me to come (Holla)
When you want me to come (Call me!)
When you want me to come (I'll be around)
(When you want me to come, yeah, woo! Holla)
When you want me to come (Holla)
When you want me to come (Call me!)
When you want me to come (I'll be around)

[Outro: Timbaland]

Uuhh Ooh! Oh no! Uh ooh! Sweet Sugar Lo and Timbo (Tim-Bo!)
Oh No, uh ooh! them niggas bouta get some mo dough (We Out...)

[Cee-Lo 1st verse]
Hey, the sun is shining looking like another wonderful day
Look through my sweet collection trying to find some good music to play
While I'm getting ready to face the world
Doing what I must do..know sugar
Nothing compares to waking up this morning to you

[Hook]
Good morning
Baby, how you been?
Did you sleep well last night honey?
Well I'm off to work again

[Cee-Lo 2nd verse]
Listen I'll call you later
Maybe we can get something to eat
How about our favorite restaurant darling
Where we usually eat
I said whew! Umm um sure looking mighty fine
I can hardly wait for quitting time

[Hook]
Good afternoon baby
I sure missed you while I was gone
But you know I got to work honey, Hey let's just do something later on

[Cee-Lo 3rd verse]
Let's go for a walk nothing gets you in the mood better than a little moonlight
Um hmm, or we can rent some movies and make it a blockbuster night, Hey
Does that sound interesting baby? Sound like an idea?
I would gladly walk you home but you're already here

[Hook]
Good night baby
I spent the whole day with my friend
Hopefully God will wake me up baby to see you in the morning

[Bridge]
Oh child
Oh because you everything, everything, everything to me
Oh yeah girl I need your love each and everyday Hey
Hmm, child
Hhmmmmmmmmm
Good night baby
In your mind...

I wanna make love but it's not quite time
I'd rather spend the night in your mind
I won't be hard to find
I'll be right there in your mind

Let me caress your consciousness
Want you to taste the thought of me
Is your imagination aroused
It ought to be
Let me seduce your soul
With every word I say
Oooo, Wait on my love
It's on its way
Whoa, may I have this dance
Your dreams and destiny
You've got years to yearn
Please say yes to me
Baby believe, believe and it will be
Prepare yourself
I promise you'll remember me
I wanna make love but it's not quite time
I'd rather spend the night in your mind
I won't be hard to find
I'll be right there in your mind

Love has lost its compassion
But no I won't commit that crime
I'd rather leave an impression
That will last your whole lifetime
You see I go deeper
Instead of standing in the shallow end
I want to please my partner
I want to fuck my friend
I want to be inside you, literally
Girl I want to use you, habitually
Was all the waiting worth it
Soon we will see
I want to remember you
And I want you to remember me

I wanna make love but it's not quite time
I'd rather spend the night in your mind
I won't be hard to find
I'll be right there in your mind

(Cee-Lo speaks)
"I want to eat your emotion
And lick your life line"
"You can search your lifetime
And not find a love like mine"

Shhhhhhhhhhhhhhh........she's sleeping

[Hook 1]

Ladies and gentlemen, Cee-Lo

[Cee-Lo]
Peace
How y'all feel out there
That's cool
Alright
You know, sometimes I wanna rap
Sometimes I wanna sing, you know what I mean
Sometimes all it calls for is a nice mellow groove
Hit of rimshot, you know
Just get, you know, get you open
But I wanna do a piece for y'all tonight, it's called sometimes
Alright, so check it out
Sometimes a stranger can be your best friend
Sometimes being angry is the best mood
Sometimes seeing you feel good makes me feel even better
Sometimes hunger is the best food
Sometimes good just ain't good enough
And other times evil will get you even
Sometimes faith is not knowing any better
Sometimes nothing is what you believe in
Woah
Sometimes I don't even have a hook

Sometimes you fail trying
And sometimes happiness hurts worse
Sometimes people live dying
Sometimes it's the last person that makes you first
Sometimes you'll keep what you don't want
And other times you'll give away what you really need
Sometimes a rich man won't have a dollar
And all a poor man has is greed
Woah

Sometimes
Sometimes I just wanna listen
Sounds good to me
Yeah
Ay yo Lock, put them strings right here
Sometimes I don't think people know I'm as good as I really am

Now my recitings are writing over rhythm's
Regularly reinacts facts of my existance
So what proof of my expertise, many emcees know of me
Using unrequested serious infested poetry
To prevoke what persistance
For instance, I don't let the T.V. screen come in between my daily routine
At a spot where me and my boy went
Someone interrupted our enjoyment
What do you know, an out of work emcee looking for employment
But I'm still curteous with my greeting, brother I'm eating
And his style sounded similar to someone elses
So evidently he's been cheating
But I couldn't question the destiny in which we meet
So, you guessed it, I suggested that he just have a seat
And then I explained to him that I remained in the mean time
Mastering mysterious methods of writing
Finding my piece of mind with soft music and moonlighting
Then supernaturaly I forsee the beginning stages
And then eventually pages get filled completely
You see, I dive into the depths of my soul
Seeking to explore the hidden treasure of a pure literature
While these others are unsure
Being that the deepness makes them doubtful
Deliberatly delaying
Saying they'll settle for whatever washes toward the shore
Delirous from dilusion
My feelings were no more direct so the conclusion is seclusion
Because mixed belief create confusion
To remain plain and simplistic, realistic
Accurate, articulate and absolutely artistic
Uninhibited, unadulterated, unstoppable
Unfuckwittable and unforgettable
But since I've been granted the power of choice
Let God bet the voice he is
So all the credibility be his
So let these be words of wisdom and in the same breath be warning
God I shine like Sunday morning
Woah
Sometimes
See you next time

[Intro: CeeLo Green]
It's the real (It's the real)
Hip-hop (Hip-Hop), hey-hey (Hey-hey)

[Verse 1: Big Rube]
As I lay motionless, wondering why we so emotionally emotionless (Scrap metal)
My focus is not to be the brunt of the joke in this (Scrap metal)
Still played, I'm not a toy
You real afraid, so I'm still a boy (Something for you haters)
But is my soul this? (Something for you haters)
Seen many-a solstices and plenty equinoxes
Some, if any, think we equal not 'cause God does, but 'cause laws force them
But what are laws if you don't enforce 'em?
Unless you get it on tape
It's more suspense and mystery than a Presidio tape
Investigation more cartoon than a kid video tape
It's civil liberties rape in Statue of Liberty shape
The American offense make you watch for the head fake
Well, down with Sam, I ain't
Three seconds in this paint will make any outside shooter faint
Wait for you to blink
So when you wake up and can't wake up, you know exactly who to thank

[Chorus: CeeLo Green]
Oh, yes, I'm sure, yes, I'm sure, I don't care anymore
Anything, anywhere, anytime, any place
Let's do this shit and get it over with
I'll run a box cutter 'cross your face
I got niggas here, I got niggas there
Ready to get down if I make the call
I don't give a fuck if your problem is big or small
Almost instantly I could say fuck it all, man, fuck it all

[Verse 2: G-Rock]
Having dealings with skill (My skill), kill if I have to kill (Kill)
Buck, dead 'em in your grill, yeah, fuck nigga for real
With a posse, I'm standin' alone, me and my nina, all-chrome
Buckin' straight at your dome, ain't stoppin' 'til the bullets gone
No, never cross no killer, lay no shit 'round no stealer
Mine, touch it, my nigga, I'll kill ya and Jesus can't even hear ya
Thrill ya like Michael Jackson, acting when the time for action
Chamdon clique out my back and Cee-Lo, he strapped with a MAC-10

[Chorus: CeeLo Green]
Oh, yes, I'm sure, yes, I'm sure, I don't care anymore
Anything, anywhere, anytime, any place
Let's do this shit and get it over with
I'll run a box cutter 'cross your face
I got niggas here, I got niggas there
Ready to get down if I make the call
I don't give a fuck if your problem is big or small
Almost instantly I could say fuck it all, man, fuck it all

[Post-Chorus: CeeLo Green]
Something for y'all haters (And imitators)
Something for y'all haters (And perpetrators)
It's the real (It's the real)
Hip-hop (Hip-hop), hey-hey (Hey-hey)
Something for y'all haters (And imitators)
Something for y'all haters (And perpetrators)
It's the real (It's the real)
Hip-hop (Hip-hop), hey-hey (Hey-hey)

[Verse 3: CeeLo Green]
See my words would be believable, believable but brief
I would even show you my teeth
You wouldn't even know that you had any beef
But, actually, I'm angry about it and I haven't had any sleep
Because of one little disrespect, it ultimately do the domino effect
Boy, don't you know that I could sit with my back to you
And still have my gat to you, so natural
Close my eyes and breathe in, do that to you
And as far as anyone that's after you, huh
The same goes for anyone that run up in your name, yes, I hate ya (I hate ya)

[Chorus: CeeLo Green]
Oh, yes, I'm sure, yes, I'm sure, I don't care anymore
Anything, anywhere, anytime, any place
Let's do this shit and get it over with
I'll run a box cutter 'cross your face
I got niggas here, I got niggas there
Ready to get down if I make the call
I don't give a fuck if your problem is big or small
Almost instantly I could say fuck it all, man, fuck it all

[Verse 4: CeeLo Green]
From the feet, the beat, the gat on the seat
And that shouldn't surprise you, oh, I've sold some pies to
Each any every stone, since I'm obviously on
It says fifty to six-five thousand's been blown
I am something to see, yet I'm nothing to touch
I'll kill ya 'bout nothing, 'cause nothing's too much
I'll put the barrel to your baby mama belly and squeeze off two
So the world won't have to deal with another fuck nigga like you, yes, I hate ya (I hate ya)

[Chorus: CeeLo Green]
Oh, yes, I'm sure, yes, I'm sure, I don't care anymore
Anything, anywhere, anytime, any place
Let's do this shit and get it over with
I'll run a box cutter 'cross your face
I got niggas here, I got niggas there
Ready to get down if I make the call
I don't give a fuck if your problem is big or small
Almost instantly I could say fuck it all, man, fuck it all

[Outro: CeeLo Green]
Something for y'all haters (And imitators)
Something for y'all haters (And perpetrators)
It's the real (It's the real)
Hey-hey (Hey-hey)
Something for y'all haters (And imitators)
Something for y'all haters (And perpetrators)
It's the real (It's the real)
Hey-hey (Hey-hey), revenge

[Hook]
See there's no way and there's no how
That I could stop now
I'mma die tryin', I'mma die trying
And sometimes I get weak from walking the road I'm on
But I'mma keep on. I'mma die tryin', I'mma die tryin' (MMMMMM)

Before we came being southern wasn't something to claim
That flag wasn't something to fly it was something to blame
Smilin' and shuckin' and jivin' I was so ashamed
They did us dirty, apparently an appropriate name
I wrote about a revolution and sung from the soul
Spoke with my spirit and mind, my ambition was blind
Answering the call of God like a child obeying
Preaching the very same proverbs they killed Martin for saying
But you can't break the mold in by holding your breath
Thought if I died for you, that would be an honorable death
So sincere my eyes begin to swell up and tear
And it's clear, my music may not do well up in here
Oh my god being a nigga must be a good payin job
With all the fringe benefits, ignorance is bliss
There is a time and a place for everybody's taste
But I know too much and I owe too much

[Hook]

So here it is, an invitation to an open book
A painful past, my heart is still broken look
I know you don't hate me, just not assured that anyone appreciate me
See I've been having a hard time selling my albums lately
In recent news The Source couldn't find any microphones to rate me
Using words like "extreme" and "alternative" to equate me
Which is true I'm in a box with a view but you still wanna gate me?
I could be a pretty good thug but it wouldn't compare to a great me
The final cross to bear, this mine, it's not a cross to share
But isn't it ironic I still went and bought a cross to wear
That obviously cost to wear
But considerably less than the price that it costs to care
And I don't have another loss to spare, how dare them say that I can't win
Even though I know talking intelligent just ain't in
You most likely to go broke when you just can't bend
So me and JJ both gon' have to paint then

[Hook]

Listen
People +Still Standing+ in line at the +World Party+ for some +Soul Food+
To get put back in that old mood
They say we like the new 'Lo
And we respect everything you trying to do 'Lo
Do what you do but just do more that you know
It's a catch 22 and I couldn't cry
And I'm under oath with them both and I couldn't lie
Custom said that I'm too dope and I coudln't fly
And you getting rich talkin shit so why shouldn't I?
I'm just playing but I guess that couldn't go without saying
I'm just gon ride this evolution until it stop me where I'm staying
But I ain't gonna have to lie to ya to make it sound fly to ya
I keep my feet on the ground and bring the sky to ya

[Hook]
Hey baby, hey baby
Hi-iiii
Laaaa, ughhhhh
Hey-ey

Hey there young man it seems like your sight's been blinded
Oh how I wish you could see
The very life that you're lived been tailored by many and mixed in ability
Oh I wish you'd do more than just keepin it real
Why don't you try being true?
One song could save the life of the young ones dependin on you
Hey young man

Hey young man I understand why you so angry
I grew up exactly the same
Daddy was gone so you had to find your own way
And he's convenient to blame
Despite those circumstances don't you stop standin
Don't Give up whatever you do
Cause just like you once were now your son's dependin on you
Hey young man
Hey there young man why degrade your only sister
And call them bitches and whores?
What if one day someone feels the same way
About that daughter of yours?
Oh if you had one inkling of an idea
Of what they had to go through
Of course she's strong but she's still depending on you
Hey young man, hey young man

Hold on
Ooooo, oooo
Well well (singing in the background)

[Laughing]
Alright y'all
(beat fades out)

[Cee-Lo]
Come on
Chop chop
Mmm hmm
Yeah man
I'm just gonna play with y'all on this
Hidey ho

Well hello, howdy do, how are you, that's good
Who me, still hot, I still got, you got me nigga
I'm here, I'm there, cause I'm wrong, cause I'm right
I can spit on anything, got plenty game, authentic
My pen's sick, forensic, defends it, he wins it
Again and a, again and a, again and a, again and a
I'm the one, come see, lookey I, and come meet
The young Cee, the one treats everything the sun seek
I'm hollering, can't help, I'm hungry
I cake rap, bake rap, sack rap, trap rap
Same shoes, same shirt, the same work, the same jerk
Claim hurt, the game hurt, my name work, it ain't work
I'm fast, time fast, I'm first, I'm last
Psychic, I knew you would like it, like this
I write this, priceless, more then my right wrist
Cock back, block track, the beat bleed, speak read
Men eat weed, bead seed, I speed read, you need me
To give it to you like you want it, I own it when I'm on it
Maintain the same thing, nigga rap about the same game
None left, shame shame, plain game, insaine
When I rap things change, me and God, same thing
Money's here, money fold, I'm young, money old
Maybe look, cross hanging down to my tummy toes
I know it, I'm a stop, I'm trying just like life
Yes I can sing, and I can rap
And I can act, and I can dance
And I can dress, sign of the best
So is my guest, man I'm impressed
Hurry hurry hurry hurry, come and see
This is just like child's play to me, ah ha
Little melody and a little drum
All I really need to have a little fun
Hush little one, let's get it done
Dress like a bum, bust like a gun
Hurry hurry hurry hurry, come and see
This is just like child's play to me, ah ha

[Ludacris]
Who the only little nigga that you know with bout fifty flows
Do about fifty shows in a week but creep on the track with my tippy toes
Shhh, shut the fuck up, I'm trying to work
Ah forget it, I'm going berzerk
Cause I stack my change, and I'm back to claim
My reign on top, so pack your thangs
I rack your brain like crack cocaine
My fame won't stop or I'll jack your chain
Give it up, ding ding ding, thanks, the price was right
That gray goose got me loose, but my eyes are tight
It's the truth, give me a light like I'm dynamite
Alright, alright, we goin ride tonight
I'm so dangerous that I gotta bang with this
You could be famous or remain nameless
Better just drop down to your knees, call upon the lord and pray
Better luck next time, cause you wanna open that door today
Your hair sorta gray, it's that sorta day
Flowing so hard over this track and I got more to say
I ain't new to this, I'm so true to this
See what you get fucking with Cee-Lo and Ludacris

[Cee-Lo]
Yes I can sing, and I can rap
And I can act, and I can dance
And I can dress, sign of the best
So is my guest, man I'm impressed
Hurry hurry hurry hurry, come and see
This is just like child's play to me, ah ha
Little melody and a little drum
All I really need to have a little fun
Hush little one, let's get it done
Dress like a bum, bust like a gun
Hurry hurry hurry hurry, come and see

Hurry hurry hurry hurry, come and see
This is just like child's play to me, ah ha
Haha
Okay, there you have it little kids
Wasn't that fun?
Yeah
Saturday morning, Cee-Lo Green and my man Ludacris
Doing this thing, ATL style
This is childs play
Seriously though
I can rap bout any you guys with my tongue tied
Ha ha ha
Don't make me get serious on your ass
You wouldn't like me when I'm serious
I could have said anything I want to

[Refrain]
Brother, you've been on my mind
Oh, brother, we've changed over time
So, brother, I'm keeping my eyes on you
I bet you don't think I know nothing but singing the blues
Oh, but brother, have I got news for you
I'm something, and I know you know that I'm something, too
Hahahaha

[Intro]
Yeah (Yeah)
(Southside, ho)
Usually, I don't get even into all this battle-rap shit and all that
(Southside, ho)
Y'know'm'sayin'? Shit's stupid
(Southside, fuck nigga)
But I'm gon' address it
(Southside, ho)
And after I get it off my chest, may God bless it, nigga
(Southside, fuck niggas)
I will invest four minutes exactly
(Southside, ho, yeah)
For everyone who had the audacity to attack me

[Verse 1]
I kept quiet, but perhaps I should have pushed this fire quicker
'Cause to just sit with this shit, I've only gotten sicker
Yet I react without even a crack in my composure
With the only way he knows to bring this shit to a closure
I'm worthy, and my associates and I named the South "Dirty" (What!)
And I'm even for sale in Braille, the deaf, dumb, and blind have heard me
But I ain't even breathing until I get an even thirty
I could casually clap up the front of somebody's throwback jersey (Oww!)

[Bridge]
You making me have to talk this way, ain't you? (Ain't you? Ain't you?)
You making me have to talk this way (Boom)
Hmm, you forcing me to walk this way (C'mon)
Maybe my album'll get bought this way

[Verse 2]
Niggas slow down around me (Errr!), I make 'em superstitious (Boom)
And one of my vices used to be wanting to look visually vicious
But instead, I use my head, and I fed niggas something nutritious
But you will appreciate what a sacrifice this is
And I know you ambitious young men—you have my best wishes
Have a piece of this pain on a platter—it's one of my best dishes
When you assassinate my character, not one remark misses
So it's gon' get funky when I'm frying these lil' fishes
Fuck faking! There has been some offense taken (Yeah)
But this itty-bitty beef is beneath me, like bacon (Oh)
But hear me when when I say: I ain't gon' hate you halfway (Uh-uh)
You know me—somebody will surely owe me
When it comes to respect, I only put my family before me (Right)
And the beat riding—tss—oh-so-slowly, but surely
And you in danger
And I'll be strict about straight e'ery one of you niggas like strangers
I'll put bullet holes (Oh) in anything that oppose (Who?)
Through car doors and clothes, amateurs and pros (Who else?)
Hardhead niggas and hoes (Yeah), also friends and foes (Alright)
Let it be known that you'll lose your life fucking around with 'Lo
This is my glockapella (Glockapella)
And I'll be wearing diamonds forever, like I'm signed to Rocafella (Right)
And I'ma bust two times in the sky (Boom, boom)
'Cause ain't nobody around here ready to die (Nuh-uh)
But if it's war that you want, can't but one side win (Boy)
And I'm damn sure ready to try, motherfucker, yeah!

[Break]
Hold on...
Hahahaha (Goddamn)
I'm all off the motherfucking beat, hold on (Talk 'bout it, 'Lo)

[Verse 3]
'Lo crazy, 'Lo'll hurt somebody bad
'Lo crazy, 'Lo'll hurt somebody dad (Man, what?)
Decide to ride down your street and just convert somebody pad (Hey)
You know, as in "house?" Hit somebody's child or somebody's spouse (Whoa)
You see what I'm saying? (See it?) And you know I can be what I'm saying
And I got the most to lose, but you stepping on my shoes (Nigga)
You become a target (Whoa), and will remain a target until you are hit
You done fucked around and found out that Cee-Lo is still down for it
'Cause I ain't scared of you (I ain't scared of you), never been scared of you (Hell, no)
If anything, I'm scared for you because I'm so ahead of you
Take that to the head, brother, 'fore I walk up on your bed, brother (Alright)
And paint you bloody red, brother (Yeah)
You heard what I said, brother?

[Break]
Motherfucker! Hahahaha (I ain't mad at these niggas)
Ah-ha, ah-ha
I tricked you (Fucker!)

[Refrain]
We got a real awful thing going down, getting down
There's a whole lot of talking going 'round (Yeah-eah)
You best believe me before I pack up and move out of town
I will gladly go'n' and Glock one of 'em down (You better believe me)
I said, bring me the funk (Bring it to me)
I want the funk (Bring it to me)
Hey, bring me the funk (Bring it to me)
Give me the funk (Bring it to me)
I said, bring me the funk (Bring it to me, goddamn it)
I can handle the funk (Bring it to me)
Hey, bring me the funk (Bring it to me)
Bring me the funk
Motherfucker! Hunh! (Hahahaha)

[Hook]
He's bad, he's Cee-Lo Green
But you can just call him the soul machine
(repeat 4x)

[Cee-Lo]
Now I came here for you to love
It's computer love
I make them cut through the rug when I do the club
I can take some mental electric sex
Refuting love
But Gunplay will be graphic if I do the thug
The day to day experience
Is the data that I download
And then remaster onto a rapture
Abracadabra before and after
Over and over
Losing account of all the dreams that I sold ya
But then I gave ya
At the speed of light trying to save ya
Then I go and now come back a row
Whoa
And oh I'm technic to God in a fashion but you can just call me Lo Go

[Bridge]
Whenever you want some soul
Start him up
Whenever you need some soul
Start him up
See he's been given the power
To take you wherever you want to go
Start him up
And tell him what you want

[Bridge 2]
Once you start up the soul machine
You will see what I mean
Open your eyes and enjoy the dream
He can do anything

[All]
He's bad!

[Spoken: Sir Cognac, the Conversation]
And now, the night time...

[Verse 1: Cee-Lo]
Late in the evening
There is the thieving and the trickin and the trappin
And they ain't actin
We make it happen
We'll get the guns on anyones and get to clappin'
Even for rappin'
Does it surprise ya?
Well, readjust and reconcile and recognize up
That I'm a writer
Oh yes, I write up
Now open wide and let me put the night inside ya

[Verse 2: Cee-Lo]
This is music usually confused with major motion picture
No one is stricter about it being status for scripture
No put-on, your good is gone, you're wearing what don't fit you
You better run, little one, 'cause the rhythm's gonna get you
And when it hits you, it usually hits somebody with you
Make 'em risk a total eclipse of sun to get richer
Maybe a little time and something fine—that'll fix you
Well, she'll love you, but got to remember to miss you
The nightlife, the dark side of the city
Gon' be on 24 inches, and be defenseless
The nightlife, the dark side of my heart
Where no one really knows you, and no one's supposed to
The nightlife, the dark side of my soul
Where if somebody cross you, kill 'em up off you
The nightlife, the dark side of the moon
Where the sun is scared to come
Give me some (Ha!)

[Break: Cee-Lo]
Take me where the darkness is still beautiful!

[Chorus: Cee-Lo]
Oh-oh-oh, wanna go, wanna go, wanna go
Wanna know, wanna go, wanna go
Wanna go, wanna go, wanna go
Wanna know, wanna go, wanna go
(Give me the night!)
The night is gonna get you, ahh, it's gonna get you
The night is gonna get you, ahh, it's gonna get you
(Give me the night!)
The night is gonna get you, ahh, it's gonna get you
The night is gonna get you, ahh, it's gonna get you
(Give me the night!)
The night is gonna get you, ahh, it's gonna get you
The night is gonna get you, hey, it's gonna get you
(Give me the night!)
The night is gonna get you, ahh, it's gonna get you
It's gonna get you!

[Verse 3: Chazzie]
I'll be your lady
Fairweather friend
I'll be honest
And I'll pretend
I'll act like I love you, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I'll act like I love you, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
You gotta listen to me now

[Break: Cee-Lo]
Take me where the darkness is still beautiful

[Verse 3: Cee-Lo]
I've been runnin' since "Rock Box"
I've cocked Glocks and locked blocks
And rocked rocks and dropped tops
The obviously odd, five-foot six-inch god
In the flesh, I've been the best, I'll get in your chest and in the mess
In your vest and out your back without even getting out the 'Lac
I lied about how I really handled that situation about the AK
I'll hit back, if your lead was the only collateral you got, I'll get that
Now, get flat, say a prayer, 'cause shawty want this shit back
Sit back, this chitchat is pitch-black, but you can still see what I'm saying
And heavy is how I weigh in
Niggas love singing sad songs about how bad they want to stay in
Either a whole lotta basketball playing or make use of some yay' then

[Spoken: Sir Cognac, the Conversation & Cee-Lo]
Wooooo, ooh!
Lord, sure feel good to me
I promise...
I promise...
Not to ever, ever leave this night life alone
This me (Me too!)
Yup, this me (And me three)
Have mercy

[Break: Cee-Lo]
Take me where the darkness is still beautiful!

[Chorus: Cee-Lo]
Oh-oh-oh, wanna go, wanna go, wanna go
Wanna know, wanna go, wanna go
Wanna go, wanna go, wanna go
Wanna know, wanna go, wanna go
(Give me the night!)
The night is gonna get you, ahh, it's gonna get you
The night is gonna get you, ahh, it's gonna get you
(Give me the night!)
The night is gonna get you, ahh, it's gonna get you
The night is gonna get you, ahh, it's gonna get you
(Give me the night!)
The night is gonna get you, ahh, it's gonna get you
The night is gonna get you, hey, it's gonna get you
(Give me the night!)
The night is gonna get you, ahh, it's gonna get you
It's gonna get you!
I am the music... (I am...)
I've yet to define myself as just, one thing. (I am...)
Let's just say that

I am the actual and factual supernatural... sight and surrounds
Signification of conversation
Two or more words rhyming in song form or spoken syncupation
Heh, the reason the rudery reanimation and realization of life is rhythm
I am the heartbeat and the heartache, the here and now
I am the purpose, the point... the living proof of a god somewhere
The lifeline, lifelike laserbeam, the progression and direction
Always will be always was
What all comes from and all must return
The center of a perfect circle, I am your soul
Music of your mind
Each feeling causing each function to be in conjunction with the music
I am the music...

*break*

I am the music
*beat changes*

Let's get started shall we, cause you know it's time gone
Every time these niggas rhyme wrong
So uhh, lights, camera, action I'm on
I'll have them standing in line to get their mind blown
I'm selling soul
Rapping and singing and screaming and yelling soul
Manufacturing, marketing, pricing, packaging, and e-mailing soul
With no rehearsal, this one verse'll, coerce you, like a commercial
But what I must first do
Is make my presentation a bit more personal
Everything must go - for a small price you can have the heart of me
There is no part of me that can't be calculated into a commodity
My musings amount to a milestone a million miles above monotony
And it'll make you feel so good, it got to be God, it got to be
I paint prophecy, you know airbrush atrocity with philosophy
And people ask me am I gon' preach one of these days
And I just tell 'em "possibly"
If you let me, I'll end up being everything probably
And obviously it's like any other job would be so you might as well thank God for me
But isn't it amazing, how the antenna ain't nothing but a sinner
You just can't go and be ordained over dinner
Now I can interest an intellectual or A-B-C it for a beginner
But yes my seasons still change, and it is almost winter
And it give it to you at God-speed, but yet it's gentle
And when I rhyme I make reading fundamentals or even black and white
My lyric is live and living color, my flow if fluorescent
Like scripture highlighted in bright yellow
And all this for $9.99, shit that's wonderful
And the great thing about it is, if you disagree you're money's refundable
But there's always something rewarding, about every Cee-Lo Green recording
Cuz even after all your expenses people still aspire affording
It's incredible how convincing I can be with a camera pointed at me
But really sometimes rapping feel like tapping to make a cracker happy
But when the DAT play and the beat get bumping like adolescent acne
It's kinda sad but it's showtime, my sentiment exactly
So don't get mad, everybody's doing it
You know you wouldn't mind a commercial with your own tennis shoe in it
Whether you're selling a dream, selling a scheme, or playing a role
Like it or not we're selling soul...

[Verse 1]
I have already seen my future
And it looks exactly like you
And being in love is sure enough a battle
But I am determined to fight on through
Now some people might consider me a star or somethin'
But shit, they need to shine the light on you
If loving you is wrong
I'm sorry but right won't do, I wanna

[Hook: Pharrell Williams]
Live, live, live, live together
Baby we can make it, but we got to chase it
We got to live, live, live, live forever
Didn't you know we can live forever, yeah

[Verse 2]
I know you see me over here in the darkness
Talk please, stop pretending that you heartless
Okay, okay, okay, alright, okay you win, babe
Could you find a way to forgive me again, babe?
Get on my knees right here on the dance floor for ya
I'll tap dance for tips at the front door for ya
All I'm tryin' to say is forward from this day I wanna live

[Hook: Pharrell]
Live, live, live, live together
Baby we can make it, but we got to chase it
We got to live, live, live, live forever
Didn't you know we can live forever, yeah

[Bridge]
You hear me woman?
What, you don't think I'll make a fool out of myself in this club this evening, girl?
You gotta know that, gotta know
You gotta know, gotta know
That I love you, baby

[Hook: Pharrell/Cee-Lo]
Live, live, live, live together (that's why)
Baby we can make it, but we got to chase it (that's why)
We got to live, live, live, live forever
Didn't you know we can live forever, yeah
Hey, hey, hey... hey...
Hey, hey, hey... heeey...

[Hook]
Ooh ask me my nigga

And always remember what it was my nigga

La da da da... la dadadadada... 

[4X]

[Verse 1]
When we were friends, the days would begin and end
Went from boys to men, we boys 'til then
We know each other real, we know each other rules
And we wore each other's clothes and each other's shoes
But in an instance, the days become distance
Your path doesn't go in the same direction his went
And can't help but be scared
Of the virtually unknown up ahead (I heard what you said)
But I'll be fine
Whether it is favor or failure, it must be mine
Well he can stand still, if that's how that man feel
Cuz what can't can't and whatever can will
So I'm walking toward my future with my back to it
Hoping you look up and see me as a reason to do it
When you get grown it's a given
You damn near gotta do the same thing for a living

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
And my cousin I love him like a son cause I was him
And he think his thuggin' pleases me but it doesn't
How could I applause it when I had caused it
But if it's God's plan for him, I guess I ain't cost shit
For what I gave him - wasn't so bad I couldn't save him
Either they'll enslave him or a gun'll grave him
I still believe in him but he think I'm leavin him
When I be busy he think I'm bob-n-weavin him
I probably sound like his daddy
But over the phone, cause I ain't around - like his daddy
When we talk I wanna hear you be productive
Conversate for hours 'bout something constructive
But it never come up
With all them niggas round your neck you ain't gon' never come up
Maybe I'm jealous cause you love them more
Can't understand what you love them for
Don't get me wrong you know I love them too
But you know who I always hold above them, you
And it ain't nobody business
I'll just make believe that music can miraculously mend this
So I'll be a sound
And then you do your thing to it and we mix it down
And make a song my nigga, cause even when I'm away I'll always be around

[Hook]

[Intro]

Cuz you the one girl, you the one girl
You the one girl, you the one girl
Put your finger in the air if you the one girl
Put your finger in the air if you the one

[Verse One: Cee-Lo]
See when we ride through, we let them see it from the side view
Slow and even so you know no one denied you
The parking lot look like these niggas like to ride too
They didn't win but I must admit they tried to
Look like we talked up, when we walked up
And when we walked in, money talk then
The bar was bought then, we couldn't be caught then
I see you looking lil' girl, let's go get lost then
Every so often out on and off them (I wanna go shit and you know this)
Well is there anyone else that you could go with
Cool run it back OK, see if she'll play wit Pha

[Hook]
You the one girl, you the one girl
You the one girl, you the one girl
Put your finger in the air if you the one girl
Put your finger in the air if you the one

Cuz you the one girl, you the one girl
You the one girl, you the one girl
Put your finger in the air if you the one girl
Raw, Raw, Raw, Raw-hide!

[Verse Two: T.I.]
'Bout ten mo minuets and I'm ready to ride
I got ten mo bitches I'mma fit up inside
This suburban or Excursion or whatever I ride
I bet it's chrome on the wire, vogue on the tire
T.I.P. refer to me as your majesty or sire
Higher then the rest, Italian drop dead fresh
So much say what I feel with southern finesse
So debonair if he dare bet he got best dressed
Full length mink, gator belt gator vest including shoes
A ten thousand dollar outfit bitch
Yes, dude he dress to impress
A bitch enough to make her want to give me her dress
Blessed with the gift of gab to get gals
Hot enough to hit they pals so get down
You looking good enough to come give me a kiss now
Get a room at the Swiss big as a beach house

[Hook]
You the one girl, you the one girl
You the one girl, you the one girl
Put your finger in the air if you the one girl
Put your finger in the air if you the one

Cuz you the one girl, you the one girl
You the one girl, you the one girl
Put your finger in the air if you the one girl
Put your finger in the air if you the one

[Verse Three: Cee-Lo]
You're lookin nice. Hell, let's toast to the broken ice
We've seen each other once and already we've spoken twice
So stay or at the most a moment longer to hear me say
I really did miss you the last time that you went away
I'm serious, I must have you, I won't waste your time
And have you wishin' that somehow you could replace the time
I don't do any magic tricks to try and make the mind
I just convinced that the reality is that you have to race the time
She said "You a playa ain't you, could have what you want can't you"
I replied that I'm also an artist baby I could paint you
In the frame and I don't try hard to not be the same
So she knew she was gon' come before she came

[Hook]
You the one girl, you the one girl
You the one girl, you the one girl
Put your finger in the air if you the one girl
Put your finger in the air if you the one
Cuz you the one girl, you the one girl
You the one girl, you the one girl
Put your finger in the air if you the one girl
Raw, Raw, Raw, Raw-hide!(Girl did you know that ahh...)

[Cee-Lo]
It's our privilege, to have had this conversation
It's our privilege, and to have had this relation
It's our privilege, I been searching all evening
For somebody who can and finally sent me the one
It's our privilege, to have made you laugh
It's our privilege, and to have crossed your path
It's our privilege, your the star yes you are
Can have your autograph cuz you lookin like the one
It's our privilege, to have seen your face
It's our privilege, and I bet you taste so good, let's get one thing understood
I'll be good yes I would, especially for the one
It's our privilege, let have a head-on collision
It's our privilege, girl you made the right decision
It's our privilege, (laughing)
Hey now here we go let's start the show
Those that know me call me 'Lo
But you can call me The Soul Machine
Watch - HEEEEYYYY YEE-EH-YEAH-EE-YEAH - See what I mean?
Four million flavors of the southern soul flower
But the power that you get from the heart of a human being
Only the mind is mechanic the dynamic happens
When the divine starts to intervene
Have mercy if I seem to be heavy
I don't mean to be heavy
But come let me say this last thing
There's a beginning and the ending and the message I'm sending
Is make the most of the inbetween

[Bridge]
It's like I'm standing on my tippy-toes to touch a star (a star)
Trying to catch joy in a glass jar
And yes by far I'm so much further than they are
HEEEEEEEYYYYYYYYY

[Hook]
Turn the radio on, let the music play
If I could I'd dance my life away
And if you can't seem to find any words to say
Make a joy-ful noise, look around it's another day
When you see me you would know that you saw me
Because he always got on his game and his good shoes
Difficult to stop creating can't wait
Cause they came to see Dr Green tell 'em the good news
Isn't it ironic how it feels so good?
But I was only just singing the blues
I wouldn't open my mouth about it at all
If I thought that I was only just singing the fool
Have mercy if I seem to be heavy
I don't mean to be heavy
Maybe 'Lo you should lighten up
I really would if I could
But I really don't think that anybody shell out enough
And I really think true wealth is home and happiness and health
A little cash and you'll need nothing else
And as far as me being good, I can't help myself
HEEEEEEEEYYYYYYYYYY

[Hook]
Turn the radio on, let the music play
If I could I'd dance my life away
And if you can't seem to find any words to say
Make a joy-ful noise, look around it's another day

So when you really really need you some soul
I mean dead serious damn near bout to die bout some
Don't be too proud to turn your radio way up loud
Close your eyes and have fun
I used to feel like God was gonna call me too soon
The reason why I had to have my son
And every time I've ever opened my mouth and said something
Bout living was to earn my one
Have mercy if I seem to be heavy
I don't mean to be heavy
Wait I'm almost done
And God can truly work a miracle - Look at me
Isn't it obvious that I'm one?
And I sing because I'm happy
And I sing because I'm free (I'm free)
And this my own little thing yes I agree
But don't you want your kids to grow up to be just like me?
HEEEYYYYYYYYYYYYYY

[Hook]
Turn the radio on, let the music play
If I could I'd dance my life away
And if you can't seem to find any words to say
Make a joy-ful noise, look around it's another day

If you take a chance to let me put them thangs on you

Wanna see me do it big, I can show you how it goes
Take you from an amateur to being professional

[Verse 4: Lil Wayne, Swizz Beatz]
Okay, I can transform ya like a Transformer
I can turn you from a human to a Carter
Take you off the bench, t-turn you to a starter
Then I take you home and put you on a charger
Then-Then my car transforms to a charter
And we can fly to wherever you ever thought of
Haha, I take you to where it's warmer
Then I gotta rip off your dress like a warm up
Haha, but I'm just gettin' warmed up
So tell your man he better get his Voltron up
I transform her to a Ducati
Then I transform me to a Bugatti
'Cause her form puts me in a trance
I transform smaller and she puts me in her pants
Swizz-Swizz on the beat, Chris move ya feet
And Weezy transform a good girl to a freak (Bounce)

[Chorus: Swizz Beatz, Chris Brown, Both]

Hold your drinks up like you was celebratin'
Hold your guns if they is hella hatin'
I'm so clean and them, they got rabies

Ans, Wayfarers, mmm-hmm
'Ye do you play fair? Mmm-mmm
Grab your remote for the reason they made TiVo
Snap the Nikons at the icon with Nikes on
I heard you like to do it with the lights on
But I really make babies when the mic's on
Check out all my kids, that bought all my cribs
Got me out of that apartment, you have got to pardon him
I am so retarded with a spit like a retarded kid that spits
Oops, I ain't mean to say that ****
I told my homie Chris, these chicks is dangerous
You need a girl that's A-List, not one that just barely made it on a list
'Cause from wall to wall, we got it poppin' right now
It's a hundred girls, tryna get down, down, down

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Baby girl, gotta tell you
Seen you somewhere before, you look familiar
You had a red shirt, Gucci slacks, and a Gucci bag to match it
Tell me you remember that, baby girl
But, lady, never mind that
Can I take you out later? And here's my contact
Can you do me this favor? Let me spend this paper
On you 'cause it's just sitting and let's spend it and go

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
Let me, let me

Girl, do you got a man? Better yet, girl, what's your name?

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
Just let me, let me, guarantee, guarantee
I'll make your da-a-ay, okay

I'm trained, I know how to do things
My thing hot like blue flame
Flame, the fireman put it out
She hot, the fireman put her out
All she gotta do is call up emergency
And I will be on my way to the house
Knock, knock? I know somebody home
Don't leave me knockin', baby
All you gotta do is bring that corn
And we can get it poppin', baby

[Intro]
Hey
We need to stay together, girl
Think about it
There was something about me and you, girl
Uh
Look here

[Verse 1]
When God created human beings
Bet he didn't think of bombs and things
I bet he wonders why
Just like I never imagined it would be
Anything between you and me
I know 'cause I cry, I cry

[Chorus]
You were my sunrays
Without you, girl, there was no days
Never dreamt I'd speak the phrase
Now what the fuck just happened? (Come on)
You were the heart I owned
The beat just like a metronome (Uh)
Can't breathe, my heart is gone
Now what the fuck just happened? (What just happened, girl?)

[Verse 2]
I was always the one behind (Yeah)
You would run up and keep me in line
Looked up to you, damn, this hurts (Oh)
All these years of discipline (Come on)
Just to end up here at the end
Can you tell me what I've learned, what I've learned?

[Bridge]
Oh
We need to stay together, girl
Uh, oh
Hey, uh
We need to stay together, girl
Think about it
Come on

[Chorus]
You were my sunrays (Oh)
Without you, girl, there was no days
Never dreamt I'd speak the phrase
Now what the fuck just happened?
You were the heart I owned (Come on)
The beat just like a metronome
Can't breathe, my heart is gone (Uh)
Now what the fuck just happened?

[Post-Chorus]
You were my friend (Oh)
My friend 'til the end (Uh)
You were my friend (Hey)
Now what the fuck just happened? (Come on)

[Chorus]
You were my sunrays
Without you, girl, there was no days
Never dreamt I'd speak the phrase
Now what the fuck just happened?
You were the heart I owned
The beat just like a metronome
Can't breathe, my heart is gone (Uh)
Now what the fuck just happened?
You were my—

[Outro]
Uh, ayy
We gotta stay together, girl
Think about it
It might just work
Uh
We gotta stay together, girl

Can you find it in your heart?
'Cause we gotta stay together, girl

Hey

We gotta stay together, girl
Yeah
Uh
Hey, baby
Oh
Oh
Hey
It just might work
Ooh
Oh
Hey, baby, you just might wanna think about it
It might just work for you and me after all
See, 'cause
You don't want me to go crazy, girl
And chase you, yeah
I could really lose my mind, you know?
Over you
Think about it
I mean, I ain't crazy or nothing
I'm just crazy about you
What's wrong with that?
Huh?

[Part I: I've Seen the Light]

[Verse 1: Pharrell]
Four in the morning she appeared there to me
Said she had the secret to life
She wandered to my heart and said that you'll believe
Felt my neck and then opened my eyes

[Hook]
But I've seen the light
I've seen the light, you're the one girl
And then it hit me, it felt like lightning
And then it hit me I wasn't frightened
Cause I've seen the light

[Pharrell]
Things will soon change, you will see, you will see
The light will chase away the dark
She said you'll be okay if you listen to me
All the superstars are burning out

[Hook]
But I've seen the light
I've seen the light, you're the one girl
And then it hit me, it felt like lightning
And then it hit me I wasn't frightened
Cause I've seen the light

[Pharrell]
Yes we've got dreams, something you won't believe
The desert was hot, the air was dry
She gave me instruction to play my magic keys
And magic treats starts falling from the sky

[Hook]
But I've seen the light
I've seen the light, you're the one girl
And then it hit me, it felt like lightning
And then it hit me I wasn't frightened
Cause I've seen the light

[Part II: Inside of Clouds]

I can smell it when I go outside (outside)
Then it just pours
It gives us peace then all in the town is quiet (outside)
That's what rains for
All the kids see rain and scream no no
Run off the bus and they will just stay in
Me I love her rain fills the potholes
Me and my cell but that's what we played in
Ever wonder exactly where the sun goes
Did it go or did something shade it?
The sun gives light cuz it is the window
The rain gives life cuz it is amazing(x2)

The inside of clouds (the inside of clouds)
That's the window to the sky
Proves it
The inside of clouds (the inside of clouds)
That's the window to the sky
Proves there's life

[Pharrell Williams & Chad Hugo]
All the kids see rain and scream no no
Run off the bus and they will just stay in
Me I love how rain fills the potholes
Me and my cell but that's what we played in
Ever wonder exactly where the sun goes
Did it go or did something shade it?
The sun gives light cuz it is the window
The rain gives life cuz it is amazing
The inside of clouds (the inside of clouds)
That's the window into the sky
Proves there's life
(phone rings)

[Ludacris]
Hello?

[Woman]
Baby you will not believe this

I know a way to get back that'll make you glad, you heard?

[Ludacris]

[Woman]

Yep, oh, let me grease them thighs
Then turn it on around and get a back massage
Oh, yep, cause I aim to please

[Hook]

[Ludacris]

Boo, can you please come see me?

[Verse 2: Ludacris]
Wait, no need to explain

Yep, oh, and do your gangster strut
There'll be a stretch limousine that'll pick you up
Oh, yep, bring it straight to me
I'll be on the top floor, hit the penthouse suite
Yep, oh, come on out your threads
And get wet, the shower got about fifty heads
Oh, yep, blow a sack with me
And head come on outside to the balcony
Yep, oh, you're a popular girl
But I'd like to introduce you to the top of the world
Oh, yep, and let the games begin
Don't you love the way the breeze just hits your skin
Yep, oh, before we do it again

[Verse 3: Ludacris]
Oh, wipe your tears away
Give your boy 10 minutes cause I'm on my way
Yep, oh, and quit the whoopty whoop
Cause I bet you never rolled in a Bentley coupe
Oh, yep, the inside is snug
Take your boots off and baby put your feet on the rug
Yep, oh, and put the drinks aside
Just lay back kick it and enjoy the ride
Oh, yep, let the speakers bleed
And I hope you don't mind if I increase the speed
Yep, oh, feel the engine thrust
Let it flow through your body, your adrenaline rush
Oh, yep, I know it turns you on
Feeling like you're in a place where you really belong
Yep, oh, go and grab your clutch
And I can make you come again without a single touch, uh

[Woman]
Ay, gracias por todo papi

[Verse 1: Ludacris & Jamie Foxx]
Country names, country slang, fiends at the liquor sto'
Black cruisin', craps shootin', fifty on the ten-to-four
Overcast, the forecast shows clouds from plenty dro
And we ready for war in the state of (Georgia!)
Yeah, dirty words, dirty birds, it's mean in the Dirty South
If you ever disrespect it, then we'll clean out ya dirty mouth
Bulldogs clockin', these lookout boys is hawkin'
You gotta be brave in the state of (Georgia!)
I got five Georgia homes where I rest my Georgia bones
Come anywhere on my land and I'll aim at ya Georgia dome
If you get into an altercation, just hop on ya mobile phone
And tell somebody you need help in the middle of (Georgia!)
We some ATL thrashers, scope ya punk and then smash ya

Don't know who they gonna get or who them robbers gonna hit
That's why I keep my Georgia TEC in the state of (Georgia!)

It ain't nothin' on my mind but (Georgia) we ain't playin' with ya
We on the grind in (Georgia) all the time
It ain't nothin' on my mind but (Georgia) we ain't playin' with ya

[Verse 2: Smoke & Jamie Foxx]
I'm from the home of neckbones
Black eyed peas, turnip and collard greens
We the children of the corn, dirtier than Bob Marley's pee-pee
GA, the Peach State, where we stay
My small city's called Albany (Georgia!)
Hahaha, pecan country like catfish with grits
Candy yams and chitlins, grandma's homemade baked biscuits
The land of classical Caprices and Impalas and Super Sports
Ingredients in this peach cobbler called Georgia (Georgia! Hahaha)
I love the women out in L.A. and the shoppin' stores in New York
The beaches in M.I.A but ain't nothin' like that GA red clay
Look on ya map, we right above Florida, next to 'Bama
Under that Carolina to Tennessee, you'll see (Georgia! Hahaha)
Where Gladys Knight took the midnight train
The birthplace of Martin Luther King
Where ass so plump and hips are thick
Where 'Llac trucks sittin' on twenty-sixes
Know where you goin' or you'll be lost
Found in these plumb trees in the South
These choppers'll tomahawk your top down here in (Georgia!)
Hahaha

[Hook: Shawn Jay & Jamie Foxx]
We on the grind in (Georgia) all the time
It ain't nothin' on my mind but (Georgia) we ain't playin' with ya
We on the grind in (Georgia) all the time
It ain't nothin' on my mind but (Georgia) we ain't playin' with ya

[Verse 3: Shawn Jay & Jamie Foxx]
Now I was born in the belly on the bottom of the map
Where the wet paint drip jelly on Pirellis
And the chrome on the Chevys when I'm choppin' in the trap
Country as hell, they some warriors
Tote somethin' that spray same shape as Florida
Lookin' for me boy, you'll find me
Down in Dougherty County in a small city
Called Albany, Georgia (Georgia!)
Where they used to call us some bamas
And now they jockin the grammar
Watch your mouth 'less you out for some manner
But ya hustlers wasn't on every corner
Like the Waffle House in Atlanta
R.I.P Camoflauge out in Savannah (Georgia!)
Now you might come for vacation, leave on probation
Home of the strip club, known for the thick girls
Where the tricks put tips in the tip cup
For the thick chick in the thong with the big butt
Wanna get love? Won't be cheap, long money like Peachtree
Man, she take it off like Freaknik down here in (Georgia!)
When you see them confederate flags, you know what is
Yo' folks picked cotton here, that's why we call it the field
I got a Chevrolet on twenty-sixes
I'm from GA, GA! (Georgia!)

[Hook: Field Mob, Ludacris & Jamie Foxx]
We on the grind in (Georgia) all the time

[Outro: Jamie Foxx]
Georgia, Georgia
Georgia, Georgia
Georgia!

[Shareefa]
Feel like niggas taking us as a joke
Gotta show 'em who boss
My team gotta eat

You niggas be stupid and come with that beef shit you losin
My squad is guerillas no questions don't like us then sue us
A natural disaster I follow the footsteps of Luda
It's my time to shine
Don't need no co-signer I speak through my music I'm tighter
Than any female in your camp, see I'm taking the title
Think I don't see these snakes hatin on me
Time to expose these chicks soundin like me

[Lil' Fate]
Cheah! Lil' Fate, nigga
G-Road, Southside

You niggas can't compete, I do this in my sleep
Dream about money, laying on million dollar sheets
Look at my feet, Louis, Gucci
To me Bathing Ape cheap, truly who he
Thank he is lookin all fruity?
Ghetto-ass nigga got some money and turned bougie
Look at all them groupies, bopping, jocking
Fuck that shit, Lil' Fate's a problem, and you can't stop him

[Tity Boi]
I got a buncha shit
I got a buncha shit

Buncha flows, buncha dough, me and a buncha hoes
Drop some elbows on to ya, call 'em Dusty Rhodes
I done bought alot of ice, I don't fuck with clothes
I was a felon, you see me fail
Now the truck so big I need CDL's
Only child that's poverty stricken
Project lifestyle, I will get rid of you nigga
Quicker than a sack off in the trap
Do it like the dons do it
I'mma serve the next car that come through here

[Dolla Boy]
We defeated the odds, my squad is the realest
End up reaching the stars, they say the sky was the limit
From the start to the finish the hardest that did it
Anything different is not realistic, we're not listening
This is now a intro of a click called DT
Punch you in your shit folk, get wrong, silencer hit home
Ugly when they hit home
Tell them sucka niggas we from Southside we been on, we been on

[Brolic D]
Now I'm the hood's best I dun travel the long road up on this rap quest
Strap vest young'n, North Carolina accent
Don't act amped, Mac 10 bring truth with its back stance
Black bands on the money knots when I'm in the spot
Posted whipping pigeons in the kitchen for them lemon drops
I'll fix ya when I hit ya clip hit ya for your lemon pop
Nowadays I ain't on the block pitching but I'm in the spot shifting
For the top and the 6 is from the lot

[Perfect Harmony]
Oasis of this desert rap mirage hierarchy
KN guns play for the your Suns like Barkley
So don't bother me, we got choppers like west coast or Orange County
Born with that norm about me
They be high up like a balcony
Inspiration get it out of me especially when they doubting me
I'll never go back to the Bedford Drive way of living
Cause I thrive on precision you're high off wisdom
Yes I am a Christian, I make niggas listen
How my intermission one time found it's way in prison
Cause I don't act up, make you think
You hear that loud beep on a Mack Truck, ya hear me? Yeeeah!

[Small World]
Since I been wit a DTP, man everything just been better man
Better whips, better chains, better grip in the bank
Extra clips cause the young boy gun got better aim
Young veteran, let me spell my name, S-M-A-L-L-W-O-R-L-D
You will honor me, cover y'all niggas in dirt like pottery
My influence on this earth's surface is certain 4.4 certain to blow
You who it's curtains fo' when it's for Kurtis Blows
This here for the world to know, we fixing to blow like Merlin's nose
Twist chicks and curl they toes, then twist and twirl the dro

[Smoke]
They say roses are red so is the gold on my neck
They say violets are blue and then my diamonds are too
D.T.P., got me on the bubble like court top
Since I met Luda I been playing diamond like shortstops
Sportin' rocks whiter than caucasians
Yellower than a coward tar hills in my red chain
Bluer than Smurfette's face, see through like an X-Ray
Thanks to Chak and Jeff lots of wealth
Blocks and bells and stock and shares, I'm outta here

[Shawn J]
Man, when it come to getting head I'm the local champ
The only male that get licked more than a postage stamp
It's a house in my garage, the car came with a green card
If you're a peon that means it's Eu-ro-pean
Punch lines bruise egos, rap Zab Judah
Don't get *Furious 2 Fast* and *Crash* like Luda
Get dashed on, Bobby Johnson that ass
Got potatoes for haters, niggas want beef, they get mashed on

You ain't know? Shawn mothafuckin' J, D.T.P
FPI, every mothafuckin..

[I-20]
It's the verse that you been waiting on, from the nigga they be hating on
20 is the anchor every bitch is conversating on
Your crib got square feet, too much for me to talk about
You saving for your car note, my driveway's a parking lot
Eastside OG, they hate it when a nigga leave
I'm coming up in this world, you niggas dry heave
This is my speed I been here from the first day
Y'all niggas can't take our spot, y'all just valets

[Ludacris]
Motherfuckin right. You betta understand it man, it's a Family Affair
Disturbing Tha Peace. Ludacris on the microphone
And as I told you before, we just getting started
That's right. We don't die, we multiply, nigga
So whoever want it, come on and get it
Whatever you want, we could supply it
That's right dammit
Oh wait a second y'all thought I wasn't gonna rap on this motherfucker too?
I'm the boss nigga, look...

Motherfucker, I'm a monster in this game, I thought I told you before
Fans so geeked up you think I sold them some blow
They sold on the flow, this rap game I'm closin the do'
5 years in a motherfucking row, who want it? I got it
Cuz my raps are chaotic, your face blue like Hypnotiq
Cause I'm a multi-millionaire who still using Ebonics
Or country grammar we gon' bananas in South Atlanta
Jesus was a carpenter so we're proud about cocking them hammers. Nigga

I'mma leave you with that, think about. Let's go...

[Hook: I-20]
It's some real niggas here, it's some real niggas here
It's some real, it's some real, it's some real niggas here
It's some real niggas here, it's some real niggas here
All the time we steady screamin' DTP for life!

[Verse 1: I-20]
It's clear who on top dawg, I guess I ain't supposed to count
A 1/4 mill before the deal, my wife was spendin' most of that (yeah!)
Niggas buy the bar out, thinkin' they could hang with us
FUCK it Chaka, buy the club cause we brought some change with us
But if my money wasn't straight, I'd go right back & rob a nigga
I'm tryna get that Maybach & goin' back to maul the nigga!
The Glock will scare most niggas, but some will try to act hard
SK-32, call that shit my black card!
& everybody want somethin' you can bet yo' life on it
Some hoes will try to give you head, others put a price on it
I-Dub, young dealer, know the name & take it down
Extacy to cocaine, bag it up & break it down
& yeah this might surprise you, you are being lied to
FUCK if he real I need some shit that I can ride to
Bang bang, shoot 'em up, nigga that's the motto here
Livin' fo' today cause you might not see tomorrow here

[Hook: I-20] Repeat 2X

[Lil' Fate talking in background]
Tell 'em, tell 'em!!! Yeeah (yeeah), look

[Verse 2: Lil' Fate]
I ain't gotta try dawg, I can get gangsta too
The ground'll be Blood red, your face'll be Crip blue
Can of whoop-ass I'mma open soon as I spot you
For talkin' all that bullshit off in them interviews
We ain't gotta rob you, we gettin' money over here
No album dropped, still shawty is a millionaire
Put a price on your head if you wanna take it there
Funeral, front row, mama cryin' +Right Thurr+
+Jackpot+ took shots and got dropped all because
He was poppin' off at the mouth like a ho does
Bitch you can't expose us, naw it ain't no love
When you see us in the streets act like you don't know us
Slim said, "Don't let up!" so I had to stay on him
Just to set the record straight - this is Lil' Fate, homie
Only use if you or don't know me to light up the streets
Better watch your words when you talkin' 'bout Disturbing Tha Peace

[Hook: I-20] Repeat 2X

[Verse 3: Ludacris]
Hailin' from Blacklanta Metropolis & hangin' on the block with us
You don't need laser vision to see it ain't no FUCKIN' stoppin' us
Keepin' a gang of niggas that be layin' down that murder game
Get that ass flame broiled, you SWEAR we worked at Burger King
Swervin' mane, up and down the block
Rock, steady cops
Heavy on the booty of that Chevy please BELIEVE ME!
Sippin' on that 'Nac
I'm ready to put a nigga on his belly or his back
Cause we ain't goin' down EASY!
& that's if we go down at all, I'm quick to throw down & brawl
I'll punch a hater in his throat for talkin' nonsense (blah!)
& we won't back down at all until you back down and fall
So tell Osama DTP's about that bomb shit (blah!)
We convicts like Akon & Young Jeez
I can blow you off the map with two grips & one squeeze (aaahhh!)
Just for walkin' on my turf you pay fees
Or get a bullet to yo' teeth, tell these boys to say, "CHEESE!!!"

[Hook: I-20] Repeat 2X
Yeah.. we gon' send this one out
To e'rybody that put mo' into they cars than they do they relationship
Let's ride

[Hook]
Two miles an hour, so everybody sees you {*repeat 3X*}

[Luda] It's get out, put my pedal to the flo' and let's roll!

[Ludacris]
Yess; Seven cars, eight cribs, and ain't a damn thang changed
Still pumpin' ten kickers, still grippin' the grain
Still candy in the paint, still ridin' them thangs
Most of my folks would same I'm happy, but I still feel pain
Until I jump in my ride, that's my only escape
Me and my automobiles got these neighbors screaming "Gimme a break!"
It's a pity how we turn our city into obstacle courses
Don't be mad cuz I can't hold my five hundred horses
Lamborginis and Porches, Ferraris and Vipers
I'mm wipe the seats wit' you drool, and rub the hood wit a diaper
Television on the gas tank, the fuel make the ass stank
I mean to be rude, my bass tubes are in a glass tank
Go strap yout seatbelts on, go put ya money up
Go put your life on the line, go put ya honey up
Go spread the word, run and tell all the boys
It's time to play, or better yet brand out the toys; we goin'

[Hook]

[Dolla Boy]
I'm in a SS Super Sport, with the Four Fifty Four
.45th on the seat, don't get yourself supersoaked
Dependin' on the weather, it may vary - whatever though
Catch me slammin' Escalade, Cadillac, to Chevy do's
And hope I don't, and pull out the Range Rover
The color of coke and snow, I blew out the brains on ya
Blew out the game on em', became a misfit
Shame on a nigga, the 726s wouldn't fit
I'm ridin', I'm high, and I'm glidin, I'm lyin'
I'm flyin', I'm doin 190, it's gon cost to catch us
You see that these diamonds are shinin', and blingin'
And blindin', so let me remind ya it's gon cost to catch up
Who's next up? - That's us, flow leave you breathless
Pedal to the flo', truck seat won't let up
But if you out ridin' deuces or better
Slow down so them girls can't sweat ya, and let the car go

[Hook]

[Bridge 4X: Titi Boi] + (Dolla Boy)
Assign your name in the skreet (sign your name in the skreet)

[Tity Boi]
I got two miles an hour, so everbody see me
Twenty fours, twenty sixes, twenty eights!
And my rims so big, you would think that is was 3D
Wait' til you see my paint, I ride around the A
With 'bout half a tank; I'm startin' to make so much money
I work half a day - I got cash in the safe
I got cash right here, I'm hard to get my swipe on
And I look like a chandalleur with all this ice on
Pull out the (?) shoot
Catch me blowin' out kush of the roof of the seven deuce
Ridin' hella hoes (hella!) elevador do's (hella)
Gator on the seat (And?) mink on the flo's
If a hater wanna creep, I got that thing by the do'
And if my chirp go beep, then my thang gon' blow
Playaz Circle - Titi Boi ridin' on skinny wheels
Bout to trade in the Quarter til eight, and get the ten till

[Chorus: Dre & The Game]
All the money in the world couldn't change me
No diamond rings or the fancy cars
Cause my niggas in the hood woulda left me
Holdin this because
(I'm from the ghetto) I'm from the ghetto
(I'm from the projects) I'm from the projects
All over the world and every hood they know
I'm from the ghetto and thats fo sho'
(I'm from the ghetto) I'm from the ghetto
(I'm from the projects) I'm from the projects (Ayo Khaled)
All over the world and every hood they know
(Walk with me) I'm from the ghetto and thats fo sho'
(I'm from the ghetto)

[Verse 1: The Game]
Yeah, that's what got me here
The Chucks, the khaki suits, all the swap meet years
The six dollar socks, the five dollar rocks
Uncle Greg rest in peace, he taught me how to chop
That's why I love the hood and everything we got
From the ice cream trucks to the forty ounce tops
All white Air Force Ones, the fake Jacob watch
A few reasons why I drive the Bently hard top
Use it in my songs cause I live it on the block
Tattoo it on my face let the whole world watch
I'm that type of nigga y'all made my city bigger dawg
Dog turn the TV off, got tired of watchin Jigga boss
So we told our moms we is lookin for jobs
When we was really in the record store lookin for Nas
Project or the ghetto, ghetto and the projects
From Compton to being Dre's number one prospect, so

[Chorus: Dre & Jadakiss]
All the money in the world couldn't change me
No diamond rings or the fancy cars
Cause my niggas in the hood woulda left me
Holdin this because

All over the world and every hood they know (They know)
I'm from the ghetto and thats fo sho' (I'm from the ghetto)

[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
Uhh, Ain't no help there
Just food stamps, weight checks and welfare (uh-huh)
Every man gone for self there
Still might need to borrow your medicate card for health care
Yeah, if you never got knocked then you made it (ha-ha)
Everybody know eachother if not they related
You can get shot or get bladed
There's dudes that got jobs now that had blocks in the 80's
Six months, five years for you just to cop out (yup)
Ninth or tenth grade is usually when niggas drop out (yup)
Fights break out when you wired and start joking (huh)
Alot of OG's retired and started smokin
House party games of spade sweet Kool-Aid
Loud music all night till the boys in blue raid
So therefore, I could never be too paid
I know where I'm going and where I'm from will get you laid
Get em

[Chorus: Dre & Trick Daddy]
All the money in the world couldn't change me
No diamond rings or the fancy cars
Cause my niggas in the hood woulda left me

All over the world and every hood they know (ha-ha)
I'm from the ghetto and thats fo sho' (I'm from the ghetto) (Ha)

[Verse 3: Trick Daddy]
Tell me this how come
Black folks get a lil doe and forget where they come from (come from)
Man we used to have good times (oh)
But since you moved on up guess you ain't cool with us (uh-uh)
We still support you tho we don't see you much (yup)
You ain't the first fool it's cool with us
But why you living out your idols dreams
Remember how far you came and help you keep them thangs? (show up)
Now its cool that your address changed
But I'm tryna holla at my dog and the number ain't the same (damn)
I guess new homies came with his fame (say what)
But see true homies will stay the same
Through all the up's and down's in your career
A couple wives, few kids scattered here (that's right)
And when you dead or broke without a deal
All the groupies cleared, the ghetto'll still be here, haa

[Chorus: Dre]
All the money in the world couldn't change me
No diamond rings or the fancy cars
Cause my niggas in the hood woulda left me
Holdin this because
(I'm from the ghetto) I'm from the ghetto
(I'm from the projects) I'm from the projects
All over the world and every hood they know
I'm from the ghetto and thats fo sho'
(I'm from the ghetto) I'm from the ghetto

[Segue from "The Storm (Skit)"]
Ain't right, I seen your eyes all fucked up...

[Intro]
Judge not, less you be judged first
My nigga, my nigga

[Chorus]
Look through my eyes, see what I see
Do as I do, be what I be
Walk in my shoes and hurt your feet
Then know why I do dirt in the street

[Verse 1]
Burnin' in hell, but don't deserve to be
Got niggas I don't even know that wanna murder me
Just because they've heard of me, and they know that the Dark is for real
The bark is for real, when you see that spark it'll kill
Peep how I park it and chill, take it over there, walk wit' it
From Y.O. to Cali to Baltimore back to New York wit' it
Come through flyin', up 1-2-9
Up the School Street 'cause I come through mine
Bark at my dogs, "Get at me, nigga!"
Get at me, nigga
What the deal is? Never forget what real is
Them cats that used to say, "X is the best," know he still is
Can't help but feel this, puttin' goosebumps on your arms
Take you there if you want but I lose chunks with the bomb
It's the calm before the storm
Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde and it's gettin' warm, feel me, yo

[Chorus]
Look through my eyes, see what I see
Do as I do, be what I be
Walk in my shoes and hurt your feet
Then know why I do dirt in the street (Yes)
Look through my eyes, see what I see
Do as I do, be what I be
Walk in my shoes and hurt your feet
Then know why I do dirt in the street

[Verse 2]
I can understand why y'all niggas is scared of me
And why the big dogs never wanted to play fair with me
'Cause I leave blood wherever I go, wherever I flow
Wherever I blow niggas who know I can go, feel me, yo
What is it about the Dark that gets niggas where they about to spark, about to bark ?
Take it to the heart 'cause it's real like that
Give him chills, but do I make him feel like that?
Shit is real, what you don't know is gon' get ya
With the steel, what you don't know is gon' split ya
I can blaze tracks, make niggas play racks and raise stacks
"Payback's a bitch," didn't you used to say that?
Play around in dirt, you'll get mud
'Cause you know, I can either spread love or shed blood
And bloodshed turns the mud red and real sticky
Or I can hit you from roof, make it a quickie, for real

[Chorus]
Look through my eyes, see what I see
Do as I do, be what I be
Walk in my shoes and hurt your feet
Then know why I do dirt in the street (Yes)
Look through my eyes, see what I see
Do as I do, be what I be
Walk in my shoes and hurt your feet
Then know why I do dirt in the street

[Verse 3]
I bear my soul, niggas wouldn't dare, my role
Gives a nigga a heart of gold, but with a hole
Lost all control, my shoulders hold a lot of weight
Just like first time sold an eighth, then told it's not an eighth
But then it's out of state, and it's too late for changes to be made
That's what I get for fuckin' with strangers in the shade
This is it, y'all niggas got to give me a plate
For the same reason that fate chose to give me the weight
Take away hate, now I'm supposed to love the one that cursed me
The one that wouldn't give me a cup of water when I was thirsty
It was always him versus me, but now I gotta teach him
Personal feelin's put aside, 'cause now I gotta reach him
What I'd like to do is turn my head, like I don't know him
But it seems like I've been called on to show him, so I'ma show him
And if you never met me, then you've no right to judge me
I've got a good heart but this heart can get ugly, yes

[Chorus]
Look through my eyes, see what I see
Do as I do, be what I be
Walk in my shoes and hurt your feet
Then know why I do dirt in the street (Yes)
Look through my eyes, see what I see
Do as I do, be what I be
Walk in my shoes and hurt your feet
Then know why I do dirt in the street

[Outro]
Feel the pain, feel the joy, of a man who was never a boy
For real

[Skit]
Y'know what I'm sayin'? These Ruff Ryder niggas (Dog)
I heard these niggas is for real
Dog (Uh-huh?)
That's my mans and them
But I heard these niggas 'posed to be like
Lockin' down the industry on some shit, on some power shit
Dog, that's my mans and them
Hmm, I see
So, what I'm doing
Right, right
My mans and them is doing, because
Right
That's my mans and them, ya know?
I feel ya
Now you feel me?
I feel ya
So you know, when you fucking with me
Right, right
You fucking with

[Intro]
Uh-oh
What have you done now?
Told y'all niggas
You just don't listen
Why must you be hardheaded?
Tried to explain
But you didn't hear me, though
Now, uh, now
I must
I don't want to
But I have to
Uh

[Verse 1]
One-two, one-two, come through, run through
Gun who? Oh, you don't know what the gun do? (What?)
Some do, those that know are real quiet
When you think you wanna try it, fuck around and start a riot (Uh)
Niggas gon' ride regardless
Because I'm the hardest rap artist and I'ma start this
Shit up for real (What?), get up and feel (What?)
My words, I make herbs split up and squeal (Come on)
Ill is all I've been hearing lately
Niggas hate me, wanna duct tape me and make me (Ah)
Put their brains on the wall, when I brawl (Uh)
Too late for that 911 call (Come on)
Niggas stay beefing, but a lot of 'em bluff (Uh-huh)
But not me 'cause I'm a nigga that can get out of them cuffs (Uh-huh)
You think a lot of 'em's tough? That's just a front
When I hit them niggas like, "What you want?" The battle turns into a hunt (Alright)
With the dog right behind niggas chasing 'em down
We all knew that you was pussy (Uh), but I'm tasting it now
And never give a dog blood, 'cause raw blood will have a dog like what? (What?)
Biting whatever, all up in your gut (Come on)
Give it to you raw like that
And ain't no love, I do 'em all like that
Four right up in they back, clack-clack
Close your eyes, baby, it's over, forget it (Uh)
Happened in front of your building, but nobody knows who did it (What?)

[Bridge]
Where my dogs at?
What, what? Where my dogs at?
Uh, where my dogs at?
What, what? Where my dogs at?
Uh, where my dogs at?
What, what? Where my dogs at?
Uh, where my dogs at?
What, what?

[Verse 2]
Niggas is puss, keep on running from the werewolf
Howling at the moon on the roof (Uh-oh)
Ooh, ah, no, get 'em
Ten niggas on him, hope God's with him
Give me the bat, let me split him
I'll have 'em where the pillow and the casket won't fit him (Come on)
Only reason I did him, he wouldn't fight back
Tried to strike back, left him like that
Laying up with the white hat
Getting right back at ya when I snatch ya
Up out the grave, nothin' but bones and ashes (Get 'em)
Hittin' niggas with gashes to the head
Straight to the white meat, but the street stay red
Bitches gon' give me head for free 'cause they see (Uh-huh)
Who I'ma be by like 2003 (Uh-huh)
That nigga D took it there, he thought it was a joke
He ran through like twenty G's, thought that I was broke (What?)
Stupid, that's what you get for thinking
And eventually found that's what you get for stinking (Uh-huh)
Blowing up the spot when you rot (Uh)
Plus, if it gets hot, they know you dead for four square blocks (Come on)
Hit 'em with the ox to the grill
Ooh, ah, kill, nigga, kill
Yet and still, you don't know I'ma rob 'em
That nigga DMX is a motherfuckin' problem, aight?

[Intro 1: Dre]
(This is, this is, this is
Yeah.. yeah, uh-huh, uh uh, c'mon)

[Intro 2: Krayzie Bone]
Yeah check it out y'all, it's them Bone Thug niggas
In the house with that nigga Twista, DJ Khaled
Duece-double-oh-six, we 'bout to do it like this - yo

[Chorus: Krayzie Bone]
Just like that 9-millimeter comin to heat ya
Nigga we come straight for ya, out to destroy ya
They better believe as soon as they creep up
Niggas gon' see how my tongue kill just like my gun, gun
Just like that 9-millimeter comin to heat ya
Nigga we come straight for ya, out to destroy ya
They better believe as soon as they creep up
Niggas gon' see how my tongue kill just like my gun, gun

[Verse 1: Twista]
Twista spit it for hustlers, Twista spit it for hoes
But I'm 'bout servin these haters like I'm servin that 'dro
Spit for my gangstas and killers that'll put one in yo' dome
Spit it for my ballers and thugs that's addicted to chrome
Either rims or the thumper, now you ain't gotta wonder
What a Twista and here I go and never on drama
With purple 'bout a pound, and my truck I pound the sounds
And my 24's got blades on them that spin round and round
Back on the scene now, and I'm always seen high
Still flow motion overdosin, smokin on green now
When I'm on them Jordans, 20's look like 17's now
Sportin throwback Jordans from when I was 17 now
Still I'm steady +Po' Pimpin+, still spinnin and hustlin
Still +Adrenaline Rushin+ like when the pendulum's cuttin
Album comin out soon, but I already had props
Pullin Benz's up on the block before I met yo' pop

[Chorus: Krayzie Bone]
Just like that 9-millimeter comin to heat ya
Nigga we come straight for ya, out to destroy ya
They better believe as soon as they creep up
Niggas gon' see how my tongue kill just like my gun, gun
Just like that 9-millimeter comin to heat ya
Nigga we come straight for ya, out to destroy ya
They better believe as soon as they creep up
Niggas gon' see how my tongue kill just like my gun, gun

[Verse 2: Twista]
The Twista, playa balla, slash pimp MC
Straight from Chi-Tizzle my nizzle, never gon' get rid of me
On some (this is, this is) and they call us C.M.T
When they drop on how pop on about how it's so fly bein me
With a lethal chemistry, put them in your memory
When you want that original sound, it's either him or me
The most underrated artist in this whole industry
If rappin was the NBA I'd be Michael Finley
Still I'm bendin and grinnin, still I got pull in the club
Still I'm poppin my collar, grindin on girls in the club
Servin 50's, rims is bigger but I got love for the dub
They love the Twist' like love for the chief, and love for the thug
Cause I got that com' game, and I got that bomb flame
Let alarms ring when you hear the don's name
I copped the H-2-1's, some throwbacks like LeBron James
This time around I'mma let my nuts and my platinum charms hang

[Chorus: Krayzie Bone]
Just like that 9-millimeter comin to heat ya
Nigga we come straight for ya, out to destroy ya
They better believe as soon as they creep up
Niggas gon' see how my tongue kill just like my gun, gun
Just like that 9-millimeter comin to heat ya
Nigga we come straight for ya, out to destroy ya
They better believe as soon as they creep up
Niggas gon' see how my tongue kill just like my gun, gun

[Verse 3: Twista]
T be poppin them tags, T be coppin them Jags
And if the T do a stick-up you be droppin them bags
And I'm from where they cock hats instead of rockin them rags
And if they ain't cockin them hats they be cockin them mags
T be thuggin and clubbin, "Oh Twista that look tight"
Don't every time he step in the party he look so nice?
I'm officially fresh in my gear as I'm rockin mo' ice
And the Mitchell & Ness from the year when I used to flow like
Annilisms are my verbal metabolisms
Shatters prisms and my thug mannerism's of cataclysm and I'm
Causin some dis-establishment-arianism
I vary in wisdom, wins only cause I'm carryin ism and I'm
A street lyrical phantom, full of verses when I chant 'em
When this shit here hit the street it's gon' be the ghetto's anthem

[Interlude: DJ Khaled]
Bone Thugs, Twista, DJ Khaled, Listennn!

[Chorus: Krayzie Bone]
Just like that 9-millimeter comin to heat ya
Nigga we come straight for ya, out to destroy ya
They better believe as soon as they creep up
Niggas gon' see how my tongue kill just like my gun, gun
Just like that 9-millimeter comin to heat ya
Nigga we come straight for ya, out to destroy ya
They better believe as soon as they creep up
Niggas gon' see how my tongue kill just like my gun, gun

[Outro: DJ Khaled]
Shouts out to Steve Lobel
Krayzie Bone, Bone Thugs, Swizz Beatz I see you
Twista, shit's crazy right here
Cool & Dre on the track
It's DJ Khaled, historical, I'm a problem!
Listennn!

[Verse 1: JAY-Z]
I'm up out M-a-r-c-y P-r-o-j-e-c-t
Ain't no other motherfucker in the rap game harder than me
I go hard and get it in like a porn star
Follow my moves you wanna make it to the top
I'm OnStar for new born stars
Even when the camera stop
I'ma hundred million dollar movie, hand on my cock
Big Homie from the back block
When you first learned how to slap box
Then you even learned how to dribble the pill
Or to hand the pot, bring it back, rock
Number one rule: if your ass get popped
Don't chatterbox to the Matlocks
Death before dishonor, I'ma honor the code they created
Number 2 Rule and it might sound rude, but...
Yup! Fuck you, pay me!
I drown my pain in Porsches, I lost my partner to the bullshit
Still tryna hold on to my religion so
I put a couple diamonds in the crosses
Close your eyes, see the darkness
That's what it's like where I'm from
No lawyers no doctors
So either I go the hardest or I could just call this a night
On dark nights, it's like I see better
On Dark Knights I'm like Heath Ledger
Even if I overdose on drugs, motherfuckers can't kill my buzz
Wait, I ain't done; I'ma freestyle this, Khaled let it run
What's the hardest county in the Yayo?
'Cause I'ma go harder then they go
I'ma go harder than Baltimore
Philly gon' say they can't touch the boy
Where you at Duval? I'ma go harder than you all
Harder than New York, turn the Pro Tools in the booth off
I'ma go harder than Ye go
And Ye go hard; that's baby bro
Put some more beat on that joint

[Chorus: T-Pain]
If you could you would get rid of me
What you gonna do when a nigga got to go hard
But I won't let you get to me
You should already figure I'mma go hard
If you were as real as me
You would never let another nigga step in yo yard
Makin money ain't shit to me
This in my veins and it gets to my heart
So I am, I will, I gots to go
You got another way to live you gots to go on
I am gettin it in until the end I got to go, go, go, go hard

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
I ain't ever been scurred
Never been a type to bite my words
When I came up ya'll gave me shit
Now I'm gunna make ya'll eat them terds
Always said what the fuck I felt
Gon head spit that murder I wrote
Man I dont care what what you felt
Fuck you nigga I know I'm dope
Dope like I'm comin to get my all
Felt like I had to play the fly on the wall
Felt like niggas was stuntin on me
Funny how I'm flyer then them all
Now I'm at the top ain't know where to go now
Instead of me, she gon go down
Maybe I would've slowed down
If I knew what I know now
I'm stupid, yeah I know I'm dumb
It could get fuckin old but its good I'm young
But my heart get cold as the hood I'm from
Tell me what it take to be numba one
I guess its gon be what its gon be
But heres one thing ya'll got to hear
I'mma tell you like George Bush told me
Fuck ya'll niggas I'm out of here

[Chorus: T-Pain]
If you could you would get rid of me
What you gonna do when a nigga got to go hard
But I won't let you get to me
You should already figure I'mma go hard
If you were as real as me
You would never let another nigga step in yo yard
Makin money ain't shit to me
This in my veins and it gets to my heart
So I am, I will, I gots to go
You got another way to live you gots to go on
I am gettin it in until the end I got to go, go, go, go hard

If you represent the hood, two hands in the sky

Listen

[Chorus: T-Pain & Trick Daddy]
Yeah, I wear my pants below my waist
And I never dance when I'm in this place
'Cause you and your man is planning to hate (I'm so hood)
And I got these golds up in my mouth
If you get closer to my house
Then you'll know what I'm talking 'bout, I'm out the (Hood)

Bitch-ass niggas, I do it 'cause I could, ha ('Cause I could, ha)
Heavy starch in my jeans, please (In my jeans, please)

Living life like a G
That's why these bitch-ass niggas wanna fight me
But I ain't gon' play wit 'em
Uh-uh, rather let the AK hit 'em (Fa-fa-fa)

Damn my P.O., y'all can tell her I said it
Violate me if she want, gon' have to come catch me
Piss test me all you want, I'ma smoke when I'm ready
Pants hangin' off me now 'cause my pistol heavy (Hood)
I ain't spoke to you yet, dog, 'cause I ain't friendly
I drink 'Gnac, homie, y'all drink Crist'
I like bust-it babies, I don't want that bougie bitch
I'd never buy a Phantom, twenty-eights can't fit
They say I'm fed bound, they call me high risk
I'm a full-blooded goon, lames make me sick
You gettin' three or four birds, where I'm from, we call you rich
I'd like to thank the hood, homie, you taught how to whip

[Chorus: T-Pain]
(I'm so hood)
Yeah, I wear my pants below my waist
And I never dance when I'm in this place
'Cause you and your man is planning to hate (I'm so hood)

[Verse 1: Beanie Sigel]
All the bullshit stops here (Here)
Let's get this clear (Yeah)
Shoot rear, fresh off the top tear (Unhh)
What I'mma 'bout to do for you, is not fair
I'm not answerin' questions for you, dat are not clear
Whuddup with State Prop. the crew, when they not there?
The moment dat they heard it the verdict, when it wasn't clear
Ya boi had the to sit a year, did they really disappear?
Jay really not visit there? Dame and Beans are they tight as it seems
Or is it all fabricated from dat same fabric
Now rip the rock marriage straight from seams
Thing's ain't what it seems but at time do tell, the truth shall prevail
Until then, you dudes bite yall nails in anticipation (Fuck)
I know you hate it why I got chu waitin? (Shiiit..) - I too, am waitin'
Gotta see a couple faces, when I make 'em face it
Truth dat is dat ya boy have patience (Yes!)
As a matter a fact, it's wearin' thin
But I tell you this tho, when the New Year begins
Pussies who got nuts cause I'm goin' all in

[Hook: Pooh Bear]
Are you listening ? (heeey) Plead for attention (heeey)
But it ain't good if you don't wait (Ooooh)
It ain't good if you don't wait (Ooooh)
I'm the plot in every movie yet my theory stays the same
It ain't good if you dont wait (Ooooh)
It ain't good if you dont wait (Ooooh)
Nah-uhhh..

[Verse 2: Beanie Sigel]
Now let's not get this misconstrued
To say dat diss record - I don't diss my dudes!
Outta respect I couldn't check my once fist tight crew
Never in front of you I couldn't get dat rude
Ionn give a fuck but I couldn't get dat crew
Cause knowin what I do I can get like (Khh) ouu
You wanna know what I do, don't cha?
You'd love it if I told you lil' fuckers, won't cha?
Uh-unh, scrap gotta pay for this one
Sorry youngin', got to wait on this one (Yes)
The Solution, soon in stores
Date to be posted, until then - I'm on pause

[Interlude: DJ Khaled]
Yeah, to DJ Khaled aka We The Best
Beanie Sigel (Whudd!.. Ain't no more too it)
Give 'em more man, more

[Verse 3: Beanie Sigel]
Well fuck it I don't wanna stop
Whatchu forgot the gun'll pop
Tell me who ya wanna rock
This true love, Roc-a-Fella 'till I die
Nigga keep it movin', don't get caught up in this drive-by
The break's over, ya boi 'bout to take over
If dat number one spot opens, give it here (Here)
Get my crown, dust of my chair
And yall niggas can kiss my ass before I sitted there
Back from the dead (Unhh) fresh off the prison tier
Daddy here to put the kids to bed (Get it clear!)
By the way, the wars on - you can't call it off
It's too late once the boss involved
Here I come!!

[Hook: Pooh Bear]
Are you listening ? (heeey) Plead for attention (heeey)
But it ain't good if you don't wait (Ooooh)
It ain't good if you don't wait (Ooooh)

Incarcerated right now, Flesh Bone
We ain't forget about you nigga
Bone Thugs, the originators
Nigga don't get it fucked up where you got your flow from
Bone Thugs, it's your time, nigga we the best!
LISTENNN! Representin all the ghettos across the world
Nigga we ghetto! We from the hood! We do this!
Let's take it to the projects

[Chorus: Krayzie Bone]

Half of this industry's swingin from our baaaaalls
It's Bone Thugs, mighty Bone Thugs
Bone Thugs, Bone Bone Thuuuuugs

[Verse 1: Krayzie Bone]
I told 'em I'mma get up, get out and get somethin
But I was a little bitty nothin, in the city thuggin
Never been a nigga that's never done less than 100%
The hustle is in me
My thug mentality showed me
What to do to improve my salary
Don't nobody move or you could be a casualty
Why you would really wanna cross paths with me?
One nigga left and they thought we was done
Don't think you'll get rid of the twist of the tongue
They thought we was finished but we just beginnin
They want me committed for the murder one
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide, my competition, ready to die
Opposition, never survive, when I get done, bustin my rhyme
I'm a criminal transformed to a lyrical bad storm
Did I mention my fast flowin
Lately has got my cash growin and ass showin
These niggas can't see Bone, they already know
Came down with a style unfamiliar sound
That's how we kicked in the do'
What it be like? Bone Thug nigga born and bred in the Cleveland street life
And believe we ain't goin nowhere, we permanent, posted up like street lights
We do it, still get to it, undisputed, who would of knew it
We stay the truest suited and booted
They ain't doin it like we do it, do it

[Chorus: Krayzie Bone]
It's Bone Thugs, we be them Bone Thugs
Half of this industry's swingin from our baaaaalls
It's Bone Thugs, mighty Bone Thugs
Bone Thugs, Bone Bone Thuuuuugs
It's Bone Thugs, we be them Bone Thugs
Half of this industry's swingin from our baaaaalls
It's Bone Thugs, mighty Bone Thugs
Bone Thugs, Bone Bone Thuuuuugs

[Verse 2: Wish Bone]
Nigga tell the truth 'fore you get in the booth
You know think about the Bone flow for hoes
I ain't nice like {?} I wanna split ya mouth
Better get you that dough you old hoes
Where's the respect when you cash that check (huh?)
Nigga break bread well bust your head (yup)
I'll bring to it the heart, rather leave 'em dead
Before my time but I'm still ahead
Of all y'all (all y'all)
Like a nice bitch hit a nigga raw dawg (raw dawg)
Any nigga with him catch a sawed-off (sawed-off)
And I'm ready, I'm ready, know what it is
Nigga bow down, bow down
Nigga show some love, ain't no hoes in us
We can swing them buds, we can share some blood
Blood blood, blood blood blood blood, blood
Let a nigga loose I'mma smack him like I do (do)
I'mma come and see you, fuck that rappin in a booth (booth)
I ain't no studio or nothin my name in yo' mouth
And I'mma show you somethin, fuck it
This the first time, double back dumpin (dumpin)
Deep in the club they some suckas, rush 'em (rush 'em)
Get it how we get it, don't let the singin fool ya
We gets dirty dirty dirty
Never nervous, nah ain't no love there (ain't no love)
Just watch yo' mouth, or one day them Thuggstaz yes
They will run up on ya (on ya)
And that's when it's over cuz, we don't play no games
So when we up on ya, believe we're gonna let it rain (rain)

[Chorus: Krayzie Bone]
It's Bone Thugs, we be them Bone Thugs

[Verse 3: Layzie Bone]
In the hood where it's good, yeah we get respect
On the industry, now it's time to bill collect
It's a promise little homie, no need for threats
We the best in the business and we breed the next
Nigga ride with a Thug on a Cleveland quest
We really ain't mad at you clones
You gotta give credit where credit is due
Why wouldn't they give it to Bone?
If you ever gave props and a massive thanks
Now you thinkin how a master think
Way back in '94, stage stayed closed
We opened the do' nigga get that bank
Flip that flow, city to city
My niggas is gritty and ol' boy
Reppin that Bone Thug, Mo Thug, Thugline
Hit 'em with one rhyme, they be like oh boy (oh boy)
Now most of the greatest done did it
And some of the latest done did it
Rest in peace to the B.I.G
Been 13 years and they still fuck wit it
Jay-Z done did it, J.D. done did it
Lil' Bow Wow did it and killed it
I love when a real nigga do they thang
Some wanna plead not guilty
Nigga get filthy, ain't no playa hation
Some of y'all niggas is congratulation
Got your hand on my dick tryin to masterbate it
Let me bust in ya face since you had to taste it
Smash and takin what's rightfully mine
Nigga better check my profile
Niggas is up in my space
Eternally this be Bone's style (Bone's style)

[Chorus: Krayzie Bone]
It's Bone Thugs, we be them Bone Thugs
Half of this industry's swingin from our baaaaalls

Half of this industry's swingin from our baaaaalls

"That be that Cash Money piece, go restin' the dead"
(Alright, alright)

[Chorus]
I walk around like I got a "S" on my chest
I walk, I walk around like I got a "S" on my chest
I walk, I walk around like I got a "S" on my chest

If stunna say the nigga dead then the nigga dead
If youngin' say the nigga dead, then the nigga dead
If youngin' say the nigga dead, then the nigga dead

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Reporting from Kim's corner store
Hollygrove, 17th carnivore
Ridin' through the city in a Tonka toy
I got old money, coulda bought a dinosaur, huh
Only ride Chevy, never drive a Ford
And my Coupe doors open like plaza doors, yup!
Red thick women (uhh) I's adore
I'm a whore, you know that I'm a whore, yup!
Cash Money, Cash Money, monster boys
Mafia bitch! Even the cops avoid
And you say you want beef, then I got you, boy, ugh
I'll just let the Big Mac, whop' a boy
See my dreads hangin' lookin' like a rasta, boy
Fuck with my roster and I turn into Mufasa, boy, haha!
We run up in your casa, boy
And blast off like NASA, boy! Haha

[Chorus]
I walk around like I got a "S" on my chest (Yeah)
I walk, I walk around like I got a "S" on my chest

[Verse 2: Birdman]
Yeah, Cash Money is an army nigga, better know it's gravy
If you ever fuck with Young and if you ever fuck with Baby
Shit gon' be crazy, nigga doin it like the 80's
Buncha young nigga poppin' off and they sprayin'
Up in the early, we thank Him for the sunshine
Got to get my bling on, reach for my chrome nine
Kiss mama cause we goin' out and get mines
Next nigga in line, seventeen on the grind
Shoot first, nigga not seeing mines
Big purses, million-dollar headlines
Five drops, O.G., the last Big Tyme'
Lord to the game, nigga, 'til it's my time
"Like Father Like Son," nigga, this time
Junior got the fame and the game, mastermind
Two hundred on the dash, nigga, watch me mash
Doing doughnuts in my hood gettin' paper bags

[Chorus]
I walk around like I got a "S" on my chest
I walk, I walk around like I got a "S" on my chest
I walk, I walk around like I got a "S" on my chest
That be that Cash Money piece, go restin' the dead

[Verse 3: Birdman]
Ribbon is red, that how we pledge
An Uptown C.M.B. blood 'til I'm dead
That's what I said, I'll put some change on your head
If you ever cross a line nigga it's nothin' but bread
Fifty shots I'm hot, nigga we won't stop
From puttin' candy on the slab nigga stirrin' them pots
Put the hammer on the jam nigga pull it and pops
And put the rubber on the bands nigga stackin' his knots

[Verse 4: Lil Wayne]
Bitch I'm the boss, bih.. bitch I'm the boss
And bury me like my father on the cross
And carry thy teen, I shall over a cross
Shorty got that game on lock, like a vault
Weezy Baby, cayenne pepper, no salt
Windows down on the hog in the winter, it's yo' fault
Hehehe, I don't jump on the track, I pole vault
I got that "S" on my chest, man I'm supposed to ball

[Chorus]
I walk around like I got a "S" on my chest
I walk, I walk around like I got a "S" on my chest
I walk, I walk around like I got a "S" on my chest
That be that Cash Money piece, go restin' the dead

[Intro: DJ Khaled]
They doubted me all my life
Now it's victory (DJ Khaled!)

[Chorus: John Legend]
Whatever it is, I'll pay the cost
I'm willing to risk it, I'll take the loss
I'll put it all on the line
In a hustler's state of mind
Yeah I'm gonna make history, ohhh
Just so we can claim victory (Victory)
Ohh, victory (Victory)

[Interlude: DJ Khaled]
Nasir!

[Verse: Nas]
Speedboats, three tokes and pass it
Grass lit, hitting slopes in Aspen
No coat, just an oath to stay thorough 'til we back to ashes
Driven in fly sedans to the MGM Grand
Picture lots of sand, two blondes, implants, Remy in hand
We trying to tan, deal my cards with an honest hand
A modest man, aware of any counterscam
Palm trees, magnum Don Ps, LV monograms
Hottest girls flew from Rio
Mojitos, mucho frio, my libido
Sex so strong, without the E though
Hollow threats, we don't see those
Higher death toll whenever we roll, that process is pivotal
My pitiful, poverty-struck criminals will get at you
Then we lounge in a Spanish-style house
'Til it all blows over, Dolce Gabbana out
Contemplating, there is no bond with Satan
Say a little prayer for me like Aretha Franklin
For my hustlers, here's some motivation
He who has begun is half done, why you waiting?
I'm too impatient to pray, too much patience for stress
It's too much paper to rest, fuck around, you face death
I know some niggas from Astoria
That'll cut your daughter up like I used to cut a quarter up
Making all the bucks, banana clips I bought in Georgia bucks
Kill all you fucks easy, I be on the golf cart sleepy
Y'all beneath me, y'all be at the pawn shop pawning watches
Obnoxious, can't stop us, we shottas
Say you killing Pablo? Impossible, nonsense
Preposterous, bizarre at best, unfulfilled promises
I feel intelligence is my wealth, however
How enormous is Nas' pockets is a pop quiz to gossipers
See me at the Oscars looking dreamy, hood opulent
Means esoteric, how I wore it, exoticness
Makes you curious to see how serious my closet is
Shareholders wanna invest in that Nas stock, it's just
We be on that real shit, luxury four-wheel shit
Niggas acting thirst on some just-got-a-deal shit
Ha, for that victory we will kill shit
Get out the way, playboy, this is real shit
Khaled

[Chorus: John Legend]
Whatever it is, I'll pay the cost
I'm willing to risk it, I'll take the loss
I'll put it all on the line
In a hustler's state of mind
Yeah I'm gonna make history, ohhh
Just so we can claim victory (Victory)
Ohh, victory (victory)

[Outro: John Legend]
Ohh, ohh
Just so we can claim victory
Ohh, victory, victory, yeah
Hoh, just so we can claim victory
Hey yeah yeah

Nasir!

[Verse 1: Nas]
Money fall out the sky when I speak
Got a valet, can't leave mine out in these streets
Can't carpool, the crew is too deep
Why tuck it all in? The jewels are too sweet
You should ball if you could
I be diggin in my pockets, it ain't trickin if you got it
And since a nigga from the projects
Champagne out of a can would be the fly shit
And I'm a history maker, hood motivational speaker
Rap Led Zeppelin, best-dressed list
Show you how to bubble off of large investments
Ya heard me, and this journey, I'm the journalist
Line around the block to hear the words of the herbalist
Send ya girl to the Dominicans to perm her shit
Tell her tonight, we gonna see Nas return to his murder shit

[Chorus: Nas & DJ Khaled]
It's still Nasty, raw in the flesh
God's Son, never gone, never left
King, I played every card in the deck
The whole world waitin for what I'mma do next
And y'all already know where I came from
Queensbridge repper since day one
Nigga, I'm on! (Come on!)
I'm on! (Come on!)
I'm on! (Come on!)
I'm on! (Nasir)
Come on!

[Post-Chorus: Dre]
Out of the shadows, into the light
I have the power to take back what's mine
(Can't hide, can't hide)
We have the power
(Alive, it's so fine to be alive)
We are the light

[Verse 2: Nas]
I'm God's hit man, Chopard wristband
New York crown jewel, no if-and's, top five
I'm the one, two, three, four and the fifth man
Smoke a hookah in Istanbul, I'm quicksand
I'm five mics, five points of light
Hit the stage like a meteorite
They wanna all hear Ether tonight, but we ain't beefin tonight
That's history, so now when you mention me
Say I'm a mystery like six degrees
Or the seven hills of Sicily, I need a vasectomy
They resurrected me but nothin is left for me
Just when you thought you'd seen the best of me
I take it a notch higher, yeah
Sip more wine than a sommelier
Get around town in a private Lear
And by sun down, I'm up out of here

[Chorus: Nas & DJ Khaled]
It's still Nasty, raw in the flesh
God's Son, never gone, never left
King, I played every card in the deck
The whole world waitin for what I'mma do next
And y'all already know where I came from
Queensbridge repper since day one
Nigga, I'm on! (Come on)
I'm on! (Come on)
I'm on! (Come on)
I'm on! (Nasir)
Come on!

[Post-Chorus: Dre]
Out of the shadows, into the light
I have the power to take back what's mine
(Can't hide, can't hide)
We have the power
(Alive, it's so fine to be alive)
We are the light

[Verse 3: Nas]
Power, paper, palace is so high
Lookin over skyscrapers, wildin out in Dubai
Do I look like I never seen the better things?
Emerald ring, I chase cheddar mean
Pockets on swole since eighteen years old
Gettin my dough, cigars are hand-rolled
From Guantanamo, Gallardos, the car shows
The Narcos, Gestapos, Optimos
Cause I love the dough more than you know
Still ain't reached the pinnacle
Braveheart general since nine-fo'
Got the belt to show, certified classic
Nine-six, Street Dreams was blastin
And no way they wanna hire assassins
They still harassin, I'm so platinum, it's natural
And nigga is my acronym, lights, camera, actionin

[Chorus: Nas & DJ Khaled]
It's still Nasty, raw in the flesh
God's Son, never gone, never left
King, I played every card in the deck
The whole world waitin for what I'mma do next
And y'all already know where I came from
Queensbridge repper since day one
Nigga, I'm on! (Come on)
I'm on! (Come on)
I'm on! (Come on)
I'm on! (Nasir)
Come on!

[Post-Chorus: Dre]
Out of the shadows, into the light
I have the power to take back what's mine

Ayy, knock-knock, yeah, I'm knockin on the bank door
With a million dollars and I'm dropping off the cash flow
See, you ain't heard? I hit a lick, now my money right
Spend it on the U-Haul, dippin on the turnpike
Call up my dawgs (Dawgs), rag on my face (Face)
Bodies gon' fall (Fall), tell 'em it's Ace (Ace)
If I catch a charge, nigga, I'ma flee the state
Hit my niggas L.A. Reid and Khaled, watch me beat the case

[Verse 5: Trick Daddy]
You niggas flies—before, you was just maggots (Maggots)
I'm the shit bitch, because I'm black flaggin (Black flag)
Yessir, the DR's, the new squad
You niggas Mod Squad, we go hard
They like, "Oh God, there go T-Double
He got his clique and his brothers, I know it's gon' be trouble"
Knock boys on the black Jags
See 'em in them black masks
No, they can't stand my Black ass

[Verse 6: Lil Wayne]
Hahahaha, and we are the best
And Weezy be the shh like two H's after S

And I'm right right, and your wrong left
Hahahah, check out this bizarre
I am regularly irregular
Khaled best DJ, Weezy best rapper
If Khaled say it's a movie, then Weezy best actor

[Hook: Akon]
I don't care what nobody say (Say) I'ma be me (Be me)
Stay hood, stay raised on the streets (Cause I'm out here grindin)
Niggas talk about greatness
Whenever they speak about me (Cause I'm out here grindin)
I ain't splittin nothin with nobody
Homie, I gotta get me me (Cause I'm out here grindin)
I ain't slept in eight days, I can go for eight weeks
Ain't nothin to me cause I am the streets

[Intro: DJ Khaled & Fabolous]
Yeah I met this shorty last night right (real rap)
And you know she looked like she was with her man (hehehe)
And you know I see you with your man
She was like, "nah that's my friend" (ooooh, okay)
So that was my cue, ayo Fab (ey Khaled)

[Verse 1: Fabolous]
Shorty wanna give me the go ahead
That I'mma stay even when I need to go head
And if I feel something I'mma try
Figured you winked at me not just something in your eye
See shawty you ain't got to tell me what I know
That was E-40 who said "tell me when to go"
I know I got the green light, and ya'll get the red light
So if the head right I'll be there err night
Err night like a playoff game
You hard working haters take a day off man

Thats so true, when I walk in this bitch baby that's your cue

[Chorus: Lloyd & Rick Ross]

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
I need bitch who motivated, and know multiplication
It's serve collect calls 'cuz I got multiple cases
Let it be house, yea the comfortable places
Married to the game on a prenuptial basis
Khaled, he the best in the game when he break it
She the baddest in the club, and I'm willing to take it
We got a lot 'o dollars, gotta be willing to make it
And if you wanna baby might just be willing to taste it
Boss, I'm thugging and she loving it
Gotta have protect one, sipping on that bubbly
Its hard not to notice me, we known globally
Sitting on the top of the world just so comfortably

[Chorus: Lloyd]

We can do that, there, just gimme the go
Been a player unprepared, everybody grown folks
'Round here, them gold bottles hold them up
Then we can say, cheers (Let's take a toast)
No wheat or white bread in my Pillsbury dough
Just give me the right head with the letters G-O
All eyes if you like your momma, lame as a video
Imagine you and other kitties strolling all over the city

[Chorus: Lloyd]
I know you see me starin girl
I see you lookin at me
Go find and it's apparent girl
You feelin luck in the street

[Verse 4: Fat Joe]
Crack! How hot is hot?

You cool it off, and it come back rock (crack!)
Yes! I am him
Pull strings like a violin
Then I cross over like I'm Iverson
To Z100 out to Ireland
White chicks is standing on line
Black chicks is standing on line
Don't discriminate, I disintegrate
So much cake, maybe we can get away

[Chorus: Lloyd]
I know you see me starin girl
I see you lookin at me
Go find and it's apparent girl
You feelin luck in the street
Girl tell me, what's on your mind, let me know

[Intro: DMX]
Believe me when I say
Before light, there was dark

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
Where you going, where you going?
Where you going, where you going?
Where you going?
If I don't know where I'm coming from
Where would I go?
If I don't know where I'm coming from
Where would I go?
If I don't know where I'm coming from
Where would I go?
If I don't know where I'm coming from
Where would I go?

[Verse 1: DMX]
Places that I've been, things that I have seen
What you call a nightmare, are what I have as dreams
Bad as that may seem, I know it's only gonna get worse
Love, or a slug, which one am I gonna get first?
My journey's been a rough one, I'm not sure when it began
But the way it's looking, I kind of know when it's gonna end
Thin love, hold me down baby, it's gon' be a rough ride
Niggas give us plenty of room, 'cause I guess enough died
Let me travel, 'cause my intentions are to travel in peace
Fuck around I lay you down, you hit the gravel and cease
I could be a beast, or I could be a gentleman
But if you ain't my dog, you gonna be like "Oh, it's him again"
Niggas will never win, this whole rap game is mine
Hot as you ever been, I was that in '89
Seek and you shall find, look within and you will know
Where you coming from, and where you gotta go
Come on!

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
If I don't know where I'm coming from
Where would I go?
If I don't know where I'm coming from
Where would I go?
-Gotta keep it real with me
If I don't know where I'm coming from
Where would I go?
-So the hell with you
If I don't know where I'm coming from
Where would I go?
-I think I'm going to the top
Me and DMX

[Verse 2: DMX]
I will spend mad time in one spot, plottin' my next move
Tryin' figure out - why is it, that X do what X do
Some questions go unanswered (why?), that's what I'm afraid of
Sometimes I can't show, but I know what I'm made of
They made love, or should I say they made lust
Bound, there didn't have to be love there, cause they made us
I got quite a few sisters, I was the only boy
But being with my dog, was my only joy
Like a kid with a new toy, I forgot about the grime
Escaped the misery, didn't think about the crime
Lost all track of time, was in another world
Everybody knew Earl, but there was another Earl
Lighter side of the dark, fight in the park but wouldn't wanna
Stayed and fought, but when they jumped me, became a good runner
One by one they all went under, so I had the last laugh
They all thought it was a joke; I had the last laugh

[Mary J. Blige]
Ha ha ha ha ha ha

[DMX]
Come on!

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
If I don't know where I'm coming from
-If I don't know, I don't know
Where would I go?
-Where would I go?
If I don't know where I'm coming from
Where would I go?
-Where we going, where we going, where we going?
If I don't know where I'm coming from
-Where I'm going
Where would I go?
-But I know where I'm going
If I don't know where I'm coming from
-Do you know, do you know
Where would I go?
-I go, I go

[Verse 3: DMX]
I feel the ghost from within, comin' back to haunt me
Stay lovin' my peoples, even though they don't want me
When I was bad, I was forgotten, like I was dead and rotten
Should've been gettin' love, but instead was plottin'
Shit wasn't right, and it was all blamed on me
Didn't know that I was special 'til this rap shit came to be
Gave me a way out, showed me it was better to teach
Than bust niggas with the 4-4, leave 'em dead in the streets
Over beef that was worth less, than the cost of the slugs that I bought to kill them
And that's because I thought I ought to kill 'em
Little did I know, death wasn't right
Didn't always show every breath was a life
It was to be captured in suspended animation
To be felt by all, understood by every nation
What's the sense of hatin', when I can show love
What's the sense of fakin', when I can show blood

[Mary J. Blige]
Now what's the moral to this story?

[DMX]
Come on!

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
If I don't know where I'm coming from
Where would I go?
-Where would I go?
If I don't know where I'm coming from
-If I don't know, I don't know
Where would I go?
If I don't know where I'm coming from
-I don't know
Where would I go?
-But I know where I'm coming from
If I don't know where I'm coming from
-Do you know where you're coming from?
Where would I go?

[Outro: Mary J. Blige]
Yonkers is where we grew
Trials we got through
On top is where we stay
'Til the end, as long as we pray
P.K. in Swizz's place
Send tracks everyday
On Hot97 ya hear
DMX all through the year
Uhh.. c'mon!

[Chorus]
(Dog) It's more to a song than, jewelry and clothes
More to a nigga's life than, money and hoes
The game is a lot bigger than you, think you know
And if you think you know, then I don't think you know

[Verse 1]
Niggas - walk around frontin (frontin) talkin bout jewels (jewels)
How much you bust tools, y'all niggas sounds like fools (woo)
Who you really think give a fuck how much your watch cost? (mm-hmm)
How much your watch cost? You bout to get your watch lost (aight)
If you flashin' it, you must not want it
See I fuck with real niggas that done it
You know what time it is, run it!
Niggas got more important shit to deal with
Talkin' about some 4 wheel shit
But my man here is about to kill shit (UH!)
Keep playin' niggas pussy, and you will get fucked
Why don't you cop some more ice dog;
Then you will get stuck and fucked
Bitch ass nigga, hit my street
And see what happens to that iceberg when it's hit by heat (woo)
It won't be a pretty sight, you and your pretty wife
Oh you must have forgot dog, this is the city life (aight?)
Ain't a fuckin thing sweet, and ain't nothing fair
Just another nigga dead, don't a motherfucker care

[Chorus 2x]
(Dog) It's more to a song than, jewelry and clothes
More to a niggas life than, money and hoes
The game is a lot bigger than you, think you know
And if you think you know, then I don't think you know

[Verse 2]
Born and raised in the projects and can't forget it
And all that grimy shit niggas do, I done did it (uhh)
And I'm still with it, nigga I stay in the hood
But when the cats is out, bet the dog, play in the hood
You keep bringin' them fake bitches through
You gon' fuck around and make bitches do (WHAT?), we take bitches too (aight?)
And if you comin through my block, it's gon' be the last stop
We blast tops, faggot couldn't make it to the stash box (c'mon!)
Big ass rocks, I want that! Fuck the blood
All that shit washes off, the next day I'm like, "What?"
Flossin' yo' shit, what I want for yo' shit? (uhh, uhh)
Give a nigga like three bricks to feed the dogs with
Cause I ain't really gots to shine (Why?) When they do, I do
For me, them niggas'll hide you, where nobody'll find you
If you eatin' motherfucker, then your dogs should be eatin too
Not just four or five niggas, 'cause you know what the streets'll do

[Chorus 2x]
(Dog) It's more to a song than, jewelry and clothes
More to a niggas life than, money and hoes
The game is a lot bigger than you, think you know
And if you think you know, then I don't think you know

[Verse 3]
I will be the voice of the street till I die (die)
Cause I know if I keep my heart real, I'm gon' fly (fly)
Either let me fly or give me death; if you didn't catch it then
Get it now, cause it's all that's left
And this will be the last breath (uh) provokin' my niggas (uh)
To start choking y'all niggas (WHAT?) and smokin' y'all niggas
A nigga would never have to say, "X feed me!"
You'll never hear a nigga say, "X is greedy!"
Only, "X believe me! I didn't know it was a setup!"
Get up, cocksuckin' motherfucker, shut up
Shut up {​​​​​​​​​*"pop pop"*}​​​​​​​​​ Fuck you nigga
From the hood to the wood, fuck you nigga
This for my dogs, til death do us part
I'm still here, cause I been here from the start (aight?)
If I'm ever anywhere, anytime it gets ugly (WHAT?)
The dog is aight, cause I know the streets love me (grrrrrrrrr)

[Chorus 2x]
(Dog) It's more to a song than jewelry and clothes
More to a niggas life than money and hoes
The game is a lot bigger than you think you know
And if you think you know, then I don't think you know

*speaking softly*
Dog..
Jewelry and clothes..
Money and hoes..
Think you know?
I don't think you know..

[DMX]
Don't do it dog, it's just not worth it
Uhh.. grrrrrr.. what the fuck have they done?
Arf! Arf!

Chorus: DMX (repeat 2X)

Now don't you ever (fuck around)
Now don't you ever (fuck around)
Nigga don't you ever (fuck around)
Now don't you ever (fuck around)

[Verse 1]
Aiyyo I got a mean flow that'll drown niggas, put down niggas
Can't stand to be around niggas if they clown niggas
How many times must I break the same niggas off somethin dumb
So we know, where the fuck I'm comin from?
Gun and ones, watch a black nigga turn purple
With this fo'-pound, I bust mo' rounds then a circle
The nigga that tried is the same nigga that fried
So he'll never rest in peace cause of the way that he died
I'm Evil, like Kneival, faggot I'll leave you
Like I shoulda did your peoples before they could conceive you
How's a buck-fifty sound, for a quick ass cut?
I'll have a flashback, I fuckin blow your bitch-ass up
And it's no problem, handlin a nigga with a death wish
Leave him breathless, and hit his wife with a dead fish
Must I show this nigga, I can throw this nigga, out flow this nigga
You can get it too, because you know this nigga
Chorus

[Verse 2]
I get pumped, just like a bodybuilder
And it's been more than a couple of times my pump shottie spilt a
Nigga's guts on the door, because he wanted more
Than he could stand, now him and his man is on the floor
That's what you get for talkin shit you shouldn'ta got me started
You motherfuckers never wanted nuttin, but you got it
I shit on niggas like a toilet, cause all it, takes
Is a second for it to get hectic so call it
How you want it? Punk bitch talkin junk bitch
Fuck around and you'll be found in a trunk bitch
Niggas is off-brand like no frills
And I got mo' skills to show my fo' kills, my fuckin blow grills
Got some cold shit, have you like - "Oh shit!" Don't laugh money
When I'm done with this nigga, I'm gettin in yo' shit
Break niggas, especially fake niggas over dumb shit
With one hit, watch the dum-dum split this bum's shit

Chorus

[Verse 3]
Fuckin see some cats thinkin the worst
Dumb cats, them cats sleep in a hearse
Where yo' guns at? Run that, see a nigga thirst
Been there, done that, and did it first
Nigga can't tell me shit about this
And I keep somethin that'll hit if I miss
One thing a nigga stay with is hot shit
Got this, what you cats want? Not this
I constantly gots to remind young niggas
Uh-uhh, don't do that, some niggas
Think cause I ain't killed a nigga this week
That shit is sweet
Fuck around, you'll be dead in the street
Red with a sheet, over the corpse
Shit is deep, so I shed a tear, over the loss
If you creep, then you niggas'll roll with the force
Shoulda paid that money that you owed to the boss
Chorus

[DMX]
Uh-huh
Don't do it dog, it's just not worth it
Please heh, for your sake, hehehe
Y'know? C'mon!
Hey Mimi
Word? {*dogs barking*}
Get em boy.. get em boy!
Get em boy! Get em boy! Boyyyyyyy!
("There's nothin you can do..." *repeats in background*)

[Chorus](2x)
X is comin' for ya, can't do nothin for ya
Cause X is comin' for ya
Run, hide, duck, duck
We don't give a fuck, fuck

[Verse 1: DMX]
Look in the mirror (uh) say my name five times
Turn out the lights (WHAT?) then I done took nine lives
Don't get scared now nigga, finish it cause you started it
Watch shit grow out of control, now you want no part of it (c'mon)
Nigga, where yo' heart at? Tell me what you made of
Already lost a stripe cause I know what you afraid of
We both know you pussy, but I ain't gonna say nuttin
Just hit a nigga off, and you can stay frontin (uhh)
I gotcha back for now, till I cased the joint (what?)
Plus, give the Feds a real good place to point (what?)
And laced the joint, I ain't gonna front I had my hands full
Glad to be alive, but you like, that's that bull (grrrrr)
But now you know, what you get, when you fuckin wit
Cause you shoulda left alone, now you stuck in shit
Duckin shit, til that headpiece gets BLAZED
Screamin this, ahh, cease to the grave
Its over, at least for you it is
Don't need the coroner, to see how true it is
I knew these kid, but did that stop me from gettin em, screamin
IT WAS ALL FOR THE MONEY, while I'm hittin and splittin him down
From his nose to his nuts (what?)
Fire department comin, put the hose to his guts (what?)
Washed away, just like dirt when it rains (uh)
And now because of you, I hurt when it rains (grrrrr)

[Chorus](2x)
X is comin' for ya, can't do nothin for ya
Cause X is comin' for ya
Run, hide, duck, duck
We don't give a fuck, fuck

[Verse 2]
My real name is Damien and my girl's name is Carrie
That Poltergeist bitch is hot, but too young to marry
That nigga Satan be fakin mad jacks so I taxed his ass
Every chance I get, is just another hit (uh, uh, uh, what?)
Another nigga split; there go white meat - another nigga
Takin up room in the morgue under a white sheet (c'mon)
That's what you get for tryin to take it there (uhh)
But with this Desert Eagle in your mouth
You cryin bout let's make it fair (uhh)
Sometimes it takes pain to make the brain a little smarter (uh-huh)
When I think the rain will stop, it only starts to rain harder (uh-huh)
Part of the game is niggas wanna become fam-ous
And doin the same shit I do, remain nameless (uh, uh, uh, uh)
I want house money, Jag money (what?) so I gots ta bag money
I ain't laughin, but yo it's mad funny (c'mon)
I used to talk about that shit you got
But you ain't never got that shit when that shit get hot!
Runnin up in the spot with, two niggas from Israel
Cause it is-real, you did squeal, now how you think yo' kids feel?
Knowin you died a snitch, I look in yo' eyes and see a bitch
Wasn't surprised to see a switch (c'mon)
Let's make it quick, I got a flight at 6 goin to Pakistan
So let this nigga know, I know he pussy, I'mma smack his man (uhh)
Fuckin Willie niggas and silly niggas
I'd rather be eatin of a plate
With all them Baltimore and Philly niggas (WHAT?)
Cause I done took about as much I can stand
A nigga smilin in my face like they my motherfuckin man
Aiyyo, it gets a lot worse, cause there's a curse (WHAT?)
That says, the reward for bein real, is a hearse
Before you turn thirty, cause the dirty shit you did (uhh)
Catches up and get you right when you thought you slid
It's gettin dark, and with the cold of the hawk
You realize, you ain't gonna see your shorty
Old enough to walk, for real

[Chorus](2x)
X is comin' for ya, can't do nothin for ya
Cause X is comin' for ya
Run, hide, duck, duck
We don't give a fuck, fuck

(Sometimes you want more than just a honey wit ass)

[DMX]
Uh, uh
Hey yo, who would ever think that the two would go good
Midtown honey, nigga from the hood
But knock on wood, I got this bitch (what?) excuse me
She don't like to be called a bitch, try not to lose me
The rules we go by, where I'm from, she don't know
When I say I'm goin around the way, she won't go
(Hell no) C'mon baby, you aight with me
Tryin to get you, to spend the whole night with me
(But I'm a good girl) Uhh, that's why I like her
Couldn't treat her like a hoodrat, didn't bite her
Turn a church girl to a straight Ruff Ryder
Take her to the Ramada make it an all nighter
(Oh no, I only go to the Swiss hotel)
Fuckin with me? I have you in the back of the Chevelle
Like what (what) hittin it raw dogg in the butt
You was good this mornin, but tonight you a slut
Chorus: DMX (Dyme)

(You fuckin wit a dog!) That's why I'm feelin you more
Attractive to me, wit yo' tactics
Hit it like AHHH! Make me backflip
(You been tryin to act, rich, that's why I taxed you
And I just got married) Hell, but I ain't even ask you

One more bitch, I'm skippin (Damn girl, stop trippin)
Cause you be actin like

But I will keep you wit a smile, and walkin funny
So what's it gon' be?) Yo, what you mean? (What to do?

You wanna be safe or be laced, cause you can be replaced)
Yeah, you can be erased
(Don't get slapped, babyface)
Chorus

[DMX]
Man, I got shorty stayin out late (Well I keep him wit a cut
And his nails stay clean) At least I get a nut

I can be good in a bad way (I can be bad in a good way)
Girl, you ain't the same dog (that's what them rats in the hood say
Or would say, if you was around them more often)
I got honey smokin weed (it be havin me coughin)
She keep the dog on the leash (when we walk in the streets)
And if y'all think it's sweet (then the dog's off the leash
Now I don't want no drama, wit no baby's mama

Girl, you off the hook, but at least now I know why
Good girls like bad guys

[Intro]
Same old shit, dog, just a different day
It is not a fuckin' game (You know how niggas do, when we play, how we play)
A man's gotta do what a man's gotta do
If it's fuck me, nigga, you know it's fuck you

[Verse 1]
I kick it to shorty to try to help him understand (Uh)
Hit him with work, 'cause yo, that's my little man (Uh-huh)
He asked a few questions 'bout the game and I told him (Yeah)
So when he made a bad m
