; shake it 'til the break of day
I'm right here, baby, I'm not that far away

[Verse 7]
I'm motherless, fatherless, almost friendless too
I'm motherless, fatherless, almost friendless too
It's Friday morning on Franklin Avenue

[Chorus]
Shake, shake, mama; raise your voice and pray
Shake, shake, mama; raise your voice and pray
If you're goin on home, ya better go the shortest way

[Verse 1]
Well I'm looking the world over
Looking far off into the East
And I see my baby coming
She's walking with the village priest
I feel a change coming on
And the last part of the day is already gone

[Verse 2]
We got so much in common
We strive for the same old ends
And I just can't wait
Wait for us to become friends
I feel a change coming on
And the fourth part of the day is already gone

[Verse 3]
Life is for love
And they say that love is blind
If you want to live easy
Baby pack your clothes with mine
I feel a change coming on
And the fourth part of the day is already gone

[Verse 4]
Well now what's the use in dreaming
You got better things to do
Dreams never did work for me anyway
Even when they did come true

[Verse 5]
You are as whorish as ever
Baby you could start a fire
I must be losing my mind
You're the object of my desire
I feel a change coming on
And the fourth part of the day is already gone

[Verse 6]
I'm listening to Billy Joe Shaver
And I'm reading James Joyce
Some people they tell me
I got the blood of the land in my voice

[Verse 7]
Everybody got all the money
Everybody got all the beautiful clothes
Everybody got all the flowers
I don't have one single rose
I feel a change coming on
And the fourth part of the day is already gone

[Verse 1]
Talk about me babe, if you must
Throw on the dirt, pile on the dust
I'd do the same thing if I could
You know what they say, they say it's all good
All good
It's all good

[Verse 2]
Big politician telling lies
Restaurant kitchen, all full of flies
Don't make a bit of difference, don't see why it should
But it's all right, 'cause it's all good
It's all good
It's all good

[Verse 3]
Wives are leaving'their husbands, they are beginning to roam
They leave the party and they never get home
I wouldn't change it, even if I could
You know what they say man, it's all good
It's all good
All good

[Verse 4]
Brick by brick, they tear you down
A teacup of water is enough to drown
You ought to know, if they could they would
Whatever going down, it's all good
All good
Say it's all good

[Verse 5]
People in the country, people on the land
Some of them so sick, they can hardly stand
Everybody would move away, if they could
It's hard to believe but it's all good
Yeah

[Verse 6]
The widow's cry, the orphan's plea
Everywhere you look, more misery
Come along with me, babe, I wish you would
You know what I'm saying, it's all good
All good
I said it's all good
All good

[Verse 7}
Cold-blooded killer, stalking the town
Cop cars blinking, something bad going down
Buildings are crumbling in the neighborhood
But there's nothing to worry about, because it's all good
It's all good
They say it's all good

[Verse 8]
I'll pluck off your beard and blow it in your face
This time tomorrow I'll be rolling in your place
I wouldn't change a thing even if I could
You know what they say, they say it's all good
It's all good

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
When the outside temperature rises
And the meaning is oh, so clear
One thousand and one yellow daffodils
Begin to dance in front of you, oh dear
Are they trying to tell you something?
You're missing that one final screw
You're simply not in the pink, my dear
To be honest, you haven't got a clue

[Chorus]
I'm going slightly mad
I'm going slightly mad
It finally happened, happened
It finally happened, oh-woah
It finally happened, I'm slightly mad
Oh dear, hahaha

[Verse 2]
I'm one card short of a full deck
I'm not quite the shilling
One wave short of a shipwreck
I'm not at my usual top billing
I'm coming down with a fever
I'm really out to sea
This kettle is boiling over
I think I'm a banana tree
Oh dear

[Chorus]
I'm going slightly mad
I'm going slightly mad
It finally happened, happened
Finally happened, uh huh
Finally happened, I'm slightly mad
Oh dear

[Guitar Solo]

Oo-oo-ah-ah, oo-oh-ah-ah

[Verse 3]
I'm knitting with only one needle
Unravelling fast, it's true
I'm driving only three wheels these days
But my dear, how about you?

[Chorus]
I'm going slightly mad
I'm going slightly mad
It finally happened
It finally happened, oh yes
It finally happened, I'm slightly mad
Just very slightly mad

[Outro]
And there you have it

[Verse 1]
Who's got a beard that's long and white?
Santa's got a beard that's long and white
Who comes around on a special night?
Santa comes around on a special night
Special Night, beard that's white

[Chorus]
Must be Santa
Must be Santa
Must be Santa, Santa Claus

[Verse 2]
Who wears boots and a suit of red?

Cap on head, suit that's red
Special night, beard that's white

[Chorus]

Ho, ho, ho, cherry nose
Cap on head, suit that's red
Special night, beard that's white

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
Who very soon will come our way?

Eight little reindeer pull his sleigh?

[Chorus]

Reindeer sleigh, come our way
Ho, ho, ho, cherry nose
Cap on head, suit that's red

[Chorus]
Must be Santa

[Verse 1]
City sidewalk, busy sidewalks
Dressed in holiday style
In the air there's a feeling of Christmas
Children laughing, people passing
Meeting smile after smile
And on every street corner you'll hear

[Chorus]
Silver bells, silver bells
It's Christmas time in the city
Ring-a-ling, hear them ring
Soon it will be Christmas day

[Verse 2]
City street lights, even stop lights
Blink a bright red and green
As the shoppers rush home with their treasures
Hear the snow crunch, see the kids bunch
This is Santa's big scene
And above all this bustle you'll hear

[Chorus]
Silver bells, silver bells
It's Christmas time in the city
Ring-a-ling, hear them ring
Soon it will be Christmas day
Soon it will be Christmas day
(Noel, noel, noel, noel)
(Noel, noel)

[Verse 1]
The first Noel, the angels did say
Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep

Noel Noel Noel Noel
Born is the King of Israel

[Verse 2]
They looked up and saw a star
Shining in the East beyond them far
And to the earth it gave great light
And so it continued both day and night

Noel Noel Noel Noel
Born is the King of Israel

[Verse 3]
This by the light of that same star
Three wise men came from country far
To seek for a King was their intent
And to follow the star wherever it went

Noel Noel Noel Noel
Born is the King of Israel
Ah Noel

[Intro]
Aloha ay
Aloha ay
Aloha oha ay

[Verse 1]
How'd you like to spend Christmas on Christmas Island?
How'd you like to spend the holiday away across the sea?
How'd you like to spend Christmas on Christmas Island?
How'd you like to hang a stocking on a great big coconut tree?

[Verse 2]
How'd you like to stay up late, like the islanders do?
Wait for Santa to sail in with your presents in a canoe
If you ever spend Christmas on Christmas Island
You'll never stray for everyday your Christmas dreams come true

[Verse 3]
How'd you like to stay up late, like the islanders do?
Wait for Santa to sail in with your presents in a canoe
If you ever spend Christmas on Christmas Island
You'll never stray for everyday your Christmas dreams come true

[Outro]
Aloha ay
Aloha ay
Aloha oha ay

[Verse 1]
All through the year we waited
Waited through spring and fall
To hear silver bells ringing
See winter time bringing
The happiest season of all

[Verse 2]
Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos

[Verse 3]
Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny little tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

[Verse 4]
They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly

[Verse 5]
And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you

[Verse 6]
And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you
Merry Christmas to you

[Verse 1]
O' little town of Bethlehem
How still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep
The silent stars go by

Yet in thy dark streets shine
An everlasting Light
The hopes and fears of all the years
Are met in thee tonight

[Verse 2]
How silently, how silently
The wondrous gift is given
So God imparts to human hearts
The blessings of all His heaven

No ear may hear His coming
But in this world of sin
Where meek souls will receive Him still
The dear Christ enters in
Amen

[Verse 1]
Mm, tell mama
Where’d ya sleep last night?
Cain’t ya hear me crying?

Hm, hm, hm

[Verse 1]
Well, I’m standin' on the highway
Tryin' to bum a ride, tryin' to bum a ride
Tryin' to bum a ride
Well, I’m standin' on the highway
Tryin' to bum a ride, tryin' to bum a ride
Tryin' to bum a ride
Nobody seem to know me
Everybody pass me by

[Verse 2]
Well, I’m standin' on the highway
Tryin' to hold up, tryin' to hold up
Tryin' to hold up and be brave
Well, I’m standin' on the highway
Tryin' to hold up, tryin' to hold up and be brave
One road’s going to the bright lights
The other’s going down to my grave

[Verse 4]
Well, I’m standin' on the highway
Vision clear
Well, I’m standin' on the highway
Vision clear
Everybody passin' me by
Nobody seem to know I'm here

[Verse 3]
Well, I’m lookin' down at two cards
They seem to be handmade
Well, I’m lookin' down at two cards
They seem to be handmade
One looks like it’s the ace of diamonds
The other looks like it is the ace of spades

[Verse 4]
Well, I’m standin' on the highway
Watchin' my life roll by
Well, I’m standin' on the highway
Tryin' to bum a ride
Well, I’m standin' on the highway
Tryin' to bum a ride

[Verse 1]
Well I'll sing you a song, It ain't very long
About an old man, who never done wrong
How he died nobody can say
They found him dead in the street one day

[Verse 2]
Well, the crowd, they gathered one fine morn'
At the man whose clothes 'n' shoes were torn
There on the sidewalk he did lay
They stopped 'n' stared 'n' walked their way

[Verse 3]
Well, the p'liceman come and he looked around
"Get up, old man, or I'm a-takin' you down."
He jabbed him once with his billy club
And the old man then rolled off the curb

[Verse 4]
Well, he jabbed him again and loudly said
"Call the wagon, this man is dead"
The wagon come, they loaded him in
I never saw the man again

[Verse 5]
Well, I've sung you my song, it ain't very long
About an old man who never done wrong
How he died no one can say
They found him dead in the street one day

[Verse 1]
To preach of peace and brotherhood
Oh, what might be the cost!
A man he did it long ago
And they hung him on a cross
Long ago, far away
Those things don’t happen nowadays

[Verse 2]
The chains of slaves they dragged the ground
With heads and hearts hung low
But it was during Lincoln’s time
And it was long ago
Long ago, far away
Those things like that don’t happen
No more, nowadays, do they

[Verse 3]
The war guns they bombed and blazed
The whole world bled its blood
Men’s bodies rotted on the ground
As their graves were made in mud
Long ago, far away
Those kind of things don’t happen
No more, nowadays

[Verse 4]
One man had much money
One man had not enough to eat
One man he lived just like a king
The other man begged on the street
Long ago, far away
Things like that don’t happen
No more, nowadays

[Verse 5]
One man died of a knife so sharp
One man died from the bullet of a gun
One man died of a broken heart
To see the lynching’ of his son
Long ago, far away
Things like that don’t happen
No more, nowadays

[Verse 6]
Gladiators killed themselves
It was during the Roman times
People cheered with bloodshot grins
As eyes and minds went blind
Long ago, far away
Things like that don't happen
No more, nowadays

[Verse 7]
And the talk of peace and brotherhood
Oh, what might be the cost
Man he did it long ago, and hung him on a cross
Long ago, far away
Things like that don't happen
No more, nowadays, do they

[Verse 1]
Yes, the gal I got
I swear she’s the screaming end
She wants me to be a hero
So she can tell all her friends

[Verse 2]
Well, she begged, she cried
She pleaded with me all last night
Well, she begged, she cried
She pleaded with me all last night
She wants me to go out
And find somebody to fight

[Verse 3]
She reads too many books
She got new movies inside her head
She reads too many books
She got movies inside her head
She wants me to walk out running
She wants me to crawl back dead

[Verse 4]
You need a different kinda man, babe
One that can grab and hold your heart
Need a different kind of man, babe
One that can hold and grab your heart
You need a different kind of man, babe
You need Napoleon Boneeparte

[Verse 5]
Well, when I’m dead
No more good times will I crave
When I’m dead
No more good times will I crave
You can stand and shout hero
All over my lonesome grave

[Verse 1]
Well, if I had to do it all over again
Babe, I’d do it all over you
And if I had to wait for ten thousand years
Babe, I’d even do that too
Well, a dog’s got his bone in the alley
A cat, she’s got nine lives
A millionaire’s got a million dollars
King Saud’s got four hundred wives
Well, ev’rybody’s got somethin’
That they’re looking’ forward to
I’m looking’ forward to when I can do it all again
And babe, I’ll do it all over you

[Verse 2]
Well, if I had my way tomorrow or today
Babe, I’d run circles all around
I’d jump up in the wind, do a somersault and spin
I’d even dance a jig on the ground
Well, everybody gets their hour
Everybody gets their time
Little David when he picked up his pebbles
Even Sampson after he went blind
Well, everybody gets the chance
To do what they want to do
When my time arrives you better run for your life
’Cause babe, I’ll do it all over you

[Verse 3]
Well, I don’t need no money, I just need a day that’s sunny
Baby, and my days are gonna come
And I grab me a pint, you know that I’m a giant
When you hear me yelling’, “Fee-fi-fo-fum”
Well, you cut me like a jigsaw puzzle
You made me to a walk-in’ wreck
Then you pushed my heart through my backbone
Then you knocked off my head from my neck
Well, if I’m ever stand-in’ steady
A-doin’ what I want to do
Well, I tell you little lover that you better run for cover
’Cause babe, I’ll do it all over you

[Verse 4]
I’m just resting’ at your gate so that I won’t be late
And, momma, I’m a-just sitting’ on the shelf
Look out your window fair and you’ll see me squatting’ there
Just a-fumblin’ and a-mumbling’ to myself
Well, after my cigarette’s been smoked up
After all my liquor’s been drunk
After my dreams are dreamed out
After all my thoughts have been thunk
Well, after I do some of these things
I’m gonna do what I have to do
And I tell you on the side, that you better run and hide
’Cause babe, I’ll do it all over you

[Verse 1]
Well, your clock is gonna stop
At Saint Peter’s gate
Ya gonna ask him what time it is
He’s gonna say, “It’s too late”
Hey, hey!
I’d sure hate to be you
On that dreadful day

[Verse 2]
You’re gonna start to sweat
And you ain’t gonna stop
You’re gonna have a nightmare
And never wake up
Hey, hey, hey!
I’d sure hate to be you
On that dreadful day

[Verse 3]
You’re gonna cry for pills
And your head’s gonna be in a knot
But the pills are gonna cost more
Than what you’ve got
Hey, hey!
I’d sure hate to be you
On that dreadful day

[Verse 4]
You’re gonna have to walk naked
Can’t ride in no car
You’re gonna let ev’rybody see
Just what you are
Hey, hey!
I’d sure hate to be you
On that dreadful day

[Verse 5]
Well, the good wine’s a-flowing
For five cents a quart
You’re gonna look in your moneybags
And find you’re one cent short
Hey, hey, hey!
I’d sure hate to be you
On that dreadful day

[Verse 6]
You’re gonna yell and scream
“Don’t anybody care?”
You’re gonna hear out a voice say
“Shoulda listened when you heard the word down there”
Hey, hey!
I’d sure hate to be you
On that dreadful day

[Verse 1]
My parents raised me tenderly
I was their only son
My mind got mixed with rambling
When I was all so young
And I left my home the first time
When I was twelve and one
I’m a long time a-comin’, Maw
An’ I’ll be a long time gone

[Verse 2]
On the western side of Texas
On the Texas plains
I tried to find a job o’ work
But they said l’s young of age
My eyes they burned when I heard
“Go home where you belong!”
I’m a long time a-comin’
An’ I’ll be a long time gone

[Verse 3]
I remember when I’s rambling
Around with the carnival trains
Different towns, different people
Somehow they’re all the same
I remember children’s faces best
I remember traveling on
I’m a long time a-comin’
I’ll be a long time gone

[Verse 4]
I once loved a fair young maid
An’ I ain’t too big to tell
If she broke my heart a single time
She broke it ten or twelve
I walked and talked all by myself
I did not tell no one
I’m a long time a-comin’, babe
An’ I’ll be a long time gone

[Verse 5]
Many times by the highwayside
I tried to flag a ride
With bloodshot eyes and gritting teeth
I’d watch the cars roll by
The empty air hung in my head
I’s thinkin’ all day long
I’m a long time a-comin’
I’ll be a long time gone

[Verse 6]
You might see me on your crossroads
When I’m a-passin’ through
Remember me how you wished to
As I’m a-Driftin’ from your view
I ain’t got the time to think about it
I got too much to get done
Well, I’m a long time coming
An’ I’ll be a long time gone

[Verse 7]
If I can’t help somebody
With a word or song
If I can’t show somebody
They are traveling’ wrong
But I know I ain’t no prophet
An’ I ain’t no prophet’s son
I’m just a long time a-comin’
An’ I’ll be a long time gone

[Verse 8]
So you can have your beauty
It’s skin deep and it only lies
And you can have your youth
It’ll rot before your eyes
Just give to me my gravestone
With it clearly carved upon:
“I’s a long time a-comin’
An’ I’ll be a long time gone”

[Verse 1]
Oh it’s fare thee well my darling’ true
I’m leaving’ in the first hour of the morn
I’m bound off for the bay of Mexico
Or maybe the coast of Californ
So it’s fare thee well my own true love
We’ll meet another day, another time
It ain’t the leavin’
That’s a-grievin’ me
But my true love who’s bound to stay behind

[Verse 2]
Oh the weather is against me and the wind blows hard
And the rain she’s a-turnin’ into hail
I still might strike it lucky on a highway going’ west
Though I’m traveling’ on a path beaten trail
So it’s fare thee well my own true love
We’ll meet another day, another time
It ain’t the leaving’
That’s a-grievin’ me
But my true love who’s bound to stay behind

[Verse 3]
I will write you a letter from time to time
As I’m rambling’ you can travel with me too
With my head, my heart and my hands, my love
I will send what I learn back home to you
So it’s fare thee well my own true love
We’ll meet another day, another time
It ain’t the leaving’
That’s a-grievin’ me
But my true love who’s bound to stay behind

[Verse 4]
I will tell you of the laughter and of troubles
Be them somebody else’s or my own
With my hands in my pockets and my coat collar high
I will travel unnoticed and unknown
So it’s fare thee well my own true love
We’ll meet another day, another time
It ain’t the leaving
That’s a-grievin’ me
But my true love who’s bound to stay behind

[Verse 5]
I’ve heard tell of a town where I might as well be bound
It’s down around the old Mexican plains
They say that the people are all friendly there
And all they ask of you is your name
So it’s fare thee well my own true love
We’ll meet another day, another time
It ain’t the leaving
That’s a-grievin’ me
But my true love who’s bound to stay behind

[Verse 1]
Tell me what you’re gonna do
When the shadow comes under your door
Tell me what you’re gonna do
When the shadow comes under your door
Tell me what you’re gonna do
When the shadow comes under your door
O Lord, O Lord
What shall you do?

[Verse 2]
Tell me what you’re gonna do
When the devil calls your cards
Tell me what you’re gonna do
When the devil calls your cards
Tell me what you’re gonna do
When the devil calls your cards
O Lord, O Lord
What shall you do?

[Verse 3]
Tell me what you’re gonna do
When your water turns to wine
Tell me what you’re gonna do
When your water turns to wine
Tell me what you’re gonna do
When your water turns to wine
O Lord, O Lord
What should you do?

[Verse 4]
Tell me what you’re gonna do
When you can’t play God no more
Tell me what you’re gonna do
When you can’t play God no more
Tell me what you’re gonna do
When you can’t play God no more
O Lord, O Lord
What shall you do?

[Verse 5]
Tell me what you’re gonna do
When the shadow comes creepin’ in your room
Tell me what you’re gonna do
When the shadow comes creepin’ in your room
Tell me what you’re gonna do
When the shadow comes creepin’ in your room
O Lord, O Lord
What should you do?

I’ve trouble on my mind
Trouble, oh trouble
Trouble on my mind
But the trouble in the world, Lord
Is much more bigger than mine
Hey, hey, so I guess I’m doing fine

[Verse 4]
And I never had no armies
To jump at my command
No, I ain’t got no armies
To jump at my command
But I don’t need no armies
I got me one good friend
Hey, hey, so I guess I’m doing fine

[Verse 5]
I been kicked and whipped and trampled on
I been shot at just like you
I been kicked and whipped and trampled on
I been shot at just like you
But as long as the world keeps a-turning
I just keep a-turnin’ too
Hey, hey, so I guess I’m doing’ fine

[Verse 6]
Well, my road might be rocky
The stones might cut my face
My road it might be rocky
The stones might cut my face
But as some folks ain’t got no road at all
They gotta stand in the same old place
Hey, hey, so I guess I’m doing fine

[Verse 1]
So bold and fine
I've known you for some time
Whole life changed while
Bones like yours and mine
Go dance in the woods and
Down we go, down, down
Oh boy, you're mine
Do you remember old times?

[Chorus]
Oh dear boy, I wanna follow you
You're a wild boy, I am a wild girl too
Oh dear boy, it’s so hollow without you
In a world with everything but it won't do
Oh dear boy, I wanna follow you
You're a wild boy, I am a wild girl too
Oh dear boy, so shallow in the blue
It's our time for everything and I call you

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Sweet love of mine, destruction ain't a crime
For those who find love as a game like you and I
Go dance in the waters of all the tears we have cried
Oh boy, we're fine, do you remember our time?

[Chorus]
Oh dear boy, I wanna follow you
You're a wild boy, I am a wild girl too
Oh dear boy, it’s so hollow without you
In a world with everything but it won't do
Oh dear boy, I wanna follow you
You're a wild boy, I am a wild girl too
Oh dear boy, so shallow in the blue
It's our time for everything and I call you

[Verse]
Check my swag, I travel like sound dawg
You play hard and I'm gravel like ground dawg
I'm underground, call me groundhog
Lay down lawns, I'm the ground law
Don't confuse me with the law,naw
But just confuse me with my pa because I am the Birdman J.R
I ain't trippin' boy, I play the corner like Ripken boy
With the .40 Cal' Ripken boy, rip a boy
Flip your vehicle, split your windshield
Whack your baby momma but I'll let the kid live

[?] people say that I am a kid still
Cause the lil' guy is still riding on big wheels
Okay, okay you're running with a Don
Come through nice ice bucket on my arm
Run through lights in the bubblegum 'Serati
Top kick back like I know a lil' karate
Mommy like Wayne so she show a lean body
We blow a lil' blunt... and
I got it in my pants man
Because I am hotter than a fire
Grill shinin’ like the thing I got up in my tires
Hey so check my

Get you wet in your drawers

[Verse 1: Sean Kingston]
Met her at KOD - said she get off at 3
I'mma be right back - pick her up in my new V
Girl, you've got that good-good, I can't even lie
I ain't even tripping', girl, I know I am that guy
Girl don't hold back - pull up, throw these racks
Show money, no tax - young gun, just like that
Pour it, pour it up cause all I see is dollar signs
Givenchy embalm me, and my crib stay so fly

[Bridge: Sean Kingston]
She say bands make her dance, money make her cum
Bring me a couple of bottles and 20,000 ones
She say bands make her dance, money make her cum
But girl, I ain't tripping cause you've got that seasonal love

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Wale]
Look, couple feelings, she caught 'em
Summer feelings, not autumn
I'm cold baby, I'm a winter
Spring out of your garments
Rain down in your lower
Cause I'm up there like I'm polar
I could be the love of your life
Or I could fuck you like I don't know ya
All these chicks around don't really understand
Just say I could hold you down, don't really need no hand
Cause she move quick, elusive with no frontin'
Don't mean to beg or borrow, but I've got a little somethin'

[Bridge]

[Hook]

[Bridge 2: Sean Kingston]
Damn girl, do you really understand that you
You've got that seasonal love?
Damn girl, do you really understand that you
You've got that seasonal love?
Damn girl, do you really understand that you
You've got that seasonal love?
Damn girl, do you really understand that you
You've got that seasonal love?

Hey, brother
There's an endless road to rediscover
Hey, sister

[Verse 1]
I don't know just how it happened; I let down my guard
Swore I'd never fall in love again, but I fell hard
Guess I should have seen it coming; caught me by surprise
Wasn't looking where I was going; I fell into your arms

[Pre-Chorus]
You came into my crazy world like a cool and cleansing rain
Before I, I knew what hit me, baby, you were flowing through my veins

[Chorus]
I'm addicted to you, hooked on your love
Like a powerful drug I can't get enough of
Lost in your eyes, drowning in blue
Out of control, what can I do?
I'm addicted to you

[Verse 2]
Midnight blows in through the window, dances 'round the room
Got me hypnotised, I'm getting high on the perfume
I couldn't live without you now, oh, I know I'd go insane
I wouldn't last one night alone, baby
I couldn't stand the pain

[Chorus]
I'm addicted to you, hooked on your love
Like a powerful drug I can't get enough of
Lost in your eyes, drowning in blue
Out of control, what can I do?
I'm﻿ addicted to you

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Young Weezy in this motherfucker handcuff her
She ain't nothin' but some stairs, I done ran up her

And the money stills smell like the stuff
I've been countin' all day, got a hundred paper cuts
Got a, mouth of syrup and a white paper cup
Leanin' like a motherfucker, might not even say wassup
I'm the personal trainer, take the key, shape it up
Got rocks on my neck, nigga get your nature up
Smokin' on that bubble gum got a nigga numb
90 G's each wrist make a bitch cum
I just spent a Maserati on my chain man
So when I'm movin' I just say I'm switchin' lanes man
Made a permanent stain, my name name-brand
Bet I schooled your bitch with no game plan
I'm a rock star, niggas know the block part
Niggas know I got bread, toast and pop-tarts
Hard top cars, drop tops as well
Hard work, soft work, chop chop and sell
Cock block hand held, pop pop oh well
Diamonds on my whole chain, flamin' up the whole L

[Hook: Biggie Smalls] x2
Diamonds on my neck, dia-diamonds on my neck
Diamonds on my neck, dia-diamonds on my neck

Smokin' pounds of green, smokin' pounds of green

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Hot boy baby, hotter than them other boys
Standin' by the heater in the summer with the oven on
I'm the nigga that your baby mama lovin' on
Spend your child support on the dress and it's coming off
The youngin is somethin' stunnin' with the tummy off
The Testarosa got a ulcer, I'm just stuntin' ya'll
Birdman JR, I get that money ya'll
Workin' that traffic, call me the cross guard

Red rags up, where my where my B's at?

[Intro: Announcer]
Ladies and Gentleman
To those among you who are easily frightened
We suggest you turn away now
To those of you who think you can take it
We say welcome to the mad house

[Verse: Rihanna & Announcer]
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, oh, oh
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, oh, oh (Mad house)

[Verse 1]
Here we are
Midair off of the cliff
Staring down at the end again
But then again, maybe we're finally
On the road that's headed away from all your complaining
Of hearing the same song
But baby, we'll hear it when I'm gone

[Chorus]
It's time to turn on the last song
Oooh
The last song
Oooh

[Verse 2]
What if you wasted love and our love in time disappeared?
And the sad song ends up being the last song you'll ever hear
It was ours
But I'd do it again, holding hands with my friend again
But then again, maybe we gave our all
A song we'll never forget
Baby let 'em play it, maybe it'll save the world
They gon' miss hearing it when it's gone

[Chorus]
But it's time to turn on the last song
Oooh
The last song
Oooh

[Verse 3]
What if we left every moment that we could spare?
And the perfect song ends up being the last song you'll ever hear
You'll never know when the songs gonna play
The last song you'll hear is the one you made
Your song was beautiful
That's why I started singing it
But this song is our song, so it's playing until the end
Even if it's the last song

[Extended Chorus]
The last song
Oooh
The last song
Oooh
What if you wasted love and our love in time disappeared?
And the perfect song ends up being the last song you'll ever hear
Oooh

[Verse: Drake]
Digital camera, freeze the moments
Use money and talent as my lead component
Normally Drake sip Don P but
You the type of girl that I need Patron with
We could do it, corporate sponsor
Your man prolly riding in his boy's Elantra
You could drop him, he's forgotten, you got options
And plus I show these young boys how to bring the money on in
When they rhymes ain't hot, and they records don't sell
Stuntin' on the strip, came with no I.D
And I only brought cash, if they checkin' oh well
I'm good, Drake make one phone call and I'm inside
Welcome to the life of an icon
And I don't like jewels, but I am thinkin' of you
In the mirror while I'm puttin' all this ice on
So

[Chorus: Lloyd (Drake)]
All I really want is
For you to back it up, go on and put ya weight on it
Cause it's alright, do what you wanna
Make me believe ya

Get it shawty, get it shawty

Til I met you

Wait, wait, wait, for me
I don't wanna go
Wait for me
I wanna go, I wanna go
Wait for me
I wanna go

I was in a bad way, honey
I was in a bad way, I was in a bad way
Bring it on punk, you know that I want it
I'm not a bad girl but when I go to clubs, I want to flaunt it
I feel like, you're Superman, and I'm not
It's on your terms, we can waste all my time
Because I want you, I want to go with you
Don't leave me here, I want to go with you

Can I be your babydoll, my my
Can I be your cherry pie
Why do all the best girls like bad guys
Cause they're to die for

I know what they say about you, you know that I never care
You were always my type with your dark heart and your long, black hair, yeah
Baby, I wanna take you higher, higher
So let me, so let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me love you
Let me love you, let me love you

I don't wanna go
Take me with you
I don't wanna go away, no

You are rollin' hard
Santa Monica Boulevard
Black tint glass on your cherry red car
You know very well no one's bad as you are

[Chorus]
You're hot, hot, hot, hot, hot
You know that I want what you got
You're hot, hot, hot, hot, hot
You know that I want what you got

[Verse 2]
Oh, you look so hot
Your face is like a map of the stars
Your switchblade smile and your battle wound scars
I'm so hot for you, baby, baby
This love is ours

[Pre-Chorus 1]
You're still in the game
I want you to change
Stop makin' it rain
I wanna be your be your girl
Wanna be your girl

[Chorus]
You're hot, hot, hot, hot, hot
You know that I want what you got
You're hot, hot, hot, hot, hot
You know that I want what you got

[Verse 3]
Oh, you look like art
Shinin' like a star in the dark
Lightnin' strikes, you're my infinite spark
Set the world on fire and it's lovely to watch

[Pre-Chorus 2]
They're scared of your name
They know you're insane
I like it that way
I have to be your girl
I gotta be your girl

[Chorus - Variation]
You're hot, hot, hot, hot, hot
You know that I want what you got
You shot, shot, shot, shot, shot
An arrow through my heart now I want you a lot

[Bridge]
Life is like, like a little game
That we like to play
Just for fun, just for fun
'Cause we take nothin' seriously
Nothin's wrong, nothin's wrong, oh
Life is like, like a piece of cake
'Cause we love to play
Just for fun, in the sun
Yeah we know nothin' means a thing cause
We have won, boy we won, won, won, won, won, won, won

[Verse 4]
Oh be still my heart
You're shining like a light in the dark

[Chorus]
You're hot, hot, hot, hot, hot

[Intro]
They all know my name now
It's just another lonely day on the playground
Okay, let's go, 1, 2, 3, 4

[Verse 1]
No I'm not vintage, no I don't care
No I'm not Kylie, no, you can't compare me to another one
There's no one else, I'm nobody, I'm just myself
It's not Fight Club, I'm a rare snowflake
But if I hear you bringing me down, calling me so fake
I will fight you (yes), I will fight you (yes)
Because in the end, there's only truth and God is gonna smite you
Besides that, I don't like you

[Pre-Chorus]
I just wanna party boy, I don't wanna fight
But everybody knows that that's the way it is
Only players can survive

[Chorus]
They all know my name now
It's just another lonely day on the playground
(Only players can survive)
Rain, rain go away, now
Come again another day in the game now
(Only players can survive)

[Verse 2]
No I'm not retro, no I'm not fair
And yes, I like to re-record and dance in underwear
And its not Scarface cause I'mma live forever
And if I hear from anyone you're trying to get too clever
Then I will fight you, I will win, I will rise again, soar in the wind
It's my destiny, the way my life begins
So if you're in my way, I'll knock you down like kingpin

[Pre-Chorus]
I just wanna party boy, I don't wanna fight
But everybody knows that that's the way it is
Only players can survive

[Chorus]
They all know my name now
It's just another lonely day on the playground
(Only players can survive)
Rain, rain go away, now
Come again another day in the game now
(Only players can survive)

[Bridge]
Ring around the rosie, oh
I don't wanna fall down
Keep my feet on the ground
Pocket full of nursery rhymes
I'm just biding my time
Biding my lines

[Verse 3]
I'm wearing the invisible crown
You can't see it yet
Touring up and tearing the town, a soul sinner, yes
Sometimes I rap too
I'm a white girl, but the world is my oyster
I'm a little pearl, yep

[Chorus]
They all know my name now
It's just another lonely day on the playground
(Only players can survive)
Rain, rain go away, now
Come again another day in the game now
(Only players can survive)

[Outro]
Ring around the rosie, oh
I don't wanna fall down
Keep my feet on the ground
Pocket full of nursery rhymes
I'm just biding my time
Biding my lines
Once upon a time
At the foot of a great mountain
There was a town where the people known as happy folk lived
Their very existence a mystery to the rest of the world
Obscured as it was by great clouds
Here they played out their peaceful lives
Innocent of the litany of excessive violence
That was growing in the world below
To live in harmony with the spirit of the mountain called Monkey was enough
Then one day, strange folk arrived in the town
They came in camouflage
Hidden behind dark glasses
And no one noticed them
They only saw shadows
You see
Without the truth of the eyes
The happy folk were blind

[Verse 1: Brian Wilson]
I've been in this town so long that back in the city
I've been taken for lost and gone
And unknown for a long long time
Fell in love years ago
With an innocent girl
From the Spanish and Indian home
Of the heroes and villains

[Verse 2: Brian Wilson]
Once at night catillian squared the fight
And she was right in the rain of the bullets that eventually brought her down
But she's still dancing in the night
Unafraid of what a dude'll do in a town full of heroes and villains

[Chorus: Brian Wilson]
Heroes and villains
Just see what you've done
Heroes and villains
Just see what you've done

[Verse 3: Brian Wilson]
Stand or fall I know there
Shall be peace in the valley
And it's all an affair
Of my life with the heroes and villains

[Bridge - Wordless Vocals]

[Verse 4: Brian Wilson]
My children were raised
You know they suddenly rise
They started so long ago
Head to toe, healthy, wealthy and wise

[Verse 5: Brian Wilson]
I've been in this town so long
So long to the city
I'm fit with the stuff
To ride in the rough
And sunny down snuff I'm alright
By the heroes and

[Chorus: Brian Wilson]
Heroes and villains
Just see what you've done
Heroes and villains
Just see what you've done

We did everything we could do to try and make it work (We did, we did, babe)
Baby, you look so confused 'cause it feels like there was no way we could lose (No way, no way, babe)
Baby, I just don't know why I can't find the things you need in me (I can't, I can't, girl)

You'll be just fine
Just fine, just fine, I know that, baby

[RAP BATTLE 1]
I'ma tell you this for your own benefit
Your shit was dope as hell, 'specially when you wrote ninety-percent of it
What you need to do is practice on your freestyles
'Fore you come up missin', like Snoop Dogg's police files
This type of literature that I'm spittin' be hittin'
You gonna swear to God this shit was written
But it wasn't, I'll kill a dozen rappers when I'm buzzin'
Guzzlin', beat your ass like a jealous husband
Now, you boys are about to suffer and see north
When you go in a coma longer than Vladimir Konstantinov
Cut the damn machine off
Get a clean cloth, and wipe this bloody video screen off

[RAP BATTLE 2]
I'm movin' in for the kill, plus I got the trap set
I can tell you're wack as fuck, and I ain't even hear you rap yet
Look at you thinkin', "I'm about to whip his ass
‘Cause I'ma do some written shit, plus I get to go last."
Well, guess what? Even if I go first, it's no worse
My shit's still gon' demolish yo' verse
I'm 'bout to slice you like a Ginsu
And anything you say can and will be used against you
In a court of law, I'm short and raw
Take your fuckin' shit and cut it off
Yo, you wanna be a dope MC?
Look, don't get mad and start takin' your period out on me
'Cause I ain't done shit to you

[RAP BATTLE 3]
You wanna represent on the microphone, but you rap sleazily
I ain't about to battle this fake ass Eazy-E
There ain't no way I'ma do this bullshit
I don't give a fuck, I'm loaded up with a full clip
Rhyme of the month? You couldn't get the tape of the day
Take him away, I rip him like a paper mache
I heard you rap before, you ain't about shit
This whole battle was mismatched, like your outfit
Try to battle me and get your mouth split
You sold out, like Ticketmaster Outlet
Ha ha, I bust and I crush
I don't give a fuck, ain't no way that you can fuck with us
I'm givin' back with pimp shit
I laminate that ass in a badge and wear it at the Rap Olympics

[RAP BATTLE 4]
Blah-badee-blah-da-blah-blah—stop babblin'!
You so fuckin' wack I'ma walk away while you battlin'
Fuck that, I'm on a brand new solo mission
To make sure that Wendy Day kicks your ass out of the rap coalition
I throw a switch at an execution
With an overdose of devotion
Don't talk back, I'm the dope, bitch
So who you sound like on the mic?
There was only one 2Pac, your thug style is just one big sike
Take a big hike, bitch, you can't catch me
Your best rhymes still ain't shit, like a patsy
What the fuck you gonna do?
I'll battle anybody in your crew
And I don't give a fuck, I slaughter boys
Especially wack-ass emcees that will wear a fake-ass corduroy

[RAP BATTLE 5]
I'm 'bout to make this mic short circuit
This beat is wack as fuck—this shit fits you perfect!
I got so many ways to diss you that I'm playful with you
I'll let a razor slit you, 'til they have to staple-stitch you
And everybody in this fuckin' place'll miss you
If you try to turn my facial tissue to a racial issue
Nobody's hearin' you, you're a wack liar
Damn! All your white jokes just backfired
‘Cause, bitch, you barkin' up the wrong tree
Now go tell all your boys that you was beat by a honkey
I don't give a fuck, I'll kill ya
Bitch, you better recognize me, like I look familiar
Anything you say, I'ma kill ya
Grill ya, when I fuckin' drill ya
I'm Marsh, but you're the one that's mellow

[Verse 1]
Don't wanna be a Canadian idiot
Don't wanna be some beer-swillin' hockey nut
And do I look like some frostbitten hose-head?
I never learned my alphabet from A to Zed

[Chorus]
They all live on donuts and moose meat
And they leave the house without packin' heat
Never even bring their guns to the mall
And you know what else is too funny?
Their stupid Monopoly money
Can't take 'em seriously at all

[Verse 2]
Well, maple syrup and snow's what they export
They treat curling just like it's a real sport
They think their silly accent is so cute
Can't understand a thing they're talkin' aboot

[Chorus]
Sure, they've got their national healthcare
Cheaper meds, low crime rates and clean air
Then again, well, they've got Celine Dion
Eat their weight in Kraft macaroni
And dream of drivin' a Zamboni
All over Saskatchewan

[Verse 3]
Don't wanna be a Canadian idiot
Won't figure out their temperature in Celsius
See the map, they're hoverin' right over us
Tell you the truth, it makes me kinda nervous

[Chorus]
Always hear the same kind of story
Break their nose and they'll just say "sorry"
Tell me what kind of freaks are that polite?
It's gotta mean they're all up to somethin'
So quick, before they see it comin'
Time for a pre-emptive strike!

[Verse 1]
Well I dreamed I saw the knights in armor comin'
Sayin' something about a queen
There were peasants singin' and drummers drummin'
And the archer split the tree
There was a fanfare blowin' to the sun
That was floating on the breeze
Look at Mother Nature on the run
In the 1970s
Look at Mother Nature on the run
In the 1970s

[Verse 2]
I was lyin' in a burned out basement
With the full moon in my eyes
I was hopin' for replacement
When the sun burst though the sky
There was a band playin' in my head
And I felt like getting high
I was thinkin' about what a friend had said
I was hopin' it was a lie
Thinkin' about what a friend had said
I was hopin' it was a lie

[Verse 3]
Well, I dreamed I saw the silver space ships flyin'
In the yellow haze of the sun
There were children cryin' and colors flyin'
All around the chosen ones
All in a dream, all in a dream
The loadin' had begun
Flying Mother Nature's silver seed
To a new home in the sun
Flying Mother Nature's silver seed
To a new home

Come on and ease on down, ease on down the road
Come on and ease on down, ease on down the road
Don't you carry nothing that might be a load
Come on, ease on down, ease on down, down the road

[Verse 1]
Pick your left foot up when your right foot's down
(Come on legs keep movin', don't you lose no ground)
You just keep on keepin' on the road that you choose
Don't you give up walkin', 'cause you gave up shoes, no

[Refrain]
Come on and ease on down, ease on down the road
Come on and ease on down, ease on down the road
Don't you carry nothing that might be a load
Come on, ease on down, ease on down, down the road

[Verse 2]
'Cause there may be times when you think you lost your mind
(And the steps you're takin' leave you three, four steps behind)
But the road you're walking might be long sometimes
You just keep on steppin' and you'll be just fine, yeah

Don't you carry nothing that might be a load

Get 'em up, goin' down, ease on down

"Hey, look out for my glass up there, man
That's my drink, man, that's my drink, alright
Make it a double, or eh
Somebody has to sing
Some body will sing?
Somebody will sing, right?
I don't know"

You all pass me that bottle
And I'll sing you all a real song
Yeah
Let me get my key, ahem

Well, I'm looking through Harlem
My stomach squeal just a little more
A stagecoach full of feathers and footprints
Pulls up to soap box door
Now a lady with a pearl handled necktie
Tied to the driver's fence
Breathes in my face
Bourbon and coke possessed words
"Haven't I seen you somewhere in hell
Or was it just an accident?"
(You know how I felt then, and so)
Before I could ask "Was it the East or West side?"
My feet they howled in pain
The wheels of a bandwagon cut very deep
But not as deep in my mind as the rain
And as they pulled away, I could see her words
Stagger and fall on my muddy tent
Well I picked them up, brushed them off
To see what they say
And you wouldn't believe
"Come around to my room, with the tooth in the middle
And bring along the bottle and a president"

[Chorus]
And eh sometimes it's not so easy, baby
Especially when your only friend
Talks, sees, looks and feels like you
And you do just the same as him
(Gets very lonely up this road, baby)
(Yeah, hmmm, yeah)
(Got more to say)

[Verse 2]
Well I'm riding through LA (huh)
On a bicycle built for a fool
And I seen one of my old buddies
And he say, "You don't look the way you usually do"
I say, "Well, some people look like a coin-box"
He says, "Looks like you have got no coins to spare"
And I laid back and I thought to myself, and I said this
I just picked up my pride from underneath the pay phone
And combed this breath right out of my hair

[Chorus]
And eh sometimes it's not so easy
Especially when your only friend
Talks, sees, looks and feels like you
And you do just the same as him

[Verse 3]
I just got out of a Scandinavian jail
And I'm on my way straight home to you
But I feel so dizzy, I take a quick look in the mirror
To make sure my friend's here with me too
And you know good well I don't drink coffee
So you fill my cup full of sand
And the frozen tea leaves on the bottom
Cherry lipstick around the broken edge
And my coat that you let your dog lay by the fire on
And your cat he attacks me from his pill-box ledge
And I thought you were my friend too
Man, my shadow comes in line before you

[Chorus]
I'm finding out that it's not so easy, baby
Especially when your only friend
Talks, sees, looks and feels like you
And you do the same just like him

[Outro]
(Lord it's so lonely here, hmmm, yeah)
Yeah!
(Pass me that bottle over there)
Yeah, yeah, okay

[Intro]
Some people
Oh—woah—oh—oh
Oh—woah—oh—oh
Yeah
People say, people
People oh
Yeah, said

[Verse 1]
People love you when they on your mind
A thought is love's currency
And I been thinkin' 'bout her all the time
I never seen somebody put together perfectly
What would I have to do to call you mine?
Someone like you is so hard to find
You can open up your eyes, or you can walk in blind
All I ask is that you hurry, I won't hurt you, don't you worry
Listen to me, I'ma set you free
He ain't gonna break your heart again
Go through the worst to reach the ecstasy
When your imagination's on pretend
I never thought that it would feel this way
You never taught me how to heal the pain
I wish you caught me on a different day
When it was easier to be happy

[Chorus]
Just a little taste and you know she got you
Can you hide away? Can you hide away?
Sound of silence as they all just watch you
I kinda find it strange how the times have changed
I wish we could go and be
Free once, baby, you and me
We could change the world forever
And never come back again
Let's leave it all in the rear view
Let's leave it all in the rear view, girl
You don't have to cry
You don't have to cry

[Verse 2]
Mend a broken heart, girl, if you can
I don't expect you to be capable
You got the world right in your hands
And that responsibility is unescapable
I promise that I'll be a different man
Please give me the chance to go and live again
I'm havin' some trouble, can you give a hand?
It seems perfection really is so unattainable
Don't even say you 'bout to end it all
Your life precious, ain't no need to go and kill yourself
I ain't so sure that there's an end at all
I wish the truth would just reveal itself
Who do you call to make it to the top?
And who do you call to make the shootin' stop?
And who do you call to give the coupe a wash?
After everything I did I think I'm still myself

[Chorus]
Just a little taste and you know she got you
Can you hide away? Can you hide away?
Sound of silence as they all just watch you
I kinda find it strange how the times have changed
I wish we could go and be
Free once, baby, you and me
We could change the world forever
And never come back again
Let's leave it all in the rear view
Let's leave it all in the rear view, girl
You don't have to cry
You don't have to cry

[Verse 1]
I used to bite my tongue and hold my breath
Scared to rock the boat and make a mess
So I sat quietly, agreed politely
I guess that I forgot I had a choice
I let you push me past the breaking point
I stood for nothing, so I fell for everything

[Pre-Chorus]
You held me down, but I got up (Hey)
Already brushing off the dust
You hear my voice, you hear that sound
Like thunder, gonna shake the ground
You held me down, but I got up (Hey)
Get ready 'cause I've had enough
I see it all, I see it now

[Chorus]
I got the eye of the tiger, a fighter
Dancing through the fire
'Cause I am a champion, and you’re gonna hear me roar
Louder, louder than a lion
'Cause I am a champion, and you’re gonna hear me roar

[Post-Chorus]
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
You’re gonna hear me roar

[Verse 2]
Now I’m floating like a butterfly
Stinging like a bee, I earned my stripes
I went from zero, to my own hero

[Pre-Chorus]
You held me down, but I got up (Hey)
Already brushing off the dust
You hear my voice, you hear that sound
Like thunder, gonna shake the ground
You held me down, but I got up (Got up)
Get ready 'cause I've had enough
I see it all, I see it now

[Chorus]
I got the eye of the tiger, a fighter
Dancing through the fire
'Cause I am a champion, and you’re gonna hear me roar
Louder, louder than a lion
'Cause I am a champion, and you’re gonna hear me roar

[Post-Chorus]
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
You’re gonna hear me roar
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
(You'll hear me roar)
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
You’re gonna hear me roar

[Bridge]
Roar, roar, roar, roar, roar

[Chorus]
I got the eye of the tiger, a fighter
Dancing through the fire
'Cause I am a champion, and you’re gonna hear me roar
Oh, louder, louder than a lion
'Cause I am a champion, and you’re gonna hear me roar

[Post-Chorus]
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh (Yeah)
You’re gonna hear me roar
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
(You'll hear me roar)
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
You’re gonna hear me roar

[Verse 1]
I ain't got no money
I ain't like those other guys you hang around
And it's kind of funny
But they always seem to let you down
And I get discouraged
'Cause I never see you anymore
And I need your love, babe, yeah
That's all I'm living for, yeah

[Pre- Chorus]
I didn't wanna pressure you, baby
But all I ever wanted to do

[Chorus]
I wanna be your lover
I wanna be the only one that makes you come running
I wanna be your lover
I wanna turn you on, turn you out, all night long, make you shout
Oh, lover!
Yeah, I wanna be the only one you come for

[Verse 2]
I wanna be your brother
I wanna be your mother and your sister, too
There ain't no other
That can do the things that I'll do to you
And I get discouraged
'Cause you treat me just like a child
And they say I'm so shy, yeah
But with you I just go wild, woo!

[Pre-Chorus]
I didn't wanna pressure you, baby, no
But all I ever wanted to do

[Chorus]
I wanna be your lover
I wanna be the only one that makes you come running
I wanna be your lover
I wanna turn you on, turn you out, all night long, make you shout
Oh, lover!
Yeah, I wanna be the only one you come for, yeah

[Verse 1]
Well the stars, always shine
You'll be mine, and I know
You'll be mine
How they shine
You'll be mine

[Chorus]
As the stars (as the stars)
Always shine (always shine)
You'll be mine (you'll be mine)
You'll be mine
And the stars (and the stars)
Always shine (always shine)
You'll be mine
Now, ah, ah, ah, ah...

[Verse 2]
(My darling
When you brought me that toast the other morning
I, I looked into your eye
And I could see a National Health eyeball
And I loved you, like I've never done
Like I've never done before!)

[Chorus]
Well the stars (well the stars)
They shine (oh, they shine)
And you'll be mine
Oh, you will be mine
You'll be mine
At the star (at the star)
Always shining

[Verse 1]
See how my harbored might is blowing away
He breaks my fall as dawning of day break
Welts with a mobius streak
Boundless and righteous for our
Magnolia seed surely ripe in the dark

Origami birds flock from my heart
Burst out in color to wherever you are

Ancient psychic, tandem, war elephants
Rest in my skin, fit this
Try angels, try angles
Try angels, try angels

[Verse 2]
See how my harbored might is blowing away
He breaks my fall as dawning of day break
Welts with a mobius streak
Boundless and righteous for our
Magnolia seed surely righteous for our
Started out as a pause, first leather bound and wrapped around the rhythm of my temperature
Rorschach way is back and raw to the marrow, fierce as don't toll me back missy mister official document
My, my ,my dot dot dot
My, my, my dot dot ocelot
My, my, my ocelot tongue is sharp and it'll eat you up
Leave you looming wild eyed far cry and wondering in the dark
Best you try to spot dot
Best you try to spot dot dot
Best you try to spot dot dot dot
Best you try to spot dot dot dot dot ocelot

[Intro: DJ Drama]
Ayo, this the one? We all get caught in our own sins. Sometimes I have to remind myself, that on my worst day, I live like somebody on their greatest—and so do you. Don't let your demons take you to Hell. Introduce 'em to Heaven!

[Chorus: Gourdan Banks]
Some niggas go to college, some niggas go to jail
Some make it into Heaven, some make it into Hell
Nobody wanna lose, nobody wanna fail
Nobody wanna die, nobody wanna kill
The things we do just to make it through
But nobody wanna lose, nobody wanna fail
Nobody wanna die, we're just tryna live our life

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Look, I got homies in the ground, skeleton and bones
And niggas doin' life, they ain't never comin' home
They said I wouldn't make it or never see the throne
And my baby mama hate me ‘cause she said I did her wrong
‘Cause I left, to chase my dream, get it any means
I said that I'll be back, she wasn't listenin' to me
That back-and-forth arguin' was gettin' in between
I said fuck them other niggas, I go get it with my team
If we all grind, we all shine, fuck a part-time
I used to play the block early mornin' and dark time
Now it's G5 flights, fuck a depart time
It was hard times, nigga, now it's our time
Just take a look at my life, rappin' brought me back to life
‘Cause I was in them streets, my heart was cold as a pack of ice
Every night we strappin' like we was in Iraq to fight
‘Cause niggas gettin' murdered for a block that do a stack a night
Whoa, I got to make it home to my son
On them papers with a firm hold on his gun
Before I snitch they gotta burn a hole in my tongue
Give me a hundred years in a hole on the sun
In boilin' water, in the world of no order
In the hood, ain't no loyalty, ain't no world for your daughter
Ain't no life for your brother, on the life of my mother
I'ma get the fam right, nigga, you damn right!

[Chorus: Gourdan Banks]
Some niggas go to college, some niggas go to jail
Some make it into Heaven, some make it into Hell
Nobody wanna lose, nobody wanna fail
Nobody wanna die, nobody wanna kill
The things we do just to make it through
But nobody wanna lose, nobody wanna fail
Nobody wanna die, we're just tryna live our life

[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
Yeah, I used to pop a lot of shit, now I keep it moderate
These niggas know I been iced out, hoppin' outta shit
Right now I'm prayin' for my son to get this scholarship
A nice university, one of these black colleges
Far as the hood go, I acknowledge it
But whoever ain't a snake's usually a follower
Luckily, I can tell the difference
My man comin' home, my other man gettin' sentenced
Soft niggas usually send the hate through the bitches
Jealous Instagram niggas hatin' on your pictures
We dream-chasin', y'all niggas walkin' behind wishes
Without workin' for it, not often you find riches
Some niggas find coffins, others just find ditches
Just ask around 'bout the militia, they malicious
D-block, finish that and cop more dope
I'm two-stroke, you four-stroke
If you got enough cigars we can all smoke
Ain't nothin' all good when you all broke
So we could never be equal
Never bite the hand that'll feed you
Never fear a man if he bleed too
Some niggas need a headshot, some niggas need two
Play sweet in these streets and they'll leave you
You can't see the Devil, he's see-through

[Chorus: Gourdan Banks]
Some niggas go to college, some niggas go to jail
Some make it into Heaven, some make it into Hell
Nobody wanna lose, nobody wanna fail
Nobody wanna die, nobody wanna kill
The things we do just to make it through
But nobody wanna lose, nobody wanna fail
Nobody wanna die, we're just tryna live our life

[Verse 1]
Come out angels, come out ghosts
Come out darkness, bring everyone you know
I'm not running, and I'm not scared
I am waiting, and well prepared

[Chorus]
I'm in the war of my life
At the door of my life
Out of time, and there's nowhere to run

[Verse 2]
I got a hammer, and a heart of glass
I got to know right now, which walls to smash
I got to pocket, got no pills
If fear hasn't killed me yet, then nothing will

All the suffering
And all the pain
Never left a name

[Chorus]
I'm in the war of my life
At the door of my life
Out of time, and there's nowhere to run
I'm in the war of my life
At the door of my life
Out of time, and there's nowhere to run

[Bridge]
No more suffering
No more pain
Never again

[Chorus]
I'm in the war of my life
At the door of my life
Out of time, and there's nowhere to run
I'm in the war of my life
At the door of my life
Out of time, and there's nowhere to run

[Outro]
So fight on (I won't give up)
Fight on, everyone (I won't run)
Fight on, got no choice but to fight until it's done (I won't stop for anyone)
So fight on
So fight on (I won't give up)
Fight on, everyone (I won't run)
Fight on, got no choice but to fight until it's done (I won't stop for anyone)
So fight on

Ain't got time for my homie
He's somewhere high, tryin' to delay

I don't mind that me and my tenderoni
We're on the dollar, tryin' to get paid

[Pre-Chorus: Ronald Isley]
All I know, can't wait until tomorrow

Tryin' to see another day
Tryin' to find a better way, mmm (No, no, no), mmm
Tryin' to see another day (Tryin' to)
Tryin' to find a better way (Find a better way, woo)

[Verse 1]
I stand here waiting for you to bang the gong
To crash the critic saying, "Is it right or is it wrong?"
If only fame had an IV, baby, could I bear
Being away from you? I found the vein, put it in here

[Pre-Chorus]
I live for the applause, applause, applause
I live for the applause-plause, live for the applause-plause
Live for the way that you cheer and scream for me
The applause, applause, applause

[Chorus]
Give me that thing that I love (I'll turn the lights out)
Put your hands up, make 'em touch, touch (Make it real loud)
Give me that thing that I love (I'll turn the lights out)
Put your hands up, make 'em touch, touch (Make it real loud)

[Post-Chorus]
A-P-P-L-A-U-S-E (Make it real loud)
A-P-P-L-A-U-S-E
Put your hands up, make 'em touch, touch
A-P-P-L-A-U-S-E (Make it real loud)
A-P-P-L-A-U-S-E
Put your hands up, make 'em touch, touch

[Verse 2]
I've overheard your theory, "Nostalgia's for geeks"
I guess sir, if you say so, some of us just like to read
One second I'm a Koons, then suddenly the Koons is me
Pop culture was in art, now art's in pop culture, in me

[Pre-Chorus]
I live for the applause, applause, applause
I live for the applause-plause, live for the applause-plause
Live for the way that you cheer and scream for me
The applause, applause, applause

[Chorus]
Give me that thing that I love (I'll turn the lights out)
Put your hands up, make 'em touch, touch (Make it real loud)
Give me that thing that I love (I'll turn the lights out)
Put your hands up, make 'em touch, touch (Make it real loud)

[Post-Chorus]
A-P-P-L-A-U-S-E (Make it real loud)
A-P-P-L-A-U-S-E
Put your hands up, make 'em touch, touch
A-P-P-L-A-U-S-E (Make it real loud)
A-P-P-L-A-U-S-E
Put your hands up, make 'em touch, touch

[Bridge]
Woo... touch, touch
Woo... touch, touch
Now... woo-oh-oh-oh...
Woo-oh-oh-oh...

[Pre-Chorus]
I live for the applause, applause, applause
I live for the applause-plause, live for the applause-plause
Live for the way that you cheer and scream for me
The applause, applause, applause

[Chorus]
Give me that thing that I love (I'll turn the lights out)
Put your hands up, make 'em touch, touch (Make it real loud)
Give me that thing that I love (I'll turn the lights out)
Put your hands up, make 'em touch, touch (Make it real loud)

[Post-Chorus]
A-P-P-L-A-U-S-E (Make it real loud)
A-P-P-L-A-U-S-E
Put your hands up, make 'em touch, touch
A-P-P-L-A-U-S-E (Make it real loud)
A-P-P-L-A-U-S-E
Put your hands up, make 'em touch, touch

[Outro]
A-R-T-P-O-P

[Verse 1 - Gucci Mane]
I'm Gucci Mane and I'm so player
And when I grab her hair, baby scream "oh yeah"
Triple ice on so they gon' stare
I like it when they wear the dress without the underwear
I'm swingin' through the club like I don't care
I'm a million dollar figure, nowadays that's rare
And you ain't gotta talk boo, I ain't finna stalk you
Girl, I get like fifty thousand dollars just to walk through
All this stuntin', I'm so blunted
What I'm gon' do with all this money?
Bag it up, wrap it up, trash bag money
Hundred pounds, ninety-three, octane money

[Hook - Gucci Mane]
I go hard on a bitch
I go hard on a bitch, man
I'm so smart on a bitch
I go hard on a bitch, man

[Verse 2 - Gucci Mane]
Baby, it's my watch that got everybody watchin'
Them white BBS's on the bracelet got 'em talkin'
Perfected on my life, thirty years of stress
A million dollar statue as a token of success
So practice makes perfect, I'm on side turfin'
While you internet surfin' and buyin' hoes purses
I'm so hard on a bitch
I go hard on a bitch, man
I'm so smart on a bitch
I go hard on a bitch, man
I just fuck her, throw her chump change and it's to the next thang
I go from the jump, man, but you bitches know I...

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Chill Will]
I'm feelin' my homie Game, I got money, I got fame
Wanna hear some more? I got pool, I got range
Bitches wet they clothes when I step up in the door
But I treat these monkey hoes like some garbage on the floor
I know I be fly like the man on the moon
You standin' in my space, baby let me get some room
Take a step back let me see what you look like
Dig you, I might, only if you weigh
I'm so smart on these hoes, man games I be playin'
I go hard on these hoes let that lame hold your hand
She say she wanna love me, I won't let her rub me
Dick up in her mouth, that's the only way she touch me

[Hook]

[Hook]
I be big boy stuntin, big boy stuntin
Ride behind 5 percent tints gettin blunted
I be big boy stuntin', big boy stuntin'
If you ain't got it I ain't trippin' I front it

(Gucci Mane):
I'mma stunt, roll another blunt, double park my dunk in the front
Jump out with my gun, walk off in the club, have fun
20,000 ones, yellow diamond shine bright as the sun
Gucci out the whip, drop top with a blunt, smokin' chron
Yeah my motor run, me and money got a stupid blunt

I'mma pick a gun, do you hear me son? (We the ???)

Picture this, Gucci talkin' slick, gots a couple chicks, she ain't shit
Ring on my finger, cost a bout a brick, I'm the shit
Bitch, you know that shit, you know I'm the shit

Left wrist, cost a hundred bitch canary on my fist
Me and black, all in dallas now, jumpin out my lam
Girl a chap, that's so icy wow
Gucci man I am

[Hook]

I be big boy stuntin, big boy stuntin, ride behind 5 or 6 head gettin bloodied
I be big boy stuntin, big boy stuntin, if you ain't got it I ain't trippin I front it

[Verse 1]
The summer's over
This town is closing
They're waving people out of the ocean
We have the feeling like we were floating
We never noticed where time was going

Do you remember when we first got here
The days were longer, the nights were hot here
Now, it's September; the engine's starting
You're empty-handed and heavy-hearted

[Chorus]
But just remember on the way home
That you were never meant to feel alone
It takes a little while, but you'd be fine
Another good time coming down the line

[Verse 2]
You'll go back to love that's waiting
I'll unpack in a rented room
How's that life you swear you're hating
Grass is greener: that makes two

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Life isn't short, but it sure is small
You get forever but nobody at all
Life isn't short, but it sure is small
You get forever but nobody at all

It don't come often, and it don't stay long

[Outro]
But just remember on the way home
That you don't ever have to feel alone
Just stay on the run, get off the grid
Hide yourself out like you know that I did
And if you might find that you're running is done
A little bit of Heaven never hurt no one

[Intro]
Yeah!
Goddamn!
Feels like a long time, don't it?
Did you miss us? We missed you! Haha!
Shady Narcotics
It's The Re-Up, pussies!
And we're back: myself
D12, 50 Cent
Obie Trice, Stat Quo
A-A-A-Al-Al-Al-Al-Alchemist
And I would also like to introduce
The two newest members of the family:
One goes by the name of Bobby Creek
The other goes by the name of Ca$his
From Orange County
And I think it's about time we just cut the bullshit, let's go!

[Verse 1: D'Phuzion]
Yo, B-Rabbit
This silly rabbit don’t like lettuce I heard he like dicks
Faggot niggas, with ponytails and lipstick
I'm for real; don’t give a fuck, what
What, ohh
It’s like this; east side is where I'm from
You got beef hit me on the streets with a badge and a gun
Fuck the badge; I'm coming through with black mags
'Bout to do this B-Rabbit nigga 'cause he's a fag
Like I said earlier in the clause
I stated that in my, oh shit

[Verse 2: Eminem (as B-Rabbit)]
A'ight look
I can see that I’m put to the test
Battling this chick, with no breasts
And why I gotta battle a chick
Especially one that’s whack, wit' a dick?
So you a dope MC?
Don’t get mad, start taking' your period out on me
‘Cause I ain’t done shit to you
What’s your name, Diffusion? Well then I guess I gotta diffuse you
This ain’t something I’m used to
Why the fuck did Future even introduce you?
I really don’t understand
Why this chick is up here right now and wants to be a man
On this mic it’s rat-a-tat-tat
Why the fuck am I standing here battling Da Brat?
You don’t really even wanna see this
On this microphone, I will eat your fucking fetus
Yo

[Marv Won]
Yo, yo, y'all ready for death? Y'all ready for death?
Marv Won, the Fat Killer
The game done got ugly, let's go, yo, yo
I seen your type before, you think you're tough
Battle you? Bitch, you lucky I don't beat you up
In a game of fisticuffs, I'll push your face back
You can't fuck with me, man, really, just face facts
It's him versus me in a battle of ten rounds
It's like Muggsy Bogues tryin' to fuck with Jim Brown
Dumb fuck, I'm the type to run amok
Come in the club drunk as fuck
Slap your bitch so we can buck
One hook... type of a man the size of Dan Dierdorf
Tryin' to take his ear off, like Mike Tys
I'm quite nice on fight nights
And why he poppin' shit? Man, I thought he liked life
Apparently not, I'm incoherently hot
And if I miss you then your parents get shot
Yo, I'm a bad boy, bitch, it's on
I'll put 44's on your chest like you're Rick Mahorn

[B-Rabbit]
Hold on, faggot, let me turn this mic on
Don't think for a minute I'ma let you
Get away with that song
'Cause that shit was wack, you ain't spittin'
As a matter of fact, all of that shit was written
And I know it wasn't for me
Surely, you really must adore me
Now, look it… yo, you might as well move  to Italy
Look, this guy's ripped...*skkkrr* – literally
You don't wanna really fuck with this
On this microphone, I'm not Snuffleupagus
But I don't give a fuck, you can keep that dull rap
And turn your ass back around with your fuckin' skullcap
And your bandana or your motherfuckin' sweatband
Fuckin' with this style, you're a dead man
I ain't Redman, but on this mic, yo, I pick it up
Just like your face when I had to rip it up
You don't wanna see me, yo, uh

[Intro: Big Sean]
Mhm, I look up
Yeah, and I take my time, nigga
I'ma take my time, woah
Mhm, power moves only, nigga

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Boy, I'm 'bout my business on business, I drink liquor on liquor
I had women on women: yeah, that's bunk-bed bitches
I've done lived more than an 80-year-old man still kickin'
‘Cause they live for some moments, and I live for a livin'
But this for the girls who barely let me get to first base
On some ground ball shit
‘Cause now I run my city on some town hall shit
They prayin' on my motherfuckin' downfall, bitch
Like a drought, but you gon' get this rain like it's May weather
G.O.O.D. Music, 'Ye weather
Champagne just tastes better
They told me I never, boy, never say never
Swear flow special like an infant's first steps
I got paid then reversed debts
Then I finally found a girl that reverse stress
So now I'm talkin' to the reaper to reverse death
Yep, so I can kick it with my granddad, take him for a ride
Show him I made somethin' out myself and not just tried
Show him the house I bought the fam, let him tour inside
No matter how far ahead I get, I always feel behind in my mind
But fuck tryin' and not doin'
‘Cause not doin' is somethin' a nigga not doin'
I said fuck tryin' and not doin'
‘Cause not doin' is somethin' a nigga not doin'
I grew up to Em, B.I.G., and Pac, bitch, and got ruined
So until I got the same crib B.I.G. had in that "Juicy" vid
Bitch, I can't motherfuckin' stop movin'
Go against me, you won't stop losin'
From the city where every month is May-Day at home, spray your dome
Niggas get sprayed up like A.K. was cologne for a paycheck or loan
Yeah, I know that shit ain't fair
They say Detroit ain't got a chance, we ain't even got a mayor
You write your name with a Sharpie, I write mine in stone
I knew the world was for the taking and wouldn't take long
We on, tryna be better than everybody that's better than everybody
Rep Detroit, everybody, Detroit vers' everybody
I'm so fuckin' first class I could spit up on every pilot
The city's my Metropolis, feel it, it's metabolic
And I'm over niggas sayin' they're the hottest niggas
Then run to the hottest niggas just to stay hot
I'm one of the hottest because I flame drop
Drop fire, and not because I'm namedroppin', Hall of Fame droppin'
And I ain't takin' shit from nobody unless they're OGs
‘Cause that ain't the way of a OG
So I G-O collect mo' Gs, every dollar
Never changed though, I'm just the new version of old me
Forever hot-headed but never got cold feet
Got up in the game, won't look back at my old seats
Clique so deep we take up the whole street
I need a bitch so bad that she take up my whole week
Sean Don

[Bridge: Kendrick Lamar]
Miscellaneous minds are never explainin' their minds
Devilish grin for my alias aliens to respond
Peddlin' sin, thinkin' maybe when you get old you realize
I'm not gonna fold or demise
I don't smoke crack, motherfucker, I sell it!
Bitch, everything I rap is a quarter piece to your melon
So if you have a relapse, just relax and pop in my disc
Don't you pop me no fuckin' pill
I'ma pop you, then give you this

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Tell Flex to drop a bomb on this shit
So many bombs, ring the alarm, like Vietnam on this shit
So many bombs, make Farrakhan think that Saddam in this bitch
One at a time, I line them up
And bomb on they mom while she watchin' the kids
I'm in a destruction mode if the gold exists
I'm important like the Pope, I'm a Muslim on pork
I'm Makaveli's offspring, I'm the King of New York
King of the Coast; one hand, I juggle 'em both
The juggernaut's all in your jugular, you take me for jokes
Live in the basement, church pews, and funeral faces
Cartier bracelets for my women friends, I'm in Vegas
Who the fuck y'all thought it's supposed to be?
If Phil Jackson came back, still no coachin' me
I'm uncoachable, I'm unsociable, fuck y'all clubs!
Fuck y'all pictures! Your Instagram can gobble these nuts!
Gobble dick up 'til you hiccup, my big homie Kurupt
This the same flow that put the rap game on a crutch
(West, West, West, West, West, West)
I've seen niggas transform like villain Decepticons
Mollies probably turn these niggas to fuckin' Lindsay Lohan
A bunch of rich-ass white girls lookin' for parties
Playin' with Barbies
Wreck the Porsche before you give them the car key
Judgement to the monarchy, blessings to Paul McCartney
You called me a black Beatle, I'm either that or a Marley
I don't smoke crack, motherfucker, I sell it!
I'm dressed in all black, this is not for the fan of Elvis
I'm aimin' straight for your pelvis
You can't stomach me? You plan on stumpin' me?
Bitch, I’ve been jumped before you put a gun on me
Bitch, I put one on yours, I'm Sean Connery
James Bonding with none of you niggas
Climbin' 100 mil in front of me
And I'm gonna get it even if you're in the way
And if you're in it, better run for Pete's sake
I heard the barbershops be in great debates all the time
'Bout who's the best MC: Kendrick, Jigga, and Nas
Eminem, André 3000; the rest of y'all
New niggas just new niggas, don't get involved
And I ain't rockin' no more designer shit
White T’s and Nike Cortez, this red Corvette's anonymous
I'm usually homeboys with the same niggas I'm rhymin' with
But this is hip-hop, and them niggas should know what time it is
And that goes for Jermaine Cole, Big K.R.I.T., Wale
Pusha T, Meek Millz, A$AP Rocky, Drake
Big Sean, Jay Electron', Tyler, Mac Miller
I got love for you all, but I'm tryna murder you niggas
Tryna make sure your core fans never heard of you niggas
They don't wanna hear not one more noun or verb from you niggas
What is competition? I'm tryna raise the bar high
Who tryna jump and get it? You're better off tryna skydive
Out the exit window of five G5's with five grand
With your granddad as the pilot, he drunk as fuck, tryna land
With the hand full of arthritis and poppin' prosthetic leg
Bumpin' Pac in the cockpit so the shit that pops in his head
Is an option of violence, someone heard the stewardess said
That your parachute is a latex condom hooked to a dread
West Coast

[Verse 3: Jay Electronica]
You could check my name on the books
I Earth Wind & Fire’d the verse, then reigned on the hook
The legend of Dorothy Flowers proclaimed from the roof
The tale of a magnificent king who came from the nooks
Of the wild magnolia, mother of many soldiers
We live by every single word she ever told us
Watch over your shoulders
And keep a tin of beans for when the weather turn the coldest
The Lord is our shepherd, so our cup runneth over
Put your trust in the Lord, but tether your Chevy Nova
I’m spittin' this shit for closure
And God is my witness, so you could get it from Hova
To all you magicians that’s fidgetin' with the cobra
I’m solid as a rock, ‘cause I came from a rock
That’s why I came with the rock
Then signed my name on the Roc
Draw a line around some Earth, then put my name on the plot
‘Cause I endured a lot of pain for everythang that I got
The eyelashes like umbrellas when it rain from the heart
And the tissue is like an angel kissin' you in the dark
You go from blind sight to hindsight
Passion of the Christ, right, to baskin' in the limelight
It take time to get your mind right
Jay Electricity, PBS Mysteries
In a lofty place tanglin' with Satan over history
You can’t say shit to me, الحمد لله‎
It’s strictly by faith that we made it this far

[Verse]
Only a nascent trying to harness huge fire
Out on the beach in the darkness starting bonfire
So gorgeous, a man might cry
Burning trees in the basement start a cool fire
Feel my heartbeat racing, baby you're on fire
So gorgeous, a man might cry

Back in Paris you told me you were suicidal
It's not a vacation if I lose you to the Eiffel
You're gorgeous but you can't fly
A hidden admirer sent me roses white as fire
We took our handfuls it was war, flower fighter

[Outro]
Wildfire
Wildfire
Wildfire
Wildfire

[Verse]
Dear Marie, tell me what it was I used to be?
Dear Marie, tell me what it was I used to be?
And if you’re further up the road
Can you show me what I still can’t see?

Remember me, I’m the boy you used to love
When we were fifteen
Remember me, I’m the boy you used to love
When we were fifteen
Now I wonder what you think
When you see me on the magazine

From time to time
I go looking for your photograph online
From time to time
I go looking for your photograph online
Some county judge in Ohio is all I ever find

[Outro]
Dear Marie, tell me do you still believe in me?
Dear Marie, tell me do you still believe in me?
Well I’ve got my dream, but you’ve got a family
Yeah I’ve got that dream, but you’ve got yourself a family
Yeah I’ve got that dream, but I guess it got away from me

[Pre-Chorus: John Mayer]
You love, who you love
Who you love
You love, who you love
Who you love

[Verse 1: John Mayer]
My girl, she isn't the one
I saw coming
And sometimes I don't know which way to go
And I tried to run before
But I'm not running anymore
Because I've fought against it hard enough to know

[Pre-Chorus: John Mayer]
That you love, who you love
Who you love
You love, who you love
Who you love
You love, who you love
Who you love

[Chorus: John Mayer]
Oh, you can't make yourself stop dreaming
Who you're dreaming of
If it's who you love
Then it's who you love

[Verse 2: Katy Perry]
My boy ain't the one that I saw coming
And some have said his heart's too hard to hold
And it takes a little time
But you should see him when he shines
You never want to let that feeling go

[Pre-Chorus: Katy Perry & John Mayer]
When you love, who you love
Who you love
You love, who you love
Who you love
Yeah, you love, who you love
Who you love

[Chorus: John Mayer]
Oh, you can't make yourself stop dreaming
Who you're dreaming of
If it's who you love
Then it's who you love

[Pre-Chorus: John Mayer & Katy Perry]
Oh you love, who you love
Who you love
You love, who you love
Who you love
You love, who you love
Who you love

[Chorus: John Mayer]
Oh, you can't make yourself stop dreaming
Who you're dreaming of
If it's who you love
Then it's who you love

[Outro: Katy Perry]
It's who you love
Who you love
Who you love
Who you love
You're the one I love

[Verse 1]
It doesn't matter where you roam
When no one's left to call you home
I might have strayed a bit too far
I'm counting all the moonlit stars

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm a little lost at sea
I'm a little birdie in a big old tree
Ain't nobody looking for me
Here out on the highway

[Chorus]
But I will be found
But I will be found
When my time comes down
But I will be found

[Verse 2]
Somedays, I think it's all okay
Some nights, I throw it all away
I saw her face and I could tell
My ghost had left the town as well

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm a little lost at sea
I'm a little birdie in a big old tree
Ain't nobody looking for me
Here out on the highway

[Chorus]
But I will be found
But I will be found
When my time comes down
But I will be found

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm a little lost at sea
I'm a little birdie in a big old tree
Ain't nobody looking for me
Here out on the highway

[Bridge]
Maybe I'm a runaway train
Maybe I'm a feather in a hurricane
Maybe it's a long play game
But maybe that's a good thing

[Chorus]
But I will be found
But I will be found
When my time comes down
But I will be found

[Outro]
Keep on running until my run is gone
Keep on riding until I see that dawn
And I will be found
I will be found

[Verse]
No, I've not seen you this way before
Standing a mess at my door
Well, it took you so long
But you finally found
You're no one until someone lets you down

You believed that all people are kind
And that you'd never mess with your mind
You gave her your trust
And she busted your crown
You're no one until someone lets you down

Yes, I've been told
That some people grow old
Without losing a part of their soul
But if that is true
I don't wish it on you
There's so much to adore in a heart that is blue

There's a light in your eyes that is pure
That you won't give away anymore
But just think of the things
We can talk about now
You're no one until someone lets you down
Yes, I have heard
There are some that avoid
All the pain that will come with the fall
But if that's the case
It would surely erase
All the joy that you feel
When the hurt fades away

[Outro]
There's a heart ticket train on the way
Waitin' to take you away
Will you please keep in mind
When it pulls into town
You're no one until someone lets you down
You're no one until someone lets you down

[Chorus]
Give me my badge and gun
Give me the road that I may run
Give me that peaceful, wandering free I used to know
I've waited all I can
But I'm just not a patient man
And I've been hiding here for seven months or so

[Verse]
Hand me down my golden hat
And grab the winter one at that
You never know how long I'll be away

Give me my badge and gun
Give me the songs that I once sung
Give me those jet-black, kick-back, lay down nights alone
This house is safe and warm
But I was made to chase the storm
Taking the whole world on with big old empty arms

Tell my friends I tried my best
That one day I just up and left
They probably saw it coming anyway
What can I say
Hey, hey
The lock is on the cellar door
I can't remember what it's for
I ain't been down those stairs in oh so long
So, so long

[Chorus]

[Outro]
The copy of your key is hanging where it used to be
Good as you've always been to me
The life I need to lead
Is somewhere out there, calling over those hills

[Verse 1: Jeff Tweedy & Feist]
You and I
We might be strangers
However close we get sometimes
It's like we never met
But you and I
I think we can take it
All the good with the bad
Make something that no one else has but

[Refrain: Jeff Tweedy & Feist]
You and I
You and I

[Verse 2: Jeff Tweedy & Feist]
Me and you
What can we do
When the words we use sometimes
Are misconstrued
Well, I won't guess
What's coming next
I can't ever tell you
The deepest well I've ever fallen into

[Bridge: Jeff Tweedy & Feist]
Oh, I don't wanna know
Oh, I don't wanna know
Oh, I don't need to know
Everything about you
Oh, I don't wanna know
And you don't need to know
That much about me

[Verse 5: Jeff Tweedy & Feist]
You and I
We might be strangers
However close we get sometimes
It's like we never met
But you and I
I think we can take it
All the good with the bad
Make something that no one else has but

[Refrain: Jeff Tweedy & Feist]
You and I
You and I

[Intro: T-Pain & YG]
Uh
Uh
Uh
(Mustard on the beat, ho)

[Chorus: T-Pain]
I ain't even know it (even know it)
Even know it (know it)
'Til they call you to the stage (stage)
Then you seen a nigga throw it (nigga throw it)

Throwing that ass for days
Booty going up, down
I ain't got no problem spending all of my money
Tryna see wassup now
I can do this all day like it ain't nuttin'

[Verse 1: T-Pain]
Black card, party in the back yard
Shorty got the black bra showing (black bra showing)
Tatted up, ass fat enough
She a bad bitch and she already know it (Yeah she know it)
Yeah she know it, yeah yeah she know it
She a bad bitch and she already know it (Yeah she know it)
Yeah she know it, yeah yeah she know it
She gon' make me spend some money on it
Whole bank account and I'll blow it

[Refrain 1: T-Pain]
Go do a show then, bring some mo' in
Pockets bigger than a Samoan
I'm at the stage every time shorty go in
Shorty go in, shorty shorty go in
Booty hit the floor then slow-motion
I'm so gone off Patron
I don't know how I'm getting home later on like

[Chorus: T-Pain]
I ain't even know it, even know it
'Til they call you to the stage
Then you seen a nigga throw it, th- throw it
Throwing that ass for days
Booty going Up-Down
I ain't got no problem spending all of my money
Trying to see what's up now
I can do this all day like it ain't nuttin'

[Verse 2: T-Pain]
Shorty thick (thick), thicker than a snicker
Every time she do it it's for me and my niggas (it's for me and my niggas)
And her friend do it with her
She don't even like girls
But a stack will make her kiss her (go on, kiss her)
Go on kiss her, go on, go on Kiss her (go on Kiss her)
She don't even like girls
But a stack will make her kiss her (go on, kiss her)
Go on, kiss her, go on, go on, kiss her (Go on, kiss her)
She keep fucking around I'll launch this missile
She make it drop then jiggle

[Refrain 2: T-Pain]
Go do a show then, bring that dough in
Booty bigger than a Samoan
I'm at the stage every time shorty go in
Shorty go in, shorty shorty go in
Booty hit the floor then slow-motion
I'm so gone off Patron
I don't know how I'm getting home later on like

[Chorus: T-Pain]
I ain't even know it, even know it
'Til they call you to the stage
Then you seen a nigga throw it, th- throw it
Throwing that ass for days
Booty going Up-Down
I ain't got no problem spending all of my money
Trying to see what's up now
I can do this all day like it ain't nuttin'

[Verse 3: B.o.B]
And you know it, look at how she throw it
If it get any bigger baby girl gon' have to tow it
Sitting on them M's like Floyd
But she lied to you if she said I paid for it
Nigga 99 broads, 99 broads
Panoramic view from the 99th floor
I'm like 'my Lord' when she down on all fours
Got a hood bitch with me, she ain't scared of taking charge
Flying by in a car, you ain't know what you saw
She adjusting her bra as I’m lighting up a cigar
They was writing me off, now I arrive like a star
I just sit back and laugh the irony of it all
Let them bands go, let them bands go
Watch a nigga throw a grand or so on that camel toe
And be like 'Damn boy, why you cuffing that whore?'
The whole team smashed her and you ain't even know

[Chorus (Extended): T-Pain]
I ain't even know it, even know it
'Til they call you to the stage
Then you seen a nigga throw it, th- throw it
Throwing that ass for days
Booty going Up-Down
I ain't got no problem spending all of my money
Trying to see what's up now
I can do this all day like it ain't nuttin'
I ain't even know it, even know it
'Til they call you to the stage
Then you seen a nigga throw it, th- throw it
Throwing that ass for days
Booty going Up-Down
I ain't got no problem spending all of my money
Trying to see what's up now
I can do this all day like it ain't nuttin'
It definitely wasn’t insulting. It was like me playing Dion one-on-one in basketball. I’d tell you ‘Dion, I’m going to slam on you. I’m going to cross you over, I’m going to give you 30 points today.' Kendrick Lamar, I don’t think he was trying to insult any of us, you know. We all know each other personally.

It’s like a sport. I look at it like, that’s motivation, as far as like, he said your name, that means you’re dong something. If he didn’t say your name… You’ve got to look at it like me going against Kobe. I’m trying to kill him.

There were a lot of names that weren’t mentioned. I like those type of games. I definitely don’t think it was an insult. It was a competition thing. A competitive type thing. I live for competition. Everyone who knows me knows I don’t want to lose in a game of nothing. I don’t want to lose in a game of tic-tac-toe. I’m not going to make a diss record for Kendrick Lamar. But if he wants to get competitive, we’re going to have some fun.

[Intro]
R.I.P. to my lil' nigga Snupe (Rest in peace to a real nigga)
Yeah
We the realest niggas in this shit
Reporting live out of Philly
Young nigga loved popping bad bitches and wheelies
And I'm talking all this money, now these niggas can't feel me
Money long, team strong so these niggas can't kill me, ah

[Verse 1]
I get a rush from this lifestyle
Solid gold presidential with the ice dial
When the chasers in the building turn the lights down
'Cause every single nigga with me gon' be iced out
Glock 40, living life wild
I go to court for probation and looking like trial
The DA told me she want a nigga but right now
I'm living better than ever, I'm thinkin' like, "How?"
Is it the money? Is it the cars?
Is it the way a nigga living that took me this far?
But still they want me with the sins and give me them bars
They lock a nigga in the dark I still look like a star
I shine, I grind harder, I'm working my mind smarter
I take care of my grandmama, mama, my ma's daughter
They telling me I ain't shit, I made it for my father
I just hope you pray for me, matter fact sing for me

[Chorus]
Lil' Snupe, they killed my lil' nigga Snupe
My lil' nigga was the truth
And all he wanted was a coupe, all he wanted was a coupe
So what's a nigga 'sposed to do?
Tell 'em put the guns down or tell these lil' niggas shoot?
'Cause they'll do the same to me, do the same shit to you
And all these niggas in my roof, that's why I got a bulletproof

[Verse 2]
And as I'm rolling through my city, nigga, all I see is murder
Ain't nobody seen it but shit everybody heard it
And ain't nobody hiring so everybody serving
And all this gunfire and shit everybody murkin', better get a strap
Young niggas selling 'caine just to get it back
And they busting out them things 'til they sitting back
And if a nigga hit my homie, we gon' hit him back
And if you send him over here, know we gon' send him back
My flow iller, I came up from dope dealing
I been sayin' I'd make it, they telling me no
Nigga these voices all in my head just telling me go get it
I came up on four wheelers, bananas and gorillas
Through the jungle where killers rumble and everyone perishing
Realest nigga in it no comparison
And they got the nerve to tell me that I'm arrogant
But what the fuck, I'm young black, I made it in America
So I'ma ball harder than the mahfucking Carters
Beyoncé and Shawn, arm bluer than their daughter
Maneuver through the water like a shark that's on a dolphin
Nigga darker in a coffin, Devil on him, get 'em off, hah
I can look at your homies and tell you foul, dawg
Leaning with your left but you still a southpaw
Be the same niggas that'll take you out, dawg
Leaving niggas hungry but you eating Mr. Chow's, dawg?
Where the love at? Where the love at?
I'd give up all this money to get lil' cuz back
Just for my nigga, go starving, like, "Where the grub at?"
Give up the fame, start over and get my buzz back
Do it again, murder his killer, him and his friend
Put the arena, step on the stage, kill him again
Look at the stands, the fans coming, filling them in
To give my nigga a chance, see him winning again

[Chorus]
Snupe! They killed my lil' nigga Snupe
My lil' nigga was the truth
And all he wanted was a coupe, all he wanted was a coupe
So what's a nigga 'sposed to do?
Tell 'em put the guns down or tell these lil' nigga shoot?
Cause they'll do the same to me, do the same shit to you
And all these niggas in my roof, that's why I got a bulletproof

[Outro]
Real nigga for life!
Real nigga for life!
Real nigga for life!
They killed my lil' nigga Snupe!
Killed my lil' nigga Snupe

[Verse 1]
Now open your mind up and listen you niggas
I am the master, the guru and after I school you I'm skinning you niggas
You finished, I'm making chinchillas out niggas
You should be embarrassed some banging pop rapper is killing you niggas
Consider this tax for the swag that my city has given you niggas
And I know I'm the man, no, I don't need no Grammy award on my mantle
Know it don't matter, the beat it don't matter, the style, any flow I can channel
You see I'm from Atlanta, east side of Decatur, I grew up on Candler
If you notice the way that I talk is vernacular, this is my actual grammar
I got these niggas nervous cause whatever lane that I'm in I'mma handle
Your lyrics are wack and emotionally shallow
You lost in my thoughts, you don't know how to paddle
I know that I'm shining, I know that I'm shining
Don't worry cause you can find shade in my shadow
From my point of view there's so many dead rappers
Shit, all we need is a memorial banner
My first mixtape, they all said I sounded like Dre
Then they said my album was pop, didn't really sound like the mixtape
Now I'm doing what I started, now they telling me I changed
I hear underrated so much you would swear it was my name
Ain't no rappers on my list
Come holla at me when you're done riding each others dick
25 million singles worlwide, I'll guess I'll take another hit
Matter of fact I find this rap shit boring, man I'm over it
Give me my guitar pick, I'll show you shit

[Intro]
God is dope, a hundred bricks
And Jesus is my connect, mane
God is dope, a hundred bricks
And Muhammad my connect, mane

[Hook]
I got these, I got these, I got that
If I rip it, nigga, I ain't coming back
I be stunting, but you know where I'm at
I can't leave out this American
Trap, trap, trap, trap, trap, trap
Great American
Rap, rap, rap, rap, rap, rap, rap, rap

[Verse 1]
D-O-P-E-B-O-Y
F-I-A-S-C-O sigh
L-U-P-E me oh my
Ba-ba-baby, we don't die
Live by multiples and nines
So if it's nine and all, that shining ball, I'm all of y'all combined
Crybaby, that never miss, I bawling all the time
What's the cause of all this crying?
I ain't falling, I ain't hurt
But the man upstairs just sent me a bunch of work
Cut it in the studio then rap it in a verse
So low so them popo, man, I catch it in the search
But I'm stupid, I'm so smart, I ain't have it in the first
Might stop at the right block, if I'm paperless I might not direct
God is dope, Jesus my connect

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Speaking to that fire, preaching to that choir
Open up that C, G-O-D is my supplier
Once it's lost, cut it soft, amazing when I heard that
Double up this fishscale, maybe bring all of these birds back
Feathers
Birds are returning to enjoy all this lovely weather
Never say never, said it so that won't happen ever
Ever so clever, yes sir, I get more coals than Weber
He cold, he cold, he cold, that's just means I'm getting better
Ego, ego, ego -- three birds are those three letters
Stop it, I'm just trying to find a prophet
Like I'm trying to line my pockets
With those fine designer wallets full of cheddar
Jesus (Chees'is) - like a picture full of teeth'is
Preachers -- I pulpit like a Michael Vick
Bless - God is dope, Muhammad my connect

[Bridge]
God is dope, a hundred bricks
God is dope, a hundred bricks

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
O-V-E-R-D-O-S-E everything I does
Noah got a boatload that got shit from up above
Gotta pick a side because they fight a war on drugs
Well, you can tell 'em cartel cause I'm riding with my plug
Riding dirty, call it bible study
And I pray you keep them pigs up out my way
Because we eating like Ramadan in the evening
So we gotta re-up like five times a day
And faith is like the keys to the kingdom
And the yayo for the halo, got my triple beam leanin'
And an M3 with a trunk full of what everybody fiendin'
And my rearview mirror cool, I see no daredevils or demons
So God is dope, I'm slinging
David with the bricks, I'm kingpin
Trying to make me miss, they atheist
God is dope, serving like it's '86

[Bridge]

[Hook]

[Produced by Floss & Fame]

[Intro]
For real though, like for real though
Like for real
You know what I'm sayin', I don't even
It's like, niggas must forget who the fuck
Did what the fuck
When the fuck
When niggas was still, not the fuck
Or whatever
Fine then, I say

[Verse]
Dear Lord, have mercy on my banana clips
Give 'em half, call it that banana splits
But my halves is really like a banana 6
Do these bananas have any idea who they on the planet with?
Apes, yeah you bananas to the grapes
That mean your bitch got a banana in her face
And wine on her chin, get these heathens off of my trunk
And all of these swine up off my rims
Tryin' to take the shine up off of my Benz
SLR, nigga please
Niggas 'bout to go to work so these bitches gon' have to leave
Gon' roll around with that B-Y, nigga just roll up my sleeve
Got body plans, so I karate stance so I could open up my chi
Lu the boy, too Bruce Leroy to destroy
Doo doo beat like two T-boys with one freak one me
But I can DP like it's three more
Three rewards for me or me or me or me or me or me
Team me is like meat eating animals meeting a meteor
Dinosaurs, I'm fine with all kinds of wars
Knives and swords, lions, tigers bitin' boars
Lightening striking Viking hordes
Fighting heightened, violence soars

[German-sounding nonsense]
That was Adolf, reacting to my new shit
Translation: how come he can't be as evil as Lu get?
Well that's cause you ain't Lu, bitch
Took two sips of the holy grail
Then I backed up and I turned around
And I bent over and pittoo'd shit
I love Jay, that's my nigga
I feel sicker than a cruise ship
I ain't competition, I don't move shit
The only opposition is this new shit
These new niggas rappin' like they 2
They be actin' like they you, man that's-- wheeeeeew shit
What happened to the game?
Niggas think they Jappin' cause they rappin' like they Wayne
Rappin' like they Chainz
I ain't matchin' them in platinum
But I'm rappin' like I'm flames
Like smackin' them in the back of him and my antonyms is on 'cain
And my heroin is on metaphors and my metaphors is on brains
My left foot is in LA but my right foot is in Spain
Now we all heard what he said, but what he said means we dead
And that shit is insane
He's so crazy, look at the little baby
Nigga you ain't Nas, nigga you ain't Jay-Z
You will respect me, you will reject me
But I've done so much, no matter how far you go, you will reflect me
SLR, nigga please
These niggas 'bout to go to work so these bitches gon' have to leave
And when the bitch gone, knee shots disabled
DVD of Dick Jones in your TV and a grenade all on your table.
And my punch bowl's like an ocean
And I lay it on by the ladle
But it's so strong, when I pull it out, I'm only hangin' on to a handle
Satan on my ankles while I'm hangin' on to an angel
Ain't hatin' on that you hatin' wrong, cause you can't hang on to my angles
It's hard being a Lupe fan, go to Harvard to be a Lupe stan
I ain't sayin' that I'm harder, it's just harder when it's in Lupe's hands
Welcome nigga, Lupe Land, SLR
Here we go, FL bars
Hold up, go back to the hard part
Would say pause, but I was talkin' 'bout my own balls
Nigga

[Verse]
Man, they be talking to me like:
"Hurry up nigga, swear you taking too long
Spring break already passed, you been breaking too long
20 year restaurant shit, we waiting too long!
Hall of Fame on the way? On the way too long!"
I know, I been, saying the, same to myself
I treat the studio like I'm laying in the cell
Trying to raise the bar, staying to myself
Is it an oxymoron; niggas praying on my hell?
That don't make sense
I never hear these words again: "late rent"
Time is money, nigga tell me how your day spent?
Mine is doing business with people who got paid
And been paid since, "Sean changed since
He broke his high school girlfriend's heart
You know how niggas are"
Really? Shit, really?
That's hurtful seeing from your friends and fam
And the internet, even Necole Bitchie?
How many of you made it with your high school romance?
I made a visit to the school, role modeled to the youth
And had the teachers and the students hold hands
But they rather show a strip club pic: pole dance
Yeah, I guess
Fuck it I'm not a good person just to get the press
Like how he used to smoke and drink just for the stress
Being blessed, made a Lex on some Detox shit
Lately I'm reading books on some Deepak shit
Still rocking more Adidas, less Reebok, bitch!
We want songs like "Memories", "Desire, Want & Need"
Motherfucka you can keep "Guap", bitch!
Take it back to the old Sean, before you had a Rollie
Man when you was wearing that G-Shock shit!
Saying
"I'm gonna make a million... Just wait till tomorrow"
Went from sleeping on floors, to making them marble
And to make it out my hood, is harder than leaving Argo
You got all the drive in the world, but your car broke
You up so late, the motherfuckin bar closed
But you need a drink "why you work so hard bro?"
Its for moments like this!
Moments for interview sentences is
How close you, Royce, and Em is?
How big is your mom new crib, and
Stupid shit like, is G.O.O.D. still your imprint?
But this for the ones that already know
Who been working all month just to save up for the show
Who paid the babysitter extra so they can go
Who paid a little more, to get early front row
Like "I'm your biggest fan, I can't believe I met you
Can we pose for Instagram?
I'm the one who knew every word, then "swerve"!
Drove eight hours here, I swear to God
This well desereved", Man, this one for you

[Intro: Pitbull]
Up in this a new million
You heard me, Sensato
It's Mr. Worldwide
Y El mundo es el patio
Let my dreams y'all dormant
Category Sixes are storming
Take this as a, take this a warning
Welcome to, welcome to global warming

[Verse 1: Pitbull]
I'm tired of this rap shit cause all they do is rap shit
About coke shit, crack shit, click clack shit
But they never sold coke or click clack shit
That's why I'm laughing to the bank, ha-ha bitch
Private jets, I'm on that mile high shit
Without Denver, I'm going to November
Earth, wind, fire, I'm all for September
George Lopez put all, you remember
Non-stop about bankers and lenders
Fuck these fake sugar ass niggas splendor
I see your game, your plan, your agenda
They'll push your shit way back to Nintendo
No Facebook, Twitter or Instagram
I do it for the paper, I'm a business man

[Chorus: Pitbull]
If you get it, that's cool
It's all about the billionaires, baby
Welcome to the new school

[Verse 2: Sensato]
Abeli, Abeli, al banco voy abrile
Una cuenta pa meterle al mille mille y matarile
I get's money en mi bloque hay misilies
Hay que comprarle shemileks y zapatos bien reptiles
Its all about them billionaires
I'm so fucking serious
Look, I love them zeros
They looking like Cheerios
Monty like I bury it
Y'all niggas gotta hurry up
My team is in your area, regando la epidemia
Tengo una novia ademia, blanquita y makademia
Estoy enfermo leukemia, yall bronkers got anemia

[Chorus: Sensato]
If you get it, that's cool
It's all about the billionaires, baby
Welcome to the new school
Oh no! Not you! What are you doing here? Oh boy it's gonna be hard now. Can we put him in the back? Robin, Robin, Robin...

I used to get dressed for y'all, now I don't do that no more, I'm sorry. It's a new day, I don't have the energy

Anybody got a joke?

Ok so, these are brand new songs that very few people have heard, very much about, you know, what I've been going trough and what I've been learning -- a lot of wonderful life lessons, you know, that aren't easy to come by but you're very blessed after you realize why you had to go trough what you had to go trough

It's just very important that you really listen to the words, you know, and if you have a hard time to hear what I'm saying please just raise your hand, you know, or something, object! You guys ready in there? (All set) Ok

And you know, it's real interesting because I used to be a performer, and I really don't consider myself a performer so much anymore. I'm really just... I'm sharing, you know, more or less the music that I've been given. But if I stop, if I start, if I... you know... feel like saying, "Baby, baby, baby" for eighteen bars -- whatever, you know? I just... I do that

So You guys are cool? 

[Yeah!] Ok I'm talking to people in my head too. It's alright though. Let's just warm up a little bit. I'm just gonna finish sucking on my lozenger

Okay, so this particular song is called "Mr. Intentional." We'll see. We all tuned up now? Let's just warm up a little bit

[Intro: Eminem]
Yeah!

[Chorus: Liz Rodrigues]
This is survival of the fittest
This is do or die
This is the winner takes it all
So, take it all, a-all, a-all, a-all

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Wasn't ready to be no millionaire, I was ill-prepared
I was prepared to be ill though, the skill was there
From the beginning it wasn't 'bout the ends, it was 'bout
Bustin' raps and standin' for somethin', fuck an acronym
Cut the fuckin' act like you're happy, I'm fuckin' back again
With another anthem – why stop when it doesn't have to end?
It ain't over 'til I say it's over, enough when I say enough
Throw me to them wolves and close the gate up, I'm afraid of What'll happen to them wolves when the thought of being thrown
Into an alligator pit, I salivate at it, wait is up
Hands up like it's 12 noon, nah, homie, hold them bitches straighter up
Wave 'em 'til you dislocate a rotator cuff
Came up rough, came to ruffle feathers, nah, egos, I ain't deflate enough
Last chance to make this whole stadium erupt, 'cause—

[Chorus: Liz Rodrigues]
This is survival of the fittest
This is do or die
This is the winner takes it all
So, take it all, a-all, a-all, a-all

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I can see the finish line with each line that I finish
I'm so close to my goals, I can almost pole vault over the goal post
And if I don't got enough in the tank, maybe I can just siphon enough
To fill up this last can, man, will I survive in this climate or what?
They said I was washed-up and got a bloodbath
I'm not a rapper, I'm an adapter: I can adjust
Plus, I can just walk up to a mic and just bust
So, floor's open if you'd like to discuss
Top 5 in this muh'fucka, and if I don't make the cut
What? Like I give a fuck! I'ma light this bitch up like I'm driving a truck
Through the side of a pump, zero to sixty, hop in and gun it
Like G-Unit without the hyphen, I'm hyping 'em up
And if there should ever come a time where my life's in a rut
And I look like I might just give up, eh, might've mistook
Me for bowin' out, I ain't takin' a bow, I'm stabbin' myself
With a fuckin' knife in the gut while I'm wipin' my butt
'Cause I just shitted on the mic and I like gettin' cut
I get excited at the sight of my blood, you're in a fight with a nut
'Cause I'ma fight 'til I die or win, bitin' the dust
It'll just make me angrier; wait, let me remind you of what
Got me this far, picture me quittin'
Now draw a circle around it and put a line through it, slut!
It's survival of what?

[Chorus: Liz Rodrigues]
This is survival of the fittest
This is do or die
This is the winner takes it all
So, take it all, a-all, a-all, a-all
So, take it all, a-all, a-all, a-all

[Verse 3: Eminem]
(Yeah) So, get your ideas, stack your ammo
But don't come unless you come to battle, now mount up, jump in the saddle
This is it—it's what you eat, sleep, piss and shit
Live, breathe, your whole existence just consists of this
Refuse to quit, fuse is lit, can't defuse the wick
I don't do this music shit, I'll lose my shit
Ain't got shit to lose, it's the moment of truth, it's all I know how to do
As soon as I get thrown in a booth, I spit
But my respect is overdue, I'm showin' you the flow no one do
'Cause I don't own no diploma for school, I quit
So there's nothin' for me to fall back on, I know no other trade
So you better trade your fuckin' mics in for some tool-box-es
'Cause you'll never take my pride from me, it'll have to be pried from me
So, pull out your pliers and your screwdrivers!
But I want you to doubt me, I don't want you to buh-lieve
'Cause this is somethin' that I must use to succeed
And if you don't like me, then fuck you! Self-esteem
Must be fuckin' shootin' through the roof, 'cause trust me
My skin is too thick and bulletproof to touch me
I can see why the fuck I disgust you, I must be
Allergic to failure, 'cause everytime I come close to it
I just sneeze, but I just go achoo then a-chieve!

[Chorus: Liz Rodrigues]
This is survival of the fittest
This is do or die
This is the winner takes it all
So, take it all, a-all, a-all, a-all
So, take it all, a-all, a-all, a-all

[Intro]
Yeah
Y'all already know what it is, man
TreeJ, motherfuckin' Grow Op
Ladies and gentlemen, I go by the name Mac Miller
And I'ma start rappin' to y'all in a second, but
I gotta light this first
You know that's important, man
It's motherfuckin' 4/20, I’d like to wish y'all a happy holiday
I want y'all to put this in, turn it on
Have some pre-rolls ready
And don’t stop smokin' 'til this shit's done, man
The man Big Jerm on the beat
TreeJ, smokin' icon
I'ma tell you one time, man, I ain't gon' tell you again
All y'all fools who think you smoke
I put you up against my mans TreeJ
I bet you fifty thousand dollars he'll smoke you under the table
That's real, holla at me
Alright, so, let's see

[Verse]
Uh, uh, yeah
Still blowin' trees like a hurricane
And I knock a pussy out with my herbal stra— (Yeah)
Still blowin' trees like a hurricane
And I knock a pussy out with my herbal stra—
Uh, uh, yeah
Still blowin' trees like a hurricane
And I knock a pussy out with my herbal strain, ha
Have 'em fast asleep
Look at 'em laughin' like, "Pass that weed"
Haven't made a weed song in a minute though
'Cause I've been gettin' dough, now it's back to gettin' smoke
Have a muhfucker high on her tippy toes
And zip a O, now you smokin' with a pro
So what you know about that?
You smoke weed, what you know about wax?
Haha, cookin' it up
At the airport, TSA lookin' at us
You used to smoke that dirt, you couldn't adjust
When you had to hit that kush
You was used to the bush like W. George
Come with this killer and I promise that you gonna end up sittin' in the morgue
Most Dope blow the most smoke, that's a fact, bitch
Plus-size section with my blunt, that's a fat bitch
Why you smokin' on that rap shit?
Why you even have it? Pillow tight weed on my mattress
You now rockin' with TreeJ, Clockwork the DJ
Smokin' another after that, replay
Most Dope, muhfucker, this The Grow Op
My weed stinkin' like Justin with no socks
Yeah, I'm a show off, probably has him mad as fuck
I’ll give him bars, and Bugs Bunny, and Duffy Duck
What you lookin' at, muhfucker? Pass the blunt!
"Lucky Ass Bitch" video, where is it? Cut, cut, cut, cut
Like a eighthy though, these other crews smoke less than an 80 though
Find me smokin' blunts with Fran and Vinny Radio
That's The Come Up, smoke until the sun's up
Light another blunt (Light it up)
Yeah, muhfucker, this The Grow Op
I can lay inside
I can lay inside
I can lay inside
I can lay inside

Can't you bare just one more night?
I can lay inside
I can lay inside
Can't you bare just one more night?
I wanna be with you
I wanna be used
Can't you bare just one more night?
I can lay inside
You know I'll hold you tight
Can't you bare just one more night?
I wanna be with you
I wanna be used

I hope you feel used
And cope the way you do
Should conjure up abuse
Select your loss, slip to lose
Just to get the muse
There's no new news here
This world, it doesn't hold a fear
This girl, she doesn't hold a tear in my head
The brain lives on but the vibes are dead
Corrosively tread through emotionally spoon fed purpose
Hel me as the worthless
A surplus, blank, white surface
Hel me as the worthless
A surplus, blank, white surface
Hel me as the worthless
I can lay inside
I can lay inside
Can't you bear just one more night?
I can lay inside
I can lay inside
Can't you bear just one more night?
I wanna be with you
I wanna be used
Can't you bear just one more night?
I can lay inside
You know I'd hold you tight
Can't you bear just one more night?
I wanna be with you
I wanna be used

I can stay in your mind
Wish me to stay away
But no sign tells me to stay, when others say
Some cats flee to see
On the lap of deceit
When true blue love means
This faithful dissolve
This melting control can be solved
The soft touch, the hopes, the souls
To one another, dear lover
Dear brother
Dear brother
Cause there's still life to be lived in hell
Can we lose our emotions and still live well?
Can you tell that this faith is changed?
This heart, brain, pain, two separate ways
Can you tell that this face is changed?
This heart, brain, pain, two separate ways
I could stay in your mind
Wish me to stray away
But leave me no sign, tell me to stay, when others say
I could stay in your mind
Wish me to stray away
But leave me no sign, tells me to stay, when others say
I could stay in your mind
Wish me to stray away
But leave me no sign, tells me to stay, when others say
I could stay in your mind
I could stay in your mind

I get high 'til I'm confused
I don't know what else to do
Bentley Coupe or Porsche Coupe
Henny got me so confused
White girl, black girl, I'm confused
Molly, kush, I'm leaning screwed

How many girls, three or two?
Beat that pussy black and blue
Damn, I like the way she look
But I don't like her attitude
Took her out and dicked her down
But she didn't show no gratitude
Cars, I got a lot of them
Forgiato tennis shoes
Trapper to the heart
But I still'll make a business move
I cannot go back to jail
Cause I got too much to lose
Don't leave home without my scale
Cause I got some work to move
Smash, smash
No cuffing, pass her to the crew
Did what I did, I'm finished with her
Then I turn her onto you
Discombobulated, man
I swear, I don't know what to do
Gucci Mane, I'm so confused
That I forgot to bring my roof

Bitches all the kids pursue
My iPad and my Metro
And I'm working out the iPhone too
Future on the super booze
The Remy did what I should do
Turn up with puff or fuck with Goose
The Panamera or my coupe
I don't wanna drive no more
Get chauffeured 'round this fucking zoo
Paper got me a like monster
Turned me to a fucking bear
Popping bottles on the sofa
Feel like I'm inside the air
No security, Gucci down
Future plug like everywhere

Free Bales, Free Bales, Free Bales

Free pills, free pills, free pills
We got 'em vacuum sealed
I be dripping so much sauce
Got bitches ready to lick it off

In my trap house getting it off

[Instrumental intro]

[Intro]
Oh-oh, people of the earth
"Listen to the warning," the seer he said
Beware the storm that gathers here
Listen to the wise man

[Verse 1]
I dreamed I saw on a moonlit stair
Spreading his hand on the multitude there
A man who cried for a love gone stale
And ice cold hearts of charity bare
I watched as fear took the old man's gaze
Hopes of the young in troubled graves

[Pre-Chorus]
"I see no day," I heard him say
So grey is the face of every mortal

[Chorus]
Oh-oh, people of the earth
"Listen to the warning," the prophet he said
For soon the cold of night will fall
Summoned by your own hand
Oh-oh, children of the land
Quicken to the new life, take my hand
Ooh, fly and find the new green bough
Return like the white dove

[Verse 2]
He told of death as a bone white haze
Taking the lost and the unloved babe
Late too late, all the wretches run
These kings of beasts now counting their days
From mother's love is the son estranged
Married his own, his precious gain

[Pre-Chorus]
The earth will shake, in two will break
And death all around will be your dowry

[Chorus]
Oh-oh, people of the earth
"Listen to the warning," the seer he said
For those who hear and mark my words
Listen to the good plan

[Bridge]
Oh, oh
And two by two, my human zoo
They'll be running for to come
Running for to come out of the rain
Oh, flee for your life
Who heed me not, let all your treasure make you
Oh, fear for your life
Deceive you not, the fires of hell will take you
Should death await you

[Acapella Canon]
Ah, people can you hear me?
And now I know and now I know
And now I know, I know
I know that you can hear me
And now I know, now I know
Now I know, now I know
Now I know, now I know
Now I know, now I know
Now I know
The earth will shake, in two will break
The earth will shake, in two will break
Death all around, around, around, around
Around, around, around, around
Now I know, now I know, now I know
And now I know, now I know
Now I know, now I know
Now I know, now I know
Now I know, now I know
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Listen to the wise, listen to the wise
Listen to the wise, listen to the wise
Listen to the wise man
La-la
La-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la

Come here
I, you
Come here
I, you
Come here
I, you
Ah, ah
Ah, ah
Listen to the man, listen to the man
Listen to the man, listen to the madman

[Instrumental break]

[Pre-Chorus]
God give you grace to purge this place
And peace all around may be your fortune

[Chorus]
Oh-oh, children of the land
Love is still the answer, take my hand
The vision fades, a voice I hear
"Listen to the madman"

[Outro]
Ooh, but still I fear and still I dare not
Laugh at the madman

[String Solo]

[Intro]
Tonight I'm gonna have myself a real good time
I feel alive
And the world, I'll turn it inside out, yeah
I'm floating around in ecstasy
So (Don't stop me now)
(Don't stop me)
'Cause I'm having a good time
Having a good time

[Verse 1]
I'm a shooting star leaping through the sky like a tiger
Defying the laws of gravity
I'm a racing car passing by like Lady Godiva
I'm gonna go, go, go, there's no stopping me

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm burning through the sky, yeah
Two hundred degrees, that's why they call me Mister Fahrenheit
I'm travelling at the speed of light
I wanna make a supersonic man outta you

[Chorus]
(Don't stop me now)

Just give me a call

Yes, I'm having a good time
I don't wanna stop at all, yeah

[Verse 2]
I'm a rocket ship on my way to Mars on a collision course
I am a satellite, I'm out of control
I'm a sex machine ready to reload like an atom bomb
About to oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, explode

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm burning through the sky, yeah
Two hundred degrees, that's why they call me Mister Fahrenheit
I'm travelling at the speed of light
I wanna make a supersonic woman of you

[Bridge]
(Don't stop me, don't stop me, don't stop me)
Hey, hey, hey
(Don't stop me, don't stop me, ooh, ooh, ooh)

(Don't stop me, don't stop me)
Have a good time, good time
(Don't stop me, don't stop me) Woah
Let loose, honey, all right

[Guitar Solo]

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I'm burning through the sky, yeah
Two hundred degrees, that's why they call me Mister Fahrenheit (Hey)
Travelling at the speed of light
I wanna make a supersonic man outta you (Hey, hey)

[Chorus]
(Don't stop me now)
I'm having such a good time
I'm having a ball
(Don't stop me now)
If you wanna have a good time
Just give me a call (Ooh, alright)
(Don't stop me now)
'Cause I'm having a good time (Hey, hey)
(Don't stop me now)
Yes, I'm having a good time
I don't wanna stop at all

DONALD is sitting against a tree and holding the lemons that DANIELLE picks and hands to him

DANIELLE
I've had the most strangely reoccurring dreams over the last week. And uh, it's like of my wedding, but nothing is going right. Everything's a disaster. My guests are all there, it's all of my real life friends. They all look gorgeous. They're all like fully done up in their gowns that they're probably going to wear to the wedding, my family is there. But suddenly I realize I should've been married by now, and I'm not married, I'm not in my wedding dress. I'm all alone, in this giant area where I see my guests being served their cocktail appetizers off of paper plates. Everyone seems to be having a great time, but they're eating off of paper plates. But I am wearing cargo pants. Army cargo pants

DONALD
Like Old Navy?

DANIELLE
Yeah, exactly. Like Old Navy cargo pants. I don't own Old Navy cargo pants. I'm not even sure where that came from in my head, but I'm wearing that with a T shirt and I'm supposed to be getting married. My hair's not done, my makeup's not done. And my mom comes in and asks me, "Why aren't you getting ready for your wedding?" And I'm like "Oh, I will be, I will be" but suddenly I'm smoking a cigarette, I even don't know why I'm smoking a cigarette, but in my mind I also that I'm three or four weeks pregnant. Horrible, right? So I tell my mom, "Mom, you don't know this, but I'm three or four weeks pregnant" and she says not "Put down the cigarette", she says, "Maybe you should get into your wedding dress". It's all very, very weird. I'm not sure what it means at all

DONALD
I think we have too many lemons

DANIELLE
One more?

DONALD
Yeah

DANIELLE
And these two

DONALD
Yeah, some of them. That'll be enough

A group of people are dancing around speakers. Assumingly, music is playing, but the events of that scene are muted, and replaced by the dialogue of...

INT. MOVIE ROOM. - NIGHT

DONALD and FLYING LOTUS are exchanging verses they've written

FLYING LOTUS

Investing time on writing lies, slightly truth without a clue
I met my higher self, pissing off the roofs of drunken goofs
He said "keep the mic smelly like a rotten tooth"
And all your fears forgotten when the Cap is in the booth
I'm an angel in an agony of flame
Feathers growing at the mention of my name, reinvention of my shame
I'm a slave to the darkness of my innermost cave
And all these words I hold tighter than a glowstick at a rave, nigga
Dance around the camp fire, buttnaked, blowing trees
Could give a single fuck if somebody sees, I'm free
Red "V" bleed out a scarlet letter, kill a king
And I'll sitting ready for whatever weather the seasons sing
Picking up expensive habits, chasing after little rabbits
Hope they lead me to a place of magic
Sad at all the times I never thought I had it
Losing all these memories, and y'all doubt it matters...
Patterns

DONALD
Mouth to a Pellegrino, bottle color of envy
Who the fuck is Gambino, I hand a waitress a benji
To act like she never met me, I'm saying though
They want the game changed when your shit on the radio
Fruit was so hanging low, I didn't even bother
She tryna land Obama's, man she get it from her mama
I don't blame her, I tame her, give her something to visualize
On my couch watching DVR'd "American Dad"
Man those new Celine bags are so to die for
I'm in that Porsche on Prozac, them suicide doors
Watch her walk as the death becomes her
Cause Mrs. Tarantino kill bills, no wonder
My heaven is the present, so maybe this is it.
Pray to God every night to make me believe he exists
Drink a fifth of vodka, I don't need no sponsor,
Heard a preacher holler, make him hold these souls

And that's when like the hook...

FLYING LOTUS
Yeah that's tight. I like that

You know you got a little...

He points to DONALD's nose, and DONALD touches it to find blood dripping

DONALD
Oh shit

FLYING LOTUS
Yeah

DONALD gets up, and runs to the bathroom

FLYING LOTUS(CONT'D)
Wow

CUT TO:

INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

DONALD examines his nose in the mirror, surprised by the bleeding

He looks for the source of all the blood, and notices and obstruction in his nasal passage- it's a string

Nauseated and scared, he pulls the long, blood soaked string while gagging and coughing. Finally, he dislodges the string and what is attached at the end, a golden tooth

He places it next to the sink and washes his hands, as the sound of the running water transitions into a similar sound of the shower water as DONALD now sits in the shower

He is still, and his back is to us

CUT TO:

EXT. POOL AREA - NIGHT

DONALD and FAM are sitting next to a bonfire, eating s'mores and swapping childhood stories

FAM
I remember being seventeen, being scared as hell. Getting prank calls, like crazy stuff. Just like senior year in high school. Had a lot of girls, it's crazy. So, this one girl, she was super crazy, she would call my phone from a blocked number, and it was her. But then I started getting like the crazy death threats. Started as a joke, then they knew exactly what kind of car I was driving, where I liked to hang out. Then they started shooting in the area, so I couldn't sleep at home anymore. Went and got a gun from my friend. Started sleeping on the street for a week. The scariest thing about it all though, is having a gun knowing you might have to use it. scarier than than killing somebody is thinking about killing somebody. Sometimes you can't explain why things happen. Those seven days, man, just couldn't handle it. Just couldn't handle it. You just get to that point like why did I get here? Sometimes they just do

DONALD
When I was like five or six, we were living in Decatur, in the projects. On Commerce Drive. It's nice now, but like we were living there and I remember my mom's friend. Like a friend of the family. This kid like... Something happened, I didn't understand it but he had to stay with us for a couple of day. I didn't really understand it. But we didn't have any space. So he had to sleep in my bed. I remember in the morning waking up and he was like "Let's rub butts". I was like "okay" like whatever I did it. And I didn't really get it. And then I turned, when we turned he kissed me

FAM
He kissed you?

DONALD
Yeah. Like you said, I don't know why it happened. I don't know why it happened

FAM
Did anybody like know about this?

DONALD
Nah, just him

FAM
That's wild

DONALD
It's crazy

FAM
Like I said, sometimes you just can't explain things

DONALD
I'm gonna go inside

FAM
Alright, I gonna stay out here, man

DONALD begins to walk inside as we...

CUT TO:

HALLWAY

DONALD is walking to his room, as the GIRL passes him in the opposite direction

He turns, quizzically

DONALD
Who are you?

She doesn't respond, or even look at him, and keeps walking. Donald continues walking to his room

CUT TO:

INT. DONALD'S ROOM. - NIGHT

He is flying face up, eyes closed. The phone rings and he opens his eyes

He leans over and picks up the phone

WOMAN (V.O.)
Hello, who's this?

DONALD immediately hangs up, looks down for a moment, and takes off his sweatshirt and shirt

He lies down and falls back asleep

FADE OUT

[Intro]
Alright kids uh welcome to your first Sunday school class alright let’s get right into it okay?
Okay

[Verse 1]
Did you know that Jesus died on the cross, just to keep you from masturbating?
And did you know that prior to 1960, he frowned on interracial dating?

[Bridge 1]
Well my name is Bobby Johnson
And I teach about god’s loving wrath
And though I try to live by the Bible, and what it says
I think I might’ve stumbled from the path

[Chorus 1]
Because I’m gay for Jesus, creator of all good
A charitable carpenter, that’s why he’s given me wood
I’m gay for Jesus, let the people rejoice
But it’s not about lust, I don’t want to nail him, that was a poor word choice

[Verse 2]
Did you know Satan wears a cape made out of a rainbow flag?
And did you know that Jesus hates abortions, unless the kid was a f- Jew?

[Bridge 2]
Well I try to live by the Bible
But it tells me that my thoughts aren't right
But those particular pages might be stuck together
From the little bit of sinning I did last night

[Chorus 2]
Because they told me to love Jesus, I chose an alternative route
Well I was so sad when he was in that cave but I was thrilled when he came out
Well I’m gay for Jesus, fill me with your grace
I said pour you love all over me, but please aim away from my face
Every time I go to dinner, seems like I'm getting a little bit thinner
I'll sit down at the breakfast table, I can talk, well they’re not able
When I look at them I find, there's a single question on their mind
I wish it could go back to the way it was
It’s not easy now because

My whole family thinks I’m gay
I guess it’s always been that way
Maybe it’s ‘cause of the way that I walk
Makes them think I like… boys
That I like boys

The goddamn question just won’t go away
And I get asked every single day
But the way they ask it is not a disguise
Like, “How was your day, do you like to kiss guys?”
This was the worst, baby this was my fear
Now their opinions are crystal clear

Because, my whole family now is shocked
I’m in the closet and the door is locked
Now my glory days are gone
I was John Elway, now I’m Elton John
My whole family now suspects
Watching SpongeBob had side effects
I’m not gay and that’s what I said
If I’m gay, hey God strike me dead, ya know?
(coughing and choking fit)
That’s rude
Just ‘cause I’m on the cheerleading team
Or my birthday party had a Broadway theme
When I go outside what do I see
That the clouds in the sky spell F-A-G
Because, I think that God might think I’m gay
What does he know anyway?
My Grandma gave me a present just last year
And the card said “Happy Birthday Queer”
My whole family thinks I’m fab
“There’s a guy’s butt. Hey Bo, take a stab.”
Come on?
“Why doesn’t he get women? There’s no other way?”
It’s ‘cause I’m lanky not ‘cause I’m gay, alright?
Not ‘cause I’m gay

Just ‘cause I’m afraid of the snow
Or my favorite color is the rainbow
(Heh… it was a joke)
I don’t mean to yell but I fear I must
Because I’m losing the people that I thought I could trust

Because even my boyfriend thinks I’m gay
Just kidding heh…heh
You all probably think I’m gay
Man this song is counterproductive
Lalalalalala
Because my whole family thinks I’m gay
What do they know anyway?
You gotta look right through the haze
Easy bake oven was just a phase
My whole family thinks I’m queer
That is all I ever hear
But I’ve been as straight as a ramp
If you don’t count Bible camp
Bible camp
I’m not gay I swear
People keep asking me how I feel about Kendricks verse on Big Seans jams. It was dope!

— Scott Mescudi (@ducidni) August 15, 2013Ur suppose to want to bite the heads of ur opponents. Hip Hop ain't about hugs and high fives.

— Scott Mescudi (@ducidni) August 15, 2013I personally don't think anyone should have responded. Niggas need to put that energy into makin a classic album and responding that way.

— Scott Mescudi (@ducidni) August 15, 2013Id feel this way had he mentioned me or not. Cuz at the end of the day Kendrick showed love, was polite and really genuine when we worked

— Scott Mescudi (@ducidni) August 15, 2013And thats what matters.

— Scott Mescudi (@ducidni) August 15, 2013Every rapper should want to murder other rappers. Its a joke otherwise

— Scott Mescudi (@ducidni) August 15, 2013Im just happy i lost the "MOST EMO RAPPER AWARD" recently ha

— Scott Mescudi (@ducidni) August 15, 2013To everyone who felt some type of way by Kendricks verse ha

— Scott Mescudi (@ducidni) August 15, 2013Its rap. niggas ain't saving lives or feeding the hungry. who caresses

— Scott Mescudi (@ducidni) August 15, 2013Ok so those are my thoughts

(Verse 1)
You might never sell enough of this stuff to move off your street
But every time I call you let me light one up for free
I'm sure that you're never ever gonna be a runway model
But you can make a bomb ass piece out of a water bottle
(Bridge)
And when you count my money
You look so sexy to me and it might sound funny
But I would by a O-Z just to get you in my bed room

(Hook)

Go and tell it to the dude that you were with

INTRODUCTION
1. The Plaintiffs, who have the utmost respect for and admiration of Marvin Gaye, Funkadelic and their musical legacies, reluctantly file this action in the face of multiple adverse claims from alleged successors in interest to those artists. Defendants continue to insist that plaintiffs' massively successful composition, "Blurred Lines," copies "their" compositions. In the case of the Marvin Gaye related defendants (the "Gaye defendants"), it's a song called "Got To Give It Up." For the owner of Funkadelic's songs, Bridgeport Music, Inc. ("Bridgeport"), it's a song called "Sexy Ways." But there are no similarities between plaintiffs' composition and those the claimants allege they own, other than commonplace musical elements. Plaintiffs created a hit and did it without copying anyone else's composition.

2. The basis of the Gaye defendants' claims is that "Blurred Lines" and "Got To Give It Up" "feel" or "sound" the same. Being reminiscent of a "sound" is not copyright infringement. The intent in producing "Blurred Lines" was to evoke an era. In reality, the Gaye defendants are claiming ownership of an entire genre, as opposed to a specific work, and Bridgeport is claiming the same work.

3. The reality is that the songs themselves are starkly different. Since that is the salient factor in a claim for copyright infringement, in the face of the threats of defendants to commence lawsuits, plaintiffs must seek declaratory relief from this Court that confirms plaintiffs' unfettered right to exploit "Blurred Lines" free of defendants' claims.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. This action is brought, and this Court has subject matter jurisdiction, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Sections 1331, 1338 and 2201. This Court has federal question jurisdiction in this matter in that plaintiffs seek a declaration of rights under the Copyright Act of 1976, 17 U.S.C. § 101 et seq.

5. Venue lies within this Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Sections 1391(b)(2)-(3), (c), (d) and 1400(a) in that defendants Frankie Christian Gaye and Marvin Gaye III are domiciled and reside for venue purposes and are subject to personal jurisdiction in this district; that, on information and belief, defendant Nona Marvisa Gaye is a part-time resident of this district; and that she and defendant Bridgeport Music, Inc. ("Bridgeport") regularly and systematically conduct business this district and, therefore, are subject to personal jurisdiction in this district.

THE PARTIES

7. On information and belief, Bridgeport is and at all times material herein has been a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the State of Michigan and is in the business of acquiring and exploiting copyright interests in musical compositions, and in the business of trolling for opportunities to threaten to sue and to sue musicians, performers, producers and others in the music industry for infringement of its copyrights. Bridgeport regularly and systematically does business in the state of California by, among other things, negotiating and granting licenses to use the songs in which it has a copyright interest to licensees in California and resorting to the California courts. Bridgeport has claimed an ownership interest in the copyright to the composition "Sexy Ways" written by George Clinton and Grace Cook.

8. On information and belief, defendant Frankie Christian Gaye is and at all times material herein has been an individual residing in Los Angeles County, California.

9. On information and belief, defendant Marvin Gaye III is and at all times material herein has been an individual residing in Los Angeles County, California.
10. On information and belief, defendant Nona Marvisa Gaye is and at all times material herein has been an individual residing in Los Angeles County, California and the State of Rhode Island, who regularly conducts business as an entertainer in the County of Los Angeles, California. Defendants Frankie Christian Gaye, Marvin Gaye III and Mona Marvisa Gaye are referred to collectively hereinafter as "the Gayes."

11. Plaintiffs are informed and believe that the Gayes claim an ownership interest in the composition "Got To Give It Up" by Marvin Gaye.

12. Defendant Does through 10, inclusive, are sued herein under fictitious names. Their true names and capacities are unknown to plaintiffs. When their true names and capacities are ascertained, plaintiffs will amend this complaint by inserting their true names and capacities herein.

13. On information and belief at all times material herein each of the defendants was the agent and employee of some or all of the other defendants, and in doing the things hereinafter alleged, was acting within the course and scope of such agency and employment.

CLAIM FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

14. Plaintiffs are informed and believe that Bridgeport owns some or all of the copyright in the composition "Sexy Ways" and that Bridgeport alleges that plaintiffs have infringed that composition by including elements of it in "Blurred Lines" without Bridgeport's knowledge or consent. Representatives of Bridgeport have recently notified plaintiffs that, if plaintiffs do not pay a monetary settlement of Bridgeport's claim, Bridgeport intends to initiate litigation for copyright infringement against plaintiffs and others.

15. Plaintiffs did not incorporate or otherwise use the composition "Sexy Ways" in "Blurred Lines." Plaintiffs did not infringe any copyright in "Sexy Ways."

16. Plaintiffs are informed and believe that the Gayes claim that they own and have standing to pursue claims for infringement of the copyright in the composition "Got To Give It Up" by Marvin Gaye, and that plaintiffs have infringed that composition by including elements of it in "Blurred Lines" without the Gaye's knowledge or consent. Representatives of the Gayes have recently notified plaintiffs that, if plaintiffs do not pay a monetary settlement of the Gayes' claim, the Gayes intend to initiate litigation for copyright infringement against plaintiffs and others.

17. Plaintiffs did not incorporate or otherwise use the composition "Got To Give It Up" in "Blurred Lines." Plaintiffs did not infringe any copyright in "Got To Give It Up."

18. There is an actual and justiciable controversy between plaintiffs and Bridgeport in that Bridgeport claims that "Blurred Lines" infringes "Sexy Ways," and that the exploitation of"Blurred Lines" violates Bridgeport's rights as herein alleged. Conversely, plaintiffs deny Bridgeport's claims and contend that "Blurred Lines" does not infringe "Sexy Ways."

19. There also is an actual and justiciable controversy between plaintiffs and the Gayes in that the Gayes claim that they have an ownership interest in the composition "Got To Give It Up" and standing to pursue claims of infringement of that composition; that the Gayes claim that "Blurred Lines" infringes "Got To Give It Up;" and that the exploitation of"Blurred Lines" violates the Gaye's alleged rights, as herein alleged.

20. Plaintiffs did not incorporate or otherwise use the composition "Got To Give It Up" in "Blurred Lines." Plaintiffs did not infringe any copyright in "Got To Give It Up."

21. A judicial declaration of the parties' respective rights and obligations with respect to "Blurred Lines" is necessary and appropriate.
22. Plaintiffs seek a judgment declaring the parties' respective rights with regard to "Blurred Lines," including a declaration that (a) "Blurred Lines" does not infringe "Sexy Ways" or otherwise violate Bridgeport's rights; (b) the Gayes do not have an interest in the copyright to the composition "Got To Give It Up" sufficient to confer standing on them to pursue claims of infringement of that composition; or alternatively (c) that "Blurred Lines" does not infringe "Got To Give It Up" or otherwise violate the Gayes' rights.

WHEREFORE, plaintiffs respectfully request judgment against defendant as follows:

1. A declaration that (a) "Blurred L ines" does not infringe "Sexy Ways" or otherwise violate Bridgeport's rights; (b) the Gayes do not have an interest in the copyright to the composition "Got To Give It Up" sufficient to confer standing on them to pursue claims of infringement of that composition; or alternatively (c) that "Blurred Lines" does not infringe "Got To Give It Up" or otherwise violate the Gayes' rights;

2. For costs and attorney fees incurred herein; and

3. For such other and further relief as the court deems just and proper.

DATED: August 15, 2013 KING, HOLMES, PATERNO & BERLINER, LLP

[Intro]
Fucking drug shit
Do the drugs
Yeah
Yo

[Verse 1]
Straight from the depths of Queens.
Leave you sleeping on the mezzanine
Like you Lincoln, then switch into a desert scene
Often heard, but this motherfucker seldom seen
I'm throwing blows while you waiting for the bell to ring
Drug smoking
Raisins make the pasta sweet
Slumped over when the barrel and your posture meet
Stay lean like some motherfucking ostrich meat
You full of shit it's time to get a colonoscopy
Scissor kicks, dick suck from Miss Elizabeth
Lex Luger arms
4 in the morning in the dark with the computer on
Wasting my time, my thoughts are paced, untastable grace replaced in my mind
Born to shine like the eyes on a cat
Same cat fuck around, put the knife in your back
This is nothing, we live & let die and roam the land
And you bluffing
You lifted the cards and showed your hand pussy

[Verse 2]
Tailor-made rubber, Rubbermaid reliable
Never spill the soup
Rock a linen suit
Play the streets like the ball court
Spin & shoot
Strong as Popeye dipping in the spinach too

[Verse 3]
Take my nuts out your mouth
Let me breathe for a minute please
Your life is cheap like a hooker in the Philippines
About to be a huge star and I'm still in Queens
You're on the shelf like a figurine
Drugs infested my mind
But I'm destined to shine
Spit the shit to keep these motherfuckers pressing rewind
Thousands of pounds of pressure pressed on your spine
Live divine, free the mind, lead the blind, read the signs
Hands up like you stepping in the party
No you getting robbed, motherfucker, with the shotty
Said you pottyd
Make your body do an ollie
Then dig your shorty out cuz I geeked her up on molly
Have her eating dick, no need for seasoning
If seven dudes are in the room then she's pleasing them
Like a trooper. Hit her in the pooper. Throw her in the shower
Then I take her out to Lupa
I'm kinky, I'll hit it even if it's stinky
Put em in the shower, make the pussy brand new
Ran through. Give 'em money what I can't do
Stuff her lunchbox & burn her with the candle

[Verse 4]
UH!
Consensual Rape
Vinegar solutions
Animal abusing
Barrel revolutions
Don't get me pissed off, fuck around rip your tits off
Still getting head, even if my dick's soft
Rising quick, no Fleischman's
I'm in the endzone with one leg up, posing like Heisman
Throwing like Theismann, sway foot
With the Village Leader smoking a pipe with seven wise-men
I eat the biggest piece of chicken at the table
Let 'em know I'm hungry
Polo on the rugby
The forty-four long surely got a trusty home
Trying to live American Dreams...Dusty Rhodes

Yeah
Fucking Pussy

Pull up in that Audi, flexin' in the summer

If my cup ain't double, its gone be some trouble
Came a long way, had to get it out the muscle
Now all my cars are muscles
Young nigga gotta get a hustle
Gotta use a wordplay like Ruzzle
If you want that cake, but you ain't got that cake
Gotta get out there and make somethin' shake
Got the 45 put it to a nigga face, rich nigga eatin' steak on Hermes plates

Wrist spinnin' like a hurricane
Ice chain came from Johnny Dang
Real heavy on my neck I need a cane

Big truck fit five chicks at a time
Stones big enough you can go rock climb
Put that on somethin'
Nah man I was lying
But tell me what you know about it (know about it)
Fat camp I can't go without it (go without it)

[Chorus 1]
If you've got trouble

You say you're worried
You can't be as worried as me (Oh oh)

[Chorus 2]
You're quite contend to be bad
With all the advantage you had over me
Just because you're trouble
Then don't bring your troubles to me

[Verse]
I don't think it's funny
When you ask for money and things
Especially when you're standing there
Wearing diamond and rings (Oh oh)

You think I'm soft in the head
Well try someone softer instead anything
It's not so funny
When you know what money can bring

[Chorus 3]
You better leave me alone
I don't need a thing from you
You better take yourself home
Go and count a ring or two

[Hook]
They asking what happened, but we just relaxin'
They asking what happened, but we taking action
We keep on bringin' the fire
The Soul they have to acquire
They asking what happened

[Verse 1: Elbee Thrie]
Phony Ppl here tonight we bring a good feeling
Word got around, 200 gathered, an apartment buildin'
Was "the location", sound thumpin', house jumpin'
Where the party is is obvious, so don't ask nothin'
See what my band is..
We upper-handed
You understand it?
Re-Up the band then 

[?]
Its hard to manage
We Brooklyn Bandits
Roll up to the venue, just to roll up at the venue
My boys got dank
But it all starts off with a noise complaint
Break it up, cut the grass, while I'm vibin' in the cypher
Phony puff, puff laugh
And I might add
From the blaze to the stage, Girls on my ass
Enter carefully because the floor is feeling like a trampoline
The ceiling broke up under us, because of us..
Cover us

[Pre-Hook]
And then the cops came
And shut shit down

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Sheriff PJ]
Listen officer man
Thoughts of us sittin' in the can got me cautious, so damn!
See, my plan was to get some liquor in my system
Probably dance, find a few chickens to split amongst my niggas, get some whamsz
But, as time wasted we had just came in
You know vacant places get break-ins, how you Gon' blame them!
See the dude that's friends with the DJ got drunk and started buggin'
Went up to this group of white kids started yapping about nothin'
After that they started punching, throwin' bottles, we started duckin'
Tryna save a few models, take'em back and get back into somethin'
We fucking dipped
Went outside, to our surprise
Bunch of red, white and blue lights up in the sky

[Pre-Hook]

[Hook]

[Intro: Nicki Minaj]
Haaa..by popular demand Sasha Feirce, Nicki Minaj, let's go

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Yo rude boy, why you cross me like a little t?
I'm Minaj, big M, uh'uh not a Mickey D
Now, I'm flyer than a broom (broom), broom, I dissed him
Then I peel up in a room (room), boomin' system
Now listen, now listen, LISTEN
I was there through your bid in prison
Ya know, I coulda been your wife
But sucks for you, boo-hoo
I would never rent a tux for you
Excuse me, I'm buzzing like bumblebees
Football & they all wanna fumble me
I was a thirty-two D in my Dugarees
Can I have a couple more cucumbers, please?
Now I'm that bitch, now I'm the bad witch
I need a lot of cheese up on my sandwich
Just got a new boyfriend, he's Pepe Le Pew
And he just bought me two Giuseppe shoes. (thank you!)
That's one for right, & one for the left
Yes to the left, left, to the left
Now we should all go to Jerry Springer
And you could put the ring up on my middle finger

[Beyonce]
All the single ladies 

[x7]
Now put your hands up
Up in the club, we just broke up
I'm doing my own little thing
Decided to dip but now you wanna trip
Cause another brother noticed me
I'm up on him, he up on me
Don't pay him any attention
Cried my tears, for three good years
Ya can't be mad at me

Cause if you liked it then you should have put a ring on it
If you liked it then you shoulda put a ring on it
Don't be mad once you see that he want it
If you liked it then you shoulda put a ring on it (x2)

I got gloss on my lips, a man on my hips
Got me tighter than my Dereon jeans
Acting up, drink in my cup
I could care less what you think
I need no permission, did I mention
Don't pay him any attention
Cause you had your turn
But now you gonna learn
What it really feels like to miss me
Cause if you liked it then you should have put a ring on it
If you liked it then you shoulda put a ring on it
Don't be mad once you see that he want it
If you liked it then you shoulda put a ring on it (x2)

Don't treat me to the things of the world
I'm not that kind of girl
Your love is what I prefer, what I deserve
Is a man that makes me, then takes me
And delivers me to a destiny
To infinity and beyond
Pull me into your arms
Say I'm the one you want
If you don't, you'll be alone
And like a ghost I'll be gone

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Hey, hey -
And just like a ghost
You'll be gone, gone
Diddy Bop, like Sean, John, John
Anyway, I like Lauren Lon-don
Get my chopsticks, get me my won-ton
Cus you thought you'd win
But I'd knew you'd lose
Honey, I'm flyer than altitude crews
Yes, I'm cool, you can chuck deuce
Nicki been hot since Duck, Duck Goose

[Beyoncé:]
All the single ladies 

[x7]
Now put your hands up

Cause if you liked it then you should have put a ring on it
If you liked it then you shoulda put a ring on it
Don't be mad once you see that he want it
If you liked it then you shoulda put a ring on it (x2)

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
My wrist so rocky, I'm cocky
Cat smell like Issey Miyake
I wanna drag her for jockey
She wanna dig in my pocket
You move a gold digger in
Bitch will live in your wallet
You start out taking her shopping
She end up spend all your profit
I just fall, I don't call
She eat balls and the bitch bring broads
Don't get your feelings involved with dogs
Feed her to the wolves that'll hang with the boys
Sippin on oil, we got her spoiled
Rollin up guards got gas in jars
All my cars foreign
Sittin on 4's
Damn you gorgeous, what you on
She on molly, I'm on chron
We put lean all in the dime
Camoflauge foamposites on
80k on me and hun
Shittin on niggas I got the runs
Pissy jewelry, yellow charm
Baby dissin, why so frizzy
Need to sit out in the sun
PeeWee kiwi kush we blowin
Take your bitch that's what we on
Beat her up, RiRi Chris Brown
Diamonds dancin like James Brown
Pitch words like I'm on the mound
Baby know what I be on
I be in and out of time
I put my dick on her tongue

[Hook]
She turn me on, I'mma turn her on to me
And I turn her on, VVS all over me
Look at my arm, this Rolley got her feelin me
Don't turn me on, I'm lit up like a Christmas tree
Don't turn me on, I'm lit up like a Christmas tree
Don't turn me on, I'm lit up like a Christmas tree
She turn me on, and I got ice all over me
I turn her on, I'm lit up like a Christmas tree

[Verse 2: PeeWee Longway]
PeeWee Longway nasty ass
Hide that gas off in the past
Italian Stallion my watch rockin
VVS is my ear hockey
Longway Liberace
Karate chop the dope in huarache
Benihana eating steak and hibachi
Clap on, clap off, I'm rocking chandeliers
Pick ups, drop offs, I'm making drug deals
I got Christmas tree bells up making profit
On some crip shit, Longway blew the rastas
Sippin and spinnin still pourin up the codeine
Brick grip still coming down your chimney
Turnin me on and all now ya in the Remy
Blowin gas Mr. Lean with the white Remy
But rising diamond bars open, know you hear me
Super charged blue Hemi flyin down 20
Bought a Porsche just out the window, blue M&M
Can't stomach my bars, ain't as sick as him
I be hangin out with stars like wit Bush and them
Stems crushin my cigars like we kushin them
One button, push start, doing tricks in them
I'm talkin foreign cars, A&G kit'd them
She turn me on, I had to turn her on to Juice and them
And OJ turned her ass on to Gucc and them, Longway

[Hook]

[Verse 3: OJ Da Juiceman]
Christmas tree glass jewelry
Sell chickens for Patrick Ewing
In the sky just like a Boeing
Kill em wit the Murray and the Rollie
I don't eat steak, eat ravioli
And you hot cause you ho done chose me
I'm a young nigga from the hood my nigga
Got these racks out the Bouldercrest corner
Texaco soldier
Deuces in the water
6's on my Charger, whip the dope a little hard
Try to see me a way, nigga better profit
Keep white just like a Nazi
Got gas, long dreads like a Rasta
Calamari shrimp type play pasta
Make moves just like I'm a mobster
Like a young nigga trying to win an Oscar
Plug came and his first name Oscar
Gettin paid since I first start walking
I'm not poppin when I'm talkin
Young Juiceman trending topic

[Hook]
She turn me on, I'mma turn her on to me
And I turn her on, VVS all over me
Look at my arm, this Rolley got her feelin me
Don't turn me on, I'm lit up like a Christmas tree
Don't turn me on, I'm lit up like a Christmas tree
Don't turn me on, I'm lit up like a Christmas tree
She turn me on, and I got ice all over me
I turn her on, I'm lit up like a Christmas tree

[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
She dances in these sheets at night
She dances to his needs
She dances 'til he feels just right
Until he falls asleep
She dances at the crack of dawn
And quickly cooks his food
She can't be late, can't take too long
The kids must get to school

[Chorus: Michael Jackson & Justin Bieber]
She's a slave to the rhythm
She's a slave to the rhythm of
She's a slave to the rhythm
A slave to the rhythm of
The rhythm of love, the rhythm of love
She's a slave to the rhythm
She's a slave to the rhythm of
She's a slave to the rhythm
A slave to the rhythm of
The rhythm of love, the rhythm of love
She's a slave to the rhythm
She's a slave to the rhythm of
She's a slave to the rhythm
A slave to the rhythm of
The rhythm of love, the rhythm of love
She's a slave to the rhythm
She's a slave to the rhythm of
She's a slave to the rhythm
A slave to the rhythm of
The rhythm of love, the rhythm of love

[Verse 2: Michael Jackson]
She dances for the man at work
Who works her overtime
She can't be rude as she says
"Sir, I must be home tonight"
She dances to the kitchen stove
Dinner is served by nine
He says his food's an hour late
She must be outta her mind

[Chorus:Michael Jackson & Justin Bieber]
She's a slave to the rhythm
She's a slave to the rhythm of
She's a slave to the rhythm
A slave to the rhythm of
The rhythm of love, the rhythm of love
She's a slave to the rhythm
She's a slave to the rhythm of
She's a slave to the rhythm
A slave to the rhythm of
The rhythm of love, the rhythm of love

[Bridge: Justin Bieber & Michael Jackson]
She works so hard, just to make her way
For a man who just won't appreciate
And though she takes, her love in vain
Though she could not stop, couldn't break his chains

[Verse 3: Justin Bieber and Michael Jackson]
She danced the night that they fell out
She swore she'd dance no more
But dance she did, he did not quit
As she ran out the door
She danced through the night in fear of her life
She danced to a beat of her own (Her own)
She let out a cry and swallowed her pride
She knew she was needed back home, home

[Chorus:Michael Jackson & Justin Bieber]
She's a slave to the rhythm
She's a slave to the rhythm of
She's a slave to the rhythm
A slave to the rhythm of
The rhythm of love, the rhythm of love
She's a slave to the rhythm
She's a slave to the rhythm of
She's a slave to the rhythm
A slave to the rhythm of
The rhythm of love, the rhythm of love

[Verse 1]
Ice under my heels, I hear it breaking
Under my heels, I hear it cracking
Foolish of me to think I had it
Emmanuel, how foolish of me!
To think I had it
I hear your voice behind me
Moving up my neck
I hear you talking
Creeping on my shoulder
I hear you breathing
In my head I hear you screaming
Just do it..

[Hook]
Yeah yeah, I feel you talking
Yeah yeah I feel you moving
Yeah yeah let's do it already

Chipping away at boulders

No New Star
Fuck your Third Eye

Neo of the Sun
Give me simplicity
Too lonely, seems like real fun
I feel you
Creeping up my leg I hear you talking
Moving on my shoulder I hear you breathing
In my head I hear you screaming
Just do it

It's just the strangest thing
I've seen your face somewhere
An early evening dream, a past life love affair

[Chorus]
Do you know me at all?
Do you know me at all?

[Verse 2]
In all my reverie
I thought I felt us there
A feather in my hand
A flower in your hair

[Chorus]
Do you know me at all?
Do you know me at all?

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Okay, yo, niggas don't want drama (nah)
See they talk proper, but when it comes time to spark
They all tryna catch alzheimers
You all talking no wack shit
You outta get smacked faggot
I seen harder niggas in drag
I'm bigger than that
So test me, don't even ask about it
Do the math and count it
You ain't got half the talent
Niggas laugh and doubt it
But only 'till my cash is sprouted
Put up your best track, I'll run laps around it
Yo, I'm coming for death, you running for life
Fuck a gun or a knife
My numbers is right
Enough of this hype
Let's get to it
Nigga you sick, prove it
Your style's transparent
Mr. Magoo could look through it
And it's true I'm not a thug, but I handle mines
And grammar wise you analyze, I vandalize
Which man standing trying to get branded with death
Falling off stage with a mic stand on your chest
Yo, take a number
Cause all these niggas thinking they can rumble with the rapist
Suffer from some sort of brain disorder
The rain is pouring now
Nigga check the brain storm
Won't stop until my name is embroidered on the gravestone

[Hook: ?]
The therapist boy you like collab
A pair of fist lefty
Mr. do right have's
And there's your 

[?]
Embarrassment, how bad too delicate for carelessness
You out your element
Syrhenz (×4)
You out your element
Syrhenz (×4)

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Loose cannon, when I shoot amateurs
Truth 

[?]
Ain't a crew standing can do damage
This shit is rock solid
Niggas bark harder than rottweilers
I rock polish, I spit top notch
You rock bottom
Assed out, my raps similar to a crack house
So dope these niggas take two puffs then pass out
Relax now, never back down
When the bells rung, cause I serve beef raw but well done
You can tell hell where I hail from
The reigning champ, main event rhyming
Y'all still in training camp
Fucking with me so you gotta be nice
But you got better odds trying to hit the lottery twice
Nucka, stop the nonsense or get knocked unconscious
The rhymes I'm designing is monstrous
My arsenal bomb shit
Got the haters loving it now
Watch my shit hit the ceiling
'Till it's covered in brown

[Hook]

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
The therapist leading the pack
Type of cat to ball
You call without asking, no bringing it back
I'm made checking
Place your wages and bets
The stakes is raising
If you ain't gotcha money on me, you brain's defecting
Pains ejecting, whenever my name is mentioned
The games is lynching, hang and hitch me
This natural instinct
More than half you faggots against me
Now watch as I turn this beat to minced meat
Case closed, snap souls along with pesos
My entire camp play cold, below the waist blows
Never take no for responses, I'm word boxing
You 

[?] watch as I flip and take the world hostage

[Bridge: J. Cole]
The therapist niggas
Yo, you out your element
What the fuck niggas thinking 'bout
Yo, check it, yo
You out your element
Yeah niggas, yo you out your element
What the fuck ya'll niggas thinking 'bout

[Hook]
I tell you, there are no big shots in reality, y'all

We're all in the same boat, dealing with the same issues, same problems, same stuff. Don't even buy it. All the perpetration... you know, all this... "We don't have problems." That's a lie. That's a lie. I know that the enemy is doing the same thing to me that he's doing to everybody else. I just know now that the only way to get out is through confrontation. See, we always thought it was retreat, you know, run away. And I'm telling you, you got to confront it

This is a strange song because this song -- when this song was written, this is when everything sort of stopped. It was written a long time ago, but it was right before God just snatched me out of everything. And because I didn't understand... Initially it was written -- I'd written it about the whole Amadou Diallo situation, when it first happened. And I went to the studio, and I laid it down. And it was like, strong, for the first day. And then it just regressed everyday after that. And I said, "What's going on? What's happening?"

And at the end of it there was a word that i used, "rebel." And I guess was afraid. It was such a hot time in the city at that point, I was afraid that if I
Put the record out, people would misunderstand what I meant by "rebel" and they'd just take it to the streets. So I was very intimidated and afraid. And before I knew it a whole host of things happened. Everything stopped after that. And the creativity stopped. Everything stopped. That's when I realized I had to understand what I was talking about before I could tell somebody else what I was talking about. And I had to be, you know, a living example

It's real crazy because I don't know what the press is saying because I don't listen to the press too much. But I know the view is that I'm emotionally unstable, which is reality. Like you aren't?

I'm laughing because what I've realized I've become is one of those mad scientists who does the tests on themselves first, you see, to make sure that they work. And that's when you know, OK look, I got something that works. You know what I'm saying? I'm not gonna give you something that I haven't tested for myself. And you go through, and you're learning by way of experience, and you're making mistakes, and you're getting up

A friend of mine once said to me, he said, Look, if we weren't supposed to turn around, why does a car have a steering wheel? Are we just supposed to crash into the wall? No, we're supposed to say, Listen, I was going the wrong way... Reverse!

In this particular song, now I realize that this song is about freedom. You see? We could look at one human being, but it's about the spirit of freedom being taken out, and how it's taken out in all of us

The song is called "I Find It Hard to Say." Bear with me a little bit

[Chorus]
Welcome everybody, SLR 3
Moment of silence for them, round of applause for me

[Verse 1]
I pause to put a round in the palms of thieves
And then clap for 'em, bring it back to 'em
Soundtrakk I bring my back to 'em
Cause they ain't ready for the front, fax to 'em
Like my nigga Mickey Factz to 'em
Aye Mickey what the wicky-wicky wack doin'?
They ain't from us but they're claiming they're Columbus
Their raps come off flat cause they ain't in circumference
They ain't in the cypher of some lifers
Them niggas probation, soon to be leavin' Rikers
They ain't see us as the circle of my peers
Sir cool but he ain't spheres
That means he ain't fierce as this
Sailboat wouldn't survive in the ocean of my tears
Bring it back to the peekhole, that's the circle of my peers
The back is what I said
Ready for the front, I rap it out the back of my head
Know it like the back of my hand
Cowboy, you calf like the back of my leg, you ain't seein' what I said
That's cause it's comin' out the back of my dreads
You ain't see it, gotta watch what I say
Wash a nigga away or dock a nigga pay
I bring it back to the piers
And if you ready for that, you've just received the deadliest catch
That you've seen in years
Match, and if you think I'm playin'
Back when you were sayin' "What in the world was that?"
When I was sayin' 'bout the world
I was talkin' 'bout when the fuckin' world was flat

[Chorus]
Welcome everybody, SLR 3
Moment of silence for them, round of applause for me

[Verse 2]
So what we got here? Some Top Ramen talkin' 'bout some top tier
Some top rhymin' to some boxed ears
Such a waste of my timin', that's why I'm not here
This recite is just a sight of the
The real me is out droppin' crop circles all over Iowa
You're witnessin' a one man cypher-a
One hand's a gun, the other hand's a silencer
If I cock the thumb, you gotta take a hike to the
Hitch, cock, psychotic, did you get that plot?
If you ain't get the words then just make a little bird
So you can hear what the fist don't stop, this shit don't stop
Let you debate whether it's birds tellin' or motellin'
Those fingernail shells come out my pistol top
I wear a Rollie so my wrist don't watch
Cause he don't like to see it, ain't that a bitch?
The same wrist I shoot the three with, game winnin' remix
Revisit the ship, upon which niggas seasick
Floatin' on the water out the eyes that I see with
Burnin' on the fire out the eyes that I see with
So as we heat seekin' the seen heater sea-seein'
But fuck it, it's too far off the deep end
I don't need a reason, I ain't talkin' to 'em
I just CC'd 'em Tetsuo season

[Outro]
SLR 3, Round of Applause
Silencer on my hand so my rounds won't sound at all
Now how that sound to y'all?
Maybe how dog whistles sound to dogs
Tetsuo season
Album comin' out, super soon
That's right, so I'm gon' ride this wave
And niggas poppin' shit, it ain't got nothin' to do with me
And just capitalize off all the free press
Because my publicist charges a lot to do the same shit
As these niggas doin' it for free
And I can just rap, because really
Shit don't mean nothin' to me
I can rap all day, pop shit all day
And you niggas just soak it up
Believe it, if I stop, still gets headlines even though my Twitter locked
And ain't that a bitch?

[Verse 1: Anthony Kiedis]
Things will never be the same
Still, I'm awfully glad I came
Resonating in the shape of things to come
Never waiting when I know there's only one
Messed it up, but rest assured
No one ever thinks they're cured
Just a minute while I reinvent myself
Make it up, and then I take it off the shelf

[Pre-Chorus: Anthony Kiedis]
Over the laws of light
Over the moon by midnight
Let's do it all this time
Everyone wishing well we go, and

[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis with John Frusciante]
Everyone knows anything goes, and now
We are the lotus kids
Oh, better take note of this
For the story

[Verse 2: Anthony Kiedis & John Frusciante]
The rising moon is on the shine
The blood of Scorpio's a nine
Like the fear that's in the eyes of every doe (Ah-ah)
Say it now, 'cause John and Jane would like to know (Ah-ah)
Is it safe inside your head?
Songs to serenade the dead
All along, I said I know no enemies
Mix it up until there are no pedigrees

[Pre-Chorus: Anthony Kiedis]
Over the laws of light
Over the moon by midnight
Let's do it all this time
Everyone wishing well we go, and…

[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis with John Frusciante]
Everyone knows anything goes, and now
We are the lotus kids
Oh, better take note of this
For the story

[Bridge: Anthony Kiedis]
Over the laws of light
Over the moon by midnight
Let's do it all this time
Into the shadow showing
Enter the rolling tide
Over the ocean so wide
Let's do it all this time
Everyone wishing well we go, and…

[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis with John Frusciante]
Everyone knows anything goes, and now
We are the lotus kids
Oh, better take note of this
For the story
Everyone knows anything goes, and now
We are the loaded kids
Oh, better take note of this
For the story
Everyone knows anything goes, and now
We are the lotus kids
Oh, better take note of this
For the story

[Verse]
I forgot to remember to forget her
I can't seem to get her off my mind
I thought I'd never miss her
But I've found out somehow
I think about her almost all the time

[Chorus] 

[x2]
Well the day she went away
I made myself a promise
That I'd soon forget we'd ever met
But something sure is wrong
Because I'm so blue and lonely
I forgot to remember to forget

[Verse 1]
I was happy in the haze of a drunken hour
But heaven knows I'm miserable now
I was looking for a job and then I found a job
And heaven knows I'm miserable now

[Refrain 1]
In my life, why do I give valuable time
To people who don't care if I live or die?

[Verse 2]
Two lovers entwined pass me by
And heaven knows I'm miserable now
I was looking for a job and then I found a job
And heaven knows I'm miserable now

[Refrain 1]
In my life, oh, why do I give valuable time
To people who don't care if I live or die?

[Verse 3]
What she asked of me at the end of the day
Caligula would have blushed
"Oh, you've been in the house too long", she said
And I naturally fled

[Refrain 2]
In my life, why do I smile
At people who I'd much rather kick in the eye?

[Verse 4]
I was happy in the haze of a drunken hour
But heaven knows I'm miserable now
"Oh, you've been in the house too long", she said
And I naturally fled

[Refrain 1]
In my life, oh, why do I give valuable time
To people who don't care if I live or die?
Drifting
On a sea of forgotten teardrops
On a lifeboat
Sailing for
Your love

Sailing home

Drifting
On a sea of old heartbreaks
On a lifeboat
Sailing for
Your love
Sailing home

[Chorus]
Gold and rose, the color of the dream I had
Not too long ago
Misty blue and the lilac too
Never to grow old

[Verse 1]
There you were under the tree of song
Sleeping so peacefully
In your hand a flower played
Waiting there for me

[Verse 2]
I have never laid eyes on you
Not before this timeless day
But you woke and you
Once smiled my name
And you stole my heart away
Stole my heart away little girl, yeah
All right!

[Chorus]
Gold and rose, the color of the dream I had
Not too long ago
Misty blue and the lilac too
Never to grow old

[Chorus]
Gold and rose, the color of the dream I had
Misty blue and the lilac too
Gold and rose, the color of the dream I had
Misty blue and the lilac too
Gold and rose, gold and rose, gold and rose

[Verse 3]
It's only a dream
But I'd love to tell somebody about this dream
The sky was filled with a thousand stars
While the sun kissed the mountains blue
And eleven moons
Played across the rainbows
Above me and you

[Outro]
Gold and rose
The color of the velvet walls surrounds us
Got a flip-top pack of cigarettes in her pocket
Feeling good at the top, shopping in sharp shoes
Walking in the sunshine town
Feeling very cool
But the butchers and the bakers in the supermarket stores
Getting everything she wants from the supermarket stores

Apples and oranges
Apples and oranges

Cornering neatly she trips up sweetly
To meet the people, she's on time again
And then
I catch her by the eye, then I stop and have to think
What a funny thing to do cause I'm feeling very pink

Apples and oranges
Apples and oranges

I love she
She loves me
See you
See you
See you
Thought you might like to know
I'm her lorry driver man
She's on the run
Down by the river side, feeding ducks in the afternoon tide
(Quack quack quack quack)

Apples and oranges
Apples and oranges
Apples and oranges

[Verse 1]
Suppose I said
I am on my best behavior
There are times
I lose my worried mind

[Chorus]
Would you want me when I'm not myself
Wait it out while I am someone else

[Verse 2]
Suppose I said
Colors change for no good reason
And words will go
From poetry to prose

[Chorus]
Would you want me when I'm not myself
Wait it out while I am someone else

[Bridge]
And I, in time, will come around
I always do for you

[Pre-Chorus]
Suppose I said
You're my saving grace

[Chorus]
Would you want me when I'm not myself
(My grace, myself, not myself, when I'm someone else)
Wait it out while I am someone else
(When I'm someone else, when I'm someone else, when I'm not myself)
Would you want me when I'm not myself
Wait it out while I am someone else

[Verse 1]
I never liked this apple much
It always seemed too big to touch
I can't remember how I found
My way before she came around

[Chorus]
I tell everyone
I smile just because
I've got a city love
I found it in Lydia
And I can't remember life before her name

[Verse 2]
She keeps a toothbrush at my place
As if I had the extra space
She steals my clothes to wear to work
I know her hairs are on my shirts

[Chorus]
I tell everyone
I smile just because
I've got a city love
I found it in Lydia
And I can't remember life before her name

[Verse 3]
The day
She called up and came to me
Covered in rain
And dinnertime shadowing
And as her clothes spun, we spooned
And I knew I was through
When I said "I love you"

Friday evening, we've been drinking
2 a.m., I swear I might propose
But we close the tab
Split a cab
And call each other up when we get home
Falling asleep to the sound
Of sirens

[Chorus]
I tell everyone
I smile just because
I've got a city love
I found it in Lydia
And I can't remember life before her name

[Bridge]
From the battery
To the gallery
It's the kind of thing you only see
In scented, glossy magazines

[Outro]
And I can't remember life before her name

[Verse 1]
I've these dreams I'm walking home
Home when it used to be
And everything is as it was
Frozen in front of me

Here I stand, 6 feet small
Romanticizing years ago
It's a bitter sweet feeling
Hearing "Wrapped Around Your Finger" on the radio

[Pre-Chorus]
And these days
I wish I was 6 again
Oh, make me a red cape
I want to be Superman

[Chorus]
Oh, if only my life was more like 1983
All these things would be
More like they were at the start of me
Heaven made in '83

[Verse 2]
Thinking about my brother, Ben
I miss him every day
He looks just like his brother, John
But on an 18 month delay

Here I stand, 6 feet small
And smiling because I'm scared as hell
Kind of like my life is like a sequel to a movie
Where the actor's names have changed, oh well

[Pre-Chorus]
And these days
I wish I was 6 again
Oh, make me a red cape
I want to be Superman

[Chorus]
Oh, if only my life was more like 1983
All these things would be
More like they were at the start of me
Heaven made in '83

[Verse 3]
And most my memories have escaped me
Or confused themselves with dreams
If heaven's all we want it to be
Send your prayers to me
Care of 1983
You can paint that house a rainbow of colors
Rip out the floorboards
Replace the shutters but
That's my plastic in the dirt

[Outro]
Whatever happened to my
Whatever happened to my
Whatever happened to my lunchbox?
When came the day that it got thrown away
And don't you think I should have had some say in that decision?

[Verse 1]
I'm writing you to catch you up on places I've been
And you held this letter
Probably got excited, but there's nothing else inside it

[Pre-Chorus]
Didn't have a camera by my side this time
Hoping I would see the world through both my eyes
Maybe I will tell you all about it when
I'm in the mood to lose my way with words

[Verse 2]
Today, skies are painted colors of a cowboy cliche
And strange how clouds that look like mountains in the sky
Are next to mountains anyway

[Pre-Chorus]
Didn't have a camera by my side this time
Hoping I would see the world through both my eyes
Maybe I will tell you all about it when
I'm in the mood to lose my way with words

[Chorus]
But let me say
You should have seen that sunrise
With your own eyes
It brought me back to life
You'll be with me next time I go outside
Just no more 3x5s

[Bridge]
I guess you had to be there
Guess you had to be with me

[Verse 3]
Today I finally overcame
Trying to fit the world inside a picture frame
Maybe I will tell you all about it when
I'm in the mood to lose my way
But let me say

[Chorus]
But let me say
You should have seen that sunrise
With your own eyes
It brought me back to life
You'll be with me next time I go outside
Just no more 3x5s

[Verse 1]
Staying home alone on a Friday
Flat on the floor looking back on old love
Or lack thereof
After all the crushes are faded
And all my wishful thinking was wrong
I'm jaded, I hate it

[Chorus]
I'm tired of being alone
So hurry up and get here
So tired of being alone
So hurry up and get here (get here)

[Verse 2]
Searching all my days just to find you
I'm not sure who I'm looking for
I'll know it when I see you
Until then, I'll hide in my bedroom
Staying up all night just to write
A love song for no one

[Chorus]
I'm tired of being alone
So hurry up and get here
So tired of being alone
So hurry up and get here

[Verse 3]
I could have met you in a sandbox
I could have passed you on the sidewalk
Could I have missed my chance
And watched you walk away

[Verse 3]
I could have met you in a sandbox
I could have passed you on the sidewalk
Could I have missed my chance
And watched you walk away

[Chorus]
I'm tired of being alone
So hurry up and get here
So tired of being alone
So hurry up and get here, oh yeah

[Chorus]
I'm tired of being alone
So hurry up and get here
So tired of being alone
So hurry up and get here

[Outro]
You'll be so good
You'll be so good for me

[Intro]
Check your pulse
It's proof that you're not listening to
The call your life's been issuing you
The rhythm of a line of idle days

[Chorus]
Scared of a world outside you should go explore
Pull all the shades and wander the great indoors
The great indoors

[Verse 1]
Lamplight makes the shadows play
And posters take the walls away
The TV is your window pane
The view won't let you down
So put your faith in a late night show
I bet you didn't even know
Depends on how far out you go
The channel numbers change

[Chorus]
Scared of a world outside you should go explore
Pull all the shades and wander the great indoors
The great indoors

[Verse 2]
Though lately I can't blame you
I have seen the world
And sometimes wish your room had room for two
So go unlock the door
And find what you are here for
Leave the great indoors
Leave the great indoors

[Outro]
Check your pulse
It's proof that you're not listening to
The call your life's been issuing you
The rhythm of a line of idle days

[Verse 1]
Here comes the cold
Break out the winter clothes
And find a love to call your own
You, enter you
Your cheeks a shade of pink
And the rest of you in powder blue

[Pre-Chorus]
Who knows what will be
But I'll make you this guarantee, see

[Chorus]
No way November will see our goodbye
When it comes to December it's obvious why
No one wants to be alone at Christmas time

[Verse 2]
In the dark, on the phone
You tell me the names of your brothers
And your favorite colors
I'm learning you
And when it snows again
We'll take a walk outside
And search the sky
Like children do
I'll say to you

[Chorus]
No way November will see our goodbye
When it comes to December it's obvious why
No one wants to be alone at Christmas time
And come January we're frozen inside
Making new resolutions a hundred times
February, won't you be my valentine?
And we'll both be safe 'til St. Patrick's Day

[Bridge]
We should take a ride tonight around the town
And look around at all the beautiful houses
Something in the way that blue lights on a black night
Can make you feel more
Everybody, it seems to me, just wants to be
Just like you and me
Hey, hey

[Chorus]
No one wants to be alone at Christmas time
And come January we're frozen inside
Making new resolutions a hundred times
February, won't you be my valentine?
And we'll both be safe 'til St. Patrick's Day

[Outro]
And if our always is all that we gave
And we someday take that away
I'll be alright if it was just until St. Patrick's Day

[Verse 1]
No, I'm not the man I used to be, lately
See, you met me at an interesting time
And if my past is any sign of your future
You should be warned before I let you inside

[Chorus]
Hold on to whatever you find, baby
Hold on to whatever will get you through
Hold on to whatever you find, baby
I don't trust myself with lovin' you

[Verse 2]
I will beg my way into your garden
And then I'll break my way out, when it rains
Just to get back to the place where I started
So I can want you back all over again
(I don't really understand)

[Chorus]
Hold on to whatever you find, baby
Hold on to whatever will get you through
Hold on to whatever you find, baby
I don't trust myself with lovin' you

[Bridge]
Who do you love?
Girl I see through, through your love
Who do you love; me or the thought of me?
Me or the thought of me?

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Hold on to whatever you find, baby
Hold on to whatever will get you through
Hold on to whatever you find, baby
I don't trust myself with lovin' you
Hold on to whatever you find, baby
Hold on to whatever will get you through
Hold on to whatever you find, baby
I don't trust myself with lovin' you
I don't trust myself with lovin' you
I don't trust myself with lovin' you
I don't trust myself with lovin' you
I don't trust myself with lovin' you

[Verse 1]
Anger, he smiles
Towering in shiny, metallic purple armor
Queen Jealousy, envy waits behind him
Her fiery green gown sneers at the grassy ground
Blue are the life-giving waters taken for granted
They quietly understand
The once happy turquoise armies lay opposite ready
But wonder why the fight is on

[Chorus]
But they're all bold as love
Yeah, they're all bold as love
They're all bold as love
Just ask the axis

[Verse 2]
My red is so confident that he flashes
Trophies of war and ribbons of euphoria
Orange is young, full of daring
But very unsteady for the first go around
My yellow, in this case, is not so mellow
In fact, I'm trying to say it's frightened like me
And all these emotions of mine keep holding me from
Giving my life to a rainbow like you

[Chorus]
I'm bold, bold as love
Yeah I'm bold, bold as love
I'm bold, bold as love
Just ask the axis
Yeah he knows, he knows, he knows, he knows everything

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
I'm bold, bold as love
I'm bold, bold as love
Hear me talking to you
I'm bold, bold as love, yeah

[Verse 1]
I hate to see you cry
Lying there in that position
There's things you need to hear
So turn off your tears
And listen

[Chorus]
Pain throws your heart to the ground
Love turns the whole thing around
No it won't all go the way it should
But I know the heart of life is good

[Verse 2]
You know, it's nothing new
Bad news never had good timing
Then, the circle of your friends
Will defend the silver lining

[Chorus]
Pain throws your heart to the ground
Love turns the whole thing around
No, it won't all go the way it should
But I know the heart of life is good

[Outro]
Pain throws your heart to the ground
Love turns the whole thing around
Fear is a friend who's misunderstood
But I know the heart of life is good
I know it's good

[Verse 1]
Still is the life
Of your room when you're not inside
And all of your things
Tell the sweetest story line
Your tears on these sheets
And your footsteps are down the hall
So tell me what I did
I can't find where the moment went wrong at all

[Chorus]
You can be mad in the morning
I'll take back what I said
Just don't leave me alone here
It's cold, baby
Come back to bed
Come back to bed
Come back to bed
Come back to bed (come on back to bed)

[Verse 2]
What will this fix?
You know you're not a quick forgive
And I won't sleep through this
I survive on the breath you are finished with

[Chorus]
You can be mad in the morning
I'll take back what I said
Just don't leave me alone here
It's cold, baby
Come back to bed
Come back to bed
Come back to bed
Come back to bed

[Chorus]
You can be mad in the morning
Or the afternoon instead
But don't leave me
Ninety-eight and six degrees of separation from you baby
Come back to bed
Come back to bed
Come back to bed
Why don't you come back to bed?

[Outro]
Don't hold your love over my head
Don't hold your love over my head
Don't hold your love over my head
Don't hold your love over my head
Don't hold your love over my head
Don't hold your love

[Verse 1]
Some of us, we're hardly ever here
The rest of us, we're born to disappear
How do I stop myself from being just a number?
How will I hold my head to keep from goin' under?

[Chorus]
Down to the wire
I wanted water, but I'll walk through the fire
If this is what it takes to take me even higher
Then I'll come through
Like I do when the world keeps testing me, testing me, testing me

[Verse 2]
How did they find me here?
What do they want from me?
All of these vultures hiding right outside my door
I hear them whispering
They're tryin' to ride it out
They've never gone this long without a kill before

[Chorus]
Down to the wire
I wanted water, but I'll walk through the fire
If this is what it takes to take me even higher
Then I'll come through
Like I do when the world keeps testing me, testing me, testing me

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Wheels up
I got to leave this evening
I can't seem to shake these vultures off of my trail
Power is made by power being taken
So I keep on running to protect my situation

[Chorus]
Down to the wire
I wanted water, but I'll walk through the fire
If this is what it takes to take me even higher
Then I'll come through
Like I do when the world keeps testing me, testing me, now

[Outro]
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Whatcha gonna do about it?
Whatcha gonna do about it?
Whatcha gonna do 'bout it?
Don't give up, give up
Don't give up, give up, give up
Don't you give up
Don't give up, give up, give up

[Verse 1]
When you’re dreaming with a broken heart
The waking up is the hardest part
You roll out of bed and down on your knees
And for a moment, you can hardly breathe
Wondering, “Was she really here?
Is she standing in my room?”
No she’s not
‘Cause she’s gone, gone, gone, gone, gone

[Verse 2]
When you’re dreaming with a broken heart
The giving up is the hardest part
She takes you in, with her crying eyes
Then, all at once, you have to say goodbye
Wondering, “could you stay my love?
Will you wake up by my side?”
No she can’t
‘Cause she’s gone, gone, gone, gone, gone

[Bridge]
Now, do I have to fall asleep with roses in my hand?
Do I have to fall asleep with roses in my hand?
Now, do I have to fall asleep with roses in my hand?
Do I have to fall asleep with roses in my, roses in my hands?
And would you get them if I did?
No you won’t
‘Cause you’re gone, gone, gone, gone, gone

[Outro]
When you’re dreaming with a broken heart
The waking up is the hardest part

[Verse 1]
Too many shadows in my room
Too many hours in this midnight
Too many corners in my mind
So much to do to set my heart right

[Chorus]
Oh, it's taking so long I could be wrong
I could be ready
Oh, but if I take my heart's advice
I should assume it's still unsteady
I am in repair, I am in repair

[Verse 2]
Stood on the corner for a while
To wait for the wind to blow down on me
Hoping it takes with it my old ways
And brings some brand new luck upon me

[Chorus]
Oh, it's taking so long I could be wrong
I could be ready
Oh, but if I take my heart's advice
I should assume it's still unsteady
I am in repair, I am in repair

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
And now I'm walking in a park
All of the birds they dance below me
Maybe when things turn green again
It will be good to say you know me

[Chorus]
Oh, it's taking so long I could be wrong
I could be ready
Oh, but if I take my heart's advice
I should assume it's still unsteady
I am in repair, I am in repair

[Outro]
I'm never really ready
Oh I'm never really ready
I'm in repair
I'm not together but I'm getting there
I'm in repair
I'm not together but I'm getting there
I'm in repair
I'm not together but I'm getting there
I'm in repair
I'm not together but I'm getting there
I'm in repair
I'm not together but I'm getting there
I'm in repair
I'm not together but I'm getting there

[Verse 1]
It's really over, you made your stand
You got me crying, as was your plan
But when my loneliness is through

[Chorus]
I'm going to find another you

[Verse 2]
You take your sweaters
You take your time
You might have your reasons
But you will never have my rhyme
I'm going to sing my way away from blue

[Chorus]
I'm going to find another you

[Bridge]
When I was your lover
No one else would do
If I'm forced to find another
I hope she looks like you
Yeah and she's nicer too

[Verse 3]
So go on baby
Make your little get away
My pride will keep me company
And you just gave yours all away
Now I'm going to dress myself for two
Once for me and once for someone new
I'm going to do some things you wouldn't let me do

[Chorus]
Oh
I'm going to find another you

[Verse 1]
Do not waste this evening
Baby, I'm begging you
Your big imagination's playing its tricks on you
If you think my up and leaving's something I'm going to do
Feel my chest when I look at you
Baby you

[Chorus]
You got my only heart
Yeah, you got my only heart
Yeah, you got my only
Only heart

[Verse 2]
So hard to be so far out
Living our separate lives
Your phone was really broken
I tried your number twice
And if you need confirmation, baby I understand
It's alright if you want me to
Tell you you

[Chorus]
You got my only heart
Yeah, you got my only heart
Yeah, you got my only
Only heart

[Bridge]
And you live like your hand's on the horn, baby
I adore you but there's a hole in the cup that should hold my love (hold my love)
If you let, if you let, if you let me leave
I swear I never will

[Chorus]
Remember now
You, you got my only heart
Yeah, you got my only heart
Yeah, you got my only heart
Yeah, you got my only heart

[Verse 1]
Take all of your wasted honor
Every little past frustration
Take all of your so-called problems
Better put 'em in quotations

[Chorus]
Say what you need to say
Say what you need to say
Say what you need to say
Say what you need to say
Say what you need to say
Say what you need to say
Say what you need to say
Say what you need to say

[Verse 2]
Walking like a one man army
Fighting with the shadows in your head
Living out the same old moment
Knowing you'd be better off instead
If you could only

[Chorus]
Say what you need to say
Say what you need to say
Say what you need to say
Say what you need to say
Say what you need to say
Say what you need to say
Say what you need to say
Say what you need to say

[Bridge]
Have no fear for giving in
Have no fear for giving over
You'd better know that in the end
It's better to say too much
Than never say what you need to say again

[Verse 3]
Even if your hands are shaking
And your faith is broken
Even as the eyes are closing
Do it with a heart wide open

[Chorus]
Say what you need to say
Say what you need to say
Say what you need to say
Say what you need to say
Say what you need to say
Say what you need to say
Say what you need to say
Say what you need to say
Say what you need to say
Say what you need to say
Say what you need to say
Say what you need to say
Say what you need to say
Say what you need to say
Say what you need to say
Say what you need to say
Say what you need to say
Say what you need to say
Say what you need to say
Say what you need to say
Say what you need to say
Say what you need to say
Say what you need to say
Say what you need to say

[Verse 1]
I worry
I weigh three times my body
I worry
I throw my fear around
But this morning
There's a calm I can't explain
The rock candy's melted, only diamonds now remain
Ooo-ooo
Ooo-ooo

[Verse 2]
By the time I recognize this moment
This moment will be gone
But I will bend the light pretending that it somehow lingered on
When all I got's
Ooo-ooo, ooo-ooo
Ooo-ooo, ooo-ooo

[Chorus]
And I will wait to find
If this will last forever
And I will wait to find
If this will last forever
And I will pay no mind
When it won't and it won't because it can't
It just can't
It's not supposed to

[Verse 3]
Was there a second of time that I looked around?
Did I sail through or drop my anchor down?
Was anything enough to kiss the ground
And say I'm here now?
And she is here now
Ooo-ooo, ooo-ooo
Ooo-ooo, ooo-ooo

[Bridge]
So much wasted in the afternoon
So much sacred in the month of June
How 'bout you, oh?

[Chorus]
And I will wait to find
If this will last forever, yeah
And I will wait to find
That it won't and it won't
And it won't
And I will pay no mind
Worried 'bout no rainy weather
And I will waste no time
Remaining in our lives together

[Verse 1]
This is a call to the color-blind
This is an IOU
I'm stranded behind a horizon line
Tied up in something true

[Pre-Chorus]
Yes, I'm grounded
Got my wings clipped
I'm surrounded by all this pavement
Guess I'll circle
While I'm waiting for my fuse to dry

[Chorus]
Someday I'll fly
Someday I'll soar
Someday I'll be so damn much more
Cause I'm bigger than my body gives me credit for

[Verse 2]
Why is it not my time
What is there more to learn
Shed this skin I've been tripping in
Never to quite return

[Pre-Chorus]
Yes, I'm grounded
Got my wings clipped
I'm surrounded by all this pavement
Guess I'll circle
While I'm waiting for my fuse to dry

[Chorus]
Someday I'll fly
Someday I'll soar
Someday I'll be so damn much more
Cause I'm bigger than my body gives me credit for
Cause I'm bigger than my body now

[Bridge]
Maybe I'll tangle in the power lines
And it might be over in a second's time
But I'll gladly go down in a flame
If a flame's what it takes to remember my name
To remember my name

[Pre-Chorus]
Yes, I'm grounded
Got my wings clipped
I'm surrounded by all this pavement
Guess I'll circle
While I'm waiting for my fuse to dry
For my fuse to dry
Wait for my fuse to dry

[Chorus]
Someday I'll fly
Someday I'll soar
Someday I'll be so damn much more
Cause I'm bigger than my body
I'm bigger than my body
I'm bigger than my body now

[Verse 1]
I'm not alone
I wish I was
'Cause then I'd know I was down because
I couldn't find a friend around
To love me like they do right now
They do right now

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm dizzy from the shopping mall
I searched for joy, but I bought it all
It doesn't help the hunger pains
And a thirst I'd have to drown first to ever satiate

[Chorus]
Something's missing
And I don't know how to fix it
Something's missing
And I don't know what it is
At all

[Verse 2]
When autumn comes
It doesn't ask
It just walks in where it left you last
And you never know when it starts
Until there's fog inside the glass around your summer heart

[Chorus]
Something's missing
And I don't know how to fix it
Something's missing
And I don't know what it is
No I don't know what it is
At all

[Bridge]
I can't be sure that this state of mind
Is not of my own design
I wish there was an over-the-counter test for loneliness
For loneliness like this

[Chorus]
Something's missing
And I don't know how to fix it
Something's missing
And I don't know what it is
No I don't know what it is
Something's different
And I don't know what it is
No I don't know what it is

[Bridge 2]
Friends (check)
Money (check)
A well slept (check)
Opposite sex (check)
Guitar (check)
Microphone (check)
Messages waiting on me when I come home (check)

[Outro]
How come everything I think I need
Always comes with batteries?
What do you think it means?
How come everything I think I need
Always comes with batteries?

[Verse 1]
I'm so alive
I'm so enlightened
I can barely survive
A night in my mind
So I've got a plan
I'm going to find out just how boring I am
And have a good time

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause ever since I tried
Trying not to find
Every little meaning in my life
It's been fine, I've been cool
With my new golden rule

[Chorus]
Numb is the new deep
Done with the old me
And talk is the same cheap it's been

[Verse 2]
Is there a God?
Why is he waiting?
Don't you think of it odd
When he knows my address?
And look at the stars
Don't they remind you of just how feeble we are?
Well it used to, I guess

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause ever since I tried
Trying not to find
Every little meaning in my life
It's been fine, I've been cool
With my new golden rule

[Chorus]
Numb is the new deep
Done with the old me
And talk is the same cheap it's been

[Verse 3]
I'm a new man
I wear a new cologne and
You wouldn't know me if your eyes were closed
I know what you'll say
This won't last longer than the rest of the day
But you're wrong this time
You're wrong

[Chorus]
Numb is the new deep
Done with the old me
I'm over the analyzing tonight

[Outro]
Stop trying to figure it out
(you try to figure, you try to figure it out)
Deep will only bring you down
You know, I used to be
The back porch poet with my book of rhymes
Always open knowing all the time I'm probably
Never going to find the perfect rhyme
For "heavier things"

[Verse 1]
I think I'm going to stay home
Have myself a home life
Sitting in the slow-mo
And listening to the daylight
I am not a nomad
I am not a rocket man
I was born a house cat
By the slight of my mother's hand
I think I'm going to stay home

[Pre-Chorus]
I want to live in the center of a circle
I want to live on the side of a square
I used to be in my M-Z now
You'll never find me 'cause my name isn't there

[Chorus]
Home life
Been holding out for a home life
My whole life

[Verse 2]
I want to see the end game
I want to learn her last name
Finish on a Friday
And sit in traffic on the highway
See, I refuse to believe
That my life's going to be
Just some string of incompletes
Never to lead me to anything remotely close to a home life

[Chorus]
Been holding out for a home life
My whole life

[Bridge]
I can tell you this much
II will marry just once
And if it doesn't work out
Give her half of my stuff
It's fine with me
We said eternity
And I will go to my grave
With the life that I gave
Not just some melody line
On a radio wave
It dissipates
And soon evaporates
But home life doesn't change (home life doesn't change)

[Pre-Chorus]
I want to live in the center of a circle
I want to live on the side of a square
I'd love to walk to where we both can talk, but
I've got to leave you cause my ride is here

[Chorus]
In my home life
You take the home life
You keep the home life
I'll come back for the home life
I promise
Home life I promise
Life
Home life
Home life

[Verse 1]
People have the right to fly
And will when it gets compromised
Their hearts say "move along"
Their minds say "gotcha heart"
"Let's move it along"
Move it along

[Verse 2]
And airports see it all the time
Where someone's last goodbye
Blends in with someone's sigh
Cause someone's coming home
In hand a single rose

[Chorus]
And that's the way this wheel keeps working now
That's the way this wheel keeps working now
And I won't be the last
No, I won't be the last
To love her

[Verse 3]
And you can't build a house of leaves
And live like it's an evergreen
It's just a season thing
It's just this thing that seasons do

[Chorus]
And that's the way this wheel keeps working now
That's the way this wheel keeps working now
And you won't be the first
No, you won't be the first
To love me

[Bridge]
You can find me
If you ever want again
I'll be around the bend
I'll be around the bend
I'll be around, I'll be around
And if you never stop when you wave goodbye
You just might find if you give it time, you will wave hello again
You just might wave hello again

[Chorus]
And that's the way this wheel keeps working now
That's the way this wheel keeps working now

[Outro]
You can't love too much, one part of it
You can't love too much, one part of it
You can't love too much, one part of it
You can't love too much, one part of it
I believe (You can't love too much, one part of it)
That my life's going to see (You can't love too much, one part of it)
The love I give return to me (You can't love too much, one part of it)
(You can't love too much, one part of it)
I believe (You can't love too much, one part of it)
That my life's going to see (You can't love too much, one part of it)
The love I give return to me
I believe
That my life's going to see the love I give return to me

[Verse]
I went down to the crossroads, fell down on my knees
I went down to the crossroads, fell down on my knees
Asked the Lord for mercy
Said, help me if you please

I went down to the crossroads, tried to flag a ride
I went down to the crossroads, tried to flag a ride
No one seemed to know me, everybody passed me by

[Outro]
You can run, you can run, tell my friend Willy Brown
You can run, you can run, tell my friend Willy Brown
That I'm standing at the crossroads
I believe I'm sinking down

[Verse 1]
Young and full of running
Tell me where has that taken me
Just a great figure eight or a tiny infinity
Love is really nothing
But a dream that keeps waking me
For all of my trying, we still end up dying
How can it be?

[Chorus]
Don't say a word, just come over and lie here with me
'Cause I'm just about to set fire to everything I see
I want you so bad, I'll go back on the things I believe
There I just said it, I'm scared you'll forget about me

[Verse 2]
So young and full of running
All the way to the edge of desire
Steady my breathing, silently screaming
I have to have you now
Wired and I'm tired
Think I'll sleep in my clothes on the floor
Or maybe this mattress will spin on its axis
And find me on yours

[Chorus]
Don't say a word, just come over and lie here with me
'Cause I'm just about to set fire to everything I see
I want you so bad, I'll go back on the things I believe
There I just said it, I'm scared you'll forget about me

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Don't say a word, just come over and lie here with me
Because I'm just about to set fire to everything I see
I want you so bad, I'll go back on the things I believe
There I just said it, I'm scared you'll forget about me

[Verse 1]
Now that we are over as the loving kind
We'll be dreaming ways to keep the good alive
Only when we want is not a compromise
I'd be pouring tears into your drying eyes

[Chorus]
Friends, lovers or nothing
There can only be one
Friends, lovers or nothing
There will never be an in-between, so give it up

[Verse 2]
You whisper, come on over
Cause you're two drinks in
But in the morning, I will say goodbye again
Think we'll never fall into the jealous game
The streets are flood with blood of those who felt the same

[Chorus]
Friends, lovers or nothing
There can only be one
Friends, lovers or nothing
There will never be an in-between, so give it up

[Chorus]
Friends, lovers, or nothing
We can really only ever be one
Friends, lovers, or nothing
We'll never be the inbetween
So give it up
We'll never the inbetween
So give it up

[Outro]
Anything other than 'yes' is 'no'
Anything other than 'stay' is 'go'
Anything less than 'I love you' is lying...

[Verse 1: The Weeknd]
Getting sober for a day got me feeling too low (Oh)
They tryna make me slow down
Tryna tell me how to live, I'm about to lose control (Lose control, oh)
Well they can watch me fuck it up all in one night
I'm in my city in the summer, camo'd out, leather booted, kissing bitches in the club
They wanna threesome (Threesome), then some (Then some)
Spend whatever come in, fuck an income
Me and my niggas we ain't never going broke
And you, have to, do it all
Just to know where it gets you
Living dreams we can never afford
Now, we sitting in the back, sayin'

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
This the shit that I live for, this the shit that I live for
This the shit that I live for, with the people I'd die for
This the shit that I live for, this the shit that I live for
This the shit that I live for, with the people I'd die for
This the shit that I live for, this the shit that I live for
This the shit that I live for, with the people I'd die for
This the shit that I live for, this the shit that I live for
This the shit that I live for, with the people I'd die for

[Verse 2: Drake]
Yeah
This the shit that I live for, this the shit that I'd die for
This the shit you can't fake, dawg, this the shit you need God for
How long do you think it's gon' take for y'all to fall?
That's a serious question, 'cause I seriously question all of y'all
Been touring the world, man, I've done spent racks in all the malls
And they know my story, flaws and all
I still got plaques hanging wall to wall, dawg
She just offered a strip tease, but she don't look like Demi Moore
Hips all on 45, waist all on 24
And it's all love in the city, still scream, "XO!" when that Henny pour
But I'm that boy, not just any boy, what the fuck you think that I'm in it for?
Roll up in that thing, got hoes like Prince, but they know, I'm king
Chubbs might hold that thing, if he get caught, he'll be home by spring
Things I shouldn't share, I mean, for the sake of my career
I'm not tryna stunt, I'm just tellin' you the truth, I swear
This the shit that I live for with the people I'd die for
This the shit you can't fake, dawg, this the shit you need God for
This that shit we really gotta talk about in person
There's some shit I need to work on, but I know you see me working, nigga, Champagne

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
This the shit that I live for, this the shit that I live for
This the shit that I live for, with the people I'd die for
This the shit that I live for, this the shit that I live for
This the shit that I live for, with the people I'd die for
This the shit that I live for, this the shit that I live for
This the shit that I live for, with the people I'd die for
This the shit that I live for, this the shit that I live for
This the shit that I live for, with the people I'd die for

[Verse 1]
Uh
Seems like since we got a black president
Black people stop questioning the government
And that ain't no diss to Barack either
So Mutherfucker you can miss me with that other shit
I'm good for life, I don't really need another hit
You wanna bury me you better get the shovel and
You better make it deep enough where no one will recover me
I'm Bobby Fucking Ray, I'm a modern day anomaly
Last year I did a show on a continent
In a country with a struggling economy
Who the hell you think paid for it all?
It sure ain't rocket science And it sure ain't trigonometry
Drug money, drug money, drug money
Blood money, blood money, blood money
For god sakes there's an all-seeing eye on the back of the dollar, we can't even trust money
You need to understand who you dealing.. With
These are like modern day villains
These are type of people that would kill a whole village
Build a fucking building.. And say it's just business
Who you think gave you religion?
Land of the free.. Who you think built it?
And don't ever let them tell you nothing different, cuz we know who did it if I ever come up missing

[Hook]
I'm missing, I'm missing, I'm missing
Ten strands of my DNA is missing
Cuban Linx on my neck as they glisten
Listen up Mutherfucker pay attention
It's a New World Order that we live in
Lies on the lips of every politician
Man at night I pray to God for forgiveness
I just wonder if the big homie's still listening
Still listening, I wonder if the big homie's still listening
Still listening, I wonder if the big homie's still listening

[Verse 2]
I don't need a hook but for hooks sake
If I had a hook, I'd make the hook say
"Be a good slave, be a good slave"
(Be a good slave, be a good slave)
Everybody in my hood brave
Everybody in my hood slang
Every street got a freak
And they give her all the wood that she could take
I'm fresher than a faema coffee
Get it? I'm fresher than a FEMA coffin
I'm willing to die for mine
But you the type of nigga
You'll call the police department
If you can't look in someone's eyes and be yourself
And speak the thoughts that's on your mind
You ain't got no reason to live
You on the sideline
You just a motherfucking slave
They got your mind tied up and it's missing

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Uh, I know I appear to be quite severe
An unopen mind will consider me weird
Thats just how the Matrix has been engineered
Now lend me your ear
Lend me your ear
Not to strike fear
More like Paul Revere
Not talking down on nobody at all
I just got some shit I think you should hear
Uh, Look
I ain't acting like I got all these facts and shit
But if you calling me a liar, look up in the sky
Look up in the sky you can see it happening
Uh, I'm not a activist
Just a young, black nigga with a half a sense
Cause there's ancient knowledge that they hiding from us
And I think it's time that we take it back again
Because it's missing

[Outro]

[First seven lines of Hook repeated]
Last night I prayed to God for forgiveness
I know they listening, I know they listening
I know they got my phone tapped and they listening
Louis V's on my bag and the feds wanna know what's in the suitcase, Pulp Fiction
Am I the realest? Am I the realest?
Cause I don't only talk about it and I live it
But they don't want anyone to find out the truth
And if I'm right I'ma wind up—

[Part 1]

[Intro]
Here soon, here soon
Here soon, here soon

[Verse 1]
Loving alone is what you make it
(Make it, make it)
Stay for the storm if you can take it
(Take it, take it)
But pray for a raincoat to bare the brunt of mistakes
I know you worry a lot if I’ll be here for you
Do I care enough? Do I feel for you?
I can guarantee

[Pre-Chorus]
Count on this one, whoa whoa
Count on this one, oh, oh
Count on this one, whoa whoa
Count on this one, oh, oh

[Chorus]
And I didn’t know you tried 'cause you wanted more
And I didn’t know you cried 'cause you wanted more
Things don't happen the way you hoped to
I’m just keeping a little hope, baby
And I didn’t know you tried 'cause you wanted more

[Verse 2]
Dying of daydreams in your bedroom
(Bedroom, bedroom)
Been waiting so long, said you’d be here soon
(Here soon, here soon)
How could you forget that I’m the one who
Forgot all your mistakes and dirty drawers?
You know I care for you
When hell over earth came, I stood for you
Will you stand for me?

[Pre-Chorus]
Count on this one, whoa whoa
Count on this one, oh, oh
Count on this one, whoa whoa
Count on this one, oh, oh

[Chorus]
And I didn’t know you tried 'cause you wanted more
And I didn’t know you cried 'cause you wanted more
Things don't happen the way you hoped to
I’m just keeping a little hope, baby
I didn’t know you tried 'cause you wanted more

[Outro]
Here soon, here soon

[Part 2]

[Produced by Dave Free]

[Verse]
Funny how life is turning out
I don't have much to talk about
Don’t have much to write about
Got a shitload to cry about
Funny the words I do kick
Funny the niggas I do pick
It’s funny what sticks
(Go figure)
Mama said I’m sensitive
I gotta work on that
Not really
Tired of using adjectives, I gotta build on that
You feel me?
Not really

[Outro]
Young man, tryna hold the world in a broken hand, hand
Young man, tryna find the world in a broken hand

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
Standing alone with no direction
How did I fall so far behind?
Why am I searching for perfection
Knowing it's something I won't find?

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
In my fear and flaws
I let myself down, again
All because

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
I run 'til the silence splits me open
I run 'til it puts me underground
'Til I have no breath
And no roads left but one

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
When did I lose my sense of purpose?
Can I regain what's lost inside?
Why do I feel like I deserve this?
Why does my pain look like my pride?

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
In my fear and flaws
I let myself down, again
All because I let myself down
In my fear and flaws

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
I run 'til the silence splits me open
I run 'til it puts me underground
'Til I have no breath
And no roads left but one
No roads left but one

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
In my fear and flaws
I let myself down, again
All because

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
I run and the silence splits me open
I run and it puts me underground
But there's no regret
And no roads left to run

[Intro: James Fauntleroy]
Stay close to me, so close to me
That's how it's supposed to be
Long as you've been knowing me
You been holding me down
I'm sure as fuck, so fuck hopefully
I watch over you, you watch over me
And that's how it's supposed to be
And we are, alright

[Hook: James Fauntleroy and Big Sean]
Now, when the world's ablaze, the stars will fall
The lights go off
Say it's going to be, alright
It's going to be, alright
Cause, when the world's ablaze, the stars will fall
The lights go off
Say it's going to be, alright
It's going to be, alright

[Post-Hook: James Fauntleroy & Big Sean]
Just tell me it'll be, tell me it'll be
Tell me it'll be, tell me it'll be
Tell me it'll be, tell me it'll be
Tell me it'll be, tell me it'll be

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
"Might not make it this time"
Is what not to say at this time
Sometimes, the truth ain't what you need to hear
And you tell them they alright, knowing they need a cure
How I'mma believe in paradise if I don't see the sand
Only palm trees I got is this weed off in my hand
Around the same time my mom said "Sean, you need a plan
Miss Freeman's son, across the street got shot, now she need a hand!"
Traumatized, God oh why's his momma cry
Now I gotta look up, up in his momma eyes, gotta tell this momma lies
Like, "It's gonna be alright," knowing it ain't alright
And I know it's so much pain, and there's probably more on the way

[Hook: James Fauntleroy and Big Sean]
Now, when the world's ablaze, the stars will fall
The lights go off
Say it's going to be, alright
It's going to be, alright
Cause, when the world's ablaze, the stars will fall
The lights go off
Say it's going to be, alright
It's going to be, alright

[Post-Hook: James Fauntleroy & Big Sean]
Just tell me it'll be, tell me it'll be
Tell me it'll be, tell me it'll be
Tell me it'll be, tell me it'll be
Tell me it'll be, tell me it'll be

[Verse 2]
You know I love you momma like she mine
Whether we together, or we trying
We fuck, three times, we smoke, tree times
We climb, I left, came back in town, it wasn't in time
The cancer done came, it just hit it's prime
It came from the breast, just spread to the spine
It might make her blind, she stare at the blinds:
"This can't be my mom!"
Got me thinking, "whats a girl to do, a girl to do?
When her world's a pool?
And she comes up for air, and it's walls of flames
And all the stress is all propane
She's burned again"
Hoping I could make her smile
Take cancer and David Blaine it out
POOF! Disappear, God make an out!

[Hook: James Fauntleroy and Big Sean]
Now, when the world's ablaze, the stars will fall
The lights go off
Say it's going to be, alright
It's going to be, alright
Cause, when the world's ablaze, the stars will fall
The lights go off
Say it's going to be, alright
It's going to be, alright

[Post-Hook: James Fauntleroy & Big Sean]
Just tell me it'll be, tell me it'll be
Tell me it'll be, tell me it'll be
Tell me it'll be, tell me it'll be
Tell me it'll be, tell me it'll be

[Outro: James Fauntleroy]
Stay close to me, so close to me
That's how it's supposed to be
Long as you've been knowing me
You been holding me down
I'm sure as fuck, so fuck hopefully
I watch over you, you watch over me
And that's how it's supposed to be
And we are, alright
And we are, alright
And we are, alright

[Verse 1]
And if I said I really knew you well
What would your answer be
If you were here today?
Ooh ooh ooh, here today

[Verse 2]
Well, knowing you
You'd probably laugh and say that we were worlds apart
If you were here today
Ooh, ooh, ooh, here today

[Bridge 1]
But as for me, I still remember how it was before
And I am holding back the tears no more
Ooh, ooh, ooh
I love you
Ooh, ooh

[Bridge 2]
What about the time we met? (What about the time we met?)
Well, I suppose that you could say that we were playing hard to get
Didn't understand a thing, but we could always sing
What about the night we cried? (What about the night we cried?)
Because there wasn't any reason left to keep it all inside
Never understood a word, but you were always there with a smile

[Verse 3]
And if I say I really loved you and was glad you came along
Then you were here today
Ooh, ooh, ooh
For you were in my song
Ooh ooh ooh, here today
(Verse 1: Gucci Mane)

1017 Dreamteam
Eating them percocetes like they was baked beans
I just gotta find out who got clean lean
And gas weed and Miley C
Peewee Longway with me that's my blood brother
Two pints of P's on us so we mud brothers
My life's a gangsta movie man I love colors
I'm in a red Bentley Brookland it's just me and Thugga
They say I'm getting skinny but all of my blunts stuffed
Ain't nuthin' skinny but them skinnies on my bentley truck
This molly really got me thow'd up in a Mulsanne backseat
Pow'd up two three's of the codeine
And feel im bout to OD
I'm in a rari but I'm runnin from the police
A carbon 15 on me and an ounce of OG
These niggas say they know Gu-wop but they don't know me
Ten G's of molly on me so i brought sand to the beach

(Chorus:)
I'm in a Ghost same color dope
Feel like I just came here on a banana boat
Come to my store, knock on my door
Soon as I get rid of them I got plenty more
Like Curtis Blow I got to blow
Like Bruce Leroy I got to glow
I do a show like I'm selling dope
I rep for the hood it's a dope show

(Verse:2 PeeWee Longway)

Me and big Gu-wop servin them bricks of du-wop
Them drummers south bricks to d-block
They bookin' those shows for re-rock
Money four door so now I'm re-routin
Looking at a real dope boy with cleeves out
Lebron James shooter trekkin what the heat brought
Real dope boy finnessing with the sheet rock
Feeling like Wayne put it on mamacita
Hit the block break it down serve James Ether
Fuck a thought with drop with the egg beater
Pull up in a drop top with a damn nina
C-Note say we not done counting 20's
Me and Wop in a Bentley flying down 20
Pourin' mud so dark think we sippin' henny
Got a bitch so bad call her dream of Jeannie
(Chorus:)

(Verse 3: Gucci Mane)
Dope show doing shows like I'm sellin' dope
I'm counting 300,000 now while she snorting coke
She mix her coke with heroine then she call it speed ballin'
I mix my cookin' with OG I hear that weed callin'
I'm on the phone slurring my words because the lean talking
Sipping champagne shoppin' for jeans I'm at Neiman Marcus
Trying on Giuseppes with a FN with a beam on it
Smelling like I just smoked a half a pound of green homey
The Trus got me looking lean homey
They say the Robins looking mean homey
But I ain't sticky cut some lean on it
They say I'm picky bout' my weed homey
These niggas trick u with the lean I buy PT's only
These niggas killin' what they eat homey
They'll treat you like a piece of meat homey
So don't get butchered in the street homey
I ain't had no work in like 2 weeks homey
I gotta feed the streets plus Gu-wop gotta eat homey

(Chorus:)

[Verse 1]
It ain’t hard to tell I got money
You can see it if you’re blind
You can see it when it shine, you see it then it’s mine
Always on my hustle, always on my grind 24/7, 365
Came up off the corner, quarters, nicks, and dimes
Nigga don’t believe me, look into my eyes
Niggas moving pies, niggas losing lives
Niggas doing time, they just tryna’ survive
Niggas talking shit, see me then its fine
Broke and rich nigga, it’s a very thin line
Speeding in my ride, smoking weed, I’m getting high
Hope you niggas fire, gonna need em’ if you try
All black leather, all black Jordan 5's
Money in the bank, kay kay on my mind
Got some niggas that I’m cool with, some gangster ass ties
All my niggas riding, all you niggas smiling

[Hook]
Shades on so them haters can’t look into my eyes
Look into my eyes, look into my eyes
So high that they say it’s hard to look into my eyes
Look into my eyes, look into my eyes
You’ll see all the shit I been through if you look into my eyes
Look into my eyes, look into my eyes
You gon’ see a real nigga when you look into my eyes
Look into my eyes, look into my eyes

[Verse 2]
My pops tell me I look tired when he look into my eyes
Soon as the cameras come on I know how to look alive
My mom tell me I look stressed when she look into my eyes
So many people in my business I’m just trying to live my life
You can tell I took a dab if you look into my eyes
See them kay kay clouds floating if you look into my ride
Say I look just like Sebastian if you look into my eyes
Know this whole world fucked up so I gotta raise him right
So we rolling, we smoking on that potent
A boss I got my own shit, Breeze holding on that chrome shit
He down to let you hold it, we all the same we close knit
Roll weed up by the ocean, you closing shop we open
We all know that the bullshit be talking and that real shit be walking
It’s a 9-11 I’m parking, you ain't getting money that’s awkward
Probably say I need a day off if you look into my eyes
Niggas faking but I can’t I don’t look good in that disguise

[Hook]

You can do it at the hippodrome

Anybody got a TV at home?

Pick it up and run like hell
Little woman, save me some
Better get up on your run

Intimate sight has come into light

[Bridge: Anthony Kiedis & John Frusciante]
When I pick up on that smell

Slip it into a summer spell, double up and run like hell

So much more than—

[Instrumental Outro]

[Intro:]
Big Willie (repeated)

[Verse]
One for the treble, two for the bass
Jazzy Jeff and Fresh Prince back up in your face
Me and Jeff again, "Oh my" you say
1985 to the Y2K
The new millenium, prophecies, I'm fulfillin' 'em
Everywhere I go, people be yelling "yo, that's Will and them"
I check the rhyme like Quest
Some jokes dropped them doo-doo rhymes at my rest
The B-I-G, W-I-L-L
King of swing, and I rock well
The nail in the coffin of your average rapper
Jeff do the ditto for your average scratcher
Stature of a rapper/actor
Back to the future on wax
The future of rap
Tap like Gregory Hines, read the headlines
Hip-hop's number one son still shines

[On gaining a reputation for making "hip-hop for people who don't like hip-hop"]

I hate that. I hate it. I mean...what are you going to do, but it's just ignorance.

[On race and mainstream success]

If you’re going to be a white dude and do this shit, I think you have to take some level of accountability. You have to acknowledge where the art came from, where it is today, how you’re benefiting from it. At the very least, just bringing up those points and acknowledging that, yes, I understand my privilege, I understand how it works for me in society, and how it works for me in 2013 with the success that The Heist has had.

We made a great album, but I do think we have benefited from being white and the media grabbing on to something. A song like "Thrift Shop" was safe enough for the kids. It was like, "This is music that my mom likes and that I can like as a teenager," and even though I’m cussing my ass off in the song, the fact that I’m a white guy, parents feel safe. They let their six-year-olds listen to it. I mean, it’s just… it’s different. And would that success have been the same if I would have been a black dude? I think the answer is no.

[Verse 1]
Press play, fast forward
Nonstop, we have a beaten path before us
It was all there, in plain sight
Come on people, we have all seen the signs

[Pre-Chorus]
So we will never get back to
To the old school
To the old grounds, it's all about the newfound
We are the newborn, the world knew all about us
(We are the future and we're here to stay)

[Chorus]
We've come a long way since that day
And we will never look back at the faded silhouette
We've come a long way since that day
And we will never look back, look back at the faded silhouette

[Beat Break]

[Verse 2]
Straight ahead on the path we have before us
Day by day, soon the change will come
Don't you know we took a big step forward
Just lead the way and we pull the trigger

[Pre-Chorus]
And we will never get back to
To the old school
To the old grounds, it's all about the newfound
We are the newborn, the world knew all about us
(We are the future and we're here to stay)

[Chorus]
We've come a long way since that day
And we will never look back at the faded silhouette
We've come a long way since that day

We've come a long way since that day
And we will never look back at the faded silhouette
We've come a long way since that day
And we will never look back, look back at the faded silhouette

[Spoken Intro: André 3000]
Ah! A letter from (*censored*)
"Dear André"

[Spoken Verse: Amanda Qasha Aman]
"I hope this letter finds you in the best of health
As for myself, I'm doin' well
And P.S. – with or without you, I can't get enough
That's why you're my favorite stuff"

[Intro]

[Chorus]
How come twenty-four hours
Baby, sometimes seem to slip into days?
Oh, twenty-four hours
Baby, sometimes seem to slip into days, yeah?
When a minute seems like a lifetime
Oh, baby, when I feel this way

[Verse 1]
Sitting, looking at the clock
Oh, time moves so slow
I've been watchin' for the hands to move
Until I just can't look no more

[Chorus]
How come twenty-four hours
Baby, sometimes seems to slip into days?
A minute seems like a lifetime
Baby, when I feel this way

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2]
To sing a song for you
I recall you used to say
"Oh, baby, this one's for we two"
Which in the end is you anyway

[Chorus]
How come twenty-four hours
Baby, sometimes seem to slip into days?
A minute seems like a lifetime
Oh, baby, when I feel this way

[Verse 3]
There was a time that I stood tall
In the eyes of other men
But by my own choice I left you, woman
And now I can't get back again

[Chorus]
How come twenty-four hours
Sometimes seem to slip into days, days?
Well, well, well, a minute seems like a lifetime
Baby, when I feel this way
A minute seems like a lifetime
Oh, baby, when I feel this way
I feel this way
Shhh, they're about to start the movie

[Intro]
Hear ye, hear ye
Disturbing Tha Peace presents, "Theater of the Mind"
Get your popcorn, get your popcorn
You scoot over to the left a little bit
Single file line now
It's an extravagant event starring Ludacris
Please silence all cell phones
We're about to go on a ride!
Let the show beginnnnnn!

[Verse 1: Ludacris]
Lights, camera, annnnnd ACTION!
Take 6, Ludacris, it's nice to meet ya
Blow the smoke in the air 'til I blow out your brain
Turn it up until I blow out your speakers
Gotta keep them Tweeters tweakin
Gotta keep them woofers pumpin
Then I blow out one of these verses
Spit 'em in ya, got a million more comin
However you want it, I can give it but you gotta admit it
Other rappers talk it, try to walk it, Luda live it
Sign it and seal it, multi-mil' it, said it and did it
Then give me sixteen bars on another nigga's song
And you know that I'ma fuckin' kill it
Cause I'm the fuckin' realest, when it comes to this rappin' shit
Semi-automatic tongue when I spit another verse
Cock back, I'm packin' bitch
And I'm back and attackin' with album six
Tell them other niggas we see danger
Probably cause I got enough albums to fill yo' CD changer
Gotta buy my whole collection, gotta beat my whole selection
Hit your neighborhood record store
And you can get it in the smokin' section
Now that's a coke connection, these fiends are addicted to it
No guts no glory, so that's my story and I'm stickin' to it

[Outro]
That's my story and I'm stickin' to it
Here's my story and I'm stickin' to it
Here's my story and I'm stickin' to it
Here some stories and I'm stickin' to it
Annnnnd CUT! On a good gate we're movin' on

[Verse 1]
Each time we have a quarrel
It almost breaks my heart
Because I am so afraid
That we will have to part
Each night I ask the stars up above

[Chorus 1]
Why must I be a teenager in love?

[Verse 2]
One day I feel so happy
Next day I feel so sad
I guess I'll learn to take
The good with the bad
Each night I ask the stars up above

[Chorus 1]
Why must I be a teenager in love?

[Chorus 2]
I cry a tear
For nobody but you
I'll be your lonely one if you should say we are through
Well if you want to make me cry
That won't be so hard to do
If you should say good bye I still go on loving you
Each night I ask the stars up above

[Chorus 1]
Why must I be a teenager in love?

[Chorus 2]
I cry a tear
For nobody but you
I'll be your lonely one if you should say we are through
Well if you want to make me cry
That won't be so hard to do
If you should say good bye I still go on loving you
Each night I ask the stars up above

[Chorus 1]
Why must I be a teenager in love?
Why must I be a teenager in love?
Why must I be a teenager in love?
Why must I be a teenager in love?
Why must I be a teenager in love?
Why must I be a teenager in love?
Why must I be a teenager in love?

Is that the stars in the sky, or is it
Rain falling down
Will it burn me if I touch the sun, yeah
So big, so round
Would I be truthful, yeah, in
Choosing you as the one for me?
Is this love, baby
Or is it just confusion?

[Verse 2]
My mind is so messed up
Going round and round
Must there be all these colours
Without names, without sound, baby?
My heart burns with feeling, but
Whoa my mind, it's cold and reeling
Is this love, baby
Or is it just confusion?

[Instrumental Break]

Oh my head is pounding, pounding
Going round and round and round and round
Must there always be these colours
Without names, without sound?
My heart burns with feeling
Oh but my mind, it's cold and reeling
Is this love, baby
Or is it just confusion?

[Outro]
Oh, tell me baby
Is this love or confusion?
Mama, we must get together and find out
Exactly what we're trying to do
Love or confusion?
Confusion

[Verse 1]
Looking 'round the room
I can tell that you
Are the most beautiful girl in the... room
(In the whole wide room)
And when you're on the street
Depending on the street
I bet you are definitely in the top three
Good looking girls on the street
Depending on the street
And when I saw you at my mate's place
I thought, "What. is. she. doin'
At my mate's place?"
How did Dave get a hottie like that to a party like this?
Good one Dave
(You're a legend Dave)
I ask Dave if he's gonna make a move on you
He's not sure
I said "Dave do you mind if I do?"
He says he doesn't mind
But I can tell he kinda minds
But I'm gonna do it anyway
I see you standing by the stereo
I dim the lights down to very low here we go

[Chorus]
You're so beautiful (beautiful)
You could be a waitress
You're so beautiful (beautiful)
You could be an air hostess in the 60s
You're so beautiful
You could be a part time model

[Post=Chorus]
And then I seal the deal
I do my moves
I do my dance moves
Both of my dance moves

[Bridge]
It's twelve-oh-two
Just me and you
And seven other dudes
Around you on the dance-floor
I draw you near
Let's get out of here
Let's get in a cab
I'll buy you a kebab

[Verse 2]
And I can't believe
That I'm sharing a kebab with the most beautiful girl
I have ever seen... with a kebab
Why don't we leave?
Let's go to my house and we can feel each other up on the couch
Oh no, I don't mind taking it slow

[Chorus]
Because you're so beautiful
Like a, tree
Or a high class prostitute
You're so beautiful
You could be a part time model
But you'd probably still have to keep your normal job
A part time model
Spending part of your time modelling
And part of your time next to me
And the rest of your time doing your normal job
My place is usually tidier than this

[Verse 1: M.I.A]
If you ever leave
Then I have to give up everything I believe
Life is nothing but just a fantasy
Since you took away the love that’s left in me
Please talk to me, did you ever fight for me?
And how can I stand by you if I can’t find my feet?
Now you can’t stand me, made me your enemy
Now what did I do for you to call me crazy?

[Chorus: M.I.A.]
If it's your sudden shade, if it's your mind array
Here's a mixtape that I made, let’s take a break
Don’t wanna fuss away, baby, if it’s too late
While I get my life sorted here’s a mixtape

[Post-Hook 1: Lizz E.]
I never thought I'd see
That time for you would be
So far away from home
So far away from me

[Verse 2: M.I.A.]
When you hit your face, tore me up like lace
Yeah, what’s it for if we’re just another case?
Hurt does leave a trace, love the darkest face
And this hole is deeper than the fall that I embrace

[Refrain: M.I.A.]
Did you fight for me? Did you cry for me?
Yeah, and how can I stand by you if I can’t find my feet?

[Chorus: M.I.A.]
If it's your sudden shade, If it's your mind array
Here's a mixtape that I made, let’s take a break
Don’t wanna fuss away, baby if it’s too late
While I get my life sorted here’s a mixtape

[Post-Hook 2: Graham Coxon]
Oh my baby, oh my baby
Oh why? Oh my
Oh my baby, oh my baby
Oh why? Oh my

[Refrain: M.I.A.]
Did you fight for me? Did you cry for me?
Yeah, and how can I stand by you if I can’t find my feet?

[Chorus: M.I.A.]
If it's your sudden shade, If it's your mind array
Here's a mixtape that I made, let’s take a break
Don’t wanna fuss away, baby if it’s too late
While I get my life sorted here’s a mixtape

[Interlude: Carly Simon]
La-di-da-di-da, la-di-da-di-da
La-di-da-di-da, la-di-da-di-da
La-di-da-di-da, la-di-da-di-da
La-di-da-di-da, la-di-da-di-da

[Outro: Karen Dalton]
Please, let me sit down beside you
I've got something to tell you, darling
You ought'a know
I just can't wait, no not another day
I love you, more than words can say

[Verse 1]
Please, please, please
No more melodies
They lack impact, they're petty
They've been made up already
Please, please, please
No more maladies
I'm so tired of crying
You'd think I was a siren
But me and everybody's on the sad same team
And you can hear our sad brains screaming

[Chorus]
Give us something familiar
Something similar
To what we know already
That will keep us steady
Steady
Steady going nowhere

[Verse 2]
Please, please, please
No apologies
At best they buy you time
Until you next step out of line
Please, please, please
No more remedies
My method is uncertain
It's a mess but it's working
And maybe if you wanna try it out
You won't like it so when you're crying out

[Chorus]
Give us something familiar
Something similar
To what we know already
That will keep us steady
Steady
Steady going nowhere

[Verse 3]
Please, please, please
No more melodies
They lack impact, they're petty
They've been made up already
Please, please, please
No more maladies
I'm so tired of crying
You'd think I was a siren
But me and everybody's on the sad same team and
You can hear our sad brain screaming

[Chorus]
Give us something familiar
Something similar
To what we know already
That will keep us steady
Steady
Steady going nowhere

[Verse 4]
Please, please, please
No apologies
At best they buy you time
Until you next step out of line
Please, please, please
No more remedies
My method is uncertain
It's a mess but it's working
And maybe if you want to try it out
You won't like it when you're crying out

[Chorus]
Give us something familiar
Something similar
To what we know already
That will keep us steady
Steady
Steady going nowhere
BET.com: You got some backlash for anti-gay lyrics and you gave a statement to the Huffington Post. Do you regret using the word “f*****”?

J. Cole: No, not at all. It’s much different than the autism thing, it wasn’t conscious; that was a slip-up, being offensive without intent. The line was to engage the conversation of homophobia in Black culture and in hip hop. I thought it was going to be a way more interesting conversation that came from it. Of course I made the statement, but I thought from that it would spawn better conversations like, “Why are we so homophobic?” Much more than I think any other culture, I don’t want to just compare it to white people, but in terms of jokes that you make — everything’s got to be “pause” or “no homo.” You can't even play basketball without someone saying, “pause.” I’m not innocent of it. I am part of that same culture – but why? That line was supposed to be offensive and confusing, but I was hoping to have more conversations about it.

BET.com: There’s been a lot of conversation about the Trayvon Martin tragedy and what young Black men experience. Do you experience racism?

J. Cole: For sure, absolutely, I just got pulled over on 42nd street in Times Square for what I believe was nothing. They said it was for tints on my front window, which is barely tinted. I really believe it was because I had my hat low. I was driving through Times Square and I just didn’t want to be seen. So I had my hat low and I think I was looking “suspicious” just as a Black man with my brim low, when I was really just trying to cover my face. They came to my window, pulled me over. I feel like if I was a white man driving, they wouldn’t question me about my tints. They told me to roll down my back window; they look in my car as if they’re looking for something. I feel like that was the real thing, they were trying to catch somebody slipping. That just happened three days ago. I almost didn’t even name that because I am so used to that. That’s something that I feel like somebody my age that’s white doesn’t have to go through, especially in New York City. On the other hand, every time I’m on the plane in first class — this is a lesser evil but it still represents their mind state — I promise you, 60 percent of the time somebody asks me what basketball team do I play for or do I rap. 

[Laughs] I am a rapper, I wish I could tell them something better — that happens all the time and I hate it. I hate that we’re stereotyped and I hate that I’m fitting into the same stereotype.

BET.com: You’ve talked about including dark-skinned women in your music videos versus all light-skinned women. The light-skinned, dark-skinned issue certainly affects women in hip hop; does it affect men in hip hop?

J. Cole: I can’t say it for sure but I just think we’re still in America. We’re still Black Americans. Those mental chains are still in us. That brainwashing that tells us that light skin is better, it’s subconsciously in us, whether we know it or not… still pursuing light skin women. There are some women out there that are like, “I don’t even like light skin men” and that’s fine. But Barack Obama would not be President if he were dark skin. You know what I mean? That’s just the truth. I might not be as successful as I am now if I was dark skin. I’m not saying that for sure, I’m still as talented as I am and Obama is still as smart as he is, but it’s just a sad truth… I don’t even know if this is going to translate well into text and people not hearing what I’m saying, but it’s a sad reality. So I can only naturally assume it’s probably easier for a light skin male rapper than it might be for a dark skin male rapper. It’s all subconscious s***, nobody’s aware — I think that s*** still subconsciously affects us.

[Verse 1]
I met a man I didn't know that asked me how are you doing
Should have just said fine cause it's all he wanted to hear
But for reasons unknown in a sorrowful tone I said
Man it's been a hell of a year
And I don't really know where I'm going
And I might just be hanging around

[Chorus]
And I don't really know where I'm going
And I might just be hanging around
If life's shades of gray
Then I guess you could say
That I've been waiting for a break in the clouds

[Verse 2]
I went to go see some gypsy to tell me my future
But she asked for my photograph instead
As I walked through the cold with my fortune untold I said
Good luck trying to reach me when I'm dead

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I saw the love I used to know swallow me whole
On a day I was out of clean clothes
She sized me up and she said honey how is your head
I said you can't call me honey but honey heaven only knows

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Bet your going to be finding a break in the clouds
No, no, no I don't know where I'm going
And I might might might just be hanging around
And if life shades of gray
Then I guess you could say
That I've been waiting for a break in the clouds

[Verse 1]
Panic on the streets of London
Panic on the streets of Birmingham
I wonder to myself...
Could life ever be sane again?
The Leeds side-streets that you slip down
I wonder to myself...

[Verse 2]
Hopes may rise on the Grasmere
But, Honey Pie, you're not safe here
So you run down to the safety of the town
But there's panic on the streets of Carlisle
Dublin, Dundee, Humberside
I wonder to myself...

[Chorus]
Burn down the disco
Hang the blessed DJ
Because the music that they constantly play
It says nothing to me about my life
Hang the blessed DJ
Because the music they constantly play

[Verse 3]
On the Leeds side-streets that you slip down
Provincial towns you jog 'round

[Outro]
Hang the DJ, hang the DJ, hang the DJ
Hang the DJ, hang the DJ, hang the DJ
Hang the DJ, hang the DJ, hang the DJ
Hang the DJ, hang the DJ
Hang the DJ, hang the DJ
Hang the DJ, hang the DJ, hang the DJ
Hang the DJ, hang the DJ
Hang the DJ, hang the DJ
Hang the DJ, hang the DJ, hang the DJ
Hang the DJ, hang the DJ
Hang the DJ, hang the DJ
Hang the DJ, hang the DJ, hang the DJ
Hang the DJ, hang the DJ

[Verse 1]
I am sleepin' with your best friend
How do you like me now?
How do you like me now?
I am sleepin' with your best friend
How do you like me now?
How do you like me now?

[Chorus]
Come on, get drunk
You know you wanna
I am, you can
Won't tell no one about it
It's gonna be a ball
It's gonna be a ball

[Verse 2]
I am lyin', usin' again
Come on
It's gonna be a ball

[Chorus]
Come on, get drunk
You know you wanna
I am, you can
Won't tell no one about it
It's gonna be a ball
It's gonna be a ball

[Bridge]
Cigarettes, Robitussin
Will I ever get to heaven?
Cigarettes, and Robitussin
Will I ever get to heaven?
It's not looking good now, oh
It's not looking good now

[Outro]
Come on, get drunk
You know you wanna
Come on
Get drunk, get drunk
Get drunk, get drunk
Get drunk, get drunk
Get drunk

[Intro: Future]
Apply major pressure my nigga
You hear me?

[Hook 1: Future]
Money on my mind, can't take it off that shit
A nigga's got five different iPhones
I only pick it up for that grip
Any time they come around here
We ain't gonna let up on you pussy niggas
We just get ready
We just get ready
Any time they come around here
We ain't gonna let up on you pussy niggas
We just get ready

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
It's Ray Bands and Freebandz, we getting money
While you're hating, we're somewhere in Abu Dhabi
With Arabians G5'in, and with my posse
It's outrages, on that good Jamaican
That's right I'm too faded, you're two shaded
I'm too greedy with two ladies
Excellence I'm exuberating
I'm finna smash like two potatoes
I don't give a fuck, not even two maybes
I turn up on niggas like rutabagas
I do it daily, I do it daily
That's my swag, you should pay me
Ain't that the truth?
This is my whip, ain't that the coupe?
Hustle Gang ain't that the squad?
Bitch, act like you've got a clue
While they out here catching feelings, I'mma catch a flight or two
I just give her major pressure while she gave me major (ooooh!)

[Hook 2: Future]
Money on my mind, can't take it off that shit
They've got five different iPhone's
Always picking up for that grip
Any time they come around here
We ain't gonna let up on you pussy niggas
We just get ready
We just get ready
Any time they come around here
We ain't gonna let up on you pussy niggas
We just get ready
We just get ready
Any time they come around here
We ain't gonna let up on you pussy niggas
We just get ready

[Verse 2: B.o.B]
Anything they wanna do, hell yeah I'm ready for it
Sexy bitch, just throw that back, hell yeah she's ready for it
They thought that the boy was stool, now my shit, they're checkin' for it
And your girl, she's addicted to it, I think that ho needs Betty Ford
All I heard was "that boy's pop"
All I heard was "that boy's not"
Top 5 on any list, but I've moved up by five slots
I'm passed one, high as fuck
I don't see niggas until I look down
I've just turned my crib in to the hookah spot
You are now welcomed to the kush lounge
So miss me with that fuckery
Girl, come here with that suckery
Ham Squad, Hustle Gang, that's that Underground Luxury
I don't mess with them fake types, I'd ban hem all, if it was up to me
Even if a bitch was a cashier, still she'd never get a buck from me

[Hook 3: Future]
Money on my mind, can't get off that shit
They've got five different iPhones
Always picking up for that grip
Any time they come around here
We ain't gonna let up on you pussy niggas
We just get ready
We just get ready
Any time they come around here
We ain't gonna let up on you pussy niggas
We just get ready
We just get ready
Any time they come around here
We ain't gonna let up on you pussy niggas
We just get ready

[Verse 1]
Let's run away from these lies
Back to yesterday, safe tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
I feel the sun creepin' up like tick tock
I'm tryna keep you in my head, but if not
We'll just keep runnin' from tomorrow with our lips locked
Yeah, you got me beggin', beggin'

[Chorus]
Baby, please don't go
If I wake up tomorrow, will you still be here?
I don't know if you feel the way I do
If you leave, I'm gon' find you
Baby, please don't go, go, go, go
Baby, please don't go, go, go, go
Baby, please don't go, go, go, go
Baby, please don't, baby, please don't

[Verse 2]
Baby, please don't run away
From my bed and start another day
Stay instead

[Pre-Chorus]
I feel the sun creepin' up like tick tock
I'm tryna keep you in my head, but if not
We'll just keep runnin' from tomorrow with our lips locked
Yeah, you got me beggin', beggin'

[Chorus]
Baby, please don't go
If I wake up tomorrow, will you still be here?
I don't know if you feel the way I do
If you leave, I'm gon' find you
Baby, please don't go, go, go, go
Baby, please don't go, go, go, go
Baby, please don't go, go, go, go
Baby, please don't, baby, please don't
Baby, please don't

[Bridge]
I stay runnin' from tomorrow
I stay runnin' from tomorrow
Well, I stay runnin' from tomorrow
Said, "I stay runnin' from tomorrow" Oh

[Chorus]
Baby, please don't go (Please don't go)
If I wake up tomorrow, will you still be here?
I don't know if you feel the way I do
If you leave (I'm gon', I'm gon', I'm gonna find you)
I'm gon' find you
Baby, please don't go, go, go, go
Baby, please don't go, go, go, go (Don't leave me, leave me)
Baby, please don't go, go, go, go
Baby, please don't, baby, please don't
Baby, please don't run away
The love that faded left me only tears
Days that were happy turned into lonely years
Vows that we made turned into lies
My life is empty, my lonely heart cries

I tried to forget that we'll never be
Nothing left for me but dust in the breeze
My way is lonely, but I think I'm lost
My love was wasted, I'm paying the cost

Brown eyes, blue eyes, they're all the same
None are for me, I've lost the game
Tomorrow has nothing but worries and cares
The love that faded left me only tears

Just like the rose your love faded away
Now my lonely heart must break and pay
Nothing now but heartaches through years
The love that faded left me only tears

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Lights, action, cameras flashin'
Managers, sponsors, concerts, monster mashin'
Flashin'
Type who might throw his underwear in the trash like Marilyn Manson
Updated Axle Rose
White version of Shaft, pimp slappin' hoes
Pull up like a Mac, jet black limo
Stretch so far back, can't see the back windows
Steppin' out, pink hats, furs and minks
Chick on each arm, what the **** you think?
Right arm got that kid from *NSYNC's chick on it
Left arm got that little P!nk chick on it
Me and Dre at the VMA's again
Pissin' off all these lesbians and gays again

[Verse 3: Eminem]
My head hits the pillow, a weepin' willow
I can't sleep, a pain so deep, it bellows
But these cellos help just to keep me mellow
Hands on my head, touch knees to elbows
I'm hunched over, emotion just flows over
These cold shoulders are both frozen, you don't know me
I keep sayin' it, I can't stress it enough
So keep playin' it, and stand next to the subs
I choke mics like asphyxiation
When I'm stranglin' my own throat masturbatin'
Shit yeah, I'm a basket case
And I mastered this rap s*** 'til my ass gets wasted
'Til my assassination
'Til I'm slain 'cause of some **** infatuation

A taste for disaster, and if that's the case, then—

[Verse 1]
Hold up

Wasn't even thinking bout getting a Rolex
Now we got a Rolex and the whole thing froze up
Now you takin pictures of this shit

They just talkin but I'm living off this shit
Kenny Powers really feel like I'm the shit
MC Hammer pants I feel like I'm legit
9/11 not the day but thats the whip
Taylor Gang they be on that shit
Always on the grind tryna keep my mind on the finer things
I gotta get that'll make a nigga rich
Lotta new kicks lotta new fits
Lotta swag that you see on me that'll take a nigga bitch
They get dressed like I get up and go
Grabbing all my shit up and roll
Walked in and lit up the store
Took a dab and roll another joint now I lit up for show
And my bitch is like a pin-up if I like it then I buy it
Most of the time the shit is free and they just in it
Major paper and I'm winning and my outfits sick
I'm a walk up in this bitch and I'm a make a nigga spit up

[Hook]

Never seen it before
Try spending what I'm spending and you'll probably go broke
I be like look what I got on, look at what I got on
I be like look what I got on, look at what I got on

[Verse 2]
Have you ever seen a nigga dress good as me
Have you ever seen a nigga go shopping for the furs
Turn around right where the leathers be
Have you ever seen a nigga with some shit wonder where he get it
When you try to get the thing in the store
Have you ever seen a nigga lookin' crazy then the motherfucker
In it but the price you don't even know
Never seen nobody walk up in the store without no money
When they come out they hands are full of hella bags
Never seen nobody come into the store and get the treatment that I get
I guess that mean I spend hella bands
Have you ever got your suit tailor'd by the man
Have you ever got your suit flown in by the man
You don't get that kind of money you don't understand
You ain't ever touch a hundred grand
You just say you do
Like a lame would do
My Taylor Gang niggas a fatal crew
We taking your paper and rocking the latest
You try to hate but my clique hater proof
My closet go on for a day or two
Ain't one of them niggas who switch the shit it up
No I'm staying true like a player do
So show me my tab and who to pay it to
Fuck you and them niggas you came with too

[Hook]
Can't get this from the store
That's a one of one that mean they don't make it no more
I be like look what I got on, look at what I got on

[Bridge: Wiz Khalifa]
Old heads look at what I got on
Young niggas look at what I got on
Broke niggas look at what I got on
Rich niggas look at what I got on

[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]
And I'm floating, my windows open
My eyes all low cause I'm off that potent

Pull up in it, they like "oh shit"
Hella expensive, smoking explosive

You say he loves you more than me, so I will set you free
Go with him (Anna)
Go with him (Anna)

Anna
Girl, before you go now
I want you to know, now
That I still love you so, but if he loves you more
Go with him

[Chorus]
All of my life
I've been searching for a girl
To love me like I love you
Oh, now, but every girl I've ever had
Breaks my heart and leaves me sad

You give back your ring to me, and I will set you free
Go with him

Chains, my baby's got me locked up in chains
And they ain't the kind that you can see
Whoa, these chains of love got a hold on me, yeah
Chains, well I can't break away from these chains
Can't run around, 'cause I'm not free
Whoa, oh, these chains of love won't let me be, yeah

[Verse 1]
I wanna tell you, pretty baby
I think you're fine

[Intro: Akon]
Love me tonight, girl, we won't meet again
Don't fight the feeling cause love ain't a sin
Let your body decide what it does
It's okay, baby (Ha ha ha ha)
'Cause everybody fucks, la la la la
'Cause everybody fucks, la la la la
'Cause everybody fucks, la la la la
Let your body decide what it does
It's okay, baby (It's okay, baby)
'cause everybody fucks

[Verse 1: Pitbull]
I know it's straight to the point
But I'd rather be straight up and straight forward
Instead of playing with your heart and your mind
Games are waste of time
Now we can do the nasty and do what it do and see what it does
Either we gon' love what we do to each other
Or just let it be what it was
No harm, no foul, no commitment, no vows
Maybe a contract or two
But by that time I'm already tired of the way you like it, ooh
And let your body decide (Decide), exactly what it does (Does)
But it's no secret baby, everybody fucks

[Pre-Chorus: Pitbull]
I know you don't do these type of things on the first night
(First night)
We both know it's wrong but fuck it cause it feels right
(Feels right)
I know you don't do these type of things on the first night
We both know it's wrong but fuck it cause it feels right

[Chorus: Akon]
Love me tonight, girl, we won't meet again
Don't fight the feeling cause love ain't a sin
Let your body decide what it does
It's okay, baby (Ha ha ha ha)
'Cause everybody fucks, la la la la
'Cause everybody fucks, la la la la
'Cause everybody fucks, la la la la
Let your body decide what it does
It's okay, baby
'Cause everybody fucks

[Verse 2: David Rush & (Akon)]
Now I can hear your body callin' me
Tell me what it is, what's gon' be
Only got one night cause I'm...
Lil mama is a bad one, ain't she?
Maybe she might be a little timid
Love when I get it
Or I might even give a text when I'm finish
Been doing all this talking, let's get it
And you can tell me what you wanna do
I guarantee you can do that
Or you can teach me like a thing or two
But I bet you I already knew that
So one night one time baby girl
Let's take this chance
We ain't trying to be love strung
But I know that (Everybody fucks)

[Pre-Chorus: Pitbull]
I know you don't do these type of things on the first night
(First night)
We both know it's wrong but fuck it cause it feels right
(Feels right)
I know you don't do these type of things on the first night
We both know it's wrong but fuck it cause it feels right

[Chorus: Akon]
Love me tonight, girl, we won't meet again
Don't fight the feeling cause love ain't a sin
Let your body decide what it does
It's okay, baby
'Cause everybody fucks, la la la la
'Cause everybody fucks, la la la la
'Cause everybody fucks, la la la la
Let your body decide what it does
It's okay, baby
'Cause everybody fucks

[Bridge: Akon]
Let your body go, let your feeling show
Say what's on your mind, I already know
I can read your eyes, see your body sign
(Every sign you give, baby) with a little bump and grind
Nothing wrong, with a little bump and grind
Baby, there ain't nothing wrong, with a little bump and grind
There ain't nothing wrong, with a little bump and grind
Baby, there ain't nothing wrong, with a little bump and grind

[Chorus: Akon]
Love me tonight, girl, we won't meet again
Don't fight the feeling cause love ain't a sin
Let your body decide what it does
It's okay, baby
'Cause everybody fucks, la la la la
'Cause everybody fucks, la la la la
'Cause everybody fucks, la la la la
Let your body decide what it does (Decide what it does)
It's okay, baby
'Cause everybody fucks

[Outro: Akon]
Believe that, believe that, baby
Everybody, everybody

[Verse 1]
Hello, I'm a salesman sorta giant
I sell Molly and Mary and other various items
One time, one guy came to where I'm residing
And I didn't invite him, so instead, tried to fight him
I got violent, long story short: he's not breathing
For some reason I liked it and it was really exciting
Couldn't stop the addiction, and the irony is
A couple junkies went missing and I know right where they're hiding

[Hook]
Dope in the bag, pretty bitch on the side
I sell dope in the back, if you tryna get high (Tryna get high)
Dope in the bag, pretty bitch on the side
I sell dope in the back, if you tryna get high
Dope—Dope in the bag, pretty bitch on the side
I sell dope in the back, if you tryna get high
Dope—Dope in the bag, pretty bitch on the side
I sell dope in the back, if you tryna get high

[Verse 2]
Task force poured into my fortress (Fortress)
Found some lipstick, a couple corpses
Bitches was harmed and they couldn't reach the alarm
I'm ripping sockets out like I had fucking problems with arms, and
They found a couple portraits on the porch
Hope they don't check up under the floor
It's bodies and hotties, and we was raging, I'm gauging a shawty
Hit so many bitches I was pimping like Scotty
I'm a bull, red, piss me off
Like that lipstick position when she kissed me
So I bit 'em off, they was too soft, I'm a Wolf
And a designer mixing skin, cotton, leather, and wool
And most people like flying kites, riding bikes in the woods
Baking cake 'cause it's good, I mean, I would if I could
But I like playing dress-up and mix-match
Sorry, I'ma 'fess up: You aren't getting your kids back

[Hook]
Dope in the bag, pretty bitch on the side
I sell dope in the back, if you tryna get high (Tryna get high)
Dope—Dope in the bag, pretty bitch on the side
I sell dope in the back, if you tryna get high
Dope—Dope in the bag, pretty bitch on the side
I sell dope in the back, if you tryna get high (Tryna get high)
Dope—Dope in the bag, pretty bitch on the side
I sell dope in the back, if you tryna get high

[Outro]
You could say I kill 'em if my product doesn't
Couple basement stairs where I drug 'em down

Finger-crush your face, I'll leave you permanently blushing, blood
Nosebleed drugs

[Verse 1]
I was staring out the window
The whole time he was talking to me
It was a filthy pane of glass
I couldn't get a clear view
And as he went on and on
It wasn't the outside world I could see
Just the filthy pane that I was looking through

[Chorus]
So I had to break the window
It just had to be
Better that I break the window
Than him or her or me

[Verse 2]
I was never focused on just one thing
My eyes got fixed when my mind got so
It may look like I'm concentrated on
A very clear view
But I'm as good as asleep
I bet you didn't know
It'd take a lot of it away
If you do

[Chorus 2]
I had to break the window
It just had to be
Better that I break the window
Than him or her or me
I had to break the window
It just had to be
It was in my way
Better that I break the window
Than forget what I had to say
Or miss what I should see

[Bridge]
Because the fact being that
Whatever's in front of me
Is covering my view
So I can't see what I'm seeing in fact
I only see what I'm looking through

[Verse 3]
So again I've done the right thing
I was never worried about that
The answer's always been in clear view
But even when the window was cleaned
I still can't see for the fact
That when it's clean
It's so clear I can't tell what I'm looking through

[Chorus 3]
So I had to break the window
It just had to be
It was in my way
Better that I break the window
Than him or her or me
I had to break the window
It just had to be
It was in my way
Better that I break the window
Than miss what I should see
I had to break the window
It just had to be
It was in my way
Better that I break the window
Than forget what I had to say
Or miss what I should see
Or break him or her or me
Especially me

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
Niggas pistol-poppin' like it's 1999
I was nine, maybe ten, then again, never mind
Press rewind, back in time
Before rappers droppin' dimes
Trap or die, choppin' pies
With clichés all in they rhymes

[Hook 1: A$AP Rocky]
Now it's Gucci, Prada and anything designer
Money, power, the whole enchilada
Commas, dollas, the greens and the guava (oh)

If you disrespect that blocka, blocka

Choppas on eavesdroppers
Fuck these choppas, I’m about it

Metal jacket, automatic magazines, head-on traffic
Fenders smashin', windows crashin'
Pants saggin', fuck your fashion
Yeah, a nigga run Manhattan
Back in Cali's where it happen

And all around the world
Going back to Cali

She don’t wanna waste time on a lame nigga
I don’t wanna waste time 'cause I’m Lanez, nigga
Yeah, I got so many hoes
So many though that lil nigga get cash
See the whip vroom and I’m in the back
Blink your eye, see the whip ride, call it whiplash, ah
I don’t got no time for hoes, they ain’t got no time for me
But if I tell a bitch put that work in, I bet she’d grind for free
What I'm tryna to say is no time to waste so don’t fuck around
So live inside of this moment, girl and just fuck me now

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
Shawty I ain’t playin', nah

Oh she said alright, can you be my driver?
And if I drive that pussy wild then she gon' be my rider
So I said alright, I’ma be your driver
And if I drive that pussy wild then she gon' be my rider
So I said alright, I’mma be yo driver
And if I drive that pussy wild then she gon' be my rider

[Verse 2: Roscoe Dash]
Pull up in the parkin' lot
Don’t give a fuck if it was dark or not

Probably pay her car note and her tuition too
Her lil pussy and her ass in critical
Condition when I finished from replenished
She was sayin' it never happen
Back at it, clap-clappin'
Fuck it let them bitches hate on it
Probably work they whole life just to pay for it
Got a booty so big, sit a cake on it
Any other nigga gotta wait on it
But a nigga like me don’t need to plate for it
And I ain’t know it
So when I ride by I don’t even say nothin'
She be smilin' 'cause she love a nigga style
So I’m the only she let drive around, I'm like

Tory: Yeah, yeah, good for fuckin' me. Aight?
Lucille: I'm not tryna knock your house off. I'ma let you do you but I just don't feel right
Tory: You trippin' Lucille

[Verse 1]
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
We jumped, never asking why
We kissed, I fell under your spell
A love no one could deny

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't you ever say I just walked away
I will always want you
I can't live a lie, running for my life
I will always want you

[Chorus]
I came in like a wrecking ball
I never hit so hard in love
All I wanted was to break your walls
All you ever did was wreck me
Yeah, you, you wreck me

[Verse 2]
I put you high up in the sky
And now, you're not coming down
It slowly turned, you let me burn
And now, we're ashes on the ground

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't you ever say I just walked away
I will always want you
I can't live a lie, running for my life
I will always want you

[Chorus]
I came in like a wrecking ball
I never hit so hard in love
All I wanted was to break your walls
All you ever did was wreck me
I came in like a wrecking ball
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
Left me crashing in a blazing fall
All you ever did was wreck me
Yeah, you, you wreck me

[Bridge]
I never meant to start a war
I just wanted you to let me in
And instead of using force
I guess I should've let you win
I never meant to start a war
I just wanted you to let me in
I guess I should've let you win

[Interlude]
Don't you ever say I just walked away
I will always want you

[Chorus]
I came in like a wrecking ball
I never hit so hard in love
All I wanted was to break your walls
All you ever did was wreck me
I came in like a wrecking ball
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
Left me crashing in a blazing fall
All you ever did was wreck me
Yeah, you, you wreck me
Yeah, you, you wreck me

[Verse 1]
If I needed someone to love
You're the one that I'd be thinking of
If I needed someone

[Verse 2]
If I had some more time to spend
Then I guess I'd be with you my friend
If I needed someone

[Bridge]
Had you come some other day
Then it might not have been like this
But you see now I'm too much in love

[Verse 3]
Carve your number on my wall
And maybe you will get a call from me
If I needed someone
Ah, ah, ah, ah

[Verse 4]
If I had some more time to spend
Then I guess I'd be with you my friend
If I needed someone

[Bridge]
Had you come some other day
Then it might not have been like this
But you see now I'm too much in love

[Verse 3]
Carve your number on my wall
And maybe you will get a call from me
If I needed someone
Ah, ah

[Intro]
(One, two, three, four)
(Bye)

[Verse 1]
We're Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
We hope you have enjoyed the show
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
We're sorry but it's time to go
Sgt. Pepper's lonely, Sgt. Pepper's lonely
Sgt. Pepper's lonely, Sgt. Pepper's lonely

[Verse 2]
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
We'd like to thank you once again
Sgt. Pepper's one and only Lonely Hearts Club Band
It's getting very near the end
Sgt. Pepper's lonely, Sgt. Pepper's lonely
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
(Woo)

[Verse]
The sun is fading away
That's the end of the day
As the June light turns to moonlight
I'll be on my way

Just one kiss and I'll go
Don't hide the tears that don't show
As the June light turns to moonlight
I'll be on my way

[Pre-Chorus]
To where the winds don't blow
And golden rivers flow
This way will I go

[Chorus]
They were right I was wrong
True love didn't last long
As the June light turns to moonlight
I'll be on my way hey

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
And these days with the world getting colder
She spends more time sleeping over
Than I planned

Tonight we're gonna order in
Drinking wine and watching CNN
It's dark, I know
But then again
It's the brightest thing I've got

[Chorus]
When I'm covered in rain, rain
When I'm covered in rain, rain, rain, rain

[Verse 2]
From fireworks to fireplaces
Summer stole what fall replaces
And now, and now we're people watching
All the people, people watching us right back now
Standing by the missing signs
At the CVS, by the checkout line
She puts her quiet hands in mine
Cause she's the brightest thing I got

[Chorus]
Oh, I'm covered in rain
Oh, I'm covered in rain
Oh, I'm covered in rain

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
And come December Lydia left
She mentioned something about it being for the best
And I can't say I disagree
And it's killing me

And now I'm standing facing west
Tracing my fingers around a silhouette
I haven't gotten used to yet
But it's the brightest thing I got

[Outro]
When I'm covered in rain

[Intro]
Up until one century ago there lived
In the Zi Duang province of an eastern country
A glass-like spider
Having devoured its prey
It would drape the skeletons over its web
In weeks creating a macabre shrine of remains
Its web was also unique, in that it had many layers
Like floors in a building
At the top of this palace-like place
Assembled with almost apparent care
Were tiny, shining objects
Glass, beads, dewdrops
One could almost call it an altar
When the breeze blew through this construction
It produced sounds of wailing, crying
Tiny wails, tiny cries
The baby spiders would get scared
And search frantically for their mother
But the glass spider would have long gone
Having known that the babies
Would survive somehow on their own
Oh, the glass spider had blue eyes almost like a human's
They shed tears at the wintered turn of the centuries

[Verse 1]
Don't you hear this wasted cry, life is over you
(Mommy come back because the water's all gone)
But you've seen who's in Heaven, is there anyone in Hell?
Mommy come back because it's dark now
(Oh-hoho-oh)
(Oh-hoho-oh)

[Verse 2]
Take care, take care
(Mommy come back  because the water's all gone)
Somewhere she glows divine, somewhere she wakes alone
But you, you've promised in your loving eye
God it's dark now
(Mommy come back because it's dark now)
(Ja ja ja ja ja)
(Ja ja ja ja ja)
(Ja ja ja ja ja)

[Verse 3]
Gone, Gone the water's all gone
(Mommy come back 'cause the water's all gone)
Stay low on the ground
The fire can drive you, savage and afraid
Spitting the dawn, come along before the animals awake
(Gone, gone, the water's all gone)
(Mommy come back because it's dark now)
Run, run, we've been moving all night, rivers to the left
If your mama don't love ya' then the riverbed might
Gone, gone, the water's all gone
(Mommy come back 'cause the water's all gone)
(Ja ja ja ja ja)
(Ja ja ja ja ja)

[Bridge]
Gone gone the water's all gone
Mommy come back 'cause the water's all gone
Gone gone the water's all gone
Mommy come back 'cause the water's all gone
Gone gone the water's all gone
Mommy come back 'cause the water's all gone

[Outro]
Mommy come back because it's dark now
(Oh-hoho-oh)
(Oh-hoho-oh)
Mommy come back 'cause the water's all gone
(Ja ja ja ja ja)
(Ja ja ja ja ja)
Mommy come back because it's dark now
(Ja ja ja ja ja)
(Ja ja ja ja ja)
Mommy come back 'cause the water's all gone
(Ja ja ja ja ja)
(Ja ja ja ja ja)
Mommy come back because it's dark now
(Ja ja ja ja ja)
(Ja ja ja ja ja)
(Oh-hoho-oh)
(Oh-hoho-oh)

[Hook]

[Verse 1]
Some of us turn off the lights and we live
With the moonlight shooting by
Some of us scare ourselves to death in the dark
To be where the angels fly
Pretty maids all in a row lined up
Outside my cabin door
I've never wanted any of them wanting me
Except the girl from the Red River Shore

[Verse 2]
Well, I sat by her side and for a while I tried
To make that girl my wife
She gave me her best advice and she said
Go home and lead a quiet life
Well, I been to the east and I been to the west
And I been out where the black winds roar
Somehow though I never did get that far
With the girl from the Red River Shore

[Verse 3]
Well, I knew when I first laid eyes on her
I could never be free
One look at her and I knew right away
She should always be with me
Well, the dream dried up a long time ago
Don't know where it is anymore
True to life, true to me
Was the girl from the Red River Shore

[Verse 4]
Well, I'm wearing the cloak of misery
And I've tasted jilted love
And the frozen smile upon my face
Fits me like a glove
Well, I can't escape from those memories
Of the one that I'll always adore
All those nights, when I lay in the arms
Of the girl from the Red River Shore

[Verse 5]
Well, we're living in the shadows of a fading past
Trapped in the fires of time
I'd tried not to ever hurt anybody
And to stay out of a life of crime
And when it's all been said and done
I never did know the score
One more day is another day away
From the girl from the Red River Shore

[Verse 6]
Well, I'm a stranger here in a strange land
But I know this is where I belong
I'll ramble and gamble for the one I love
And the hills will give me a song
Though nothing looks familiar to me
I know I've stayed here before
Once, a thousand nights ago
With the girl from the Red River Shore

[Verse 7]
Well, I went back to see about her once
Went back to straighten it out
Everybody that I talked to had seen us there
Said they didn't know who I was talking about
Well, the sun went down on me a long time ago
I had to go back from the door
I wish I could have spent every hour of my life
With the girl from the Red River Shore

[Verse 8]
Now I heard of a guy who lived a long time ago
A man full of sorrow and strife
That if someone around him died and was dead
He knew how to bring 'em on back to life
Well, I don't know what kind of language he used
Or if they do that kind of thing anymore
Sometimes I think nobody saw me here at all
Except the girl from the Red River Shore

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Now this shit's about to kick off, this party looks wack
Let's take it back to straight hip-hop and start it from scratch
I'm 'bout to bloody this track up, everybody get back
That's why my pen needs a pad, 'cause my rhymes on the rag
Just like I did with addiction, I'm 'bout to kick it
Like a magician, critics I turn to crickets
Got 'em still on the fence whether to picket
But quick to get it impaled when I tell 'em, "Stick it!"
So sick, I'm looking pale—wait, that's my pigment
'Bout to go ham, ya bish, shout out to Kendrick
Let's bring it back to that vintage Slim, bitch!
The art of MCing mixed with da Vinci and MC Ren
And I don't mean Stimpy's friend, bitch
Been Public Enemy since you thought PE was gym, bitch

[Pre-Chorus: Eminem]
Kick your shoes off, let your hair down
(And go berserk) All night long
Grow your beard out, just weird out
(And go berserk) All night long

[Chorus 1: Eminem & Billy Squier]
We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud
'Cause it's mayhem 'til the A.M
So, baby, make just like K-Fed
And let yourself go, let yourself go
Say, "Fuck it!" before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
So everybody, everybody (Go berserk)
Grab your vial, yeah

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Guess it's just the way that I'm dressed, ain't it?
Khakis pressed, Nike shoes crispy and fresh laced
So I guess it ain't that aftershave
Or cologne that made 'em just faint
Plus I showed up with a coat fresher than wet paint
So if love is a chess game, check mate
But girl, your body's bangin', jump me in, dang, bang-bang
Yes siree 'Bob', I was thinking the same thang
So come get on this Kid's rock, baw with da baw, dang-dang
Pow-p-p-p-pow, chica, pow, chica, wow-wow
Got your gal blowin' up a valve, v-v-valve-valve
Ain't slowin' it down, throw in the towel, t-t-towel-towel
Dumb it down, I don't know how, huh-huh, how-how
At least I know that I don't know
Question is, are you bozos smart enough to feel stupid?
Hope so, now ho

[Pre-Chorus: Eminem]
Kick your shoes off, let your hair down
(And go berserk) All night long
Grow your beard out, just weird out
(And go berserk) All night long

[Chorus 2: Eminem & Billy Squier]
We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud
'Cause it's mayhem 'til the A.M
So crank the bass up like crazy
And let yourself go, let yourself go
Say, "Fuck it!" before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
So everybody, everybody (Go berzerk)
Get your vinyls

[Scratch]

[Verse 3: Eminem]
And they say that love is powerful as cough syrup in styrofoam
All I know is I fell asleep and woke up in that Monte Carlo
With the ugly Kardashian, Lamar, oh
Sorry, yo—we done both set the bar low
Far as hard drugs are though, that's the past
But I done did enough codeine to knock Future into tomorrow
And girl, I ain't got no money to borrow
But I am tryin' to find a way to get you alone: car note
Oh, Marshall Mathers
Shithead with a potty mouth, get the bar of soap lathered
Kangol's and Carheartless Cargos
Girl, you're fixin' to get your heart broke
Don't be absurd, ma'am, you birdbrain, baby
I ain't called anybody baby since Birdman, unless you're a swallow (Ha-ha!)
Word, Rick? (Word, man, you heard)
But don't get discouraged, girl
This is your jam, unless you got toe jam

[Pre-Chorus: Eminem]
Kick your shoes off, let your hair down
(And go berserk) All night long
Grow your beard out, just weird out
(And go berserk) All night long

[Chorus 1: Eminem & Billy Squier]
We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud
'Cause it's mayhem 'til the A.M
So, baby, make just like K-Fed
And let yourself go, let yourself go
Say, "Fuck it!" before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
So everybody, everybody (Go berserk)
Grab your vial, yeah

[Chorus 2: Eminem & Billy Squier]
We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud
'Cause it's mayhem 'til the A.M
So crank the bass up like crazy
And let yourself go, let yourself go
Say, "Fuck it!" before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
So everybody, everybody (Go berzerk)
Get your vials

We've been friends for oh so long
I let you share what's mine
When you mess with the girl I love
It's time to draw the line

[Chorus]
Keep your hands (Keep your hands) off my baby
Ain't gonna tell you but a-one more time
Oh, keep your hands (Keep your hands) off my baby
Boy, you get it through your head
That girl is mine

[Verse 2]
I don't mind if you lend my clothes
But you will be in touch
There is something that you get straight
There's one thing you don't touch

[Chorus]
Keep your hands (Keep your hands) off my baby
Ain't gonna tell you but a-one more time
Oh, keep your hands (Keep your hands) off my baby

Ain't gonna tell you but a-one more time
Oh, keep your hands (Keep your hands) off my baby

You better watch yourself now
Boy, you get it through your head
That girl is mine

[Verse 1]
My love don't give me presents
I know that she's no peasant
Only ever has to give me
Love forever and forever
My love don't give me presents
Turn me on when I get lonely
People tell me that she's only
Fooling, I know she isn't

[Verse 2]
She don't give the boys the eye
She hates to see me cry
She is happy just to hear me
Say that I will never leave her
She don't give boys the eye
She will never make me jealous
Gives me all her time as well as
Loving, don't ask me why

[Bridge]
She's a woman who understands
She's a woman who loves her man

[Verse 1]
My love don't give me presents
I know that she's no peasant
Only ever has to give me

My love don't give me presents
Turn me on when I get lonely
People tell me that she's only
Fooling, I know she isn't

She's a woman
She's a woman
She's a woman
She's a woman
She's a woman

[Intro]

A bad little kid moved into my neighborhood
He won't do nothing right, just sitting down and looks so good
He don't want to go to school and learn to read and write
Just sits around the house and plays the rock and roll music all night
Well, he put some tacks on teacher's chair
Puts chewing gum in little girl's hair
Now, junior, behave yourself

Buy every rock and roll book on the magazine stand
Every dime that he gets (oh) is lost to the jukebox man
Well he worries his teacher till at night she's ready to poop
From rocking and a-rolling to spinning in a hula hoop
Well this rock and roll has got to stop
Junior's head is hard as rock
Now, junior, behave yourself

Ooh!

[Bridge]
Ooh!

Gonna tell your mama you better do what she said
Get to the barber shop and get that hair cut off your head
Shoot the canary and you fed it to the neighbor's cat
You gave the cocker spaniel a bath in mother's laundromat
Well, in mama's head it's got to stop
Junior's head is hard as rock
Now, junior, behave yourself

[Outro]

We all miss you; You miss them?
Yeah!
The Beatles miss you; all the Beatles missed you
Now, junior, behave yourself

[Verse 1]
You tell lies thinkin' I can't see
You can't cry 'cause you're laughing at me

[Chorus]
I'm down (I'm really down)
I'm down (Down on the ground)
I'm down (I'm really down)
How can you laugh when you know I'm down?
(How can you laugh?) When you know I'm down?

[Verse 2]
Man buys ring, woman throws it away
Same old thing happen every day

[Chorus]
I'm down (I'm really down)
I'm down (Down on the ground)
I'm down (I'm really down)
How can you laugh when you know I'm down?
(How can you laugh?) When you know I'm down?

[Guitar solo]

[Verse 3]
We're all alone and there nobody else
You still moan, "Keep your hands to yourself!"

[Chorus]
I'm down (I'm really down)
Oh baby, I'm down (Down on the ground)
I'm down (I'm really down)
How can you laugh when you know I'm down?
(How can you laugh?) When you know I'm down?
Wow! Baby, I'm down

[Chorus]
Oh baby, you know I'm down (I'm really down)
Oh yes, I'm down (I'm really down)

Oh baby, I'm down
I'm down, down, down, down, down, down

[Verse]
Without going out of my door
I can know all things on Earth
Without looking out of my window
I could know the ways of Heaven
The farther one travels
The less one knows
The less one really knows

[Verse]
Without going out of your door
You can know all things on Earth
Without looking out of your window
You could know the ways of Heaven
The farther one travels
The less one knows
The less one really knows

[Outro]
Arrive without travelling
See all without looking
Do all without doing

[Intro]
Aah!

[Verse 1]
You say you want a revolution
Well, you know
We'd all love to change the world
You tell me that it's evolution
Well, you know
We'd all love to change the world

[Pre-Chorus 1]
But when you talk about destruction
Don't you know that you can count me out

[Chorus]
Don't you know it's gonna be alright?
(Don't you know it's gonna be) Alright
(Don't you know it's gonna be) Alright

[Verse 2]
You say you got a real solution
Well, you know
We'd all love to see the plan
(Oh, shooby-doo-wah, oh, shooby-doo-wah)
You ask me for a contribution
Well, you know
We're all doing what we can
(Oh, shooby-doo-wah, oh, shooby-doo-wah)

[Pre-Chorus 2]
But if you want money for people with minds that hate
All I can tell you is, brother, you have to wait

[Chorus]
Don't you know it's gonna be alright?
(Don't you know it's gonna be) Alright
(Don't you know it's gonna be) Alright

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
You say you'll change the constitution
Well, you know
We all love to change your head
(Shooby-doo-wah, oh, shooby-doo-wah)
You tell me it's the institution
Well, you know
You better free your mind instead
(Shooby-doo-wah, oh, shooby-doo-wah)

[Pre-Chorus 3]
But if you go carrying pictures of Chairman Mao
You ain't going to make it with anyone anyhow

[Chorus]
Don't you know it's gonna be
Alright
Alright
Alright

[Outro]
Alright, alright
Alright, alright
Alright, alright
Alright, alright!

[Verse 1]
I want a love that's right
But right is only half of what's wrong
I want a short haired girl
Who sometimes wears it twice as long

[Chorus 1]
Now I'm stepping out this old brown shoe
Baby, I'm in love with you
I'm so glad you came here
It won't be the same now, I'm telling you

[Verse 2]
You know you pick me up
From where some try to drag me down
And when I see your smile
Replacing every thoughtless frown

[Chorus 2]
Got me escaping from this zoo
Baby, I'm in love with you
I'm so glad you came here
It won't be the same now when I'm with you

[Bridge]
If I grow up I'll be a singer
Wearing rings on every finger
Not worrying what they or you say
I'll live and love and maybe someday
Who knows, baby, you may comfort me, hey

[Instrumental Verse]

[Bridge]
I may appear to be imperfect
My love is something you can't reject
I'm changing faster than the weather
If you and me should get together
Who knows, baby, you may comfort me

[Verse 3]
I want that love of yours
To miss that love is something I'd hate
I'll make an early start
I'm making sure that I'm not late, hey

[Chorus 3]
For your sweet top lip I'm in the queue
Baby, I'm in love with you
I'm so glad you came here
It won't be the same now when I'm with you

[Outro]
I'm so glad you came here
It won't be the same now when I'm with you
Yeah, yeah, yeah

You know who loves you
You know who loves you
You know who loves you
You know who loves you

You know who loves you
You know who loves you
You know who loves you
You know who loves you
You know who loves you

[Speech]

[Brian Matthew] Before we hear another song, fellows, there is a few things I'd like to ask you. First of all, do you ever get tired of being Beatles?

[John, Paul, George, and Ringo] (Comedic yawning)

[Paul] We don't think so, really

[Brian] You don't ever think that?

[Paul] Just occasionally, you get cheesed off with people writing rubbish about you, which you get often

[John] Yeah, I agree with that. I've had a divorce and half a dozen kids

[Brian] Now, what do you, eh--

[Paul] (Laughs)

[Brian] --well, I mean, doesn't, isn't this a big sort of drag to go around explaining to your wife that you're not divorced and all that sort of things?

[John] No, she knows I'm not divorced, because I keep seeing her every day, you see

[Brian] Yes, a point, but what about the simpler things of life, like, eh"

[Paul] Like riding on a bus?

[Brian] Yeah, or going to just about any restaurant you--

[Paul] Well, yeah, you miss those sort of things

[John] We go to certain ones

[George] And we go to ones where the people there are so snobby, they're the type who pretend they don't know us, so we have a good time, because they pretend they don't know us

[Paul] Joe's CafAc!

[Brian] Yeah, that figures

[Paul] Joe's CafAc! Social statement, that, you know

[George] It is

[Chorus]
Well, I got a woman way cross town
She's good to me, oh ho yeah
Said I got a woman way cross town
She's good to me, oh yeah

[Verse 1]
She gives me money every time I need
Yes, you know she's a kind of friend indeed
Said I got a woman way cross town
She's good to me, oh ho yeah

She says she loves me early in the morning
Just for me, oh ho yeah
She says she loves me early in the morning
Just for me, oh yeah

She says she loves me just for me, yeah
You know she loves me so tenderly
Said I got a woman way cross town
She's good to me, oh yeah
Ow!
She's there to love me
All day and night
Never grumbles or fusses
Just treats me right
Never running in the streets
Leave me alone
She knows a woman's place
Is right back there with her hanging around the home

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Well, she's my baby, don't you understand
That I, I, I, I, I'm her loving man
Said I got a woman way cross town
She's good to me, oh ho yeah

Well, that much is alright
Well, that much is alright

[Outro]
I got a woman
Way cross town
She's good to me
Oh ho ho yeah

[Verse 1]
Running to and fro, hard
Working at the mail
Never fail
Get the mail
Yeah, some rotten deal
Ow!

[Chorus]
Too much monkey business
Too much monkey business
Too much monkey business for me to invite them again

[Verse 2]
Say me
Talking to me
Tryin' to run me up a creek
She used to buy one
Try to pay me again next week
Ow!

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Long-haired, good-looking
Trying to get me hooked
Or me to marry
Settle down
Get the horn by the bull
Ow!

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
Mediocre money
Being fighting in the hall
Army bunk, army go
Army chow, army cook
Ow!

[Chorus]

[Verse 5]
Same thing every day
Getting up, going to school
No need to make complaining
My objection's overruled
Ow!

[Chorus]

[Verse 6]
Working in the filling station
Too many tires
Wipe the windows
Check the tire
Check the oil and all the gas
Ow!

[Chorus]
Too much monkey business
Too much monkey business
Don't want your moderation, get away, leave me

[Verse 1]
I saw her standing on the corner (Yip yip boom)
A yellow ribbon in her hair (Yip yip boom)
I couldn't stop myself from calling
Well look a-there, look a-there
Wow look a-there, well look a-there
Young blood, young blood, young blood
I can't get you out of my mind

[Verse 2]
I took one look and I was fractured (Yip yip boom)
I tried to walk but I was lame (Yip yip boom)
I tried to talk but I just stuttered
Well what's your name, what's your name
Well what's your name, well what's your name
Young blood, ah young blood, young blood
I can't get you out of my mind

[Verse 3]
A crazy stop, she was the top
I tried to follow her all the way home
Things went bad, I met her dad
He said, "You'd better leave my daughter alone"
Ow!

[Verse 4]
Well I tried to speak but I just stuttered (Yip yip boom)
I saw the rising of the sun (Yip yip boom)
And all along my heart was falling
While you're the one, you're the one
While you're the one, ah you're the one
Young blood, oh young blood, yeah young blood
I can't get you out of my mind
Yeah young blood, oh young blood, yeah young blood
I can't get you out of my mind

[Verse]
Well, if your hands start a-clapping
And your fingers start a-popping
And your feet start a-moving around

And if you start to swing and sway
When the band starts to play
A real cool way out sound

And if you get to can't help it
And you can't sit down
You feel like you gotta move a round

[Chorus 1]
You get a shot of rhythm and blues
With just a little rock and roll on the side
Just for good measure

[Chorus 2]
Get a pair of dancing shoes
Well, with your lover by your side
Don't you know you're going to have a lot of pleasure?

[Chorus 3]
Don't you worry about a thing if you start to dance and sing
And chills coming up on you
And if the rhythm finally gets you and the beat gets you too
Well, here's something for you to do

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 3]

[Chorus 2]
Get a shot of rhythm and blues
Get a pair of dancing shoes
Get a shot of rhythm and blues
Well, with your lover by your side
Don't you know you're going to have a lot of pleasure?

[Chorus 3]

[Verse]
I'm sure to fall, fall in love
I'm sure to fall in love with you
You are so sweet and so near
I'm sure to fall in love with you

[Pre-Chorus]
So hold me tight
Let tonight be the night
Darling don't ever let me go

[Chorus]
Loving you is the natural thing to do
I want you for the rest of my life

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Some other guy now, has taken my love away from me, oh now
Some other guy now, has taken away my sweet desire, oh now
Some other guy now, I just don't want to hold my hand, oh now
I'm the lonely one, as lonely as I can feel all right

[Verse 2]
Some other guy now, is sipping up the honey like a yellow dog, oh now
Some other guy now, has taken my love just like I'm gone, oh now
Some other guy now, has taken my love away from me, oh now
I'm the lonely one, as lonely as I can feel all right
Oh oh hoho
Oh yeah! Ow! Ow!

[Verse 3]
Some other guy, is making me very very mad, oh now
Some other guy now, is making my past seem oh so bad, oh now
Some other guy now, she was the first girl I ever had, oh now
I'm the lonely one, as lonely as I can feel all right
Oh oh hoho
I'm a-talking to you, right now
Ow!

[Outro]
Hey! Yeah!

[Speech]

[Lee Peters] Next number was called "Sha La La La La La"

[John] You're joking!

[Lee] No?

[Paul] La?

[Lee] Ah, but, in fact, "Baby It's You"

[John] Why don't you do it in your famous James Mason impersonation voice?

[Lee] Ha, ha

[All] All right! Go on, man! Do it in your

[Lee] I thought this next number was called one "Sha La La La La La," but, in fact, "Baby It's You"

Well, that's alright, Mama
That's alright with you
Yeah, that's alright now, Mama
Just anyway you do
That's alright, that's alright
That's alright my Mama, anyway you do

[Verse 1]
Well Mama, she done told me
Poppa done told me too
Said, "Son, that girl you're fooling with
She is no girl for you"
That's alright, that's alright
That's alright my Mama, anyway you do. Woh

Well, I'm leaving town, baby
I'm leaving town for sure
Then you won't be bothered with me

Hanging around your door
That's alright, that's alright
Yeah that's alright my Mama, anyway you do

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Ya da di dididi
Ya da di dididi
Ya da di dididi, I need your loving
That's alright, that's alright my Mama, anyway you do
Yeah, that's alright my Mama, anyway you do

[Chorus]
Oh Carol, don't let him
Steal your heart away
Well I've got to learn to dance
If it takes me all night and day

[Verse 1]
Well come into my machine
So we can move on out
I know a jumping little joint
Where we can jump and shout
It's not too far back on the highway
Not too long a ride
Well you take your car along
And you park it outside
A little cutie takes your hat
And you can thank her, ma'am
Well every time you're going to drive
You find the joint is jammed

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Well if you want to hear some music
Like the boys all play
Hold tight, tap your foot
Don't let it carry you away
Don't let the heat overcome you
Because they play so loud
While the music will treat you
When they get a crowd
Well you can dance
I know you will, you thought
I got my eyes on you baby
Because you dance so good

Don't let him
Steal your heart away
I've got to learn to dance
If it takes me all night and day
Well I've got to learn to dance
If it takes you all night and day

[Chorus]
Lay down your arms (Soldier of love)
And surrender to me (Sha la, la)
Lay down your arms (Soldier of love)
And love me peacefully (Sha la, la) yeah (Sha la la)
Use your arms for loving me
Baby, that's the way it's got to be (Ooh)

[Verse 1]
There is no reason for you to declare
War on the one that loves you so
So forget the other boys because my love is real
Come off your battlefield

[Chorus]
Lay down your arms (Soldier of love)
And love me peacefully (Sha la, la)
Lay down your arms (Soldier of love)
And love me tenderly (Sha la, la) yeah (Sha la la)
Use your arms to hold me tight
Baby, I don't want to fight no more (Ooh)

[Verse 2]
The weapons you're using are hurting me bad
But someday you're going to see
That my love for you baby, is the truest you've ever had
A Soldier of Love, that's hard to be

[Chorus]
Lay down your arms (Soldier of love)
And love me peacefully (Sha la, la)
Lay down your arms (Soldier of love)
And surrender to me (Sha la, la) yeah (Sha la la)
Use your arms to squeeze and please because I'm the one that loves you so
(Yeah, soldier of love) Baby, lay down your arms
(Yeah, soldier of love) Baby, lay down your arms
(Yeah, yeah) (fade out)

[Speech]

[Rodney Burke] Now, for the final number, John's got a card in his hand with a little rhyme on it. What is it?

[John] It's from the form up a third at Hemel Hempstead

[Rodney] Oh!

[John] It says, "Dear George, John, Ringo, Paul, here's hoping that you'll please us all
A beauty song and swinging voice, we leave it up to you, the choice
We think you're fab and really cool, so brighten up our lads at school"
Dig this, for here's Paul, whistling "Clarabella"

[Verse 1]
Well, I got a baby crazy for me
Yeah, I got a baby won't let me be
Who, baby baby, Clarabella

I'm going to love you more and more every day
I'm going to love you more and more every day
And if you ever say goodbye
And if you ever even try

[Pre-Chorus]
Going to tell your mama
Tell your papa, too
So they'll know exactly
Just what I'm going to do

[Chorus]
If you ever say goodbye
If you ever even try
I'm going to sit right down and cry over you
Oh, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Verse]
Crying, waiting, hoping you'll come back
I just can't seem to get you off my mind
Crying, waiting, hoping you'll come back
You're the one I love, I think about you all the time

[Chorus] 

[x2]
Crying, do do do do, tear keep a falling all night long
Waiting, do do do do, it seems so useless I know it's wrong
Keep a crying, waiting, hoping you'll come back
Maybe someday soon it'll change and you'll be mine

[Speech]

[Brian Matthew] But despite the fact that the next request comes from Anton, 32
Perry Road, Sherwood, in Nottingham, it's headed "Up the Pool" and starts
"Dear Wack!" So, John, you take it from there

[John] "Dear Wack! Please, ask those gorgeous lads," ha, ha," called the Beatles
To sing 'You Really Got a Hold on Me' for Di, Gus, Wizz, and me, also for the

Orbison Tour. I'm a regular listener of 'Pop Go the Beatles,'" good lad, "and
Please, tell the boys that all the girls in our office think it is a fab show
Thank you"

Going to sing for us?

[Brian Matthew] The next few minutes, we're in the lap of the gods and the hands of the Beatles In my young days, when I was a lad, they used to have actors in films and now that they--

[Paul] Yes?

[John] Hey! Listen!

[Paul] It's all changed, now, Brian They're not doing that, no actors

[John] It's all changed, now

[Brian] But this is what I wonder In those days, the actors used to say their best bits were left on the cutting room floor, did you find that?

[John] No, no, no, those were the good bits in the film You should have seen the rest

[Verse 2]

[Brian] Yes?

[John] Rubbish!

[Brian] Was it, really?

[John] Even worse, yes

[Brian] Who was worst?

[John] Oh, Paul

[Brian] I see

[Paul] I think John was about the worst

[John] No, it was you

[Verse 3]

[Paul] Oh, Ringo was very good, he was, he's a good lad

[Brian] He was. They're saying he's a new Charlie Chaplin Do you think that's right?

[John] He was miming

[Paul] You, too, with Jason

[John] Oh, yes, he's an old one. Okay, Ring?

[Brian] Beginning to look like that Now, then--

[Ringo] All right, John. Can you hear me?

[Verse 4]

[Paul] Can you hear him? Hello!

[Brian] Not really I hope not I hope not!

[John] We brought you the flowers, Ring

[Brian] He's not allowed to talk

[Ringo] Eh?

[John] We brought you the flowers

[Verse 5]

[Ringo] Oh, good

[John] And the grapes

[Ringo] Oh, I like grapes

[Paul] He likes grapes

[George] We've been to Portugal

[Brian] Guess who's, guess who's top of the pops in Portugal, then

[Verse 6]

[All] Who?

[Brian] Os Beatles

[John] Los Beatles? Great, great laugh

[Brian] Ridiculous, Os Beatles

[Brian] I don't suppose you know the title of your film in Portuguese?

[John] No Crinsk dee Night?

[Brian] Could be, let's hear the number, shall we?

[John] Right

[Verse 1]

[Brian Matthew] Is that it? Is that the end?

[Paul] Yeah, yeah, that's it

[John] Fade, fade!

[Brian] Good track Oh, well, we'll stop there, stop there, stop there

[Verse 2]

[John] What an end!

[Brian] Quiet! All right, George

[John] Fade!

[Brian] Hold it!

[George] Oh, thank you

[John] Fade, you silly

[Verse 3]

[Brian] Well, we did We did that Oh, no! No! We've done that bit!

[John] The train comes in now

[Brian] We did that

[John] Yeah

[Verse 4]

[Brian] To prove we weren't playing the record, then, you see 'Cause, otherwise, there's no point in you being here, is there? Ha, ha, ha!

[John] Yeah, we did that, 'cause it sounds just like it, don't it?

[Brian] Pretty cool lot of fellows, aren't you? Here, Ringo, have a banana, catch!

[Verse 1]

[Alan Freeman] George, is it true you're a connoisseur of the classics?

[George] No, it's just a rumor

[Alan] It's just a rumor

[George] A rumor, mmm

[Verse 2]

[Alan] Do you enjoy singing Beethoven?

[George] No, been singing it for 28 years now, y'know

[Alan] For how long?

[George] 28 years

[Alan] That's incredible, could you manage one more performance?

[George] Um, possibly

[Alan] Oh go on, say yes

[George] Yes. Thank you

[Verse]
I never knew that a day like today lay before us
I've got the sun in my heart and my heart's in the sun
The skys are as bright as your eyes the horizon is open
Love is the ceiling feeling are reeling free as the air

[Chorus]
Forever on and forever
Forever on side by side
Whoever knew that we too could be free as we fancied
Fancy is free but are we who are bound to each other by love
To each other by love

[Chorus]
Whoever knew that we too could be free as we fancied
Fancy is free but we are who are bound to each other by love
To each other by love
To each other by love
To each other by love

[Verse 1]
Deep down in Louisiana
Close to New Orleans
Way back up in the woods
Among the evergreens
There stand a country cabin
Made of clay and wood
Where lives a young country boy
Named Johnny B. Goode
He never learned
To read or write a book so well
But he could play his guitar
Just like a-ringing a bell

[Chorus]
Go go, go Johnny go go go!
Go Johnny go go go!
Go Johnny go go go!
Go Johnny go go go!
Aah Johnny B. Goode!

[Verse 2]
He used to carry his guitar
In a gunny sack
Sit beneath the trees
By the railroad track
Oh sitting and a-playing
In the shade
Drumming to the rhythm
That the drivers made
People passing by
Used to stop and say
My oh my
That country boy can play

[Chorus]
Go go, go Johnny go go go!
Go Johnny go go go!
Go Johnny go go go!
Go Johnny go go go!
Aah Johnny B. Goode!

[Verse 3]
Well his mama told him
Someday you will be a man
And you will be the leader
Of a big old band
Many people coming
From miles around
To hear you play your music
Till the sun goes down
Maybe some day
Your name will be in light
Saying Johnny B. Goode tonight!

[Chorus]
Go go, go Johnny go go go!
Go Johnny go go go!
Go Johnny go go go!
Go Johnny go go go!
Aah Johnny B. Goode!

[Verse 1]
Long distance information
Give me Memphis, Tennessee
Try to find the party
Trying to get in touch with me
She would not leave her number
But I know who placed the call
Because my uncle took the message
And he wrote it on the wall

[Verse 2]
Help me, information
Get in touch with my Marie
She's the only one who'd phone me here
From Memphis, Tennessee
Her home is on the south side
Just beyond the ridge
Just a half a mile
From the Mississippi Bridge

[Verse 3]
Help me, information
More than that I cannot add
Only that I miss her
And all the fun we had
We were pulled apart
Because her mom would not agree
Help me get in touch with her
In Memphis, Tennessee

[Verse 4]
The last time I saw Marie
She was waving me goodbye
With hurry home drops on her cheek
That trickled from her eyes
Marie is only six years old
Information please
Help me get in touch with her
In Memphis, Tennessee

[Verse 1]
They're really rocking in Boston
Philadelphia, PA
Deep in the heart of Texas
On down in Frisco Bay
All over Saint Louis
On down to New Orleans
All the cats want to dance with
Sweet little sixteen

[Verse 2]
Sweet little sixteen
She just got to have
About half a million
Framed autographs
Her wallet is filled with pictures
She get them one by one
Becomes so excited
Watch and look at her run boy who
Mommy mommy
Please may I go
It's such a sight to see
Somebody steal the show
Oh daddy daddy
I beg of you
Well please say it to mommy
It's all right with you
Ow!

[Verse 3]
Sweet little sixteen
She's got the grown-up blues
Tight dresses and lipstick
She's blowing high healed shoes
Well by tomorrow morning
She'll have to change her train
Become sweet sixteen
A back in class again

[Verse 4]
Yea cos they're really rocking in Boston
Philadelphia, PA
Deep in the heart of Texas
On down in Frisco Bay
All over Saint Louis
On down to New Orleans
All the cats want to dance with
Sweet little sixteen

[Chorus 1]
Oh baby baby baby
Blues and sorrow
And I love you tomorrow
Just suit you just fine
Oh baby baby baby
Blues and sorrow
And I love you tomorrow
Just suit you just fine

[Chorus 2]
I can't forget that you told me
So many promising lies
How must I forget these
Lonesome tears in my eyes?

[Chorus 3]
You've broken my heart
Gonna do it again
And I can't forget
The spell that I'm in
Can't forget that you told me
So many promising lies
I'm a-trying to forget these
Lonesome tears in my eyes

[Chorus 3]

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Verse 1: George Harrison]
I found it out, what love is all about
And every day, it sure lets out
I see my baby, I get weak in the knees
'Cause nothin's shakin' but the leaves on the tree
My papi told me there'd be times like these
There's nothin' shakin' but the leaves on the trees

[Verse 2: George Harrison]
We meet the gang and go to rockin' Joe's
The cats are something on the heels and toes
I grab my baby, tried to give her a squeeze
There's nothin' shakin' but the leaves on the trees
Well why must she be such a dog-gone tease?
There's nothin' shakin' but the leaves on the trees

[Pre-Chorus: George Harrison]
She's got a way that makes me act like a fool
Spent my money, then she plays me cool
I'm beggin' for her kisses on a bended knee
Oh, won't you give me some-a lovin', baby
Please, please, please

[Chorus: George Harrison]
Though I keep trying hard to make her mine
One day the wind will blow, the sun will shine
Till that time, she puts my heart at ease
There's nothin' shakin' but the leaves on the trees
She locked my heart and threw away the keys
There's nothin' shakin' but the leaves on the trees, yeah

[Guitar Solo: George Harrison]

[Pre-Chorus: George Harrison]
She's got a way that makes me act like a fool
Spent my money, then she plays me cool
I'm beggin' for her kisses on a bended knee
Oh, won't you give me some-a lovin', baby
Please, please, please

[Chorus: George Harrison]
Though I keep trying hard to make her mine
One day the wind will blow, the sun will shine
Till that time, she puts my heart at ease
There's nothin' shakin' but the leaves on the trees
She locked my heart and threw away the keys
There's nothin' shakin' but the leaves on the trees
There's nothin' shakin' but the leaves on the trees
There's nothin' shakin' but the leaves on the trees
There's nothin' shakin' but the leaves on the trees

[Verse 1]
For goodness sake
I got the hippy hippy shake

Well now you shake it to the left
Shake it to the right
Do the hippy shake shake

[Verse]
Ah Lucille
Baby satisfy my soul
Ah Lucille

Well you know I love baby

Babe I woke up this morning
Lucille was not inside
I asked her friends about her
But all their lips were tight
Lucille
Please come back where you belong
Well I'm talking to you baby
I'll never put you on
Aaaah! Wah!

[Chorus]

[Chorus 1]
A friend says that your love won't mean a lot
And you know that your love is all you've got
At times things are so fine, and at times they're not
But when she says she loves you, that means a lot

[Chorus 2]
A friend says that a love is never true
But you know this can't apply to you
A touch can mean so much when it's all you've got
And when she says she loves you, that means a lot

[Verse]
Love can be deep inside
Love can be suicide
Can't you see you can't hide what you feel
When it's real?

[Chorus 3]
A friend says that your love won't mean a lot
But you know that your love is all you've got
A touch can mean so much when it's all you've got
But when she says she loves you, that means a lot

[Outro]
Can't you see, yeah
Can't you see, yeah
Can't you see, yeah
Can't you see, yeah
Can't you see, yeah
Can't you see, yeah
Can't you see, yeah
Can't you see, yeah

[Speech]

[Paul] Yes?

[Alan] Now, listen

[Paul] Yes?

[Alan] Are you singing?

[Paul] Mmm

[Alan] Do you have any particular idol that you've ever copied your singing style from?

[John] What about my book?

[Alan] John, go away

[John] What about my

[Paul] Used to be sort of influenced by Elvis in the old days, I think

[Alan] Really?

[Paul] Yeah, used to love him

[John] What about my book, then?

[Paul] Chuck Berry, Chuck Berry, Carl Perkins, and, eh, Marvin Gaye and things
Can't really sing like them, you know. I like them, though love them

[John] What about it?

[Alan] Paul, what about singing "Till There Was You"?

[Verse 1]
It's getting late, have you seen my mates?
Ma, tell me when the boys get here
It's seven o'clock and I wanna rock
Wanna get a belly full of beer
My old man's drunker than a barrel full of monkeys
And my old lady, she don't care
My sister looks cute in her braces and boots
A handful of grease in her hair

[Chorus]
Oh, don't give us none of your aggravation
We had it with your discipline
Oh, Saturday night's alright for fighting
Get a little action in
Get about as oiled as a diesel train
Gonna set this dance alight
'Cause Saturday night's the night I like
Saturday night's alright, alright, alright, ooh

[Verse 2]
Well, they're packed pretty tight in here tonight
I'm looking for a dolly who'll see me right
I may use a little muscle to get what I need
I may sink a little drink and shout out, "She's with me!"
A couple of the sounds that I really like
Are the sounds of a switchblade and a motorbike
I'm a juvenile product of the working class
Whose best friend floats in the bottom of a glass

[Chorus]
Oh, don't give us none of your aggravation
We had it with your discipline
Saturday night's alright for fighting
Get a little action in
Get about as oiled as a diesel train
Gonna set this dance alight
'Cause Saturday night's the night I like
Saturday night's alright, alright, alright, ooh

[Guitar break]

[Chorus]
Oh, don't give us none of your aggravation
We had it with your discipline
'Cause Saturday night's alright for fighting
Get a little action in
Get about as oiled as a diesel train
Gonna set this dance alight
'Cause Saturday night's the night I like
Saturday night's alright, alright, alright, ooh

[Outro]
Saturday! Saturday! Saturday!
Saturday! Saturday! Saturday!
Saturday! Saturday! Saturday night's alright
Saturday! Saturday! Saturday!
Saturday! Saturday! Saturday!
Saturday! Saturday! Saturday night's alright
Saturday! Saturday! Saturday!
Saturday! Saturday! Saturday!
Saturday! Saturday! Saturday night's alright, whoo

[Intro]
Ooh, oh
Oh, yeah, mmmm

[Verse 1]
A hundred and five is the number that comes to my head
When I think of all the years I want to be with you
Wake up every morning with you in my bed
That's precisely what I plan to do

[Pre-Chorus]
And you know one of these days when I get my money right
Buy you everything and show you all of the finer things in life
We'll forever be in love so there ain't no need to rush
But one day I won't be able to ask you loud enough

[Chorus]
I'll say will you marry me?
I swear that I will mean it
I'll say will you marry me?
Singing, oh-woah
Oh, oh-woah
Oh-woah
Oh, yeah

[Verse 2]
How many girls in the world could make me feel like this?
Baby, I don't ever plan to find out
The more I look, the more I find the reasons why
You're the love of my life

[Pre-Chorus]
You know one of these days when I get my money right
Buy you everything and show you all of the finer things in life
We'll forever be in love so there ain't no need to rush
But one day I won't be able to ask you loud enough

[Chorus]
I'll say will you marry me?
I swear that I will mean it
I'll say will you marry me?

[Bridge]
And if I lost everything
In my heart it means nothing
'Cause I have you, girl, I have you
To get right down on bended knee
Nothing else would ever be better, better
The day when I

[Chorus]
I'll say will you marry me?
I swear that I will mean it
I'll say will you marry me? (Yeah)
I'll say will you marry me? (The day I get on my knees)
I swear that I will mean it
I'll say will you marry me? (And what you do to me, baby?)
Got me singing, oh-woah
Got me singing, oh-woah
Would you marry me, baby? Oh-woah
Oh-woah (ayy)
Oh-woah (yeah)

[Outro]
A hundred and five is the number that comes to my head
When I think of all the years I want to be with you
Wake up every morning with you in my bed
That's precisely what I plan to do

[Intro]
I'm talkin' money, I'm talkin'
She if ever found me, know she got a down nigga, huh

[Verse 1]
I told her love me, or love me
I'm gone pitchin' this drink and I'm on bitches
I'ma need more than just a hook and a song bitches
To get mami off and let me hit all of her on switches
Fuck it, I'm gone 'cause really we ain't got to much in common
'Cept fuckin' and bein' honest enough to say that we want it
I want a lover, really I want to love her
Sincerely, she want to love me but fear that I'm on another
Niggas that want to fuck wit' her, tell her I'll fucking duck her
But I tell her baby I'm on the road, with 20k for a show, wassup
Don't get mad if I tell you that I'm gone
We can fuck, be friends and live on, Swavey

[Pre-Chorus]
And if I hit you up in the summertime
Know you down to ride, I ain't got the time
I ain't tryna waste your time, baby
I got somethin' on my mind, maybe

[Chorus]
We can fuck and be friends
We can fuck and be friends

[Verse 2]
Uh, she love me and gettin' money wit' a nigga
And even though we fuckin', she ain't fuckin' wit' a nigga
'Cause when I get up in it, it ain't nothin' to a nigga
She know the money galore, been fuckin' honeys on tour
She fuck wit' a boy, I love her like cooked meals
And them heels swollen, she rollin' like good wheels
I be that nigga stroking away that is your feel
And I call it manslaughter the way that them looks kill, girl
Uh, I'm only fuckin' if it's worth it
But if it's worth me, I'm only fuckin' if she perfect
A real nigga really know what's up
And yeah, my wrist chilly, got these chicks in the celly
Ho, what's up?

[Pre-Chorus]
And if I hit you up in the summertime
Know you down to ride, I ain't got the time
I ain't tryna waste your time, baby
I got somethin' on my mind, maybe

[Chorus]
We can fuck and be friends
We can fuck and be friends
We can fuck and be friends
We can fuck and be friends

[Chorus: John Lennon]
Free as a bird
It's the next best thing to be
Free as a bird
Home, home and dry
Like a homing bird I'll fly
As a bird on wings

[Bridge: Paul McCartney]
Whatever happened to
The life that we once knew?
Can we really live without each other?
Where did we lose the touch
That seemed to mean so much?
It always made me feel so

[Chorus: John Lennon]
Free as a bird
It's the next best thing to be
Free as a bird
Home, home and dry
Like a homing bird I'll fly
As a bird on wings

[Bridge: George Harrison]
Whatever happened to
The life that we once knew?
Always made me feel so free

Ah
Ah
Ah

[Verse 2]
Free as a bird
It's the next best thing to be
Free as a bird
Free as a bird
Free as a bird
Oooooo

[Outro]
Free

Made for John Lennon

[Verse 1]
Does he fuck you right?
He don't make you feel like I used to
He can't do your body the way that I do
Oh, never that
Your new nigga, he ain't me and now you'll see
I made you, look how a nigga made you

[Chorus]
Made you never wanna fuck with nobody else
Doing 95 on your body, babe
Ain't no one can rock with your body, babe
I'm going 95 on your body, babe
Made you never wanna fuck with nobody else
Doing 95 on your body, babe
Ain't no one can rock with your body, babe
I'm going 95 on your body, babe

[Verse 2]
He don't know your body
The way that I know it goes down
You don't feel how
How you felt, when we go, when we go down
And though it's no more now
I think it's fucked up how

[Chorus]
I made you never wanna fuck with nobody else
Doing 95 on your body, babe
Ain't no one can rock with your body, babe
I'm going 95 on your body, babe
Made you never wanna fuck with nobody else
Doing 95 on your body, babe
Ain't no one can rock with your body, babe
I'm going 95 on your body, babe

[Verse 3]
Uh, heard you goin' back to that college
I acknowledge the fact that I'm back
Blowin' this pack of this loud, flowin' this factual shit
Shit, I know that you gon' hear it, but fuck it, I'm gone
In my spirit like
Lines for my lamp page and time for these moments
When I ain't got time for 'em, I been tryna get my shine
So even though we was fuckin', it wasn't nothin' but time, I'm lyin'
Gettin' mine is hard, but shit I'm tryin', I'm fine
She don't need me and time is helpin' her leave me
So I don't want nothin' from her, for her, shit is crazy
We came from sayin' that we would be makin' babies
To blatantly sayin' daily how much that you fuckin' hate me
And I ain't got no time for them bitches, dawg
Ain't no nigga hit your mind like I did it, dawg
You and your nigga, y'all don't grind like we did it, dawg
I fuck your body and your mind 95 on this road, ayo, stop, uh

[Chorus]
I made you never wanna fuck with nobody else
Doing 95 on your body, babe
Ain't no one can rock with your body, babe
I'm going 95 on your body, babe
Made you never wanna fuck with nobody else
Doing 95 on your body, babe
Ain't no one can rock with your body, babe
I'm going 95 on your body, babe

Are coming up in a beat up car
Spitting up a lift of candy bar

Splitting up a bag of potato chips
I think cool cats really did flip
Three cool chicks

Man, do you see what I see?"

I hope it's me and love love love
So I hope there'll come a day
When you'll say, "Mm you're my little girl"

I suppose that you think you're very smart
But won't you tell me how do you do it?

[Chorus 1]
How do you do what you do to me?
I wish I knew
Wish I knew how you do it to me
But I haven't a clue
Wish I knew how you do it to me
I'd do it to you
Wish I knew how you do it to me
I'd do it to you

[Verse]
Lend me your comb
It's time to go home
I got to confess
My hair is a mess

Your mammie will scold
Your pappie will shout
Unless we come in
The way we went out

[Pre-Chorus]
Kissing you was fun honey
But thanks for the date
But I must come to run honey
But you know baby it's getting late

[Chorus]
Just wait till I
Straighten my tie
Lend me your comb
We got to go home
Whoa! Ow!

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
We were sailing along (Twist and shout)
On Moonlight Bay (Ooh)
We could hear the voices singing (I like it!)
They seemed to say (Keep on, Bongo)
You have broken my heart (Oh, twist and shout)
So go away

(Are the Beatles gone?
No, they're here
Oh)

[Verse 2]
With you big, far, hairy legs
On Moonlight Bay
On Moonlight Bay

I like to be with you every hour of the day

[Chorus]
So if you want me just like I need you
You know what to do

I watched you walking by, and you looked alone
I hope that you won't mind if I walk you back home

You better leave my kitten all alone
You better leave my kitten all alone
But I told you big fat bulldog
You better leave her alone

You better leave my kitten all alone
You better leave my kitten all alone
This dog is going to get you
If you don't leave her alone

[Chorus]
Well, Mister Dog, I'm going to hit you
On the top of your head
That child is going to miss you
You're going to wish that you were dead
If you don't leave my kitten all alone
Well I told you big fat bulldog
You better leave her alone

[Bridge]
Alright
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey

[Chorus]

[Outro]

You better leave, yeah you better leave
You better leave, oh you got to leave
Hey hey, well I told you big fat bulldog

[Verse 1]
All my little plans and schemes
Lost like some forgotten dreams
Seems that all I really was doing
Was waiting for you

Just like little girls and boys
Playing with their little toys
Seems like all they really were doing
Was waiting for love

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Don't need to be alone
No need to be alone

[Chorus 1]
It's real love
It's real
Yes, it's real love
It's real

[Piano interlude]

[Verse 2]
From this moment on I know
Exactly where my life will go
Seems that all I really was doing
Was waiting for love

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Don't need to be afraid
No need to be afraid

[Chorus 2]
It's real love
It's real
Yes, it's real love
It's real

[Guitar solo: George Harrison]

[Verse 3]
Thought I'd been in love before
But in my heart, I wanted more
Seems like all I really was doing
Was waiting for you

[Pre-Chorus 3]
Don't need to be alone
Don't need to be alone

[Chorus 3]
It's real love, it's real
It's real love, it's real
Yes it's real love, it's real
It's real love, it's real

Yes it's real love, it's real
It's real love, it's real

Ah, ah
The shop window
Why why, says the sign
In the yard
Buy buy, says the sign
In the shop window
Why why, says the junk
In the yard
I'm a charger
That charges through the night
Like an orange bolt of lightning
Passing everything in sight
I'm the best pal the Duke boys' ever had
I'm thunder on the highway looking bad, bad, bad

I'm a knight
Like the kind in shining armor
With my polished body gleaming
I'm a fighter and a charmer
If trouble comes your way just ask for me
My friends all know me as the General Lee

I'm the General Lee
A piston pumpin' steel belted cavalry
I'll never let you down when you're riding with me
Buckle up and I'll show you what I mean
Take a look back there
Sirens blowing red lights flashing everywhere
We'll cross the field and we'll be runnin' free
They'll eat dust with compliments of me
The General Lee
I'm a hero
And that's how I'll make you feel
When you're riding shotgun with me
And the law is at your heels
I'm glory bound and when the chase is done
I'll take off through the mountains and have fun, fun, fun

I've got style
Tearing through the curves
With my flag waving proudly to the people that I serve
I'm number 1 and I'll always be
The pride of the South they call the General Lee

I'm the General Lee
A piston pumpin' steel belted cavalry
I'll never let you down when you're riding with me
Buckle up and I'll show you what I mean
Take a look back there
Sirens blowing red lights flashing everywhere
I'll jump that pond and we'll be running free
And they'll go swimming compliments of me
The General Lee
The General Lee
General Lee

[Verse 1]
Not guilty
For getting in your way, while you try to steal the day

I'm really sorry for your aging head, but like you heard me said

[Verse 2]

Though you signing me a writ, while I'm trying to do my bit
I don't expect to take your heart I only want what I can get

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Not guilty
For looking like a freak, making friends with every Sikh

For leading you astray on the road to Mandalay
I won't upset the apple cart I only want what I can get
I'm really sorry that you've been mislead, but like you heard me said
Not guilty

This is the story
About a boy named Ted
If his mother said (Said)
"Ted, be good (Be good, Ted)," he would (Alright)

She told him tales
About his soldier dad
But it made her sad
Then she cried, oh my

[Pre-Chorus: Paul McCartney]
Ted used to tell her
He'd be twice as good
And he knew he could
Because in his head he said
"Mummy don't worry
Your mblmblmbl's here
Taking good care of you
Mama don't worry
Your Teddy boy's here
Teddy's going to see you through"

[Chorus]
And she said
"Teddy don't worry
Your mummy's here
Taking good care of you"
She said, "Teddy don't worry
Your mummy's here
Teddy's going to see you through"

He said, "Ta da da"

[Verse 2]
Then came the day
She found herself a man
Teddy turned and ran
Oh far away, oh yeah

He couldn't stand
Just to be around
So he left the town far away, yeah yeah

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus] 

[x2]

[Verse 3: John Lennon]
Take your partners
And do-si-do
Hold them tight
And don't let go
When you've got it. Jump up
Take your partners
And do-si-do
When you got it
Then let it go
Hold them tight then

Now Ted used to tell her
He'd be twice as good
And he knew he could
Because in his head, he said

[Hook]
I could write you a song to make you fall in love
I would already have you right under my arm
I used up all of my  tricks, I hope that you like this
But, you probably won't, you think you're cooler than me
You got designer shades just to hide your face
And you wear 'em around like you're cooler than me
And you never say hey, or remember my name
And it's probably cause you think you're cooler than me

[Verse 1]
You got your high brow, shoes on your feet
And you wear 'em around like it ain't (neat)
But you don't know the way that you look
When your steps make that much noise...shh
I got you all figured out
You need everyone's eyes just to feel seen
Behind your makeup nobody knows who you even are
Who do you think that you are ?

[Hook]
If I could write you a song to make you fall in love

And you wear 'em around like you're cooler than me
And you never say hey, or remember my name
And it's probably cause you think you're cooler than me

[Verse 2]
You got your high brow, switchin' your walk
And you don't even look when you pass by
But you don't know the way that you look
When your steps make that much noise...shh
I got you all figured out
You need everyone's eyes just to feel seen
Behind your makeup nobody knows who you even are
Who do you think that you are?

Cause it's your scene, (it's your scene)
You got no doubt
But we all see
You got your head in the clouds

[Hook]
If I could write you a song to make you fall in love
I would already have you right under my arm

[Intro]
I don't care if I spent my dough
'Night I'm gonna be one happy soul

[Verse 1]
Going to rock it up
Going to shake it up
Going to roll it up
Have them ball tonight

Rattle and roll
I said shake rattle and roll
Well you never done nothing
To save your doggone soul

Well get out of that kitchen
And shake those pots and pans
I said get out of that kitchen
And shake those pots and pans
I said to my soul:
You're the devil in a frying pan
Well I said shake rattle and roll
I said shake rattle and roll
I said shake rattle and roll
I said shake rattle and roll
Well you never done nothing
To save your doggone soul

You can knock me down
Slap my face
Slander my name
All over the place
Do anything that you want to do
But oh oh honey
Lay off of them shoes

[Chorus]
Now don't you step
On my blue suede shoes
Well you can do anything
But lay off of them blue suede shoes

Ah go!

[Verse 2]
You can burn my house
Steal my car
Drink my liquor
From an old fruit jar
Do anything
That you want to do
But ah ah honey
Lay off of them shoes

[Chorus]

Ah go, hit it, Carl!

[Verse 3]
Well blue blue
Blue suede shoes
Yeah blue blue
Blue suede shoes
Babe blue blue
Blue suede shoes
Yeah brown brown
Brown suede boots
Well do anything
But lay off of them blue suede shoes

[Verse 1]
Sunrise doesn't last all morning
A cloudburst doesn't last all day
Seems my love is up
And has left you with no warning
But it's not always going to be this grey

[Chorus]
All things must pass
All things must pass away

[Verse 2]
Sunset doesn't last all evening
A mind can blow those clouds away
After all this my love is up
And must be leaving
It has not always been this grey

[Chorus]
All things must pass
All things must pass away

[Bridge]
All things must pass
None of life's strings can last
So I must be on my way
And face another day

[Verse 3]
Now the darkness only stays at nighttime
In the morning it will fade away
Daylight is good
At arriving at the right time
It's not always going to be this grey

[Chorus]
All things must pass
All things must pass away
All things must pass
All things must pass away

[Verse]
She wrote me only one sad night
Told me she's no longer mine
Sue sue mailman, that will do for sometime

[Chorus]

Mailman, bring me no more blues
Mailman, bring me no more blues
One more heartache is all I can use

Red light

[Engineer]
Demo take one

[Verse 1]
If you want it, here it is
Come and get it
Make your mind up fast

[Verse 2]
If you want it, any time
I can give it
But you better hurry because it may not last

[Chorus]
Did I hear you say that there must be a catch?
Will you walk away from a fool and his money?

[Verse 3]
If you want it, here it is
Come and get it
But you better hurry because it's going fast

[Verse 1]
If you want it, here it is
Come and get it
Make your mind up fast

Sonny, if you want it, here it is
Come and get it
But you'd better hurry because it's going fast
You'd better hurry because it's going fast

Woo, fool and his money

[Outro]
Sonny, if you want it, here it is
Come and get it
But you'd better hurry because it's going fast
You'd better hurry because it's going fast
You'd better hurry because it's going fast

[Verse 1]
I'm sorry that your dad is dead
I hope you amend it
I think I've lost a lot of my friends
Through belief that I'm an instrument
Well fuck me if you must then
Treat me like an old friend
I can't exist within my own head
So I insist on haunting your bed
If you could only hear what I said
You'd see

[Chorus]
I'm not scared (Anymore, no)
I'm not scared
I'm not scared
I'm not scared
I'm not scared
I'm not scared

[Verse 2]
Spin car 'round, push your head down, down, down
And smash into the ground with you
There's been a piece of glass found and a terrible sound, sound
What if what they're saying is true?
Oh, I prefer it in your bed; television set

[Chorus]
I'm not scared
I'm not scared
I'm not scared
I'm not scared
I'm not scared
I'm not scared

[Verse 1]
I have no doubt about it
This must be love
One little kiss from you
And I feel glad all over
Ooh baby, hot dang gilly
It's silly
But I'm glad all over

[Verse 2]
Yeah the goose pimples baby
Because I feel so good
When you call me like you do
And I feel glad all over
Ooh mercy, I'm rock gone puppy
And I'm happy
And I'm glad all over

[Verse 3]
Your touch sewed me
Like an electric wire
Never thought of make love
It don't take much looking
To see what I've got
But it shows, yes it shows
Come on honey Bonnie
Give me one more time
Every time you do
Well I feel glad all over
Ooh baby, hot dang gilly
It's silly
But I'm glad all over
Yeah!

[Verse 4]
Tried to tell you
How I'm cooking inside
When we're cheek to cheek
My temperature is low
Fever is high
I can't speak
I'm too weak

[Verse 5]
Well come on honey Bonnie
Give me one more time
Every time you do
Well I feel glad all over
Ooh baby, hot dang gilly
It's silly
But I'm glad all over
Hot dang gilly
It's silly
But I'm glad all over
Well, hot dang gilly
It's silly
But I'm glad all over

[Chorus 1]
Well you call me your baby
When you hold in my hand
But the way that you hurt me
I just don't understand

[Verse]
Well you say that you need me
Like an ocean needs sand
But the way you deceive me
I just don't understand

[Chorus 2] 

[x2]
Well you know that I love you
More than anyone can
But a one-sided love
I just don't understand

[Chorus 1]

[Intro]
They say that everyone wants someone
So how come no one wants me
And they say that eveyone needs someone
So how come no one needs me

[Chorus] 

[x2]
Well if you wonder who the loneliest creatures in the world can be
Well they're the ugly duckling, the little black sheep, and me
Uh huh
They say that everyone loves someone
So how come no one loves me

[Speech]

[Lee Peters] But now, John has his work cut out on the next one
As he takes his guitar on and off his neck and pulls the harmonica in and out of his face

[John] Harp. It's a harp

[Lee] What? Harp?

[John] The harp. Because I'm playing the harp on this one

[Lee] Playing the harp?

[John] Harmonica I play on "Love Me Do," harp, on this one, little goes in the orange

[Lee] But it goes in and out? Do you want to do this announcement?
Well, go on, you go ahead, no, it's all right. Tell them. Tell them about the next song

[John] Oh, er, we'd like to carry on with Chuck Berry's "I Got to Find My Baby"
Don't know where she's been, pardon, hello? Love these goon shows

[Verse 1]
I'm gonna search this town
From door to door
Love I crave
I can't find no more

[Chorus]
I gotta find my baby
I declare that ain't no lie
I ain't had no real good loving
Since that woman said goodbye

[Verse 2]
You know I hate to see the sun
Sinking to the west
'Cause I know my whole life's
Gonna be one solid mess

[Chorus]
I gotta find my baby
I declare that ain't no lie
I ain't had no real good loving
Since that woman said goodbye

[Verse 3]
Well ever since the day
That she said we were through
I've been nervous
And shook up too

[Chorus]
I gotta find my baby
I declare that ain't no lie
I ain't had no real good loving
Since that woman said goodbye

[Verse 4]
Well I don't care if the last thing
I ever do in my life
I wanna find that little woman
Make her my wife

[Chorus]
I gotta find my baby
I declare that ain't no lie
I ain't had no real good loving
Since that woman said goodbye

[Verse 1]
You never wear a stitch of lace
Your powder's never on your face
You're always wearing jeans except on Sunday
So, please, don't ever change
Now, don't you ever change
I kind of like you just the way you are

[Verse 2]
You don't know the latest dance
But when it's time to make romance
Your kisses let me know you're not a tomboy
So, please, don't ever change
Now, don't you ever change
Just promise me you're always going to be
As sweet as you are

[Bridge]
I love you when you're happy
I love you when you're blue
I love you when you're mad at me
So, how can I get tired of you?

[Verse 3]
Now, lots of other girls I've seen
They know how to treat guys mean
But you would rather die than ever hurt me
So, please, don't ever change
Now, don't you ever change
Just promise me you're always going to be
As sweet as you are

[Outro]
Please, don't ever change
Don't you ever change
Please, don't ever change
Don't you ever change

[Pre-Chorus: will.i.am]
Watching the world
Watching them all go insane
Look at 'em all
Look at 'em do evil things

[Chorus: will.i.am]
So I go out and dance
Party my problems away
Look at me now
Look at me dancing again
In a club, nothing really matters
In a club, nothing really matters
In a club, nothing really matters
In a club, nothing really matters
But the beat
In a club

[Verse 2: will.i.am]
I rock club light, come out at night
Shot 'til daylight
Hot models, my type
Let's go, take flight
Explode, dynamite
Disco, blacklight
In a club
Party people rocking hardcore in a club
DJ rock the fucking dancefloor in a club
Hot mamas dancing, all alone, in a club
I just came to rock on out, to escape from the world

[Pre-Chorus: will.i.am]
Watching the world (Watching the world)
Watching them all go insane
Look at 'em all (Look at 'em all)
Look at 'em do evil things

[Chorus: will.i.am]
So I go out and dance
Party my problems away
Look at me now (Look at me now)
Look at me dancing again
In a club, nothing really matters
In a club, nothing really matters
In a club, nothing really matters
In a club, nothing really matters
But the beat
In a club

[Verse 4: will.i.am]
Feeling like a star when I walk in the house
DJ spin that record and he burned down the house
Just like MC hammer I'mma turn the motha out
I'mma rock the dance floor, check me out
I am with all my people, we gon' fuck up the place
I was stressed out, so I had to get away
The world is going mad, I think they gone crazy
So I just gotta break on out

[Chorus: will.i.am]
In a club nothing really matters
In a club nothing really matters
In a club nothing really matters
In a club nothing really matters

[Outro: will.i.am]
Drop the beat
Drop the beat
Drop the beat
Drop the beat
Drop the beat

Sex game crazy, we got that chemistry, let's make babies
And this my testimonial, I wanna be alone with you
You are so phenomenal, I wish I had a clone of you
Pictures all in my phone of you, let me park in your garage
When I crank that thing up, you got my back like a massage
And like a Dodge I charge ya, my bills are larger
Her ass is too, salute

[Pre-hook]

[Hook]

Girl, I bet that he be acting all cocky like
Like he deserves you and you so lucky to be with him
Bet he be treating you rude, always got a attitude
Like he's the only dude made for you, woah

[Pre-Chorus]
But I bet he didn't count on, a little nigga like me coming 'round
Giving you things to think about 'cause I know what's up
Since he ain't tryna step it up, don't you think you should give him up?
'Cause he ain't worth the love

[Chorus]
Stop tripping
I know you got a man but, girl, he's slipping
I can see myself getting in where I fit in
I want you to see, just how much your man ain't me 'cause
He ain't fly, he don't even drive
'Cause when you wanna sneak out in the middle of the night, baby, I'm your guy
I might be since he ain't being all that he can be (Yeah)
Baby, please, your man, your man ain't me

[Verse 2]
Girl, I know that you be wishing he was nothing like
Like that playa type and you so lucky to be with him
Wish that he treated you cool and didn't cheat on you
Like you're just another girl in his crew

[Pre-Chorus]
But I bet he didn't count on (Oh) a little nigga like me coming 'round
Giving you things to think about 'cause I know what's up, yeah
Since he ain't tryna step it up, don't you think you should give him up?
'Cause he ain't worth your love, you need to stop tripping

[Chorus]
Stop tripping (Oh)
I know you got a man but, girl, he's slipping (Oh)
I can see myself getting in where I fit in (I can see myself, yeah)
I want you to see, just how much your man ain't me 'cause (I want you to see)
He ain't fly (He ain't fly), he don't even drive (Oh no)
'Cause when you wanna sneak out in the middle of the night, baby, I'm your guy (Oh)
I might be since he ain't being all that he can be (No)
Baby, please, your man, your man ain't me

[Bridge]
Can you see
You and him ain't meant to be together, life with me will be better?
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Yes, just let him leave
You'd be doing yourself a favor
Girl, I'm just tryna save you

[Chorus]
Stop tripping (Oh)
I know you got a man but, girl, he's slipping (And you know I can see it)
I can see myself getting in where I fit in (I can fit in, baby)
I want you to see, just how much your man ain't me 'cause (Oh, oh, oh)
He ain't fly (No no), he don't even drive
'Cause when you wanna sneak out in the middle of the night, baby, I'm your guy (In the middle of the night)

Oh, no, your man ain't me, no, baby

[Verse 1]
Hush up
Don't speak, don't wanna hear another (Not another word from you)
You're just an animal, tryna act real special (But deep down you are just a shrew)

[Pre-Chorus]
Maybe I should have a little more just to stay out of my mind
'Cause it's when I'm not thinking with you that I act like a swine
Act like a swine
Act like a swine

[Chorus]
I know, I know, I know, I know you want me
You're just a pig inside a human body
Squealer, squealer, squeal out, you're so disgusting
You're just a pig inside
Do ya? I know, I know, I know you want me
You're just a pig inside a human body
Squealer, squealer, squeal out, you're so disgusting

[Post-Chorus]
Swine, swine
Swine, swine

[Verse 2]
Be that hog, sweat it out, you squealer (Let your body jiggle)
Slap her skin, he loves to watch your ass go wiggle (It's the thrill of ecstasy)

[Pre-Chorus]
Maybe I should have a little more just to stay out of my mind
'Cause it's when I'm not thinking with you that I act like a swine
Act like a swine
Act like a swine

[Chorus]
I know, I know, I know, I know you want me
You're just a pig inside a human body

[Verse One]
I'm a traveling man
Made a lot of stops, all over the world
But in every part, I own the heart
Of at least one lovely girl
I have a pretty senorita
Waiting for me
When I get back to L.A
And all the girls that I ran through
When I was in Cancun
I still don't know their names

Oh my Georgia peach down in ATL
Calls me everyday
And my Brooklyn girl back in NYC meets me at JFK
Pretty Puerto Rican baby I met at the bar
I remember the time
I left the studio late
But you fixed me a plate
And then you let me spend the night

[Hook]
Ohh I'm a traveling man
Yes I'm a traveling man
Ohh I'm a traveling man

[Verse Two]
I have a Carolina cutie, waiting for me
When I get back from my shows
And she never freaks out whenever she hears 'bout
The groupies on the road

Oh my Georgia peach down in ATL
Calls me everyday
And my Brooklyn girl back in NYC meets me at JFK
Pretty Puerto Rican baby I met at the bar
I remember the time
I left the studio late
But you fixed me a plate
And then you let me spend the night

[Hook]

[Verse Three]
I'm a traveling man, made a lot of stops
All over the world
And in every part, I own the heart of at least one lonely girl

[Hook]
On the response to the line "I’m the king of New York":

It made me go back here and feel like I probably gotta dumb down my lyrics nowadays, for people to take it way out of context the way they did… The main heads that really understood the context of the line was the actual kings of New York, the cats that I sat down with this past week. They’re not understanding that it’s not about the culture, it’s not about what side we on, it’s about being great as Biggie, as Pac, the two cats that I referenced… I feel like I’m a student. I’m a student of the work that they did. When I put down 20 years in the game, I can eventually plant my foot and have that same type of legacy… I never take the history behind what Pac laid or what BIG laid.

On Kendrick’s king of rap, Snoop Dogg:

To keep it 100 with you, Snoop will always be number one, and I’m from the West Coast, and he gave me that. But out of respect for my big homie, I understand it. He laid down. I only got one album out homie. One album out. I got years to be doing this. At the end of the day, Snoop will always be my big homie and the legends that came before me they will always stand tall where they’re at. But I can’t stop myself from wanting to be great just like them.

On East/West rivalry in 2013:

I feel as though you have certain cats that are really gonna take it to the next level and make it a rivalry thing and try to bring back that whole thing. No that’s old school homie. We black men out here trying to uplift the culture. My first sold out show was in New York…I respect the legends in the game. I respect people that done it before me, people that lost their lives over this. Because of what they laid down, I’m gonna try to go ten times harder and breathe it and live it. That’s the point of the whole verse, what I was trying to convey through that verse. All the ignorance behind it, you can kill that noise. It’ll never be like that again, two coast rivalry. Not on my behalf.

[Verse 1]
Don't look at me
It's way too soon to see
What's gonna be
Don't look at me
All my life
I never knew
What I could be, what I could do
Then we were new

[Verse 2]
You came along
And made my life a song
One lucky day
You came along
Just in time
Well I was searching for a rhyme
You came along
Then we were new

[Bridge]
We can do what we want
We can live as we choose
You see there's no guarantee
We got nothing to lose

[Verse 3]
Don't look at me
I can't deny the truth
It's plain to see
Don't look at me
All my life
I never knew
What I could be, what I could do
Then we were new

[Bridge]
We can do what we want
We can live as we choose
You see there's no guarantee
We got nothing to lose

[Verse 4]
Don't look at me
It's way too soon to see
What's gonna be
Don't look at me
All my life
I never knew
What I could be, what I could do
Then we were new

[Outro]
Then we were new
Now we are new

[Verse 1]
If I wasn't who I was, if I wasn't me
Would you stand next to me in the street?
If I changed my hair, would you then me proud?
If I ran around town with a different crowd
Would you be my baby, oh
If I had more money, oh?

[Chorus]
Would that make you love me? Oh
Would that make you love me? Oh
Would that make you love me? Oh
Would that make you love me? Oh

[Verse 2]
If I practiced a different religion
If I spoke my words differently
If I changed my tune to your favorite song
Would you wrap your arms around me?
If I dug down deep to the bottom
Could you love me unconditionally?
If I sound like you and we laugh the same
Would you mind if I hang around?

[Chorus]
Would that make you love me? Oh
Would that make you love me? Oh
Would that make you love me? Oh
Would that make you love me? Oh

[Bridge]
I can't, I can't (Ooh)
I can't, I can't (Love)
I can't, I can't (Me)
I can't make you (Love)
I can't make you (Who)
I can't make you (Who)
I can't make you (Love)

[Verse 3]
If I came to you from a different place
Would my message finally be heard?
If it's just me and you and there's no one else
Would you see how much we're the same?
Could you be my lover? Oh
If I were a different color, oh
Could you be my brother? Oh

[Chorus]
Would that make you love me? Oh
Would that make you love me? Oh
Would that make you love me? Oh
Would that make you love me? Oh
Would that make you love me? Oh
Would that make you love me? Oh
Would that make you love me? Oh
Would that make you love me? Oh
Would that make you love me? Oh
Would that make you love me? Oh
Would that make you love me? Oh
Would that make you love me?

[Verse]
Wizzle man, the fans, the critics know me
Feet sunk in the sand blowing an OZ

And um, I'm the man to these hoes
Promoters paying me grands for my shows Mosley Rose
Fast cars and buying out the bars
Champagne, planes and rock stars
Shawty says she's' half-baked and ready to 'scape to outer space
So I take her to Mars

Amazed on how it's so easily roll
Hate niggas wanna police their hoes

[Hook]
We came to party, we grown
Smoke all this weed and get blown
And meet new people she wanna be free so leave those handcuffs at home
And if she's decide if she's leaving with me
Then let your bitch choose
No need to hate the player just hate the game
You know the rules, fool

[Verse One: Mike Posner]
Standing in the dark with the flashlight
Pretending it's the sun
You've been throwing rocks at the castle
But the king's not at home

[Hook: Mike Posner]
When the walls come tumbling down
Is gonna make it go away
When the walls come tumbling down
Is gonna make it go away
Is gonna make it OK

[Verse One]
Come up to meet you, tell you I'm sorry
You don't know how lovely you are
I had to find you, tell you I need you
Tell you I set you apart
Tell me your secrets and ask me your questions
Oh, let's go back to the start
Running in circles, coming in tales
Heads are a science apart

[Hook]
Nobody said it was easy
It's such a shame for us to part
Nobody said it was easy
No-one ever said it would be this hard
Oh take me back to the start

[Verse Two]
I was just guessing at numbers and figures
Pulling your puzzles apart
Questions of science, science and progress
Don't speak as loud as my heart

[Hook]

I'm going back to the start

Oh, ooooo
Ah, ooooo
Oh, ooooo
Oh, ooooo

[Verse 1]
Open Sesame (We've places to go)
We've people to see (Let's put 'em on hold)
There's all sorts of shapes that I bet you can make
When you want to escape, say the word

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, I know that getting you alone isn't easy to do
With the exception of you, I dislike everyone in the room
And I don't wanna lie, but I don't wanna tell you the truth
Get the sense that you're on the move
And you'll probably be leaving soon, so I'm telling you

[Chorus]
Stop the world 'cause I wanna
Get off with you
Stop the world 'cause I wanna
Get off with you

[Verse 2]
Eyes the colour of (Water left in mud)
Icing sugar dust (Crazy green flashes)
It's a funny thing that I cannot explain
Don't you know the train keeps a-rolling?

[Chorus]
Stop the world 'cause I wanna
Get off with you
Stop the world 'cause I wanna
Get off with you

[Instrumental Break]

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, I know that getting you alone isn't easy to do
And I don't wanna lie, and I don't wanna tell you the truth
And I know we got places to go, we got people to see
Think we both oughta put 'em on hold and I know you agree

[Chorus]
Stop the world 'cause I wanna
Get off with you
Stop the world 'cause I wanna
Get off with you

[Verse 1]
Put some lipstick on
Perfume your neck and slip your high heels on
Rinse and curl your hair
Loosen your hips and get a dress to wear
I'm the one who's been coming 'round
Looking to love in you
You're the medicine, I need to heal
The way you make me feel

[Chorus]
I'm gon' be MANiCURED
You wanna be man cured

[Verse 2]
Touch me in the dark
Put your hands all over my body parts
Throw me on the bed
Squeeze, tease me, please me, that's what I said!
'Cause I'm the trick who's been coming 'round
Looking to love in you
You're the, the medicine
I need to heal the way, the way, the way you make me feel

[Chorus]
I'm gon' be MANiCURED

[Verse 1]
Life of a suburban kid
Existentialism
I ain’t never care much for esoteric shit
He said “I ain’t got no real thoughts”
I could use some adderall in my green tea
Some ice up in my soymilk
I keep an angel on my shoulder, devil in my head
He said...

[Chorus 1]
Violate the bounds of platitude
Violate the bounds of platitude
Who do I do it for? Who do I do it for?
I hope I do it for you
Hope I do it for you

[Verse 2]
Try to fight the numbness
Still don't have an answer
Figure when I die it will make sense
Maybe God will answer
Until then

[Chorus 2]
I'm drowning in this world of platitude
Feel like I'm drowning in this world of platitude
What do I do it for? What do I do it for?
Maybe I do it for you, oh
Baby I do it for you, oh, oh

[Verse 3]
Little red man living my head
Lay around in my dreams
Come alive in my nightmares
Ignore my rambles
Hoping that you hear me
Hoping that I'm heard
If your not careful
I'll take scissors to my mind
I'll take scissors to my mind
Snip snip

[Outro]
N-n-now do it for you
Tell me what you want from me yeah
For you
Tell me what you want from me yeah, yeah
Baby I do it for you
Tell me what you want from me yeah
For you
Tell me what you want from me yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Into the roads, it's open
Bare to your left, my heart sits here
They say my dreaming is hopeless
This is the bed I lie in yeah

I only move for the gut punch
Seeing your pain brings me such joy
Love will only take you
Into the bed you lie in yeah

[Verse]
'Cause I'm me, I'm me, revenge is my thing
Watch em bleed, I like it
Yeah I like it, yeah I like it
Yeah, yeah

Ooh I fell off the truck, out of luck
So perturbed, uh
Ooh pick me off the ground, to be found
Call my name on the loud speaker uhh
Claim me loud enough for me to hear
Oooh, oooh, oooooh

[Chorus]
Into the roads, it's open
Bare to your left, my heart sits here
They say my dreaming is hopeless
This is the bed I lie in yeah

I only move for the gut punch
Seeing your pain brings me such joy
Love will only take you
Into the bed you lie in yeah

[Refrain]
Mmm yeah
Kille come, come, yeah
Kille come, come, yeah
Kille come, come, come, come
Come, come, yeah
Kille come, come
Come, come
Come, come, yeah
Kille come, come, yeah

[Bridge]
This is from the heart this is what we live for
Now back to the cheese the cheese
This is from the heart this is what we live for
Now back to the cheese the cheese
(This is from the heart this is what we live for)
At ease, at ease, at ease, at ease
(This is from the heart this is what we live for)
At ease, at ease, at ease, at ease

[Chorus]
Into the roads, it's open
Bare to your left, my heart sits here
They say my dreaming is hopeless
This is the bed I lie in yeah

I only move for the gut punch
Seeing your pain brings me such joy
Love will only take you
Into the bed you lie in yeah

[Refrain]
Mmm yeah
Kille come, come, yeah
Kille come, come, yeah
Kille come, come, come, come
Come, come, yeah
Kille come, come
Come, come
Come, come, yeah
Kille come, come, yeah

[Intro]
When the sun comes up, you're searching for a love
So your heart won't lead you to anyone
When the sun goes down, I know what you become
You become awake, unlike the rest of us

[Sample]
The afternoon has gently passed me by
The evening spreads its sail against the sky
Waiting for tomorrow
Just another day
As I bid yesterday goodbye

[Verse 1]
I lay my head on a thousand beds
It's been a test to see how far a man
Can go without himself
I think I lost the only piece that held it all in place
Now my madness is the only love I let myself embrace
I could've stayed

[Chorus]
But I chose the lie
I chose the life
Then I realized
She might have been the one
I let it go
For a little fun
I made a trade
Gave away our days
For a little fame
Now I'll never see your face
But it's okay I adapted anyway

[Verse 2]
Adapted to these models
Who's adapted to the bottle
They take it down like water
Just to burn away their sorrows
I'll stay up ‘til tomorrow
Just to tear down all their morals
And all is fair in Love and War
She's pure

[Bridge]
So pure, like the love that's so uncut and raw
And clean, so clean, as opposed to what I offered

[Chorus]
Because I chose the lie
I chose the life
Then I realized
She might have been the one
I let it go
For a little fun
I made a trade
Gave away our days
For a little fame
Now I'll never see your face
But it's okay I adapted anyway

[Bridge 2]
She might just be the one
She might just be the one
She might just be the one
She might just be the one

[Sample]
The afternoon has gently passed me by
The evening spreads its sail against the sky
Waiting for tomorrow
Just another day
God bid yesterday goodbye

[Outro]

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
I'm a dope man, dope man, dope man, dope man
Gucci stay fresh like the dope man, dope man
Everybody holla at the dope man, dope man
Come and spend some dollars with the dope man, dope man

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Yeah I'm the dope man
Something like the Birdman
Ridin' outta town
50 birds in my 'burban
Servin', splurgin'
You could say I'm workin'
Got washing powder
I ain't talkin' 'bout detergent
Young nigga coppin' 9s and 4s
Got me in my trap house
Standin' over the stove
My money long like Pinocchio nose
That's my why trap open early
And the bitch don't close
Man I love the trap
And if my arms were big enough
I would hug the trap
Because I still do the dirt
I'm in the carpool lane
'Cause it's me and my work
I got a trick up my sleeve
Got a 5 grand plate quarter
Brick up my sleeve
Niggas call me the dope man
The whole hood shoppin'
Gucci Mane, I'm the dope man

[Intro]
It's nothin', Prefix, go!
Bitch, my name is Weezy F Baby
And you wanna know what the F is for?
That's cause I stay fresh, I I stay fresh
I stay fresh, yeah I stay fresh
You know I stay fresh, so fresh
I say, ain't I the coolest? Get at me!
My name is Weezy F Baby mu' fucka
And this is The Prefix, know what I'm talkin' 'bout?
Go get that Carter album too when it drops
It's supposed to be June 22nd or something
I don't know, it's up to Universal
But when it do drop, go get that shit
But right now, at this given place and time, I'm tired of you niggas
I need a bed everywhere I go to go to bed every time I hear the bullshit
I'm tired of this shit man, I'm tired of that
It's gon' be real fucked up when I get sick and tired of you niggas
I'mma throw up on one of you boys
How would you like that, huh?
Get trashbags for you, cause you're garbage

[Verse 1]
It's your boy Weezy, from Hollygrove I'm still loc'in
I'm Mannie fresh from the t-shirt to the Forces
Pink got my feet wet, bitch I'm still soakin'
Steppin' out ashy, I need a little lotion
You niggas funny, you gotta be jokin'
My Glocks speak out and the bullets outspoken
I take a week out on the map of the ocean
Way in the middle of the Atlantic I'm tokin'
Just in case one of these niggas jaws open
I jaws 1-2-3-4 bow him
They say he gotta be seasick, how he spit
Keep kickin' it, but you'll never see my knee bent
They got a 

[?] that I'm deep in
Little niggas I started went off the deep end
But I ain't trippin', I just keep my gun
I got 99 problems and a bitch ain't one
I got 99 partners and a snitch ain't one
I got 99 bitches and I don't love one
My 1999 bitches I been done
In 2000 it was mine, now that's his son
Go Weezy, that's what the freaks say
He like head when he ridin' on the freeway
And them threeways on a weekday
I stopped fuckin' with a girl on her P day
I'm playin', I take you to a whole 'nother land
Get you a Tiffany band
Yo, I got one with a 

[?] band
If you're sick of me stuntin' then I hope you die sufferin'
In the city dolo most of the time
Since a nigga say I want most of the shine
I hit your head really open your mind
Rude boy dreads, I'm red smokin' a pine
I take a bath with your ho and mine
And make a little butter so it go in fine
I flow tough, you can't go with mine
Message to Miss Cita, I'm focused mom

[Hook] x2
If y'all see them boys tonight
Wait 'til they come up out of them lights
Make 'em come up off of that ice
Bring it back to the hood and flip they shit twice

[Verse 2]
Get your shit sliced
Boy, get your ho card swiped
Credit or debit pussy, I decline your life

[?] payin' your pipe I 

[?] Medula
Writin' to Rocafella, protectin' the mozzarella
With the toaster strudel, you niggas is noodles
I'm just tryin' to get my palms on that parmesan
You know the usual, pop smoke and neutral
Cop coke and move, no hustler 'til my boot 

[?]
We are not mutual, we are not pupils
We are not peoples, you are not eagle
You're not Cash Money or Young Money either
You're thinkin' I'mma beat you, I'm thinkin' where should I leave you
I'm legal, respected like a Visa
Kick early game to your bitch like cold pizza
Yeah, I let you know 

[?]
I am a product, 

[?] behind 'em yeah
I'm kinda hot, but she don't mind
You might shoot once, I'll bang 3, 4 times
5, 6, 7-8-9
The 10'll empty it, that's the one that I kill you with
Weezy F Baby flow genuine
The track screamin' just like my bitch, "Boy, you killin' it!"
Weezy F Baby flow genuine
The track screamin' just like my bitch, "Boy, you killin' it!"

[Hook]

[Verse 1]
Arabella's got some interstellar-gator skin boots
And a Helter Skelter 'round her little finger
And I ride it endlessly
She's got a Barbarella silver swimsuit
And when she needs to shelter from reality
She takes a dip in my daydreams

[Chorus]
My days end best when the sunset gets itself behind
That little lady sittin' on the passenger side
It's much less picturesque without her catchin' the light
The horizon tries but it's just not as kind on the eyes
As Arabella, oh
As Arabella

[Post-Chorus]
Just might've tapped into your mind and soul
You can't be sure

[Verse 2]
Arabella's got a '70s head
But she's a modern lover
It's an exploration, she's made of outer space
And her lips are like the galaxy's edge
And her kiss the colour of a constellation
Fallin' into place

[Chorus]
My days end best when the sunset gets itself behind
That little lady sittin' on the passenger side
It's much less picturesque without her catchin' the light
The horizon tries but it's just not as kind on the eyes
As Arabella, oh
As Arabella

[Post-Chorus]
Just might've tapped into your mind and soul
You can't be sure

[Bridge]
(That's magic) In a cheetah print coat
(Just a slip) Underneath it, I hope
(Asking if) I can have one of those
(Organic) Cigarettes that she smokes
(Wraps her lips) 'Round a Mexican Coke
(Makes you wish) That you were the bottle
(Takes a sip) Of your soul, and it sounds like

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
Just might've tapped into your mind and soul
You can't be sure
Go down
Soft sound
Midnight
Car lights
Playing with the air
Breathing in your hair
Go down
Soft sound
Step into your skin?
I'd rather jump in your bones
Taking up your mouth, so you breathe through your nose

[Verse 1]
With a face from a movie scene
Or magazine, know what I mean?
She's definitely got the style on you
She's definitely got the style on you

[Pre-Chorus 1]
She's got two-tone everything
Moving but she just can't move
She's got two phones, everything
Moving but she just can't move

[Chorus]
'Cause she way out
Never seen her dance moves
Dancing like she way out
'Cause she way out
Never seen her talk
But I'm telling you, she way out

[Verse 2]
She said "It's not about your body
It's just social implications are brought upon by this party that we're sitting in
And I'd like to say you've changed but you're always the same
I've got a feeling that the marijuana's rotting your brain"

[Pre-Chorus 2]
She's got two-tone everything, way too intelligent
Moving but she just can't move
She's got two phones, everything
Boyfriend, telling him "Find me 'cause I'll never find you" (Find you)

[Chorus]
'Cause she way out
Never seen her dance moves
Dancing like she way out
'Cause she way out
Never seen her talk
But I'm telling you, she way out (Hey)
'Cause she way out
Never seen her dance moves
Dancing like she way out
'Cause she way out
Never seen her talk
But I'm telling you, she way out

[Bridge]
The tension's overflowing with every Benson she's throwing
On the floor and in my mouth
She said "I'd love you to stay but that's simply insane
I've got a feeling that my friends are gonna kick in your brain"
Because...

[Chorus]
'Cause she way out
Never seen her dance moves
Dancing like she way out
'Cause she way out
Never seen her talk
But I'm telling you, she way out
'Cause she way out
Never seen her dance moves
Dancing like she way out
Oh, because she way out
Never seen her talk
But I'm telling you, she way out

[Outro]
Because she way out
Dancing like she way out
Because she way out
I'm telling you, she way out
Because she way out
Never seen her dance moves
Dancing like she way out
Because she way out
Never seen her talk
But I'm telling you, she way out

[Chorus]
Drink slow to feed the nose, you know he likes to get blown
Has he got enough money to spend?
Leave? No, he's to and fro, he doesn't like it when the girls go
Has he got enough money to spend?

[Verse 1]
It's going off 'cause they're not gonna let him in
Two and a half, the boy is rushing out his skin
He's got his charm with the girls that are smoking
He takes her arm, jumps the bar and now he's in

[Chorus]
Drink slow to feed the nose, you know he likes to get blown
Has he got enough money to spend?
Leave? No, he's to and fro, he doesn't like it when the girls go
Has he got enough money to spend?

[Verse 2]
A broken half a glass has opened up his chin
He thinks he's hard, a powdered mouth that tastes of gin
He's just been barred for that blues he was smoking
And then he barks, "It's my car I'm sleeping in"

[Bridge]
Tabs with unlimited O's
New clothes, bloody nose
Powders and walking back home
Has he got enough weed? No
Broken phone, retching on the floor alone
And I can't believe that we're talking 'bout him

[Verse 3]
"I'm searching you, mate, your jaw's all over the place"
Can't talk, quick slap in the face
Yes, I threw a nut, but your friend's a case
Why you singling him out, is it because of his race?
"Look, the dog won't bark if you don't lark about"

[Outro]
M-O-N-E-Y's me
M-O-N-E-Y
M-O-N-E-Y's me
M-O-N-E-Y
M-O-N-E –
M-O-N-E –
M-O-N-E-Y
M-O-N-E-Y's me
M-O-N-E-Y

[Verse 1]
(Last night) Our lovers' quarrel
(I was thinkin' about you) Hurts more than I can say
(And it was kind of dirty) All night
(And the way that you looked at me)
Help me here (It was kind of nasty, aah!)
Help me here (It was kind of trashy)
'Cause I can't help my mind from going there

[Pre-Chorus]
Heard your boyfriend was away this weekend
Wanna meet at my place?
Heard that we both got nothing to do
When I lay in bed, I touch myself and think of you

[Chorus]
Last night
Damn, you were in my sex dreams (You were in my)
Doing really nasty things (You were in my dreams)
Damn, you were in my sex dreams (You were in my)
Making love in my sex dreams

[Verse 2]
We could be caught (I just want this to be perfect)
We're both convicted criminals of thought ('Cause I'm broken)
Let's white (By the one before)
Glove the bed (He was kind of nasty)
Help me here (And I feel so trashy)
'Cause we can't hide the evidence in our heads

[Pre-Chorus]
Heard your boyfriend was away this weekend
Wanna meet at my place?
Heard that we both got nothing to do (Woo)
When I lay in bed, I touch myself and think of you

[Chorus]
Last night
Damn, you were in my sex dreams (You were in my)
Doing really nasty things (You were in my dreams)
Damn, you were in my sex dreams (You were in my)
Making love in my sex dreams

[Post-Chorus]
Don't stop the party (Making love in my sex dreams)
Let's keep it naughty, yeah (Making love in my sex dreams)
Watch me act a fool (Making love in my sex dreams)
Tomorrow when I run into you, tomorrow when I run into you

[Bridge]
You could turn to stone or the color of men petrified by a woman
In love as I am when I lay with you
I think of him, I think of him

[Interlude]
I can't believe I'm telling you this, but I've had a couple drinks and... oh my God!

[Chorus]
Last night
Damn, you were in my sex dreams (You were in my)
Doing really nasty things (You were in my dreams)
Damn, you were in my sex dreams (You were in my)

[Post-Chorus]
Last night
Don't stop the party (Damn, you were in my sex dreams)
Let's keep it naughty, yeah (Doing really nasty things)
Watch me act a fool (Damn, you were in my sex dreams)
Tomorrow when I run into you (Making love in my sex dreams)

[Verse 1]
The people asking me ''Wayne, what's crackalacking''? I can't kid
I ain't smelling out my ass, mama, I ain't shit
But you can't tell my mama that I ain't the shit
And if you talk about my mama bet I'm all in your shit
All of the things go to my mama cause she brought me in this
And ever since I never miss her, never called in sick
I go to work, I don't quit, mama taught me this
''You go berserk for that crib, baby boy, don't slip''
I'll murk you for them chips and make Frito Lay
I'm trying to come up on the fortress, split it 3-4-ways
Hey - Mama say ''don't let 'em see your page''
Don't let 'em copy you off your paper, let 'em see yo' ok
And you ain't gotta do nothing but be your age
But mama how can I? I will be so paid
She kept me with money, I keep her with money, she like
"Long as you investin' in something," I'm invested in her
I got my weight up

[Verse 2]
Pops passed, I had to get off my ass
Had to put it in little bags and get off my grass
Nigga coming at me sharp my ass
I'm just trying to play my part like Cass', smart like Taz
I used to carry off-white like cash
Now I tote handguns like bags
Ain't too much changed
Still pitch and give 'em a split or a change up
I never up and change, I just get my change up
I'm greasy with the game, Joe Casey gave me, I'm an animal
And niggas hate me like rabies
But niggas taste this and lick nuts like ladies
I get ape quick and hit up like I get
I deflate the game and insert my dick
That mean I fuck the game so fuck the game
I grind to the money, say fuck the game
Man, niggas wonder why I got out, I won the game
I'm a champion

[Verse 3]
And when I got paid I gave back what I owed
So don't be mad when you see me in the Maybach or the Rolls
Making haters taste crack when I'm attacking the roads
Sitting so far back with the seat I'm in the trunk with the coke
You know what's under the seat, I got the Combat 4
Gave a nigga one, bet he don't come back no more
Nope - it's Weezy F and the 'F' is for flow
I spit blood on a track, call me Dracula dough
I get it sacking, act like I came back from coke
Not guilty or Jesus, let rabbit go
Wow, that's my daddy if ya'll ain't know
And I love him with every second my hard day go
Buck - remember when the bullet caught lil' bro?
Who you think got that blood up off that flo'?
Who you think made that boy come off so cold?
How you think that young boy come off so old?
I miss you pops

[Intro]
Ooh ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, la la
Ooh ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, la la

[Verse 1]
You're like Brando on the silver screen
You're my hero in a mythical dream
You are perfect just the way that you are
You're Mike Jordan, you're my superstar

[Chorus]
Ooh la la, you're my superstar
Ooh la la, love the way that you are
Ooh la la, you're my superstar
Ooh la la, that's what you are

[Post-Chorus]
I'm your biggest fan, it's true
Hopelessly attracted to you
You can have the keys to my car
I'll play you a song on my guitar

[Chorus]
Ooh la la, you're my superstar
Ooh la la, love the way that you are
Ooh la la, you're my superstar
Ooh la la, that's what you are

[Interlude]
Ooh ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, la la
Ooh ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, la la

[Verse 2]
You're my gangster, you're like Al Capone
You're like Caesar stepping onto the throne
You're Abe Lincoln, 'cause you fight for what's right
You're my angel, bringing peace to my life

[Chorus]
Ooh la la, you're my superstar
Ooh la la, love the way that you are
Ooh la la, you're my superstar
Ooh la la, that's what you are

[Post-Chorus]
I'm your biggest fan, it's true
Hopelessly attracted to you
You can have the password to my phone
I'll give you a massage when you get home

[Chorus]
Ooh la la, you're my superstar
Ooh la la, love the way that you are
Ooh la la, you're my superstar
Ooh la la, that's what you are

[Bridge]
You're Bruce Lee, with the way that you move
You're Travolta, getting into your groove
You're James Dean, driving in your fast car
You're a hotshot, you're my super-duper star

[Breakdown]
You're my superstar, you're my superstar (Ooh la la, ooh la la)
You're my superstar (Ooh la la, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh la la)

[Post-Chorus]
I'm your biggest fan, it's true
Hopelessly attracted to you
You can have the keys to my car
I'll play you a song on my guitar

[Breakdown]
(Oh-oo-oh-oo ooh) Ooh la la, you're my superstar
(Oh-oo-oh-oo ooh) Ooh la la, love the way that you are
(Oh-oo-oh-oo ooh) Ooh la la, you're my superstar
(Oh-oo-oh-oo ooh) Ooh la la, that's what you are

[Outro]
Ooh la la, ooh la la (Oh-oo-oh-oo ooh)
Ooh la la, you're my superstar
Ooh la la, ooh la la (Oh-oo-oh-oo ooh)
Ooh la la, you're my super, superstar

[Verse 1]
Rushing in a small town
I forgot to call you
Running low on know how
This beat's made for 2

[Pre-Chorus 1]
'Cause I remember that I like you
No matter what I found
Said it's nice to have your friends 'round
We're watching the television with no sound

[Chorus]
It's just you and I, tonight
Why don't you figure my heart out?
It's just you and I, tonight
Why don't you figure my heart out?

[Verse 2]
Push your lack of chest out
Look at my hair
Gotta love the way you love yourself
Your obsession with rocks and brown
And fucking the whole town is a reflection on your mental health

[Pre-Chorus 2]
'Cause I remember when I found you
Much younger than you are now
And once we started having friends 'round
You created a television of your mouth

[Chorus]
It's just you and I, tonight
Why don't you figure my heart out?
It's just you and I, tonight
Why don't you figure my heart out?

[Bridge]
You got something to say?
Why don't you speak it out loud, instead of living in your head?
It's always the same
Why don't you take your heart out, instead of living in your head?

[Chorus]
It's just you and I, tonight
Why don't you figure my heart out?
It's just you and I, tonight
Why don't you figure my heart out?

[Intro]
What you doing man? I'm recording...

Another disappointed soul
Well I tried, I tried to keep it in control
Well I, I will end up on the dole
It's my life, and I'll fall into that goal

And well Blue you've got me on the go
But don't worry, you'll never know
And your eyes, they're never cold
To me, well at least, that's what I've been told

And girl, you made my dreams come true
It’s all a clue, that it was all for you
My self is still waiting in queue
It’s all that I, well all I want to do

I know when I look into the sky
There is no meaning
Girl I’m the only one believing
And that there’s nothing to believe in
I’m dreaming
My aspirations got a ceiling
Well I’m constantly cleaning
The scars of your dealings

And well my guts are on the floor
For you to adore me
And all that I could be
And see, girl, what I say
On the horizon
The skies are grey
The skies are grey

Has this hit?
Has this hit?

See girl I wish it hit
You know I wish it hit
You see I’m tired every night
See things never seem quite right

I’m never fully content
I wish it worked and went well for once
But if you’re a cunt and people are cunts

They pull stunts to stunt your progress
But know it’s slow to digest
The way your insides stress
You’re not blessed
You’re definitely not blessed
I don’t deserve history repeating itself
I always see myself getting picked up and left back on the shelf
Again and again and again and again

You're not my pen
You're my paper
You're not my heart
You're its breaker
You're its breaker
You're its breaker
You're its breaker
You're its breaker

[Verse 1]
A soft sound to the way that she wears her hair down
Covering up her face
And oh, what a letdown
I don't seem to be having any effect now
Falling all over the place

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And you're losing your words
We're speaking in bodies
Avoiding me and talking about you
And you're losing your turn
I guess I'll never learn
'Cause I stay another hour or two

[Chorus]
For crying out loud, settle down!
You know I can't be found with you
We get back to my house
Your hands, my mouth
Now I just stop myself around you

[Verse 2]
A small town dictating all the people we get around
What a familiar face
Do you get what I mean now?
I'm so fixated on the girl with the soft sound
And hair all over the place

[Pre-Chorus 2]
You're sure that I'd learn
I'm pushing through bodies
Avoiding me and walking around you
You're cold and I burn
I guess I'll never learn
'Cause I stay another hour or two

[Chorus]
For crying out loud, settle down
You know I can't be found with you
We get back to my house
Your hands, my mouth
Now I just stop myself around you
(Hey!)

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Verse 1]
A soft sound into the way that she wears her hair down
Covering up her face
And oh, what a letdown
I don't seem to be having any effect now
Falling all over the place

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And you're losing your words
We're speaking in bodies
Avoiding me and talking about you
And you're losing your turn
I guess I'll never learn
'Cause I stay another hour or two

[Chorus]
For crying out loud, settle down!
You know I can't be found with you
We get back to my house
Your hands, my mouth
Now I just stop myself around you
(For crying out loud!)

[Intro]
(Hoo!)
(Hoo!)
Come on, girls!
Do you believe in love?
'Cause I got something to say about it
And it goes something like this

[Chorus]
Don't go for second best, baby
Put your love to the test
You know, you know, you've got to
Make him express how he feels
And maybe then you'll know your love is real

[Verse 1]
You don't need diamond rings
Or eighteen karat gold
Fancy cars that go very fast
You know they never last, no no
What you need is a big strong hand
To lift you to your higher ground
Make you feel like a queen on a throne
Make him love you 'til you can't come down
(You'll never come down)

[Chorus]
Don't go for second best, baby
Put your love to the test
You know, you know, you've got to
Make him express how he feels
And maybe then you'll know your love is real

[Verse 2]
Long stem roses are the way to your heart
But he needs to start with your head
Satin sheets are very romantic
What happens when you're not in bed?
You deserve the best in life
So if the time isn't right, then move on
Second best is never enough
You'll do much better, baby, on your own
(Baby, on your own)

[Chorus]
Don't go for second best, baby
Put your love to the test
You know, you know, you've got to
Make him express how he feels
And maybe then you'll know your love is real

Express yourself
You've got to make him express himself
Hey, hey, hey, hey
So if you want it right now, make him show you how
Express what he's got, oh baby, ready or not

[Bridge]
And when you're gone he might regret it
Think about the love he once had
Try to carry on, but he just won't get it
He'll be back on his knees
To express himself
You've got to make him express himself
Hey, hey

[Verse 3]
What you need is a big strong hand
To lift you to your higher ground
Make you feel like a queen on a throne
Make him love you 'til you can't come down
(You'll never come down)

[Bridge]
And when you're gone he might regret it
Think about the love he once had
Try to carry on, but he just won't get it
He'll be back on his knees, so please

[Chorus]
Don't go for second best, baby
Put your love to the test
You know, you know, you've got to
Make him express how he feels
And maybe then you'll know your love is real
Express yourself
You've got to make him express himself
Hey, hey, hey, hey
So if you want it right now, make him show you how
Express what he's got, oh baby, ready or not

Express yourself
(You've got to make him) So you can respect yourself
Hey, hey
So if you want it right now, make him show you how
Express what he's got, oh baby, ready or not
Express yourself

[Intro]
Life is a mystery
Everyone must stand alone
I hear you call my name
And it feels like home

[Chorus]
When you call my name
It's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees
I want to take you there
In the midnight hour
I can feel your power
Just like a prayer
You know I'll take you there

[Verse 1]
I hear your voice
It's like an angel sighing
I have no choice
I hear your voice
Feels like flying
I close my eyes
Oh God, I think I'm falling
Out of the sky
I close my eyes
Heaven, help me

[Chorus]
When you call my name
It's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees
I want to take you there
In the midnight hour
I can feel your power
Just like a prayer
You know I'll take you there

[Verse 2]
Like a child
You whisper softly to me
You're in control
Just like a child
Now I'm dancing
It's like a dream
No end and no beginning
You're here with me
It's like a dream
Let the choir sing

[Chorus]
When you call my name
It's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees
I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour
I can feel your power
Just like a prayer
You know I'll take you there
When you call my name
It's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees
I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour
I can feel your power
Just like a prayer
You know I'll take you there

[Reprise]
Life is a mystery
Everyone must stand alone
I hear you call my name
And it feels like home

[Chorus]
Just like a prayer
Your voice can take me there
Just like a muse to me
You are a mystery
Just like a dream
You are not what you seem
Just like a prayer, no choice
Your voice can take me there

[Bridge]
Just like a prayer, I'll take you there
It's like a dream to me (Mmmm...)
Just like a prayer, I'll take you there (I'll take you there)
It's like a dream to me (Oh, oh-oh-oh yeah)
Just like a prayer, I'll take you there (I'll take you there)
It's like a dream to me (Oh yeah, yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah)
Just like a prayer, I'll take you there (Oh, yeah)
It's like a dream to me (Oh, oh)

[Chorus]
Just like a prayer
Your voice can take me there
Just like a muse to me
You are a mystery
Just like a dream
You are not what you seem
Just like a prayer, no choice
Your voice can take me there

Just like a prayer
Your voice can take me there
Just like a muse to me
You are a mystery
Just like a dream
You are not what you seem
Just like a prayer, no choice
Your voice can take me there
Your voice can take me there
Like a prayer

[Outro]
It's like a prayer, your voice can take me there
It's like a prayer
It's like a prayer, your voice can take me there
It's like a prayer
It's like a prayer, your voice can take me there
It's like a prayer
It's like a prayer, your voice can take me there
It's like a prayer

[Verse 1]
She had a face straight out a magazine
God only knows but you'll never leave her
Her balaclava is starting to chafe
And when she gets his gun, he's begging, "Babe, stay, stay, stay"

[Chorus]
"I'll give you one more time
We'll give you one more fight
Said one more line
Will I know you?"

[Verse 2]
Now if you never shoot, you'll never know
And if you never eat, you'll never grow
You've got a pretty kind of dirty face
And when she's leaving your home she's begging you to stay, stay, stay, stay, stay

[Chorus]
"I'll give you one more time
We'll give you one more fight
Said one more line
There'll be a riot, 'cause I know you"

[Bridge]
Well now that you've got your gun
It's much harder now the police have come
And I'll shoot him if it's what you ask
But if you'd just take off your mask
You'd find out everything's gone wrong

[Outro]
Now everybody's dead
And they're driving past my old school
And he's got his gun, he's got his suit on
She says, "Babe, you look so cool
You look so cool, you look so cool
You look so cool, you look so cool
You look so cool"
('Cause I know you)
(Side Fact)

[Verse 1]
Bite your face to spite your nose
Seventeen and a half years old
Worrying about my brother finding out
Where's the fun in doing what you're told?

[Pre-Chorus]
I said "No!"
"Oh, give it a rest, I could persuade you
I'm not your typical, stoned eighteen year old
Give me a night, I'll make you"
"I know you're looking for salvation in the secular age
But, girl, I'm not your saviour"
Wrestle to the ground
God help me now

[Chorus]
'Cause they're just girls breaking hearts
Eyes bright, uptight, just girls
But she can't be what you need if she's seventeen
They're just girls
They're just girls

[Verse 2]
A pair of frozen hands to hold
Oh, she's so southern so she feels the cold
One moment I was tearing off your blouse
Now you're living in my house
What happened to just messing around?

[Pre-Chorus]
I said "Yo, I think you better go, I can't take you"
"You just sit and get stoned with thirty-year-olds and you think you've made it"
"Well, shouldn't you be fucking with somebody your age instead of making changes?"
Wrestle to the ground
God help me now

[Chorus]
'Cause they're just girls breaking hearts
Eyes bright, uptight, just girls
But she can't be what you need if she's seventeen
They're just girls
They're just girls

[Bridge]
I told her from the start
Destined to be hard
I told her from the start
I'll break your heart
Destined to be hard
Break your heart

[Pre-Chorus]
I said "Yo, I think you better go, I can't take you
I know you're looking for salvation in the secular age
But, girl, I'm not your saviour"
"Well, shouldn't you be fucking with somebody your age instead of making changes?"
Wrestle to the ground
God help me now

[Chorus]
'Cause they're just girls breaking hearts
Eyes bright, uptight, just girls
But she can't be what you need if she's seventeen
They're just girls
They're just girls
'Cause they're just girls breaking hearts
Eyes bright, uptight, just girls
But she can't be what you need if she's seventeen
They're just girls
They're just girls
'Cause they're just girls

[Instrumental]

Well I only brought three, what you lookin' at me for?
She's dressed in white and putting off crying
Well you're the best man, so what's the plan?
Why don't you talk to Matty about it?
Said, "I only brought three like I told you before
We're gonna have to ask about"

Free bar, that's the point
Spilling Amaretto 'cause of previous joints
I'm sitting with a girl, fortunate placing
Preceding railing racket off a porcelain basin
And who's he, giving it the lips?
I've never seen him knockin' about
He looks just like me, but 6 foot 3
So I reckon you could knock him out

Well, I think I'll say a couple of words if you don't mind
I never really got on with your bird the first time
I met her out, dressed in nowt
Telling everybody you were shagging about
Well, who's this, going for the kiss?
I'm probably gonna yosh in your mouth
Because it's five past three, I can hardly see
And I'm on the verge of passing out

[Verse 1]
Like a bitch out of order
Like a bat out of hell
Like a fish out of water
I'm scared, can't you tell?
Bang bang
Bang bang

[Verse 2]
I thought you were good
But you painted me bad
Compared to the others
You're the best thing I had
Bang bang, shot you dead
Bang bang, shot you dead

[Verse 3]
I thought it was you, and I loved you the most
But I was just keeping my enemies close
Made a decision, I will never look back
So, how did you end up with all of my jack?
Bang bang, shot you dead
Bang bang, shot you dead (In the head)

[Verse 4]
Bitch out of order
Bat out of hell
Fish out of water
I'm scared, can't you tell?
Bang bang, shot you dead
Bang bang, shot you dead

[Verse 5]
I made a decision, I will never look back
So how did you end up with all of my jack?
Bang bang, shot you dead
Bang bang, shot you dead

[Chorus]
Bang bang, shot you dead, shot my lover in the head
Bang bang, shot you dead and I have no regrets
Bang bang, shot you dead (In the head)
Bang bang, shot you dead, shot my lover in the head

[Verse 6]
And then I discovered it couldn't get worse
You were building my coffin
You were driving my hearse
Bang bang, shot you dead
Bang bang, in the head

[Verse 7]
I thought it was you, and I loved you the most
But I was just keeping my enemies close
I made a decision, I would never look back
So, how did you end up with all of my jack?
Bang bang, shot you dead (In the head)

[Chorus]
Bang bang, shot you dead, shot my lover in the head
Bang bang, shot you dead and I have no regrets
Bang bang, shot you dead (In the head)
Bang bang, shot you dead, shot my lover in the head

[Interlude]
(I need you to die for me, baby)

[Breakdown]
You have to die for me, baby
That's right, you have to die for me, baby
How could I move on with my life?
If you didn't die for me, baby?
If you didn't die for me, baby?
I need you to die for me, baby!

[Chorus]
Bang bang, shot you dead, shot my lover in the head
Bang bang, shot you dead, shot my lover in the head
Bang bang, shot you dead, shot my lover in the head
Now my lover is dead and I have no regrets (He deserved it)

[Bridge]
And I'm going straight to hell
And I got a lot of friends there
And if I see that bitch in hell
I'm gonna shoot him in the head again
'Cause I want to see him die
Over, and over, and over, and over
And over, and over, and over, and over
Now drive, bitch!
I said drive, bitch!
And while you're at it, die, bitch!
That's right, drive, bitch
Now drive, bitch!
I said drive, bitch!
And while you're at it, die bitch!
That's right, drive bitch

[Outro]
Now if you're gonna act like a bitch
Then you're gonna die like a bitch

[Verse 1]
When I move a certain way
I feel an ache I'd kept at bay
A hairline break that’s taking hold
A metal that I thought was gold

[Pre-Chorus]
And pure, so sure, I'd struck a vein
I wanted you to feel the same
So when you did ignite a spark
Rescue me from all this dark
See our hearts are intertwined
Then I'm free, free of mine
I'm falling free

[Chorus]
And see our hearts are intertwined
And then I'm free, I'm free of mine
And deep and pure, our hearts aligned
And then I'm free, I'm free of mine

[Verse 2]
When I raise a certain wing
And crawl beneath that growing thing
It throws a shadow over time
And keeps yours falling next to mine

[Pre-Chorus]
Your days were meant to fly and do
I fall and fold mine into you
And what you take is just enough
And what you give is what I love
And when you lift, you raise the sail
And then I’m free, free to fail
I’m falling free

[Chorus]
Deep and pure, our hearts align
And then I'm free, I'm free of mine
When I let loose the need to know
Then we're both free, we're free to go

[Verse 3]
When I lose a certain claim
That tries to know and needs to blame
Whatever river runs aground
It turns my head and washes down

[Pre-Chorus]
The face of God that stands above
Pouring over hope and love
That all of might, and life, and limb
Could turn around and love again
When I let loose the need to know
Then we're both free, free to go
I'm falling free

[Breakdown]
I'm falling
I'm falling
I'm falling free
I'm falling
I'm falling
I'm falling free

[Chorus]
Deep and pure, our hearts align
And then I'm free, I'm free of mine
When I let loose the need to know
Then we're both free, we're free to go

[Outro]
Deep and pure, our hearts align
And then I'm free, I'm free of mine
I let loose the need to know
Then we're both free, we're free to go
Come on, come on, come on, come
Shout for the 17, shout for the Hollygrove
Shout for the 17
I'mma take it uptown, uptown
You dig
You understand me

[Verse 1]
Woke one morning
Tears in my eyes
And you had left me without a kiss or a note
Or goodbye
Now I got to learn to live alone
But my heart can't take it
I guess that's why I wait by the phone
For a call, a call from you
Sayin' she needs me back
Just as much as I need you
But I guess for the time, you need to stay away
Let me tell you baby, now I'm thinkin' of you every day

[Hook]
I'm thinkin' about you
I'm thinkin' about you

[Break]
Oops upside your head
I said oops upside your head
I said feet, don't fail me now
White man came down to my city
On the corner
And asked me what do I do
I said, do what I wanna
Said, do what I wanna

[Verse 2]
I keep thinkin' 'bout the good times we had
And how we let jealousy
Turn all we had good into bad
Now I realize
If you just try it again
Love will play out
You'll be my girl
I'll be your only man
   

[Chorus]
Why do you talk so loud?
Why do you talk so?
Why do you talk so loud?
Why do you talk so?

[Verse 1]
Passing grammatical mistakes
Totally wrecked and polemic in the way he talks
Vocal sabbatical, delayed by churning out the same

[Chorus]
Why do you talk so loud?
Why do you talk so?
Why do you talk so loud?
Why do you talk so?

[Verse 2]
We don't got alarms we just use my Dad's arms
Excess until we stop hearts
"I think you're trying too hard with your lungs in tar
And your kitchen full of pop stars"

[Verse 3]
And I've been thinking lots about your mouth
A conversation superseded by the way he talks
I'd be an anchor but I'm scared you'd drown
It's safer on the ground

[Chorus]
Why do you talk so loud?
Why do you talk so?
Why do you talk so loud?
Why do you talk so?

[Verse 4]
Passing grammatical mistakes
Totally wrecked and polemic in the way he talks
Vocal sabbatical, delayed by churning out the same

[Outro]
Why do you talk so loud?
('Cause I've been thinking lots about your mouth)
Why do you talk so?
(A conversation superseded by the way he talks)
Why do you talk so loud?
(And I've been thinking lots about your mouth)
Why do you talk so?
Oh, I preferred it before
We should ring Dad more
Lost our house
Hold me close
I stopped by, just to wash my clothes
I know it's me that's supposed to love you
And when I'm home, you know I got you
Is there somebody who can watch you?
I know it's me that's supposed to love you
And when I'm home, you know I got you
Is there somebody who can love you?
Love, you
Is there somebody who can watch you?
Is there somebody who can watch you?

[Charlamagne]
Let's shift gears for a minute and talk about New York City. I actually get in arguments because people say Nicki doesn't rep New York. I say "What do you mean? She shouts it out all of the time."

[Nicki Minaj]
Y'all don't want me to rep y'all. Y'all don't hear when I rep y'all cause y'all be dick-riding everybody else.

[Charlamagne]
She does have a point. Do you feel you get the proper love from New York?

[Nicki Minaj]
Hell fucking no.

[Charlamagne]
And I never understood that because you ran the same circuits of all these other rappers. You did the DVDs. You did the mixtapes. You came up on mixtapes like every other underground rapper in New York.

[Nicki Minaj]
I was selling my mixtape out of my mutherfucking BMW out on Jamaica mutherfucking Avenue to Amadu and Hussaine and these niggas. Fuck you niggas! You niggas don't know the fucking half of what I've fucking been through!

_________________________________________________________________

[Charlemagne]
Well, Sir Isaac Newton said the law of energy is, "Energy is not lost or destroyed, it is merely transferred from on party to the next." You got a miserable bitch on a blog who writes something negative about you, you read it, and now you're miserable.

[Nicki Minaj]
Absolutely. Right. Absolutely.

[Charlemange]
What you think about the blogs, Scaff Beezy?

[Scaff "SB" Beezy]
Honestly, the blogs could just suck my damn cock, balls, deepthroat, gag, and choke.

_________________________________________________________________

[Charlemagne]
So, Miss Nicki Minaj, what do you say to people that say you're trying to be something that you're not like Lady Gaga or Madonna and you're doing things for shock value?

[Nicki Minaj]
Well, I mean, I don't know. In a minute, if I fucking sit down and piss, they're going to tell me I can't do that cause another bitch did it.

[Scaff "SB" Beezy]
Stupid ass bitches! Yo, niggas just want to compare her to somebody.

[Nicki Minaj]
Everybody! If they ever see me sitting down and peeing, they're gonna fucking stone me.

[Scaff "SB" Beezy]
They're gonna say, "You're trying to be like Barack's wife. Look at her, she's sitting down and peeing like that. You trying to be like Michelle."

[Nicki Minaj]
"Why you sitting down and peeing Nicki?"

[Scaff "SB" Beezy]
"Why don't you stand up?"

[Charlemange]
That happens to everybody, though.

[Nicki Minaj]
It does.

[Scaff "SB" Beezy]
No, Nicki gets it so hard -- pause! Hospital flow, need more gauze.

[Charlamagne]
I think when they don't understand something they gotta compare it to something to make themselves feel comfortable.

[Nicki Minaj]
Absolutely, I always say that. For their minds to interpret it, they have to draw a comparison. And I always say, even though it's very common, it's just a more simple-minded approach as opposed to looking at every situation as if it's the first time. It is what it is. But even she gets compared to Madonna, and it's a never-ending cycle. But I rather you compare me to someone that is winning and that's won than compare me to...

[Charlamagne]
Someone that is washed. That's a natural emotion though... It's easy for a loser to be jealous of a winner. That's just the way that it is.

Do you ever look back at some of your performances and look at your costumes and your wigs and say, "I did look like a damn fool?"

[Nicki Minaj]
Yes! Yes, I do. Yes, I do.

[Charlemagne]
Do you ever think that?

[Scaff "SB" Beezy]
Sometimes. Every now and then. You know what I like about superstars? I like my superstars to be out there. Jump out the window! Be like Prince with your ass out. I may see it and say, "Damn, she looks like a fool," but you're a superstar.

That's how I want to see my superstars. I don't want to see my superstars regular.

_________________________________________________________________

[Nicki Minaj]
I keep saying this: I went to school for theater. I took four years of my life and devoted it to theater.

I did that because my passion was acting. When I started rapping, I felt like I couldn't really be myself. When I started winning, I started feeling that I can be myself. I can do my accents, I can do my voices, I can do my faces, I can do costumes.

I can now bring me to who, you know, people see as Nicki Minaj. I can now really bring me into it. And I think that's where the confusion lies, is that people thought that when I first came out, that that was me in my entirety. But that wasn't. That was a small facet of who I was.

But, who you see now is just a more multi-faceted mixture of all the personalities that I have in me. I mean... and I think that if I was to not show that, then I wouldn't be doing justice to all the people that feel like I do. Cause for every person who doesn't understand it is, there is a person who feels like me, who feels like... sometimes I just break out in an English accent, you know, like, what's wrong with that?

[Charlemagne]
You can! Why not?

_________________________________________________________________

[Charlemagne]
Do you think that mixtape Nicki and pop Nicki can exist in the same space?

[Nicki Minaj]
They already are. They're already existing together, and they are both winning.

[Charlemagne]
Who do you feel that you lean towards more?

[Nicki Minaj]
I can't choose. I can't pick. I feel like the world makes them two different people, but in my mind they're the same person.

That's what I keep saying... I grew up in New York my whole life. I would go to the block and hang out with my home girls on the weekend, and then Monday through Friday I was having a nine-to-five on Wall Street.

When I was an office manager I wasn't having the same conversation in the office that I was having on the block, but I was still the same person. I was Onika. But I knew how to switch it up and have an intelligent conversation with one group of people, get a job, ace the interview, and then go home with my home girls and have fun.

[Charlemagne]
It seems like you're very versatile. If it's one thing that I would love for little girls to embrace from Nicki Minaj is the fact that she is versatile. She knows how to kick it in the streets and she knows how to kick it in the corporate setting.

[Nicki Minaj]
Right, because you can't do too much of either. You really can't.

It's unfortunate that at times hip hop culture will tell you to lean only to one side, when that is detrimental for your future. It's detrimental for your growth. It's detrimental to your longevity.

At a certain point as a woman -- I'm not talking about as a man because we've seen The Blueprint with Jay. We've seen that you could come in the game and do 10, 12, 15 – still win and still be the king of hip hop. We have not seen that with a woman. So, show me the blueprint. That's all I want you to do -- show me the blueprint.

[Charlemagne]
I think you are creating it. Because Queen Latifah doesn't exist in that space anymore. She went on to become an actress.

[Nicki Minaj]
And is someone who I tip my hat to because Queen Latifah looked at it and said, "Okay, wait, hmm, I may not want to be 40 years old rapping. The hip hop fans may not want to hear me when I'm 40 years old rapping. So I'm going to move in a way so that every aspect of who I am can be seen." Queen Latifah does musicals, movies, voice-overs for cartoons -- is she a sellout or is she winning?

[Charlemagne]
She's winning!

[Nicki Minaj]
So these other bitches that only did rap and now they're washed, and they're living in, you know, low income housing - is that winning? Just so that a nigga in the street can give me a fucking dap? The same niggas that didn't buy my album any fucking way, that downloaded the shit? Get the fuck out of here!

_________________________________________________________________

[Charlemagne]
When it's all said and done, are you going to want to have kids? Get married?

[Nicki Minaj]
Oh my goodness, I have to! I have to! Yep. I'm gonna get married and have kids. I love children. I am obsessed with children.

And yeah, I believe in marriage, and I believe marriage is forever. So, that's the other thing...

[Scaff "SB" Beezy]
"Look in my eyes, look in my eyes / Know that we'll always be forever / Moment in time, moment in time..."

[Nicki Minaj]
Safaree... Safaree...

_________________________________________________________________

[Charlemagne]
Do you have any regrets? Cause you've had a relatively short career. This is the second album, and hopefully we can ten more of these. But do you have any regrets in this short time that you've been Nicki Minaj?

[Nicki Minaj]
I think my only regret would be not enjoying every single moment when I could have.

[Charlemange]
How can the author of "I wish I could enjoy this moment for life" not be here trying to enjoy every moment?

[Nicki Minaj]
Absolutely. And that's the thing. It kinda just comes so quickly.

[Scaff "SB" Beezy]
Pause!

[Nicki Minaj]
And then all of a sudden it's like, "Wait a minute. I just did Super Bowl. I just did Super Bowl with Madonna. And before I go into the Super Bowl stage I'm just stressing and worrying. And then when I come off it's all done. And what I did I even enjoy about it?

[Charlemagne]
Not even that, you closed up the Grammy's.

[Scaff "SB" Beezy]
But that's why, cause she's doing the Super Bowl, and she's thinking about the Grammy's.

[Nicki Minaj]
And then I'm doing the Grammy's, and I'm thinking about the NBA all-star game. That's the only thing.

I've gotten to a very good place, though. All of my friends and mentors in the game have been reaching out to me trying to encourage me because for some strange reason they knew how frazzled I used to be. And every time I tell people, "No, no, I'm really good. I'm really happy. I'm really at a peaceful place." It's almost like they don't believe me. So I thought the other day, I must have really, really been worried a lot. Because people who know me very well are like, "Are you sure you're ok?" But I really am. I've never been this happy. I'm so proud of this album. I'm proud of myself. And I will not allow anyone to scare me out of my true potential. It's a scare tactic.
_________________________________________________________________

[Charlemagne]
What is Nicki Minaj's purpose? Because from the outside looking in, I think you're a very blessed individual. Because you got two things going against you. Number one, you're a female. And the female hip hop division was not existent before you started popping. And then you're from New York. There's a lot of rappers from New York that aren't popping right now. So you got those two things going against you.

Being that you were able to break through that and be the big superstar that you are, it's like, "She's obviously here for something." I think it's a bigger purpose than maybe you even know. But what is Nicki Minaj's purpose?

[Nicki Minaj]
I have to pray on that. I think that my purpose will eventually be related to some sort of movement for my younger fans, really... I've always had this dream of having a Nicki Minaj YMCA type of thing. When I was young -- well, everybody knows my story -- we didn't have a lot. Free lunch was the thing, "We can get free lunch. Oh, we're going to free lunch. This is like dope!" So I remember those moments and I always play them back in my head. And I wish to think to myself, I wish there was a place we could also go to to go swimming and to do this and to do that.

But things were moving so quickly. My parents were so, not really stable and just -- my father being an addict and all that. In a lot of ways I feel like I didn't really have a childhood. So when I see kids, it melts my heart because I'm looking at them and I'm like "They'll never get this moment back again, and they'll always remember this time." How do we as adults optimize it for them right now, whether they have money or not.

I think that one day I would like to do something for them, for kids in the inner cities, for them to have a place where they can go to and have not only recreation but schooling, tutoring. I remember I was really really smart in school, and I think my mother took that for granted. So she wouldn't really sit with me and take the extra time to give me that extra push. But I think that kids need that.

It's weird because people would never expect me to be so into children's education, but that's real shit. I don't just say that because it sounds good. I really am interested in learning how to build the education system to a point where we have more of a success rate in terms of black children that go from high school to college.

I feel like college was not something that was engraved in my brain. I don't feel like that ever happened. Most of my closest girlfriends, it was just like once they got out of high school they figured, "Oh well, we're good now, we're out of high school," or "I got my GED, I'm good." And I don't want my fans to think like that.

I have such a great rapport with my fans. When they see me, they really be bringing out their Bachelor's and their Master's saying, "Look, Nicki, Look." Because they know how important it is to me. It's OK to have fun (I'mma give you the raunchiest verse sometimes), but I also want you to realize that it's for a time.

One day, you're going to look back and think "Wait a minute, did I really lose my life clubbing and miss out on a moment where I could've been building myself as a woman and having something to offer my children?"

We got so many girls right now having children and don't even know the first thing to say to a child. But you're having a child because I want to keep this dude or it just happened. I want to get us to the place where it doesn't just happen and that we're smarter than that. We're the ones in control again. Why are we never in control?

Why are we stuck with a baby? Why are we always stuck on the welfare line? Why are we always stuck having to beg, borrow, and steal to provide for our children? Why do we think it's something wrong for waiting to have a baby? Waiting until you're 35 or 36 to have children?

Technology has changed – you can wait! Have something to offer them. That's something that's dear to my heart, doing something that makes children feel like "I don't have to rush to grow up. I can enjoy my childhood. I can have somewhere to go for free for recreational purposes and for schooling purposes." That's my bigger goal in life.

[Charlemagne]
How do you stay humble? I know you keep a tight circle, you keep guys like Scaff Beezy around.

I'm gonna ask Scaff. How do you keep her humble, Scaff Beezy? Do you ever see her getting a little bit extra...?

[Scaff "SB" Beezy]
You wanna know what's crazy? Yesterday, remember I was saying to you, "It's so crazy. She's so famous." If she goes out, anytime we go somewhere, it's such a freaking chaotic zoo movie.

The other day we went to a carnival. We thought we'd be able to be in there, and just go on some rides, and nobody will notice anything. Within like seven minutes the whole park -- it was 10, 15 minutes until we got out.

She really hasn't changed. She really don't act like, "I'm this person" or, "I'm that person." She just be there looking so oblivious to what's going on. Sometimes she doesn't even know she's famous like that. It doesn't faze her. She really hasn't changed a bit.

_________________________________________________________________

[Charlemagne]
Pay attention to that. How did you escape being more than just an ass?

[Nicki Minaj]
We said that the other day, before I was just a rapping butt.

[Safaree "SB" Samuels]
A butt with lyrics

[Charlemagne]
How did you get out of that?

[Nicki Minaj]
Because I created a brand.

People take for granted how hard it is so shout out to every woman and man that's won. It's very hard, mentally, this shit is draining and draining. For you to be able to get up there and do music that people love, and do interviews with a smile on your face, and act like this shit ain't getting to you, it's draining.

It's crazy! That's why so many artists go on drugs or become alcoholics. When I was coming up, I never understood it. I use to be like, "What? They are so ungrateful. Why are they on drugs? Why don't they fucking appreciate their success? I would kill to be where they are," until you get here and you are like, "Oh my god! Lord, is this the price I have to pay if I really want this?" And he's like, "Yep. Now let's see who really want it." But, I think I became more than that because people cannot deny... at the end of the day, people can't deny that...

[Charlamagne]
You the shit. Say it! You don't have to be humble. Be like Ray J. "I'm tired of being humble."

[Nicki Minaj]
I'm not a cocky person by nature.

[Charlemagne]
Scaff, be cocky for her!

[Scaff "SB" Beezy]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, man. You bitches ain't shit, man. You need to just really -- When you see her, get the rose petals, just like she's said before, throw it out in front of her feet. You pour out the champagne. You feed her grapes. If something needs to be sucked, you suck it!

[Nicki Minaj]
What!? What would need to be sucked? On you?

[Scaff "SB" Beezy]
Ay. Anything. Anywhere. I'm in these streets looking for work. We're all in these streets, we're looking for that work, that twerk.

_________________________________________________________________

[Charlemagne]
I just want to tell you, Nicki, I think that you're very necessary. I think you represent something way bigger than hip hop. I think that you're gonna take hip hop to new levels. And I think, like how Jay-Z took it to heights and made people be like, "Damn, hip hop can take you this far!?" I think you're taking that baton and you're gonna take it even further. So keep doing your thing, Ma.

[Nicki Minaj]
Thank you, darling.

Charlemange da God, singed out!

[Intro: The Weeknd]
Everything I said I'd do, I did
I'm good, I'm good
Everything I said I'd do, I did

[Verse 1: The Weeknd]
But baby lets face it, I'm not into dating
I haven't been patient
Ever since I been famous my time has been racing
My motives are basic, this life I've been chasing
These hearts I've been breaking
And these girls I been tasting don't never get naked
They like it in a head lock fuck 'em from behind
Fuck 'em with their clothes on, put it to the side
Feelings to the side like a don do
Get 'em wet, let it slide like a sunroof
Got goals, got dreams, got a hotel-crib
Got niggas that'll die for the prince
Got my city on lock, XO 'til the death
Left town in a coach came back in a jet

[Bridge: The Weeknd]
I'm good, I'm not living like I did before
I'm good, I'm good, I said I'm good
Everything I said I'd do, I did
I'm good, said I'm good
Oh, I been good
I've been out there puttin' down that work
I'm good, said I'm good, I said I'm good
Everything I said I'd do, I did
I'm good, motherfucker I'm good

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
This is dedicated to everybody who forgot
Forgetful motherfuckers
Remember, don't you remember?
I been good, we good

[Intro: DJ Drama]
Shout to Chi-Town!
Dedication 5!
Since '05!
Know that!

[Verse 1: Chance The Rapper]
You feel like Kool-Aid in a wine glass with your fine ass
You fine as two grapes gettin' stomped out by a giant cask
You the best dressed with your breasts showing
Like a salad, no dressing, take you to your favorite restaurant
Ask for the bread, then fuck in the restroom
They don't ask for a pass when your ass waltz in my dress room
You the best bride and I'm the best groom
Wedding presents got my best man at the Best Buy
Buyin' the Best of Fresh Prince for the bedroom
And I'ma buy a summer house, with a rec room
And a car with no backseat and some leg room
And some strawberries and some chocolate
And a fridge and some broccoli
'Cause I know you like vegetables even though I don't
I won't say I won't eat it if you chef it
Fuck it, I'll hire Geoffrey to get a beverage if you should ever get parched
You feel like Ruby Dee to me, great and powerful Ossie
Who's behind the man behind the curtain? Foxy, coffee
Brown as the bosom I flew in on
Nose round like the wheels that my rims spin on
Lips full like the light on the dash was flickin', oh wait, it wasn't
Oh, and I forgot, I'll take a microwave or oven
So we could kick the butler out and we can make a muffin
Maybe bake a dozen
My homeboy like your sister, maybe they can bake some cousins
Ooh, isn't that sweet?
You feel like Kool-Aid in a wine glass

[Hook: Chance the Rapper]
This is not a love song, this is a you song
I just happen to love you
This is not a love song, this is a you song
I just happen to love you
This is not a love song, this is a you song
I just happen to love you
This is not a love song, this is a you song
I just happen to love you

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Give you the world if it was for me
My diamond grill make it hard to see, I'm lying through my teeth
And now I'm flying on my PJ, looking at the clouds
Thinking about yo ass and how it look like a big smile
I get mental flashbacks of your ass crack, lemme get back on track
You say I act like I don't miss you, that's because I don't act
But anyway, we can role-play or get straight to it
Sorry, my mind in the gutter—better yet, sewer
And when you say I love you, I stutter, "I-I love you too"
It's Wayne's world, she say, "What is this world coming to?"
And she know me and whoever together, she hope we comin' loose
She told me that if she ain't the one, she gon' throw up the deuce
I laughed at her, we took a bath together and splashed each other
Then she got serious and said, "Tune I gotta ask you something
Do you really love me?" I tried to change the subject
So I said some crazy shit to her like
"What if you and I were just letters?
That'd be unfortunate, we'd have to rob a fortune teller
But I swear, I think I love you, fingers crossed in my pocket
Okay, that's a dead subject, you bring it up, that's a zombie
You remind me of... my memory ain't what it used to be"
She said she ain't trippin', I know, because I move my feet
And when she figure out that she been swindled
I'll be cleaning that love bird shit off of my window
I-I love you too...

[Hook: Chance the Rapper]
This is not a love song, this is a you song
I just happen to love you
This is not a love song, this is a you song
I just happen to love you
This is not a love song, this is a you song
I just happen to love you
This is not a love song, this is a you song
I just happen to love you

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
I mean how many times
How many times I gotta
How many times I gotta say it for it to count?
Are you counting?
I loved the pictures
I needed that, I swear I did
I was just thinking about you when you sent them too
You don't believe me? I know
D5, what up 5?
I-I love you too...I do

[Hook]
And if I fuck her, she gon' get attached
Who invited all these fuck-niggas?
Man, shit ain't ever smell this good
Why them snakes tryin' to tongue kiss us?
Way too cool to die young, way too young to die sober
Way too cool to die young, way too young to die sober
Sleepin' with a bad bitch, wake me up when it's all over
I'm so tired of these niggas, wake me up when it's all over

[Verse 1]
Bitch, come kill my time, but bitch don't steal my shine
I'm cooking up two quarters, bout' to get rich or die tryin'
I got some killer's on my side, some kill up in my swisher
All this hatin' drive me crazy, take the key out the ignition
Oh my god it feel like Coogi weather
I lost my mind, but I got it back like groovy Stella
Tell them hoes I got that Victoria Secret weapon
I hope you live a double life cause you gon' need an extra
Me and my niggas we got bad bitches up in the pool
Bad bitches up in the pool
She gon' learn tonight, call that shit night school
And life is a bitch on her cycle, delightful
Got ho's on that powder, like light blue
Nice move, now king me nigga
Badass bitch, you seen me with her, we on that
GT Vodka, straight out the bottle, genie nigga
The difference between me and these niggas, is
I go hard and they go wrong
She say, "Hit it from the back," I'm tryin' to leave that crack alone baby

[Hook 2]
And if she love me, I'mma love her back
Who indictin' all the tough niggas?
We smoke that skunk that's always smellin' good
But why these snakes tryin' to tongue kiss us?
Way too cool to die young, way too young to die sober
Way too cool to die young, way too young to die sober
Sleepin' with a bad bitch, wake me up when it's all over
I'm so tired of these nigga's, wake me up when it's all over

[Verse 2]
Street sweepers and millimeters, AK's and skateboards
Let 'em know we got beef for anyone who got a taste for it
Real nigga to the bone, bristle
Cocaine, like co cripple
Heard niggas been waitin' on me, well I might as well go and tip 'em
I'm smokin' on that Hulk Hogan
I call shots, you call forward
I pimp my ride, my car's ho-in'
And all my bars be barcoded
These YMCMB stars glowin'
Hate a ho-nigga, like anchovies
My young bitch keep on snappin' on me, I told that bitch I ain't posing
That pussy feel like a pot of gold
The money old and the night is young
All them niggas keep talkin' shit
I make you eat your words and bite your tongue
And when the guns ring I'm the ring leader
Got those ho's on pins and needles
I'm so high I left Earth
And ran into Venus and Serena
Get head like a mind reader
You washed up, I'm the dry cleaner
Don't worry about me, nigga I'm one-
Hundred like a high fever
Got pounds takin' up closet space
Guns all in my bitch crib
Since all you nigga's fly now, bugs all on my windshield

[Hook 3]
And if she tense, then I'mma rub her back
She alright, I think I fuck with her
Man, I wish a motherfucker would
I feel like a hockey puck nigga
Way too cold to die young, way too young to die sober
Way too cold to die young, give these niggas the cold shoulder
Sleepin' with a bad bitch, another bitch when I roll over
We fuck until we fall asleep, wake up and do it all over

[Outro]
D5
What up 5? (Kendrick)
What up 5?

[Verse]
Nigga I be hard on a ho 'cause a bitch ain't shit
And every ho I done fucked done sucked my dick
I had to pour out some drank for niggas I miss
I hope my weed ain't too loud to hear the snakes hiss
It's Dedication 5, medication high
I gotta clean up after these niggas 'cause they be wasting time
And boy, my hoes don't get in line because they stay in line
I'm shining on these hoes so hard they getting tan lines
It's Tunechi, I go hard, I put in work
Twin Glocks, the gift and the curse
Dirty money, no footprints in dirt
We geeked up, the revenge of the nerds
I swear, play with these niggas, that's that shit I don't do
As long as money talks, I got someone to talk to
Watch my dogs treat the beef like dog food
I got the power, but a short fuse, let's go
I can't trust my iPhone, I think Siri the Feds
You know snitches get stitches, nigga, needle and thread
You better walk it like you talk it or we cut off your legs
Pretty please don't kill my vibe, I ain't too proud to beg
Alright, fucking right, shoot you up at the light
Straight take all your possessions, call that shit Poltergeist
And my homie, he a sniper, we call him Wesley Snipes
I call my bitch Plane Jane 'cause she catch nut like a flight
I'm on a mission to get movie money, stick to the script
Your bitch leaking information, I just follow the drip
Soon as I get that coupe, I'mma go get the rims
Toss the keys to my homie, tell that nigga it's his
I feel like He-Man when I'm in your ho
And tell that bitch give me my space, like a telescope
In her throat like Ricola, my system solar
I'm too young to die sober, your man a cobra
Watch that nigga, let's go
Boy, my bitches got bitches badder than your bitches
But I can't trust none of them bitches though, like magicians
Straight blowing money fast, I'mma get a ticket
Soon as I get off paper, I'mma smack a nigga
No broken mirrors, I can't see myself broke
Right back pocket, flag redder than a velvet rope
Never say never, she might do her friend, you never know
Shorty make that dick stand up like it's telling jokes
I swear to God, I put in work
I'm on them shrooms, my goons on alert
I spit these bars, this a uni-verse
You better duck, like Dooney and Bourke
I'm telling ya, shout out Turk
It's Hot Boys, bitch, the block is hot
If I ain't have the keys to success I would have picked the lock
Diarrhea, shit don't stop, until my fucking casket drop
Still got that crack, maybe one day I'mma pass the rock

[Outro]
Tunechi
Dedication 5
What up Five

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
I got shotguns under my staircase
Rob yo ho ass bare face
Been had this bitch on lock, I’m bout to get this bitch a cellmate
All my life I been this cold
All my nights I spend with hoes
I keep change on me now
‘Cus this shit’s startin to take a toll
I just flew 2 hoes in, oh how time flies, clip its wings
Make you spit that safe combination, out like Listerine
And even though I’m not an artist this is where I draw the line
We don’t feel none of you niggas
Y'all some fuckin porcupines
I still got residue all on my dinner plates
Real niggas in my inner circle
None of my checks come late, I ain’t having that, I give em curfews
Dressed up like a old lady, uzi under my church dress
Surprise yo ass like a baby… taking his first steps
I’m too good for just any bad bitch
Smoke like I’ve been kissing dragons
That milk carton show her missing panties
That pussy felt like a hidden valley
Thank God that I’m so gifted
I wouldn’t return a single gift
But all good things must come to an end
Like this blunt burning my fingertips
Lil' Tune

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
This ain’t what you want
Put that gun to yo ho head
Make her tell me what you don’t
Got some moon rocks in my pockets, that’s a pocket full of stones
Fuck with me cuz I fuck around and got that shit from Neil Armstrong aw!
Neil Armstrong aw! Neil Armstrong
Fuck with me cuz I fuck around and got that shit from Neil Armstrong!
Got some moon rocks in my pockets, that’s a pocket full of stones
Fuck with me cuz I fuck around and got that shit from Neil Armstrong aw!

[Verse 2: Mack Maine]
Striper pole on the yacht
Striper pole in my spot
I got yo girl in my condo
Bitch I’m ballin like Rondo
Flexin ranches up in Texas
I know it’s a blessing but I don’t know what’s a recession
If we talkin mew mew’s, Jimmy Choos and Giuseppe she got it
I star 6-7, my flights I fly private
I’m a walkin hedge fund
I copped a 62 for leg room
This bitch text saying her lights off
I bought her a new crib, it’s a tax write-off

[Hook: Future]
It’s like the way I’m ballin on these niggas
It’s like the way I’m ballin on these niggas
Foreva
It’s like the way I’m ballin on these niggas
Hold it
It’s like the way I’m ballin on these niggas
Step up in this kitchen
Just step back take a look at me
Listen , that Ferrari unreleased
Stop being so defensive, I’m making real decisions
That’s the reason why we winning
We flying, we finished

[Verse 3: Birdman]
Rich Gang, we drop feathers to vall
Rich Gang ball 'till you fall
We hit the block dippin cuz the block hot
Record sales, ship it from the Hard Knox
Live it like we live it twice
Ballin with them bright lights
Bad bitches stand tall
Bad bitches want em all
Hella choppas on the surface
Mansion on the beach, nigga that’s the purpose
Blow it cuz the swag is perfect
First class flights, nigga we done murked em

[Hook: Future]

[Verse 1]
I got old money, take a bath in hundreds
My way or the highway and I see traffic comin'
It's Tunechi in this ho, watch them hoes go crazy
Pass that weed around, like that shit contagious
And I got news for all these snitches, tell them feds stop bitchin'
If pussy lips could talk, I'd go down there like it's whisperin'
You know life is so uncertain and death is so unwanted
My navigation system say, "It's death around the corner"
I got a condo for a stash house, a condo for a stash house
Get that boy a mirror, so he can watch his damn mouth
See I get it from Sosa, he got it from Frank
And Sosa alright, but I'm tryin' to meet Frank
He said business is well, he ain't got no complaints
You'll be Batman and I'll be robbin' the bank
I know I ain't gon' fall, even though I'm power trippin'
Glass house nigga, you see how I'm livin'
I know that we the new slaves, I know that we the new age
Ain't no such thing as too paid

[Reprise]
Like it's freezing and you naked, shake that ass ho
Shake that ass ho

[Verse 2]
When we throw a pool party, we put sharks in the pool
I got Bloods in the cut, so don't throw salt in the wound
AK wet niggas up, I don't throw water balloons
Better call the platoon
If it's fuck it then fuck it, now you speakin' my language
Put your dead body under them white sheets with no blankets
I'm so rich I go pour
Champagne and don't drink it
Ice on my neck like I fainted
These are the thoughts of the brainless
No new friends, we don't talk to strangers
Man I'm so serious with this pimp shit
Full clip in my Mac 10
Ain't no exit out the game, nigga cut off your blinkers
And if she married I fuck her, if she lonely I fuck her
If she crazy I love her, y'all just don't understand her
She say you got it made, I say no I got a butler
They tell me to turn up, but I'm the knob on the oven
I got a knife in my pocket if there's a fork in the road
I'm the man of steel, but I won't say what I stole
Bring that coke to the stove, and whip it like a new slave
Whip it like a new slave

[Reprise]

[Outro]
D5
Whattup five
Take that coke to the stove
And whip it like a new slave, whip it like a new slave
Like it's freezing and you naked shake that ass ho

[Intro: Lil Wayne]
My niggas been stuntin' since way back when
CNN, I got news for you haters
I'm a nasty ass nigga, ask your bitch, I ain't lying
69, that's a favor for a favor

[Bridge: Lil Wayne]
Them hoes bitin' they lip, cause when I say shit like that she feel some type of way
I hit it from the front, from the side, from the back, I hit it all type of ways
She throw it at me like I'm just one strike away
Sometimes life is hard to swallow, but she like to taste
Ding-ding-ding-ding-ding my lawyer fight the case
I got them flowers in me, I feel like a vase
Monsters in my closet no more closet space
Niggas want to be this fly, too many flights to take

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Enough with the small talk, my girl pussy is a water-park
Every little thing I do turn her on; that's autostart
I kiss every single body part, her body is a work of art
I'm way too high, her skirt too short, I think I love her, it was just a thought
I pop up in that coupe 'bout to go back to the future
And she said, "Tune, not in my mouth," damn you should've said it sooner
I be shittin' on these niggas, like I'm sippin' Metamucil
And we smokin' on that gas, pass it like "excuse you"
And it's 6-6-2's Piru all day, my nigga
Before these niggas play with us, they'll play dead, my nigga
And if you lookin' for me, I'll be on these bitches' mind
These niggas chicken and I've never seen a chicken fly
My bitch been fussin' at me about nothin'
Ain't no tellin' what she'd do if I replace her
Like bae, I'm straight, there's plenty fish and I'm bait
We can't even have a decent conversation

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
I pop the seal on my sip and she be like, "See, you gon' drink your life away"
Bitch it's my life, my life, my life shout out Mary J
And tell them boys that beef tastes like a slice of cake
And old folks get shot too, they write down license plates
I hope that ho don't call sayin' her cycle late
All this fucking gotta stop, but I need tighter brakes
And don't run from this dick girl, I don't like to chase
I wax that ass, she make that Mr. Miyagi face
And she ain't all that pretty, but I like her shape
They say numbers don't lie, she shaped like a 8
She say she ain't no dyke, but she gon' dyke today
It's curtains for these niggas I feel like some drapes.
We turnt up niggas, burnt up, stop the microwave
This shit might cost us our life, but that's the price we pay
I'm hotter than the peppers Peter Piper ate
This that Dedication 5, whattup 5?

[Verse 3: T.I.]
Ay Tune' I gotta turn up on the D5 man!
Hustle Gang, bang, green mean, anybody get it
Anything we'll do for the paper
And we live this shit, talk slick get kill't
Got nothin' but a tool for a hater (Spent 100K on my wrist nigga!)
This flooded rollie make you feel some type of way (I know it do!)
Your ho be on me, know you feel some type of way (I take your ho!)
The car I'm drivin' make you feel some type of way (They can't afford this nigga!)
The cash I gettin' make you feel some type of way (Bankrolls-R-Us!)
This type of way, know you feel some type of way (Hustle Gang my nigga!)
That shit ain't hot, we out here poppin' that's all I can say (G.D.O.D!)
My only problem is tryin' to decide what I'mma drive today (Hustle Gang my nigga!)
We shine all in they face, I know they feel some type of way
I wake up in a multi-million dollar crib get dressed I plan on having a nicer day
When these punk ass rappers keep my name in they mouth, like they some type of gay
You know me dog, so watch what you say (You better watch your mouth!)
We ain't playing no games with your lame ass nigga, fuckboy you can die today (I swear you can!)
I keep a chopper in my backseat, actually it's my Glock partner (My Glock, partner!)
Play crazy if you want to, fuck around and get shot partner (Get shot partner!)
I don't like these niggas, and really fuck these niggas
Talk crazy in ya raps if you want, when you see me you won't touch me nigga! (Won't touch me niggas!)
Ball all around in my flip flop, you think TIP soft? Well then why don’t you try me
If you really gon' be dramatic, we gon' to need some music, they queuein' the violin
I'm talking slow singing, flower bringing
Empty a clip in you earing, and you chest thing, and you out the door
This flooded rollie make you feel some type of way (I know it do!)
Your ho be on me, know you feel some type of way (I take your ho!)
The car I’m driving make you feel some type of way (They can’t afford this nigga!)
The cash I get it make you feel some type of way (Bankrolls-R-Us!)

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
You've seen so many faces that I never seen before
I left an unrewarding message telling you to come on
Overdramatic, automatically assume I'll stay the same

[Chorus]
There's a change in pressure
We're never gonna lie to you
(Change in pressure)
My broken veins say that if my heart stops beating
We'll bleed the same way
(Change in pressure)
Oh, my broken veins say

[Verse 2]
Well, I stay tuned and listen to the news
And try to fall asleep at night
Because I'm living in a house with just three walls
So I'm always getting recognised

[Chorus]
There's a change in pressure
We're never gonna lie to you
(Change in pressure)
My broken veins say that if my heart stops beating
We'll bleed the same way
(Change in pressure)
Oh, my broken veins say

[Bridge]
Change in pressure
Change in pressure
Change in pressure
Change in pressure

[Chorus]
There's a change in pressure
We're never gonna lie to you
(Change in pressure)
My broken veins say that if my heart stops beating
We'll bleed the same way
(Change in pressure)

[Outro]
Oh, my broken veins say

[Verse 1]
Somebody told me it was pointless for me to come back
Into your arms
Said you fucked another man
Finally, I knew this day would come
Whoa, oh-oh
'Cause I see fear in your eyes
You've been living out your life
As long as you know that when I land, you're mine
It's been exactly 365 since I've seen your face
I've been livin' on the road
And you've been livin' all alone at home
Girl, I hope, he made you satisfied (kimochi)
Well, baby, I won't cry
As long as you know that when I land, you're mine

[Chorus]
And you will never feel so pretty
And you will never feel this beautiful
When I make it there
Oh, when I make it there

[Verse 2]
There are certain things that I've come to understand
Expectations can kill a simple man, simple woman, woah
I try to master the art of that far away love
But only so much can keep a woman warm
Now it's times like this that I say to myself
We've been livin' in a cold, cold world, cold world
But at least I have you to rely
Even if for a short time
As long as you know that when I land, you're mine

[Chorus]
And you will never feel so pretty
And you will never feel this beautiful
When I make it there
Oh, when I make it there
And he can't make you feel this pretty
No, he won't make you feel this beautiful
When I make it there
Oh, when I make it there

(Breakdown)

[Chorus]
And you will never feel so pretty
And you will never feel this beautiful
When I make it there
Oh, when I make it there
And he can't make you feel this pretty
No, he won't make you feel this beautiful
When I make it there
Oh, when I make it there
And you will never feel so pretty
And you will never feel this beautiful
When I make it there
Oh, when I make it there
And he can't make you feel this pretty
No, he won't make you feel this beautiful
When I make it there
Oh, when I make it there

[Outro]
Quand une putain de colombe blanche chante sa chanson
C'est tout ce qu'on entend
Les jours se défilent comme de la ficelle dans le vent
Embobiné dans ma toile, je les dévoile à nouveau
10 ans mon ami, que rien d'autre ne compte
Elle n'était qu'une gamine à ce moment
Souffrant d'un cœur brisé, une douleur très profonde
C'est là où je l'ai aperçue, seule, prête à entamer ses 17 ans

[Intro]
It's ideal, oh
You need someone to tell you how to feel
And you think your happiness is real
There's so much more the world has to reveal
But you choose to be concealed
So you're somebody now
But what's a somebody in a nobody town?
I don't think you even know it
So you're somebody now
But what's a somebody in a nobody town?
You made enough to quit a couple years ago
But it consumes you
It's everywhere you go
And just the thought alone got you trippin'
Got you losing your mind
And I don't blame you
It's everything you know
But I own this time, this ain't new
Now I decide when we're through

[Chorus]
I love, you love
This love
We're professional
I know, you know
We're sophisticated
At loving...
We're professional

[Verse 1]
What does it mean, oh
When your heart's already numb?
You're professional
Won't treat it like it's personal
No, 'cause it's just love
It always makes its way back around
It's dispensable
To fall is unacceptable
'Cause everything you've been through made you stronger
And every day, you learn about yourself
And nothing really played out how it's s'posed to
Depending on somebody else's wealth
But now you know the value of a dollar
And girl, I make enough of it to spend
I love the way you put yourself together
I love the way you make that body bend
For me again, oh yeah

[Chorus]
I love, you love
This love
We're professional
I know, you know
We're sophisticated
At loving...

[Verse 2]
All of those nights you were up barely holding your own
Girl, you've got it made
Had you blaming yourself for when life did you wrong
Now, you've got it made
Getting rich to the drums of your favorite song
Girl, you've got it made
'Cause your freedom was here in this cage all along
Oooh, how'd you drain all the soul from your eyes?
How'd you teach, teach yourself how to smile
In a world where your dreams can't be real, no?
Every touch that you sell is a lie

[Chorus]
I love, you love
This love
We're professional
I know, you know
We're sophisticated
At loving...
We're professional
We're professional

[Verse 1: The Weeknd]
Is it so hard to say the same thing?
And you're so weak to say the same thing
Burn a hole into your apprehensiveness
And let the wildfire shine
And repeat after me (like)
Good girls go to heaven
And bad girls go everywhere
And tonight I will love you
And tomorrow you won't care

[Bridge: Fox the Fox]
Precious little diamond
I leave it all to you
Precious little diamond
Let it come to you
Precious little, precious little diamond
I leave it all to you
Precious little diamond
Let it come to you
Precious little diamond

[Hook 1: The Weeknd]
You're in love with something bigger than love
You believe in something stronger than trust
Wanderlust
Wanderlust

[Verse 2: The Weeknd]
Don't you shy away from me
Just sacrifice your every last inhibition
I'm on your side
Don't patronize
You know tonight
Is the only time we'll have each other
Why would you try to waste this precious time?
'Cause tonight, we'll be right here
And tomorrow you won't care

[Bridge: The Weeknd]
Precious little diamond
Precious little diamond
I leave it all to you
I leave it all to you
Precious little diamond
Precious little diamond
Let it come to you
Precious little, precious little diamond
Precious little diamond
I leave it all to you
I leave it all to you
Precious little diamond
Precious little diamond
Let it come to you

[Hook 2: The Weeknd]
You're in love with something bigger than love
You believe in something stronger than trust
Wanderlust
Wanderlust
They're in love with this idea of love
It's a shame that they'll believe it will come
For us all, for us all
You're in love with something bigger than love
You believe in something stronger than trust
Wanderlust
Wanderlust

[Outro: The Weeknd]
Precious little diamond
Precious little diamond
I leave it all to you
I leave it all to you
Precious little diamond
Precious little diamond
Let it come to you
Precious little diamond
Precious little diamond
I leave it all to you
I leave it all to you
Precious little diamond
Precious little diamond
Let it come to you
Precious little diamond
I leave it all to you
Precious little diamond
Precious little diamond
Let it come to you
Precious little, precious little diamond
Precious little diamond
I leave it all to you
I leave it all to you
Precious little diamond
Precious little diamond
Let it come to you
Precious little diamond

[Verse 1: Euro]
I'm that Dominican nigga, your bitch be talkin' 'bout
I'm in a different city, you can fuck her now
I got a whole collection of my ho collection
Y-M-C-M-B no autocorrection
I said, "Fuck all y'all niggas, except my niggas"
Security don't check my niggas, all y'all niggas gon' respect my niggas
Either that or get a whack or get a bat to the back of the neck my nigga
Yeah that shorty with y'all with y'all, cause she never met a big dog 'til she met my niggas
Got a big dream, from a small town
Got a small circle, you never get around
Old hoes thinkin' I'mma put 'em on now
Room full of bad bitches, I'mma put 'em all down
Always been broke, who's rich now?
I ain't never had change, why switch now?
Money talks nigga, I ain't never heard shit
Til y'all heard me spit, now everything loud
Got a mojo, with a flow-flow
Got a whole load, don't know if it's a promo
Never cuff hoes, hell no that's a no-no
Coolin' in the cut with a bud sipping romo
No love for the po-po's
Gotta pour more for my niggas in the hell hole
Never tell though, I'mma need a little more dope for my uncle
Cause I sell flows and he sell dope, nigga work

[Break: Mack Maine]
Yeah, Euro
What up this Mack the fortune teller
The nigga that put y'all on Miley Cyrus
Negrodamus my nigga
Predicting futures
You need some lottery numbers holla at me nigga I got you

[Verse 2: Jae Millz]
Put a nigga in that hearse, long ass K no nina
Word to Martin I'm cold with this homie buck shots
Like Pam make a nigga say, "Damn Gina"
Millzy! Money don't mean nothing, my youngin'
I'll kill you for some sneakers
This Dedication 5, no vacations slime
We in the endzone and they in bleachers
Cheerleaders, we ain't worried 'bout nothin', nothin'
Nigga act dumb, push the button, fuck 'em
Get 'em out of here like the 6th foul in the NBA
Little nigga no discussion
Boy I'll close ya case, like judge Millz Lane
All y'all wack ass niggas stay out of Millz lane
Big guns that go over the shoulder dog
My team strapped, no overalls
So please don't make me do it, got soldiers and shooters
These bullets will swallow like shots of Kahlua
When we light up the weed then we fly like a rumor
Then hop on the plane and fly over you losers
Put racks on your head now you sleep in the sewer
I'm not from this era that beef on computers
Look boy if it's war, then all we comin' after you
Special I'm smashin ya, somethin' like Gallagher
Shots in your challenger, shots in your passenger
Hittin' your girl then I'm passing her
Jae Millz ain't worried 'bout nothin'
Young Money ain't worried 'bout nothin'
D5!

[Outro: Jae Millz]
We ain't worried 'bout nothin' (Young Money)
Nigga we ain't worried 'bout nothin' (Jae Millz)
Nigga we ain't worried 'bout nothin' (not a thing)
Nigga we ain't worried 'bout nothin' (D5)

[Chorus]
They all feel the same
Adjust to the fame
'Cause no one will love you like her
It's pointless
Like tears in the rain
So now that she's gone
Embrace all that comes
And die with a smile
Don't show the world how alone you've become
They all feel the same
Adjust to the fame
'Cause no one will love you like her
It's pointless
Like tears in the rain (Like tears in the rain, hmm)

[Verse 1]
When it's said and done
I already felt love
And I let it end up
End up dying by itself
And when it's said and done
You were better off
You deserve real love
And I deserve to be by myself
'Cause I've gone too far
And I started too young
To give up
And even if I changed
It would be too late
I exposed my ways
Now every girl I touch

[Chorus]
They all feel the same
Adjust to the fame, ooh
'Cause no one will love you like her
It's pointless
Like tears in the rain (Like tears in the rain)
So now that she's gone (Oh, no)
Embrace all that comes (Embrace all that comes)
And die with a smile
Don't show the world how alone you've become (Alone you've become)
They all feel the same

[Verse 2]
I should've let you leave
But I let you watch me slip away
I could've set you free
But I'm selfish
I watched you stay, oh, yeah

[Bridge]
She has no recollection
Of the life she had without me
She let it slip away, away, away
So sad it had to be this
She forgot the good things about me
She let it slip away, away, away
She has no recollection
Of the life she had without me
She let it slip away, away, away
So sad it had to be this
She forgot the good things about me
She let it slip away, away, away

[Chorus]
They all feel the same (Ooh)
Adjust to the fame (Adjust to the fame, baby)
'Cause no one will love you like her (No one could love me)
It's pointless (No one's gonna love me)
Like tears in the rain (No one can love no more)
So now that she's gone (Oh, now that she's gone, baby)
Embrace all that comes (Oh, embrace all that comes)
And die with a smile
Don't show the world how alone you've become (I'm not gonna show the world, oh, how alone I've become, oh)
They all feel the same (Ooh, baby, ooh, baby)
Adjust to the fame (Ohh, adjust to the fame, I ain't tryin' to be alone, baby)
'Cause no one will love you like her (No one's gonna love you no more)
It's pointless
Like tears in the rain (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
So now that she's gone (Ooh, baby, no one's gonna love me no more)
Embrace all that comes
And die with a smile
Don't show the world how alone you've become (No one's gonna love me, no, woah, yeah)

[Outro]
She has no recollection
Of the life she had without me
She let it slip away, away, away
So sad it had to be this
She forgot the good things about me
She let it slip away, away, away

[Hook]
You did many things
That I liked, that I liked
And you like diamond rings
I can provide, I can provide for you
You made me feel so good
Before I left
On the road
And you deserve your name
On a crown, on a throne
You did many things
That I liked, that I liked
And you like diamond rings
I can provide, I can provide for you
You made me feel so good
Before I left
On the road
And you deserve your name
On a crown, on a throne

[Verse 1]
I haven't been around my town in a long while
I apologize, but I
I've been trying to get this money like I got a couple kids who rely
On me
But I remember on the bathroom floor
'Fore I went on tour
Like you said we couldn't do it again
Cause you had a thing with some other man
You said it was love
And you said you were lost
Then you wished me good luck
To find somebody to love
But, oooh
Now I've heard that you're single
And uh huh, I'll give you something to live for
Yes, I will

[Verse 2]
Honey, please
You never thought you'd ever see my face again
But your love just swayed the lies
When he stared into your eyes
He just might be too good for you
You're almost dead to him
You're sleeping with a frozen heart
Well baby girl it's over now
And you can always count on me
Your unshackled boy, unrestrained to touch
So immune to love
And it feels so priceless to me
That you're always free
That you'll take me in
Now I'm everything, your everything
I bet you'll take me in
I know you'll take me in now
The same place I left you in (we)
I bet you'll take me in
I know you'll take me in, I know you'll take me in
The same place I left you in

[Breakdown]
We
Who?
Oooh...
Oooooooh...
No ho...
Let her know...

[Hook]
You did many things
That I liked, that I liked
And you like diamond rings
I can provide, I can provide for you
You made me feel so good
Before I left
On the road
And you deserve your name
On a crown, on a throne

[Verse One]
Uh, I'm flying private through Cloud 9
Yeah, if you got a problem, I'm Einstein
Yeah, I'm yawnin', I'm so tired of ballin'
Yeah, only selling work to them workaholics
Got guns bigger than you nigga, I don't fuck with new niggas
I blues your bitch ass, hope somebody give you rhythm
I got animal all in my floor, take your shoes off at the door
Niggas feed these bitches lies, nigga don't food poison my ho
I buy my drugs for the low, like a coupon on at the store
My niggas like Kanye with that good, my niggas like Lou Rawls with that blow
Niggas be sayin' they racked up, don't let that Q-ball leave you broke
I know you want a pat on the back, but then those fools goin' see you choke
I saw your bitch and she said, she tryin' to move on and let go
Boy, I get up in that pussy and hit her with moves you don't even know
Niggas be trippin' over these hoes, I done came too far to get close
I've been outchea gettin' bread and I don't need you all in my loaf
If you stick your neck out there, I'll have my goon's all at your throat
Niggas be lukewarm at the most and when I'm through ballin' I coach
Shout out to my nigga Mack gettin' his boo on in that Ghost
I'm still coming off the top of the dome but it'd be on a tombstone if I wrote, Tunechi

[Hook]
My kids already rich and they don't even know
These nigga's sayin' they playa's, they ain't even scored
My bitch rolling my weed, she don't even smoke
Everybody following me, I ain't even Moses, nigga

[Verse Two]
Uh, my cologne illegal in nine countries
I found a way like it was hiding from me
Yeah, my weed good, my sex better
Bitch, don't text me no long letters
I'm ahead of the game, I need a blowjob
Most of these ho's ain't got no job
And these niggas goin' buy em' everything
You goin' fuck around, and get the ho robbed
I'm ahead of the game, I need a haircut
Used to hug the block, I mean bear hug
And tell them rats the AK go Rat-a-Tat, like snare drums
I woke up this morning, dick rock hard, dick harder than a armadillo
MLK would be proud of me, cause I do this shit for all my niggas
Her mouth, pussy, or asshole, life is full of hard decisions
If she ain't fuckin', she get the boot, let me write this bitch a parking ticket
Ain't got time for love life, all I know is get paid
I'm high like Bonjour, twisted like french braids
I got my own shoes, SLIME, T, I feel like MJ
I'm working that graveyard shift, man these niggas been dead

[Hook]
Uh, I feel asleep in that pussy and I didn't even know
I woke up and acted like I didn't even know her, yeah
Don't fuck with these fuck niggas, you already know us
I'm looking for that loud pack, weedman bring the noise
Yeah

[Verse Three]
Pass that weed to the next nigga, blunt longer than a tongue twista
Hoes want this scud missile, I'mma ball, like Crystal
Lil Tunchi Li, young sex pistol, new money, no wrinkles
I'm hard headed, Ocho, Dedication Cinco, uh

[Outro]
What up 5?
Rocko fuck with me! Yeah!
Future fuck with me! Yeah!
T, I feel like MJ
I'm working that graveyard shift, man these niggas been dead
5!

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
I love all my bitches, that's my fuckin' problem
A two dollar bill is still a couple dollars
And if any one of them niggas got a fuckin' problem
I'mma milk all of 'em cause they fuckin' cowards
I love red bitches, there's just something 'bout 'em
But I'm gettin' better pussy from a brown one
Been schoolin' y'all niggas, I'm your alma mater
I'm the shit, where the fly swatter

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
I know you dykin' who you eatin' on
Make me think about all them nights we got a threesome on
Make me think about how you suck it like your teeth are gone
If your friends hatin' on you, fuck 'em to each his own, yessir
I do my drugs then I sleep 'em off
Like it just be callin' me, I need to turn my ringer off
Ain't a fuckin' singalong unless you brought the weed along
That kush, okay I got it, that kush
Cop pounds and put my people on
We can take the stairs up to the stars that's where we belong
Fuck that shit you talk, I beat that pussy like production
Or like Rocky, beat the Russian, or like Jordan, beat the buzzer
Nigga, gimme what you've got, take that money like an usher
One man band, all you hear is repercussion
Told a bitch, too much selfish gonna lead to self destruction
She looked me in my eyes and said
Man, I ain't worried 'bout nothin', I said shorty, you a beast

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
I love bad bitches, okay, what's the problem
If she thinks she gonna come up then I'mma fuckin' drown her
I'm wilder than public schools and public housing
Can't afford failure, I'm just browsing
I was 15 with $100,000
And if you talk trash I'mma fuckin' possum
And nigga, if your bitch got eye problem
You know what it is, armed robbery
Tunechi

[Verse 2: Euro]
I heard 'em tell me "Go get 'em, young"
I haven't seen a movie since I started livin' one
I be in a room full of bitches gettin' drunk
Smokin' like a point guard, no look, passin' blunts
Fuck you talkin' 'bout? Euro, this and that
Wanna walk in these shoes? Have the outfit to match
And niggas schemin' on what I had, but
We gon' put money in the bag or a body in the bag (You choose)
And all these new bitches old news
Throwin' stacks at 'em like "That's prolly gon' bruise"
And every dream girl that I fucked came true
Now every night feels like deja vu
And the hatin's no use, she ain't waitin' on you
I tell a baby, "Tell ya man kick rocks with no shoes"
And I murder that pussy, and I ain't leave a clue
Cause I put her on her knees and made her swallow all the proof
That sick shit, I'm ill, yeah, I'm a fuckin' problem
I'm fine wit' it, though, bitches like fuckin' problems
And I can't solve shit if I'm the fuckin' problem
Just know I got 'em, let me know if there's a fuckin' problem
Out the city, but you can't take the city out 'em
I know these hoes well, see the water spittin' out 'em?
Long story short, money always colorblind
She blew the team for some Red Bottoms
(Euro)

[Verse 3: Kidd Kidd]
I love bad bitches, that's my fuckin problem
Had a few ugly bitches but I had to hide em
Can't live with em, Can't live without em
Can't trust them hoes poking holes up in condoms
Put a S on her breast, she a supermodel
If you swallow these kids, does that make you childish
Now she say I got a fuckin problem
Because I fucked her once and gave a fuck about her
Her hair blown out like the 80s
I drive these bitches crazy, mental asylum should pay me
I ain't looking for a lady, call Will Smith to get you hitched
I ain't looking for a wife, I need a one night trick
That can ride it like that, suck it like this
Hit it from the back in the back of the whip
I'm a mac, I'm a pimp girl
You don't need make up, put this mac on your lips
She drive a X5, beefin' with her ex man
Baby Ima dog and a DMX fan
Told myself I wouldn't mess with my ex again
Popped a lil x then i tried explain
I keep it too real to ever be a lame
Too many girls in this world, you all be lame
She all on my dick cause I got street fame
Told that thirsty ass bitch don't speak my name
Kidd Kidd, a nut from the 9
Tell em don't worry bout me I'm just fine
Girl if you comin' with me then let's ride
I know you want money so don't waste my time
Uh, wear that ass out fuck her till we pass out
Fuck a hotel, we goin' to my mans house
Scratch that your baby mama was an Amtrak
We treat that pussy like some good weed and pass that
Yeah, to my niggas, she fuck my niggas
Bought some bitches, and she was wit' it
With you she wasn't, but she did it
She let you lick it, but never stick it
You be trippin, you say you fallin
Nigga you slippin, stupid ass nigga tryna' fall in love
If i fall it's gon be from too many drugs
You asking questions, bout what she was
With the rider game, she told you in the club

[Hook:Meek Mill]
Scared money don't make no money
Scared money don't make no money
Scared money don't make no money
If I ever go broke I'mma take yo money

[Verse 1:Yellowz]
Scared money won't make no money
I be stacking up racks if i ever did make it
Like damn these haters that tryna hold me back
I thought I couldn't make it
I never knew if I was gifted
I've been tryna make some new changes
Got these niggas motivated
But i ain't even educated
I never listened to no shit
I've been tryna make a hit
On this fucking remix
If you come across me
(gunshot!)
I've been living life all broke
Nigga this ain't no joke
I've been aiming for those gold
Born with a sick flow
Fucking each and different hoes
Nigga that's how it goes
Cause this is how we roll
Nigga I ain't telling no lies I gon shine so bright it'll make your eyes blind
I gon work all day i gont hustle no break
I'm never scared no money i just go and tryna get it
Fuck you niggas that tryna stop me

[Hook:Meek Mill]
Scared money don't make no money
Scared money don't make no money
Scared money don't make no money
If I ever go broke I'mma take yo money
Give me models with semi-autos
And many Glock fo's in they Fendi ponchos
Kissimmee Saint Cloud condos
You want it pronto
You hit it on the head like congos
My entourage is
Like that of Malik el-Shabazz Hajj's
Those that choose not to dodge us
Bullet lodges
Like water buffalo better get
Hustler ettiquette
Move rocks like Frederick
And your dames I entertain
Like my first name Cederick
Like Max Julien how I max jewely them
Or any other chicken that listens for more than 40 seconds
Me and shorty steppin, left in the dust is the previous player who
Game wasn't up to par with thus such as ours
See thats where the jealousy starts, the ice grills begin and the weaponry sparks
So I'm forced to keep a gun up in the drawers and a, vest tight like a woman wit some balls
Pause... never
Niggas stall like public bathrooms
I move fast, while they assume
Positions I be splittin and gettin gone
They wanna take me off the wicker throne that I sit upon
Like Huey Newton but Luey shootin in Louis Vuitton, movie viewin, hoochie doin'
With a chick similar to Lucy Liu an' only Cuban
Transmittin, these ghetto laws like the transitions
See the heroin that my man siftin'
I move it to death
Like my hands spittin, from my lungs to my tounge to my gums to the guns that my hands liftin
Stay riffin Mercedez Benz sedan whippin
Extra heavy coppin, set up every block and buy out every bag of plastic wrap saran rippin
Nigga, nigga... yeeeah!
Now Julie ran a jewelry store had a friend named Gwen
Who had a Benz named Sin
223 4 burgundy the color currency her mother
Wore a lady mueller 17 carats maybe cooler
Navy maybe bluer say she pay 80 maybe fewer
Prada topper gucci shoer
Light skin 5'10" and slim and had something real shady to her
On the daily Julie tried to play me to her
Said that she can take me to a place in Aruba
Where they puff buddha from hookas while sippin cups of lewer
Steady frontin like she somethin how a hundred wasn't nothing to her
But through all the diamonds, Pradas last season I even trying to believe in
I think she lieing conniving deceiving she look like the type that like to mislead men
But I could be misreading miss taught never underestimate underspeculate even
She say she used to run with Steven, good nigga but hes no longer breathin'
You see I heard he used to mess with checks til he got it indirect
They shot him in his chest head left honking his van horn like the Nets
Cellphone in his cupholder, chrome in his gun holster
They got the drop on em put the full Fox and Glocks on em
Thought he was invincible, the pinnacle of tough guy material
Left his rocks on him ??buggets?? and ??secks?? thats invisible
Much like the ones I wear one eyed stare looking at her crazy yeah
I know about Aruba we got a crib on the coast
2 yachts barbeque chicken wings on the boats
Much white northern light to smoke and 13 to toast but
Thats for my niggas I never partake in the smoking marijuanas
Or the drinking of the liquors and I ain't got nothing for you
I'm nothing cordial, type send you to buy for you

Take a stack off the loot and scoop, nigga nigga

[Intro: Lil Chuckee]
Man...Mike, cut something on!
Man, they don't never let me get on nothin' dog
Man cut-man cut-man cut something on, man!
Man, hurry up though, before Tune get back, come on!
Yeah, D5 motherfucker!
It's Tunechi Jr. bitch!
Pops, lemme go ahead and get 'em one time, ya heard me?
Hol' up!

[Verse: Lil Chuckee]
Turn my motherfuckin' mic on
And I ain't leavin' 'til the motherfuckin' lights on
This ain't a dick, this a motherfuckin' python
And if it's war call me, fuck Tyrone
You know what? It's time for y'all niggas to sit
Big ass house, no room for bullshit
Such and such told me, "Chuck, you ain't rich!"
Well tell such and such they can suck my dick
Cause I got a lot of sperm if you need it, sperm if you need it
I made you go crazy for no fuckin' reason
I beat you pussy niggas up 'til you start bleedin'
Menstrual cycle, fuck it, go ahead bleach 'em
Diarrhea, I'm running this shit, I'm just gettin' my laps on
All my niggas strapped up and y'all pussy niggas got strap-ons
Bitch we breed this 5-stars, bitch we bleed these 5-stars
YMCMB, you can come get fucked by 5 stars!
She ain't got too comfortable, I done made her stupid ass walk home
I kill the beat the barrel on the yopper round as a motherfuckin' Super Dome
You know I'm a fuckin' beast, yeah I'm a fuckin' creep
You could get these 30 clips if you wanna make a scene
Tune let me off the leash, now I run the fucking streets
Two fingers in her pussy, then I tell her pussy, "Peace!"
It's Chuckee, she say, "Yo' name Chuckee?"
I said, "No, my name's Suck Me!"
Introduce you to T if your stupid ass lucky
Fuke roll 'em fat, kinda got my nose stuffy
All my niggas on gas, Quik Trip
And all my niggas gon' blast this shit
See, all y'all niggas doin' bad and shit
So really I'mma act a fuckin' ass this year
Trukfit on my neck, that Truk mean I'll truck your ass
She got junk up in her trunk, I guess it's time to take out the trash
And you thought this shit was over
Got paper like a fuckin' school folder
If her grass ain't cut, get the lawnmower
Tony, tell them bitches it's Libra gang
Vocal lessons, let the nina sing
Before I leave up out this bitch, they gon' know my fuckin' name
Birdman Jr. Junior! Fuck a dog, bitch I got a puma
Man these niggas' pussies stink, no wonder why I was smellin' tuna
Lame ass boys don't want no trouble, pussy niggas just a bunch of suckers
Smashing all they moms, you could call me a motherfucker
Man I'm about to act an ass and this shit here? Just a little tease
Pull big willie out my pants and all them girls say, "Hercules!"
Bitch I'm livin' B.I.G., my gun is little cease
If that girl don't pop it off, I'll just skeet right on her weave
Okay that gold pack in my pocket; I'm like a rag up in a socket?
And when I cock that nina nine, you better not cock block me
YM be the shit, I say, "Damn everybody else"
I be kicking girls out the condo, I got a black belt
Big bro said, "It's your time nigga"
You heard what the fuck the man said
Boy I body these verses, that's why they cost a arm and a leg
Left that coochie smokin', she gon' fail her drug test
My chain on freeze, call my shit under arrest
I'm gone!

[Outro]
Mike turn the mic off dog!
Fuck, I'm just playing around dog
Man cut the beat off before Tune get back!

[Verse 1]
Y'all don't want no problems up in here
These niggas wear dresses and y'all call me weird nigga?
Go in niggas' pockets while we here
What kind of cologne do you wear because all I could smell is fear nigga
Y'all don't want no problems up in here
Boy I'm from New Orleans where the dope fiends kill niggas
Brains came out his fucking ear
I got a full clip, I empty the whole thing up in here
Now I'mma keep a pill and a blunt
I might pass the motherfucker but most likely I'mma flunk
Tell my bitch I could do bad on my own
She say "You gon' miss me nigga." I say "Bitch the thrill is gone"
I ain't drove it look better in the driveway
Married to the MOB, man you niggas just some bridesmaids
Bitches give me head instead of playing mind games
Tattooed tears for my homies, it's a cryin' shame
You could get a Dom P bottle to your face
Niggas just construction workers, trynna build a case
Males shouldn't be jealous that's a female trait
Why your bitch blowing me up? If I answer, I deflate
Motherfucker I'm like
Y'all don't want no problems up in here
I fuck her 'til she cry, make that ho drink her fuckin' tears
Lord, I hope she swallow more than tears
Then her homegirl came in the room and volunteered
Man, dreads hanging out the ski mask
Run up in your house, the couch potatoes getting mashed
Run up in the kitchen get your stash out the oven
You wonder how we know? stop talking while you cuddlin'
Ain't nothing like some pussy when you going through something
Just called a bad bitch, I said I'm going through something
Bugatti sitting still, look like it's going 200
Pussy nigga keep your mouth closed like you chew onions
Mother fucker I'm like
Y'all don't want no problems up in here
Rather be judged by my jewelry, not a jury of my peers
And I got some kush to hide in her brassiere
And we only selling what the boat bring here nigga
Y'all don't want no problems up in here
Cause I got shooters on the roof like some fucking reindeer
And I'm probably with the model of the year
I'm about to go Pac with the nose ring up in here
Uh, lifestyles of the rich and famous
Young Money motherfucking Entertainment
And y'all know Marley got the chopper up in here
Yeah, me, myself and I, the fucking Three Musketeers
Smoke like I fucking disappeared
I check your pussy ass, and wait for it to clear nigga
Tunechi, everybody know your name like Cheers, nigga
Started from the bottom now my whole team here nigga!
Tunechi!

[Outro]
Yeah, D5
Whatup Five?
Worry bout me, give a fuck about you
Just as a reminder to myself
Bust every single nut in her motherfucking mouth
I'm like, Lord I hope she swallow more than tears...

[Verse 1]
Come to me
In all your glamour and cruelty
Just do that thing that you do
And I'll undress you
Keep it tight
Sometimes the simplest move is right
The melody that you choose
Can rescue you

[Pre-Chorus 1]
A hybrid can withstand these things
My heart can beat with bricks and strings
My ARTPOP could mean anything

[Chorus]
We could, we could belong together (ARTPOP)
We could, we could belong together (ARTPOP)
We could, we could belong together (ARTPOP, ARTPOP, ARTPOP)

[Verse 2]
Come to me
With all your subtext and fantasy
Just do that thing that you do
In a perverse hue
Lovers' kites
Are flown on beaches for public sight
The color palette you choose
Could profit you

[Pre-Chorus 2]
A hybrid can withstand these things
My heart can beat with bricks and strings
My ARTPOP could mean anything
Could try to sell you out or I
Could show you all the reasons why
My ARTPOP could mean anything

[Chorus]
We could, we could belong together (ARTPOP)
We could, we could belong together (ARTPOP)
We could, we could belong together (ARTPOP, ARTPOP, ARTPOP)

[Bridge]
Brushes of darkness won't help you create Your destiny of self
But ARTPOP could mean anything
Anything
I try to sell myself, but I am really laughing
Because I just love the music, not the bling
Music, not the bling

[Chorus]
We could, we could belong together (ARTPOP)
We could, we could belong together (ARTPOP)
We could, we could belong together (ARTPOP, ARTPOP, ARTPOP)
We could, we could belong together (ARTPOP)
We could, we could belong together (ARTPOP)
We could, we could belong together (ARTPOP, ARTPOP, ARTPOP)

[Outro]
Free my mind
ARTPOP
You make my
Heart stop

[Intro: T.I.]
Yeah
It's about that time, yeah, haha
Time to take off, partner, alright?
Hustle Gang, uh-huh, G-D-O-D
Get your doe or die, partner
Yup, leggo (Ayy)

[Verse 1: T.I.]
Still Bankhead, shawty, yeah, you know what it is
Pockets full of numbers, rubber bands, and bills
Came up from 'round, that's a Dandiville
They finna do a deal, about 60 mil'
You ain't lived that life, you perpetrate
You wasn't really trappin', servin' birds of yay
You ain't have to beat no murder case
Man, you probably couldn't get a O of every day
'Round my way, cats get murder planned
Ain't no rules, play dirty, man
Put somethin' through your jersey, man
If your partner want some, we can do it again
Okay, H-U-S-T-L-E
G-G-G-A-N-G, yeah, that way
Just pull up, pull up, hop out, hop out
All about the dollar, better go and ask Gaga

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
Don't want your jewels, I want your drugs
Don't want your money, want your love
Don't want your jewels, I want your drugs
Want your jewels, I want your drugs
Don't want your money, want your love

[Verse 2: Lady Gaga]
I admit that my habit's expensive
And you may find it quite offensive
But I won't die at the hands of another
I'm your mother, sister, your father, brother
This family is stupid attractive
If you've surveyed the way we've acted
Keep it comin', I'm comin' around like your friend now
I think you should shut up and sit down

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
Don't want your jewels, I want your drugs
Don't want your money, want your love
Don't want your jewels, I want your drugs
Want your jewels, I want your drugs
Don't want your money, want your love

[Verse 3: Too $hort]
Everybody want that money, what you want?
High as hell, tryna have some fuckin' fun
I don't need 'em, but the diamonds make it shine (Shine)
Tried to kick it, just can't find the time
It's the middle of the week, this ain't even the weekend
Red carpet events, every time you see pimps
It's good pussy in the passenger seat
My lil' homies hang with me, I be passin' 'em freaks (Bitch)

[Bridge: Lady Gaga]
Jewels and drugs, play that hustle
Smother 'em if you wanna be bad
Slap honey on a young pancake
We know how to make that money
Jewels and drugs, play that hustle
Smother 'em if you wanna be bad
Ain't nothin' if it ain't family
We know how to make that money

[Verse 4: Twista]
Come and show me the gateway into your love
I feel like the money can never do it like the club
And I feel like a diamond can never do it like a drug
And I want it so come on and take it with me so that I can hit it
I can admit it, I'm influenced by desire when I approach her
I try to provoke her by givin' money and jewelry and accessories
Instead of the recipe of a legacy of takin' her to another place when I get it
Hold up
Twista be goin' in warp speed, breakin' atoms
Blowin' O.G. has got me creating antimatter
Let her pop it and smoke on it with me, now I got her
Because she be ready to party and then move to the club (Yes)
Because you know the way I think is an anomaly
And I'ma be strange as Lady Gaga
Probably a dollar be the business
But I'd rather be in an outer dimension when I be talkin' about jewels and drugs

[Outro: Lady Gaga]
Jewels and drugs, play that hustle
Smother 'em if you wanna be bad
Slap honey on a young pancake
We know how to make that money
Jewels and drugs, play that hustle
Smother 'em if you wanna be bad
Ain't nothin; if it ain't family
We know how to make that money

[Verse 1]
It's off, it's on
The party's just begun
Take off, and run
Let's celebrate the fun of being young
I don't wanna grow up
I don't wanna grow up

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause when the lights come on
You lift me up, and I feel strong

[Chorus]
I won't be right without you
And I might break without you
I'd rather be poor and happy than rich and alone
I'll write hit songs about you
No matter how, we'll get through
I'll keep on singing while I'm living, but I wanna be in love
And I wanna be with you
This one's for you

[Verse 2]
Lights off, lights on
The music has begun
Rely, or run
Get the bad guy's gun
I love the songs that you play
And I don't care what they say
'Cause I was born this way

[Pre-Chorus]
And I hear you scream, I hit the top of the stage
And close my eyes, and know exactly who I am
Oh-oh

[Chorus]
And I won't be right without you
And I might break without you
I'd rather be poor and happy than rich and alone
I'll write hit songs about you
No matter how, we'll get through
I'll keep on singing while I'm living, but I wanna be in love
And I wanna be with you
This one's for you

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
I won't be right without you
And I might break without you
I'd rather be poor and happy than rich and alone
I'll write hit songs about you
No matter how, we'll get through
I'll keep on singing for a living, but I wanna be in love
And I, I wanna be with you
This one's for you

[Verse 1]
She say my dickhead need a crown on it
She say my cum tastes like holy water
She say she get hiccups just thinkin' of me
I said, "Next time, bring your drinkin' buddy"
I told her, this that Dedication 5
And anything else is a consolation prize
I said, "I'm cumming," she say, "Take your time"

[Hook]
Yeah, I told her take her drawers off and she says I ain't wearin' none
I asked her, "Who this pussy for?" She said "Ransom"
And when she says "I Love You", I say, "Shut up, take this dick"
She treat me like a God and tell her man she atheist
And then he calls with all that bitchin'
"Who is this?" She busy, call her later

[Verse 2]
Now we switchin' positions, we in here getting creative
I put Champagne on her titties, then sip it out her navel, boy
I live in pussy, let me speak to my neighbors, I say
Clean the puke off of the toilet bowl
Treat the pussy like revolving doors
Ran outta rubbers at the corner store
She in my ear, like "What you want them for?"
Well, give me brains since you a smart-aleck
Fuck her all night and don't smell it
Open her mind like a watermelon, haha, you jealous

[Hook]
I told her take her drawers off and she says I ain't wearin' none
I asked her who this pussy for, she said ransom
And when she says "I Love You", I say,  "Shut up, take this dick"
She treat me like a God and tell her man she atheist
He on that phone with all that bitchin'
"Who is this?" She busy, call her later
Now we kissin', we twisted, my dick in a tornado
She say, "Hit it," I hit it, I hit it raw like yayo, I admit it

[Bridge]
(That fuckin' corner store man)
Uh, we makin' love like money
Yeah, yeah, like money
Like money
Told her this that Dedication 5
Dedication 5
I killed that pussy, it came back to life

[Hook]
I told her take her drawers off and she said "Why you playin' dumb?"
I asked her "Who this pussy for?" She didn't answer
And she say "Ooh, I love you," I said "Shut up, take this dick"
Would tell her say my name, but I gave her an alias

[Verse 3]
And oh my god she swallowed triplets, she gripped with
The hand that rocks the cradle, I'm so lifted, what is this? This here a Dedication
It was scripted, predicted, and shout out to my skaters
Boy, I live in pussy, let me speak to my neighbors, I say

[Outro]
D5
What up 5?
I told her this that Dedication 5
We makin' love like money

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
I can't trust these niggas, throw some water on 'em,
They tell me "Go to Hell," Okay I know the owner
Strip clubs gettin old all the strippers hoein'
All these bitches think they dimes, watch me flip a coin

It’s that Dedication 5 and another one, I love it!
Tunechi

[Bridge]
Yeah, free Scooter, I'm outchea

[Verse 2]
I done lost a couple hoes but I'm still a pimp

Just looking for a bitch to stay down like I'm throwing knives

I really beat that pussy up them niggas shadow box
These niggas sending threats, I'mma start sending hits
Bring me his head, so I can make sure its him
It's lonely at the top, it's lonely at the top
I think I'm 'bout to jump, niggas phony as a prop
Ain't nothing on me but this chop, turn you, your homies into slop
Put your brains all over the window, people passing window shop
Like ugh, this that pure Columbia
It's just us, fuck the rest we got insomnia
Most likely I done fucked that bitch that's laying under ya
She said she trying to see me, bitch that's Stevie Wonderful

And these... niggas saying they the truth

Keep a brand new bitch, bout to get her ribbon cut
Rich, but I ain't rich enough
Your bitch is down, you bitchin up
Rolls Royce, topless, it's about to get titty fucked

[Verse 2: Euro]
Okay, live my life, have no fun, 'less you give my niggas some
Live my life, what the fuck, can't recall me giving one
Live my life, have my fun, fuck like I don't give a fuck
And question, who the realest niggas?
Okay, that's a given one
Well welcome to the murder show
Show starts when the curtains close
Pass the scalpel to me, on my open-hearted surgeon flow
Why are all these coppers trippin?
Bitches down there, searching clothes
Yeah, I'm drinking stupid
What the fuck you think I'm swerving for?
Look, I be with that nigga from New Orleans
Who be asking if you heard me, even though he wasn't talking
Seen a straight chick do some dyke shit and didn't pause
And she was probably brokenhearted
I'm so gone, I probably caused it
I'm just saying
They ain't fucking with me
Bet they talking bout murdering me
But, look, Tune, I just don't see the killer in these niggas
2Pac's hologram was realer than these niggas

[Verse 3: T@]
I'm a get this money, live my life and ball like I don't give a fuck
Get this money, live my life and ball like I don't give a fuck
Get this money, live my life and ball like I don't give a fuck
Rudy Gays up on the coupe, and Black Mambas on the Truck
I'm a dream chaser for stacking cheddar
I'm in my Olympic Dream Team's Retros Number 7s
What you know about getting money?
Hop out the coupe, I got your bitch in there, I leave the engine running
I hit the block, talk shit, roll a few stogies
Pop a bar, kill a lil' time on my Rollie
David Copperfield, I make a hundred disappear
Like I know magic, but ball like Jordan
Nigga hating on my new deal, James Harden
I guess cause I'm the shit, and you lil' niggas fartin'
With the weed, I did coke numbers, real talk
A buck fifty every three months, real talk

[Verse 4: Lil Wayne]
W-T-F, what the fuck nigga?
Tell them fuck niggas get the fuck nigga
Now who the fuck is with the fuck nigga?
It's just us, it's just us nigga
We the fuss nigga

And we don't fuck with snitches trying to bust niggas
So tell them fuck niggas get the fuck nigga
I'm a live my life, have my fun, skate like I don't give a fuck
Live my life, have my fun, act like I don't give a fuck
Get this money, live my life, and ball like I don't give a fuck
Smoke weed with the windows up
High as fuck, but inching up
Pussy niggas tensing up
Are these niggas men or what?
I got your bitch antennas up
Money talks, your minutes up
You can judge us, but don't sentence us
Blow me like the wind would gust
We trukfit and we supered up
W-T-F, who to fuck?

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
And this, bitch I'm rolling with is cute
And her ass on fire
And the whole time, I ain't feel a tooth
Then I ate that pussy 'til I lost a diamond and I'm gone...

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Man all you pussy niggas drive me crazy
Make me sick to my stomach, I feel nauseated
All you haters hold hands and jump off a building
I could still taste her pussy, memorabilia
Backpack full of artillery, one me, no equivalent
These niggas acting like lil bitches
I don’t understand this shit like you scribbled it
Took her clothes, step back and exhibit it
Then tear her ass up like a parking ticket
The end of the road is at walking distance
Have to get that blood off my hands, left the faucet drippin
In yo face like a airbag in a car collision
My weed man so consistent
I’m stayin rich, tryin not to make poor decisions
Everything I do I plan it out like a solar system
Nigga if you clumsy you gon slip and fall a victim to me
Your bitch is sendin' naked pictures to me
Then she shoot over to my house, I scoot over in a bed
I shoot off in her mouth then she bit the bullet uh
Skatin on em like I’m Lil Wayne
And the weed so strong I can feel veins
Write it down, take a picture, now I feel framed
The drugs got me so numb I can’t feel ashamed
And my girl at home with the mood swings
Girl I gotta make a few runs like Usain
Wish I had a penny for my thoughts for some loose change
Hungry niggas going at yo neck for that food chain
Pop some pills that make me sleepy
Hoes creep me in they Teepee
I hope that pussy taste like kiwi
Hope it’s nicer than Tahiti, hopin I could get a freebie
Leavin a nigga body floatin with a mouth full of seaweed
What's in my Louis backpack, that’s E.T
Snitches give me the heebeegeebees
I hope they’ll disappear, where the fuck is Houdini?
I got niggas on my side, you got niggas on yo back
I’mma yell timber, money grow on trees
Money over queens, fuck you blow me
I sit back enjoy the breeze, hoes prettier than please
I don’t really do shit but sit back and call the shots
She poured out her heart, I had it on the rocks
Red beam on yo head, that’s a cherry on top
You don’t wanna keep your cool, I know niggas that’ll die uh
I danced with the devil in my dreams
When I wake up I still hear the same song
Make me wanna blow a motherfucker brains out
Flood warning nigga, I’m about to brainstorm, lil nigga
I’ll take yo main ho, make her call her homegirl
Make em share the same dick
It’s that motherfuckin Dedication 5
I just hope I’ll be alive to see a Dedication 6
Lil Tunechi

[Verse 2: Vado]
Ayo it’s levels to this shit, levels to this shit
Been doing MIA since Levels was the shit
And niggas know I’m on another level with this shit
I’m pedaling the 6, full metal when it hit
All I need is a shovel and a ditch
You done dig me a hole then you show me where it is
Run in his home and show me where the kids
Put one in his dome while he going in his fridge
That’s me, him nigga
Black piece AP, gold trim nigga
Black jeans, grey tee, old Tim’s nigga
Backstreet, everything go for 10 nigga
Keep quiet, beef we deep fry it
I’m in the streets like Rodney King’s riots
Mommy opposed their lead tight
On that old bullshit, Pete Myers
They scream and seize fire
My audible like Godfather meets Wire
A felon in the whip
Rollin 3 6’s, devil on trips
Shots whistled like a kettle when it’s lit
I’m tryin to go ballistic, shadow in the ship
Call the Barney Rubble in the whip
Made her kick rocks, blow haze from ziplocks uh

[Hook: Gudda Gudda]
I’m a east side nigga but my homies from uptown
I’m a east side nigga but my homies from uptown
I’m a east side nigga

[Verse 1: Gudda Gudda]
I got the 2-2-3 cocked, I point it at yo melon
Loose lips sink ships so ain’t no motherfucking telling
I’m a east side nigga but my homies from uptown
Gas up the minivan, put the pumps in the trunk
Now I be sippin on something, they got me tilt to the side
All black ski mask, red chinese eyes
Now I’ve been hungry for years, I’mma take yo plate
I’ma eat yo steak dead in yo face
I woke up on a mission, I got 2 women I ride with
One named Nina and that yapper my side bitch
We size niggas up so wisely choose who you side with
Got something on my side that pack a kick – that’s my sidekick
I’m about that paper, roll the dice and get paid
And they can’t bite the hand I’m feeding with, I’m holding grenades
So I’mma talk my shit, I’mma live my life
I’mma nail yo girl, shit I did that twice
Gudda!

[Hook: Gudda Gudda]
I’m a east side nigga
I’m a east side nigga but my homies from uptown
I’m a east side nigga but my homies from uptown

[Verse: Lil Wayne]
Money don’t make itself
These niggas gon make me kill em
I should probably see a shrink but I’m afraid he’ll make me little
I’ve been a beast since I could remember
I got too many hoes, that’s my dilemma
Chop yo fuckin head off and put it on the front of my car like the emblem
Get em, I got Mike Banger on the beat, I got this banger on display
I just test-drove a new Lamborghini and got a A
Got a billion bitches, I’m lookin for the one that got away
And since all these niggas watching, ask them for the time of day
Fuck yall niggas I’m skating
Got yo ho at the skate park waiting
That dick keep her coming back, motherfucking reincarnation
I don’t want that pussy if it's spatious
Just give me fellatio
My bitch named Gigi give me head, I be like goodness gracious, fuck
Hi, my name is Tune, it’s nice to eat ya
I still keep that gun like a secret
Another one bites the dust, would you like to eat it?
Boy I have the people looking for you like a reason uh
You don't want to hit my blunt cause I been eating pussy all day
This gun got a hair trigger, I pull this bitch til it’s bald head
Ye ain’t got no bars nigga
Recharge, you going dead
Can’t kill me, I was born dead
Crowned of thorns head
Devil horns red, have my barn head
I’m a serial killer, yo lucky charm dead
And that trash bag, they find you arm leg leg leg arm head
Oh what a tangled web we weave I feel like daddy long legs
Hop out that Ferrari Spider for my boys at Rikers and all my lifers
My bitch say my dick is great
But I make her say it like Tony the Tiger
I own a rifle and I’m on the edge
I bop bop and I’m ridin off
I’m devastation, I’m Freddy Jason, Dedication 5, 5 stars
Tunechi

[Verse 1]
The greatest line in history:
Baby it’s not you, it’s me
What you think I’m dumb, dumb, babydoll?
I’m big enough and bad enough
And I can tell when things get rough
Now nothing that you say can break my fall

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, oh
Stop right there
Oh, oh
If you really care

[Chorus]
Don’t go and blow it all, it’s bad enough baby
I don’t wanna hear you sayin' it’s not you, it’s me
If there’s blood on my hands, you should let me know
If you’re done with the dance, you should let me go
Baby you said it all
There’s nothing you can say to break my fall

[Verse 2]
Greatest lie in history:
Baby it’s not you, it’s me
Do you really think I’ll buy your bullshit boy?
Ooh-oh-oh-oh
Give a girl her self respect
You haven’t gone and hurt me yet
But you know that I’ll crumble if you call

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, oh
Stop right there
Oh, oh
If you really care

[Chorus]
Don’t go and blow it all, it’s bad enough baby
I don’t wanna hear you sayin' it’s not you, it’s me
If there’s blood on my hands, you should let me know
If you’re done with the dance, you should let me go
Baby you said it all
There’s nothing you can say to break my fall

[Post-Chorus]
Break my fall
Oh, oh
Oh, oh

[Bridge]
I’m not gonna let you become a martyr
Not gonna let you pick up the gun
I’m gonna make this a whole lot harder
Won’t make it easy for you to run
I’m not gonna let you become a martyr
Not gonna let you pick up the gun
I’m gonna make this a whole lot harder
Won’t make it easy for you to run

[Chorus]
Don’t go and blow it all, it’s bad enough baby
I don’t wanna hear you sayin' it’s not you, it’s me
If there’s blood on my hands, you should let me know
If you’re done with the dance, you should let me go
Baby you said it all
There’s nothing you can say to break my fall
Don’t go and blow it all, it’s bad enough baby
I don’t wanna hear you sayin' it’s not you, it’s me
If there’s blood on my hands, you should let me know
If you’re done with the dance, you should let me go
Baby you said it all
There’s nothing you can say to break my fall

[Hook: Method Man]
Cash rules everything around me
C.R.E.A.M get the money
Dollar, dollar bill y'all

[Verse 1: Euro]
I've been having these nightmares of losing time, with no reward
Momma would call the Lord, before she call the law
Then I went and found time in a Audemars
Time is money, so I spent it all trying to order more
They say beef is a poor man's sport
Behind the money, get that rhyme report, fuck it

[Hook: Method Man]
Cash rules everything around me
C.R.E.A.M get the money
Dollar, dollar bill y'all

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Uh, I don't cut the work, droptop on 20's
Soon as I learned how to talk I talked business
Nigga's ain't safe, all 9 innings
And to you it's just change, I want every JC Penney
And I walk up in your funeral late, suit rented
Lift a mini skirt, get behind her like Benny
Goin' at your neck, get the rope, tie a noose
This a gut check, now who do I write it to?
I'm dirty like ENT, shout out to Murphy Lee
Gotta cut up the credit cards, plastic surgery
I'm a God, mercy me, I'm higher than Mercury
Smokin' on that strong, full of that Hercules
Bartender, hurry up, hurry up with my drink
Niggas pullin capers like they come with a string
I'm standing over the stove with my gun in the sink
Cause I don't know what niggas thinkin, but I know how they think
Uh, catch a skateboard to the jaw
I'm in that pussy, she in awe
And this here is my homeboy, Quick Draw McGraw
I'm even on both sides of the seesaw
You can get your head cut off with a saw, yeehaw
Kill you and your right-hand man, southpaw
Money over bitches, and above the law
Money over bitches, and above the law, money

[Hook: Method Man]
Cash rules everything around me
C.R.E.A.M get the money
Dollar, dollar bill y'all

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Uh, pocket full of money, with a posse full of hitters
Black and white Porsches, like a Nazi with a nigga
Money make the world, 360
We throw them dollars up, them bitches better be Frisbees
Pounds in the freezer, 50 rounds in the sweeper
Counter full of coke, naked bitch baggin' up
And if the bitch stealing, I know where her Mama live
I love this shit so much, I got on a tux
Man, it's been a minute since I seen my nigga Bubba
Some niggas fade away, some niggas hit the jumper
Kidnap your niece, don't cry, call your uncle
We don't wanna hurt ya, baby, we just want your uncle
25 lighters on the dresser, yessir
I ain't hearin' that bullshit, I'm deafer than Leppard
Somewhere out wherever, they find your body severed
You know they findin' niggas guilty like they finding treasure
But get your money on occasions, I get too wasted
It's an occasion
I heard a nurse say, "Thank you for being so patient"
I know my nigga's got me, we good forever
Get the cheese nigga, please, avoid the shredder
Turning good to better, gotta pull it together
I wish that blood on the floor, was rose petals
Real gangstas die of old age
And old money, get paid, my nigga, Tunechi

[Hook: Method Man]
Cash rules everything around me
C.R.E.A.M get the money
Dollar, dollar bill y'all

[Verse 1]
Straight lines, they unwind you
She does a little thing with her eyes that says, "We're off soon"
She says the bleeding's incidental 'cause she's so cool
She said, "I'm no fun if I've only a bottle of wine"

[Chorus]
And now she's doing it all the time
Yeah, she's doing it all the time

[Verse 2]
Slow down, yeah, I want you
She does a little bit on the sly that shows what she's up to
She started talking about missing him, she was glistening
It won't mend your heart if it's only a couple of lines

[Chorus]
And now she's doing it all the time
Yeah, she's doing it all the time
Yeah, she's doing it all the time
Yeah, she's doing it all the time
Yeah, she's doing it all the time

[Chorus]
Yeah, so far, it's alright, alright, baby
Yeah, so far, it's alright, alright, baby
Yeah, so far, it's alright, alright, baby
Yeah, so far, it's alright, alright

[Verse 1]
Yeah, it's the way we are
We were smoking by 11 and knocking 'round town
Beat 'em ups on my arm
We were never good at selling, couldn't cut down
And I stay with my father while his friends die of heart attacks
He's got a heart made of stone, but he never gets cold because the sun's always on his back
"I used to think you were cool, and I believed you had a wonderful vision
But I soon found out you're a terrible friend, and your mother's on the television"
Give's a go on your bike, how you getting along with your life?
It's alright
Yeah, it's alright

[Chorus]
Yeah, so far, it's alright, alright, baby
Yeah, so far, it's alright, alright, baby
Yeah, so far, it's alright, alright, baby
Yeah, so far, it's alright, alright

[Verse 2]
"Well I'm coming to the end of 23," she said, "Is that alright?"
"Well, it's coming to the end of you and me," she said, "Is that alright?"
And how can you complain about life and talk about being bored?
If you just sit at Pete's house playing video games, doing sniff that you can't afford
I can't be picking up in the town
So get me one off Adam if he's sorting you out
I don't really care what all your friends were about
I was always looking for a way to get out
It's just a reflection on the size of your house
A silver spoon and a zoot in your mouth
But you're alright
Yeah, it's alright

[Chorus]
Yeah, so far, it's alright, alright, baby
Yeah, so far, it's alright, alright, baby
Yeah, so far, it's alright, alright, baby
Yeah, so far, it's alright, alright

[Verse 3]
So here we are, it's quarter to 11, we're knocking 'round town
Pushing in in the bar, you can cry until 11, it's a quarter of an hour
And why stay if you hate it so much?
You think you're well cool
You just write about sex and killing yourself and how you hardly ever went to school
Don't you want to take me up in the clouds?
Pretend that I'm the one and you can show me about
She was talking marriage, so we had to get out
Now he's making up for it by sleeping about
Your ultimatum's a ridiculous joke
I'm gonna pick that option that allows me to smoke
But I'm alright
Yeah, it's alright

[Chorus]
Yeah, so far, it's alright, alright, baby
Yeah, so far, it's alright, alright, baby
Yeah, so far, it's alright, alright, baby
Yeah, so far, it's alright, alright

[Verse 1]
What time you coming out?
We started losing light
I'll never make it right
If you don't want me 'round
I'm so excited for the night
All we need's my bike and your enormous house
You said someday we might
When I'm closer to your height
'Til then, we'll knock around and see
If you're all I need

[Chorus]
Don't you see me? I
I think I'm falling, I'm falling for you
And don't you need me? I
I think I'm falling, I'm falling for you
And on this night, and in this light
I think I'm falling (I think I'm falling), I'm falling for you
And maybe you, change your mind
I think I'm falling, I think I'm falling

[Verse 2]
I'm caught on your coat again
You said, "Oh no, it's fine"
I read between the lines and touched your leg again (Again)
I'll take it one day at a time
Soon you will be mine, oh
But I want you now (I want you now)
When the smoke is in your eyes
You look so alive
Do you fancy sitting down with me? (Maybe)
'Cause you're all I need

[Bridge]
According to your heart
My place is not deliberate
Feeling of your arms
I don't wanna be your friend
I wanna kiss your neck

[Chorus]
Don't you see me? I
I think I'm falling, I'm falling for you
And don't you need me? I
I think I'm falling (I think I'm falling), I'm falling for you
And on this night, and in this light
I think I'm falling (I think I'm falling), I'm falling for you
And maybe you change your mind

[Verse 1]
Someone's telling the toll to me
I'm cut and weeping like a rubber tree
But I don't care who's left behind
Lost revelations that I'll never find
In the long hall
Pipes are whispering
Blues prepared for
Anti-christening

[Verse 2]
Somewhere there's an honest soul
To mirror teeth where neon lures troll
And what's extinct might come alive
A purple smoke in some internal shrine
With a long sigh
Let the hissing in
Stones deformed by
Gentle kissing and
All the closed eyes
Start to glisten
But it feels like
Someone's missing
It feels like
Someone's missing
Yeah, it feels like
Someone's missing
It feels like
Someone's missing
Feels like
Someone's missing
Yeah, It feels like
Someone's missing
It feels like
Someone's missing

[Outro]
It feels like
Someone's missing
Feels like
Someone's missing
Yeah, it feels like
Someone's missing
It feels like
Someone's missing
Yeah, it feels like
Someone's missing

[Chorus]
With my heart upon my sleeve
My head down low and I still feel broken
And down upon my knees
With my head down low I and I still feel broken
Where are you? Where are you?
I know that I need you most and
A heart upon my sleeve, broken down
Woah

[Verse]
I guess I'm just down on my luck a bit, shakin' me out of it
I guess I'm just down on my luck a bit, shakin' me out of it

[Chorus]
With my heart upon my sleeve
With my head down low and I still feel broken
Down upon my knees
With my head down low I and I still feel broken
Where are you? Where are you?
I know that I need you most and
A heart upon my sleeve, broken down, down, down, down

[Verse 1]
Hope there's someone who'll take care of me
When I die, will I go?
Hope there's someone who'll set my heart free
Nice to hold when I'm tired

[Chorus 1]
There's a ghost on the 'rizon
When I go to bed
How will I fall asleep tonight
How will I rest my head?

[Post-Chorus]
And godsend I don't want to go
To the seal's watershed
And there's a ghost on the 'rizon
When I go to bed

[Verse 2]
Oh I'm scared of that middle place
Between light and nowhere
I don't want to be the one
Left in there, left in there

[Chorus 2]
And there's a man on the 'rizon
Wish that I go to bed
And if I fall to his feet tonight
How will I rest my head?

[Post-Chorus]
And godsend I don't want to go
To the seal's watershed
And there's a ghost on the 'rizon
When I go to bed

[Verse 1]
I wanna be your vacuum cleaner
Breathin' in your dust
I wanna be your Ford Cortina
I will never rust
If you like your coffee hot
Let me be your coffee pot
You call the shots, babe
I just wanna be yours

[Chorus]
Secrets I have held in my heart
Are harder to hide than I thought
Maybe I just wanna be yours
I wanna be yours
I wanna be yours
Wanna be yours
Wanna be yours
Wanna be yours

[Verse 2]
Let me be your 'leccy meter
An' I'll never run out
Let me be the portable heater
That you’ll get cold without
I wanna be your setting lotion (Wanna be)
Hold your hair in deep devotion (How deep?)
At least as deep as the Pacific Ocean
I wanna be yours

[Chorus]
Secrets I have held in my heart
Are harder to hide than I thought
Maybe I just wanna be yours
I wanna be yours
I wanna be yours
Wanna be yours
Wanna be yours
Wanna be yours
Wanna be yours
Wanna be yours
Wanna be yours
Wanna be yours
Wanna be yours

[Outro]
I wanna be your vacuum cleaner (Wanna be yours)
Breathin' in your dust (Wanna be yours)
I wanna be your Ford Cortina (Wanna be yours)
I will never rust (Wanna be yours)
I just wanna be yours (Wanna be yours)
I just wanna be yours (Wanna be yours)
I just wanna be yours (Wanna be yours)
I just wanna be yours (Wanna be yours)

[Intro: Josh Homme]
One for the road, oooh oooh
One for the road, oooh oooh

[Verse 1: Alex Turner]
From the bottom of your heart
The relegation zone
I saw this comin' from the start
The shake, rattle and roll
The cracks in blackout blinds
Cast patterns on the ceiling
But you're feeling fine
I thought it was dark outside
I thought it was dark outside

[Chorus: Alex Turner & Josh Homme]
One for the road
So we all get back to yours
And you sit and talk to me on the floor
There's no need to show me 'round, baby
I feel like I've been here before
I've been wonderin' whether later
When you tell everybody to go
Will you pour me one for the road?

[Verse 2: Alex Turner]
I knew this would be on the cards
I knew you wouldn't fold
I saw this comin' from the start
The shake, rattle and roll

[Chorus: Alex Turner & Josh Homme]
One for the road
So we all get back to yours
And you sit and talk to me on the floor
There's no need to show me 'round, baby
I feel like I've been here before
I've been wonderin' whether later
When you tell everybody to go
Will you pour me one for the road?

[Bridge: Alex Turner & Josh Homme]
The mixture hits you hard
Don't get that sinking feeling
Don't fall apart
Some out of tune guitar
Soundtrack to disaster
Oooh oooh, one for the road
Oooh oooh, one for the road
Oooh oooh, one for the road
Oooh oooh, one for the road

[Guitar Solo]
Oooh oooh
Oooh oooh
Oooh oooh
Oooh oooh

[Chorus: Alex Turner & Josh Homme]
One for the road
So we all get back to yours
And you sit and talk to me on the floor
There's no need to show me 'round, baby
I feel like I've been here before
I've been wonderin' whether later
When you tell everybody to go
Will you pour me one for the road?

[Lead-In: DJ Drama]
I mean it’s simple
Can’t fuck wit us

[Intro: Lil Wayne]
I got money on yo head, I don’t do my dirty work
I cut off my hands, I don’t even touch the work
I pray these niggas don’t fuck with me and I don’t like to curse in church
And my girl’ pussy taste just like Mrs. Butterworth’s
I mean that, believe that

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Don’t be short with that work nigga
We find out where yo ho work nigga
We follow your moms from church nigga
You gonna have to swallow yo pride like a thirst quencher
Get 'em Tune, I don’t really fuck around with certain niggas
Fuck all yall niggas, except my niggas
These niggas hustling backwards
Check your rear-view mirror and your side mirrors
OG Kush keep my mind clearer
That choppa get yo mind right
I got two choppers, that’s chopsticks
Eat yo block up like shrimp fried rice
Been so long since I seen my eyes white
You know I smoke like dry ice
Better stay in your lane or get sideswiped
It’s going down, let me straighten up and fly right
Still can’t turn a ho into a housewife
Man, it’s like some things will never change
You ain’t got a shot in a gun range
These chumps ain’t even got chump change
Uh, yeah, and don’t fuck with me, you know I’m Gotti
Check yourself before I sign it
Yeah, I’m shinin on these niggas, no horizon
Yeah, and it’s going down if I’m her pilot
Uh, my new car is so robotic
My new bitch is so provided, money talks, yours like no comment
Black car, racial profiling, rest in peace to Christopher Wallace
Desert Eagle like the Mojave, I get my work from Rico Suave
Uh, it’s a Rollie if I got time on my hand
If you ever see me broke, write on my cast
Boy, my weed so good, I cry when it’s gone
Had a phone in jail, that’s a cellphone
Yeah, I’m bout to buy a machine gun
We drink it all, leave clean cups, make mountains look like speed bumps
I’m sittin on some train tracks, hopin' that bitch speed up
I’m strong-arming these niggas, roll my sleeves up, yeah
I got bad bitches on standby, all my hoes got cat eyes
Celebrate when a rat die, make a nigga fall back like he getting baptized
Put me in a hospital room, full of flat lines, I’m Tunechi Lee immortal
My name ringing, my name ringing, hello may I take your order?
I say, Testarossa over testimony
Got so much shit built up you could smell it on me
Fuck all y'all niggas in Swahili nigga
Ain’t nothing free round here but Willy, nigga
AK-47, call it Mr. Biggs
All my niggas bloods, fuck your syringe
Chop his head off, put it in the fridge
Try not to mistake that shit for dinner, Dedication

[Verse 2 : T.I.]
Hey let me introduce you niggas to America's Most
Every nigga round with me carry a tote
Sadity bitches, like a nigga Tune on the low
They just be like 10 and be doing the most
Okay, Tune in the jet flyin over the boat
I’m on the way from the Panama, I got a few on the boat
What you niggas make a year, I could do with the blow
You keep on playin with me, bet I’ll put a few in you, ho
The fate of a fuck nigga, we soon to see
These niggas sweet as perfume to me
I mean, really, like cartoon to me
Ain’t nobody fuckin with Tune and me
Hustle Gang, bang green, in God we trust
Young Money, Cash Money, they down with us
I got a bitch who want you bitch, you finna give the ho up
And don’t buck, shawty listen, you don’t really know us
We a bust a nigga head, leave him layin' for dead
I get caught with a banger, I’ma lay in the feds
In gen. pop., nigga, every day in the feds
I was chillin on the yard, really going hard
And these pussy niggas catchin' feelings over broads
King, pussy nigga, but I'm really like a god
A-Town nigga, Bankhead, I’m about it
Everybody know to fuck with me cuz I got it

[Verse 1]
I can't explain but I wanna try
There's this image of you and I
And it goes dancing by
In the morning and in the night time
There's all these secrets that I can't keep
Like in my heart there's that hotel suite
And you lived there so long
It's kind of strange now you're gone

[Chorus]
I'm not sure if I should show you what I've found
Has it gone for good, or is it coming back around?
Isn't it hard to make up your mind
When you're losing and your fuse is fireside?

[Verse 2]
There's all those places we used to go
And I suspect you already know
But that place on memory lane you like still looks the same
But something about it's changed

[Chorus]
I'm not sure if I should show you what I've found
Has it gone for good, or is it coming back around?
Isn't it hard to make up your mind
When you're losing and your fuse is fireside?

[Bridge]
And I thought I was yours forever
Or maybe I was mistaken
But I just cannot manage to make it through the day
Without thinking of you lately

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
I'm not sure if I should show you what I've found
Has it gone for good, or is it coming back around?
Isn't it hard to make up your mind
When you're losing and your fuse is fireside?

[Verse 1]
Blind faith, heartache
Mind games, mistakes
My sweet fireball
My sweet rigmarole

[Chorus]
I want it all
I want it all

[Verse 2]
Old dogs, new tricks
Can you feel it?
Space age country girl
Stone cold miracle

[Chorus]
I want it all
I want it all

[Verse 3]
And then suddenly it hit me, it’s a year ago
Since I drank miniature whiskey and we shared your Coke
Said, ain’t it just like you to kiss me and then hit the road?
Leave me listening to the Stones, 2000 Light Years From Home

[Bridge]
Shoo-wop, shoo-wop shoo-wop, shoo-wop
Shoo-wop, shoo-wop shoo-wop, shoo-wop
Shoo-wop, shoo-wop shoo-wop, shoo-wop
Shoo-wop, shoo-wop shoo-wop, shoo-wop
Shoo-wop, shoo-wop

[Chorus]
I want it all
I want it all
I want it all
I want it all
I want it all

[Verse 1]
So you're on the prowl wondering whether
She left already or not
Leather jacket, collar popped like antenna
Never knowing when to stop
Sunglasses indoors, par for the course
Lights in the floors and sweat on the walls
Cages and poles
Call off the search for your soul
Or put it on hold again
She's having a sly indoor smoke
And she calls the folks who run this, her oldest friends
Sipping a drink and laughing at imaginary jokes
As all the signals are sent, her eyes invite you to approach
And it seems as though those lumps in your throat
That you just swallowed have got you going

[Chorus]
Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on
Number one party anthem

[Verse 2]
She's a certified mind blower
Knowing full well that I don't
May suggest there's somewhere from which I might know her
Just to get the ball to roll
Drunken monologues, confused because
It's not like I'm falling in love, I just want ya
To do me no good
And you look like you could

[Chorus]
Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on
Number one party anthem
Come on, come on, come on
Before the moment's gone
Number one party anthem, yeah, yeah

[Bridge]
The look of love, the rush of blood
The "She's with me"s, the Gallic shrug
The shutterbugs, the Camera Plus
The black & white and the color dodge
The good time girls, the cubicles
The house of fun, the number one
Party anthem, oh

[Chorus]
Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on
Before the moment's gone
Number one party anthem
Number one party anthem
Number one party anthem
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
What's been happenin' in your world?
What have you been up to?
I heard that you fell in love or near enough
I gotta tell you the truth, yeah

[Chorus]
I wanna grab both your shoulders and shake, baby
Snap out of it (Snap out of it)
I get the feelin' I left it too late, but, baby
Snap out of it (Snap out of it)
If that watch don't continue to swing
Or the fat lady fancies havin' a sing
I'll be here, waitin' ever so patiently for you to
Snap out of it

[Verse 2]
Forever isn't for everyone
Is forever for you?
It sounds like settlin' down or givin' up
But it don't sound much like you, girl

[Chorus]
I wanna grab both your shoulders and shake, baby
Snap out of it (Snap out of it)
I get the feelin' I left it too late, but, baby
Snap out of it (Snap out of it)
If that watch don't continue to swing
Or the fat lady fancies havin' a sing
I'll be here, waitin' ever so patiently for you to
Snap out of it

[Bridge]
Under a spell, you're hypnotised (Ooh)
Darling, how could you be so blind? (Snap out of it)
Under a spell, you're hypnotised (Ooh)
Darling, how could you be so blind?

[Chorus]
I wanna grab both your shoulders and shake, baby
Snap out of it (Snap out of it)
I get the feelin' I left it too late, but, baby
Snap out of it (Snap out of it)
If that watch don't continue to swing
Or the fat lady fancies havin' a sing
I'll be here, waitin' ever so patiently for you to
Snap out of it

[Verse 1]
You got the lights on in the afternoon
An' the nights are drawn out long
And you’re kissin' to cut through the gloom
With a cough drop coloured tongue
And you were sittin' in the corner with the coats, all piled high
And I thought you might be mine
In a small world on an exceptionally rainy Tuesday night
In the right place and time

[Chorus]
When the zeros line up on the 24-hour clock
When you know who’s callin' even though the number is blocked
When you walked around your house wearin' my sky blue Lacoste
And your knee socks

[Verse 2]
Well, you cured my January blues
Yeah, you made it all alright
I got a feelin' I might have lit the very fuse
That you were tryin' not to light
You were a stranger in my phonebook I was actin' like I knew
‘Cause I had nothin' to lose
When the winter’s in full swing
And your dreams just aren’t comin' true
Ain’t it funny what you’ll do?

[Chorus]
When the zeros line up on the 24-hour clock
When you know who’s callin' even though the number is blocked
When you walked around your house wearin' my sky blue Lacoste
And your knee socks

[Post-Chorus]
The late afternoon, the ghost in your room
That you always thought didn’t approve of you knockin' boots
Never stopped you lettin' me get hold of the sweet spot
By the scruff of your knee socks

[Bridge]
You and me could have been a team
Each had a half of a king and queen seat
Like the beginning of Mean Streets
You could be my baby (Could be my baby)
You and me could have been a team
Each had a half of a king and queen seat
Like the beginning of Mean Streets
You could be my baby (Could be my baby)

[Interlude: Josh Homme]
All the zeros lined up
But the number’s blocked
When you’ve come undone

[Bridge]
You and me could have been a team
Each had a half of a king and queen seat
Like the beginning of Mean Streets
You could be my baby (Could be my baby)
You and me could have been a team
Each had a half of a king and queen seat
Like the beginning of Mean Streets
You could be my baby (Could be my baby)

[Chorus]
When the zeros line up on the 24-hour clock
When you know who’s callin' even though the number is blocked
When you walked around your house wearin' my sky blue Lacoste
And your knee socks
When the zeros line up on the 24-hour clock
When you know who’s callin' even though the number is blocked
When you walked around your house wearin' my sky blue Lacoste
And your knee socks

[Outro]
Knee socks
Knee socks

[Verse 1: 2D]
In demon days, it's cold inside
You don't get nobody, people sigh
It's so bad, lasting far, but love yourself
Hiding in a hole in there
All the glasses are far too big
Bring it back, got to hold it back
To let you do that, yet you don't want me back
Before it fall down, falling down, falling down
Falling down to go far from the sun

[Verse 2: The London Community Gospel Choir]
In these demon days, we're so cold inside
It's so hard for a good soul to survive
You can't even trust the air you breathe
'Cause Mother Earth want us all to leave
When lies become reality
Numb yourself with drugs and TV
Pick yourself up, it's a brand new day
So turn yourself 'round
Don't burn yourself, turn yourself
Turn yourself around to the sun
In these demon days, we're so cold inside
It's so hard for a good soul to survive
You can't even trust the air you breathe
'Cause Mother Earth wants us all to leave
When lies become reality
You numb yourself with drugs and TV
Pick yourself up, it's a brand new day
So turn yourself 'round
Don't burn yourself, turn yourself
Turn yourself around into the sun

[Outro: The London Community Gospel Choir]
To the sun, to the sun
To the sun, to the sun
To the sun, to the sun
To the sun, to the sun
To the sun, to the sun
To the sun, to the sun
To the sun, to the sun
To the sun, to the sun
To the sun, to the sun
To the sun, to the sun
To the sun, to the sun
To the sun, to the sun
To the sun, to the sun

Dreads hang on designer everything
Mr. Comme des Garçons, Mr. Alexander Wang
Mr. Chain, pinky ring, flow insane, ho insane
Man, these shoes I got on, these the hardest I done seen
It look clean when you pour it, I remix it make it dirty
If she got good head and text me, I text back and tell her "hurry"
This that category 5 when I walk up in the strip club
Throw it high, make you and George Washington head butt
OG's never fed us, now young niggas fed up
Ballin' so hard I deserve a and one
Baking soda marketing, I'm getting it ain't I? Obviously
You a bitch, you a ho, that's just my philosophy
And I'm known to kick it like the captain of a soccer team
Billie Jean red leather same color Red Lobster
And she brainwash ya, head doctor
I'ma be fresh as hell if the Feds watching

[Chorus: 2 Chainz & Pharrell]
I'ma be fresh as hell if the Feds watching
I'ma be fresh as hell if the Feds watching

I'ma be fresh as hell if the Feds watching
I'ma be fresh as hell if the Feds watching
Drop topping, head bopping

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Bullet ain't got no name, her pussy ain't got no smell
Got this bitch on lock, these niggas ain't got no bail
These snitches ain't got no pride, these hoes ain't got no manners
These tricks ain't got no magic, ain't that a bitch?.
But me, I make shit taste like sugar cane
'Bout to go to bed with what's her name?
Yeah, pussy never felt so good
And you know we don't smoke that bullshit
Give that shit back to that bull, uh
I'm so sick of balling, I'm so sick of balling
Ride me like a horse, Bitches call me Charlie.
Swear to god, I never met a nigga with enough money
I'm riding around in that new thing with no roof like a hush puppy.
Shhh, I look down at the stars
I could pull a few strings, make it sound like guitars
Told that bitch she my boo, now the round of applause
Shit, I'ma be dressed to kill, now the dead watching
Tunechi!

[Chorus: 2 Chainz & Pharrell]
I'ma be fresh as hell if the Feds watching

[Verse 3: T.I]
I Strivers Row my Denim, bankrolls all in 'em
I'm maximum, you minimal
Make dough, you better get you some
Them corners, we be bent in 'em
Better ask 'bout us, we been a fool
Shot of weed with the one with the pounds of the weed
And the quarter keys of middle school
Beeper, sneakers, tennis shoe, that’s all we was hustling for
When I pull this strap, you don't do what I say
Nigga that's what I would bust it for
I don't take your shit, ain't nothing, bruh
What's all the discussion for?
I'm the motherfucking king and I'm doing my thing
Ain't my fault you can't fuck with us
You know a counterfeit case make years in prison
Got back out, got back to getting busy
Keep playing 'round with it, on the real you can get it
Let a goon get a quarter mil', that'll kill it
Couple racks on that Versace suit
Just in case they watching fool
Sophisticated, my surveillance pics just like a photoshoot
Givenchy, Balenciaga, YSL and Prada
Tom Ford, LonBon, you name it, I got it
So I be fresh as fuck, going hard when the feds watching
Literally 'cause I'm menaging when the feds watching, ha!

[Chorus: 2 Chainz & Pharrell]
I'ma be fresh as hell if the Feds watching
I'ma be fresh as hell if the Feds watching
I'ma be fresh as hell if the Feds watching
Drop topping, head bopping
I'ma be fresh as hell if the Feds watching
I'ma be fresh as hell if the Feds watching
I'ma be fresh as hell if the Feds watching
Drop topping, head bopping

[Verse 1]
Straight from the depths of Queens
Leave you sleeping on the mezzanine
Like you Lincoln, and switch into a desert scene
Often heard, but this motherfucker seldom seen
I'm throwing blows while you're waiting for the bell to ring
Drug smoking, raisins make the pasta sweet
Slumped over when the barrel and your posture meet
Stay lean like some motherfucking ostrich meat
You full of shit, it's time to get a colonoscopy
Scissor kicks, dick's up for Miss Elizabeth
Lex Luger arms, four in the morning in the dark with the computer on
Waste of my time - my thoughts are patient, 

[?] replaced in my mind
Born to shine like the eyes on a cat
Same cat fuck around, put the knife in your back
Cause it's nothing, we live and let die and roam the land
And you bluffing, you lifted the cards and showed your hand, pussy
Tailor-made rubber, rubber made reliable
Never spill the soup, rock a linen suit
Play the streets like the ball court, spin and shoot
Strong as Popeye, dipping in a spinach Coupe
Pull my nuts out your mouth, let me breathe for a minute, please
Your life is cheap like a hooker in the Philippines
About to be a huge star and I'm still in Queens
You on the shelf like a figurine
Drugs infesting my mind, but I'm destined to shine
Spit the shit to keep these motherfuckers pressing rewind
Thousands of pounds of pressure pressed on your spine
Lift the vine, free the bonds - lead the blind, read the signs
Hands up like you stepping in the party
Now you getting robbed, motherfucker, with the shotty
Said you pottied - make your body do an ollie
Then dig your shorty out cause I geeked her up on molly
Have her eating dick, no need for seasoning
If seven dudes are in the room, then she's pleasing 'em
Like a tropper, hit her in the pooper
Throw her in the shower then I take her out to LUPA
I'm kinky, I'll hit it even if it's stinky
Put 'em in the shower, make the pussy brand-new
Ran through, give her money's what I can't do
Stuff her lunch box and burn her with a candle
Consensual rate, vinegar solutions
Animal abusing, down with revolutions
Don't get me pissed off, fuck around, rip your tits off
Still getting head even if my dick soft
Rising quick, no Fleischmann's
I'm in the end zone with one leg up, posing like Heisman
Throw it like Theismann, suede foot
With the village leader, smoking a pipe with seven wise men
I eat the biggest piece of chicken at the table
Let 'em know I'm hungry, Polo on the Rugby
The .44 long, surely got a trusty hove
Tryna live the American dream, Dusty Rhodes, yeah

[Verse 1]
Looking in your eyes
Kind of heaven eyes
Closing both my eyes
Waiting for surprise

[Pre-Chorus 1]
To see the heaven in your eyes is not so far
'Cause I'm not afraid to try and go it
To know the love and the beauty never known before
I'll leave it up to you to show it

[Chorus]
And golden lady, golden lady
I'd like to go there
Golden lady, golden lady
I'd like to go there
Take me right away

[Verse 2]
Looking at your hands
Hands can understand
Waiting for the chance
Just to hold your hand

[Pre-Chorus 2]
A touch of rain and sunshine made the flower grow
Into a lovely smile that's blooming
And it's so clear to me that here's a dream come true
There's no way that I'll be losing

[Chorus]
And golden lady, golden lady
I'd like to go there
Golden lady, golden lady
I'd like to go there
Take me right away

[Organ solo]

[Pre-Chorus 2]
A touch of rain and sunshine made the flower grow
Into a lovely smile that's blooming
And it's so clear to me that you're my dream come true
There is no way that I'll be losing

[Chorus]
And golden lady, golden lady
I'd like to go there
Golden lady, golden lady
I'd like to go there
Golden lady, golden lady
I'd like to go there
Golden lady, golden lady
I'd like to go there

And golden lady, golden lady
I'd like to go there
Golden lady, golden lady
I'd like to go there

And golden lady, golden lady
I'd like to go there
Golden lady, golden lady
I'd like to go there

And golden lady, golden lady
I'd like to go there...

[Verse 1]
Don't say I'll see you later alligator, so cute
When you know it's not true
I know you're seeing her
But you can still see me, too
If you wanted to, baby

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I know they say I'm cheap
And you're two-timing me
That's what you get
We're in the 21st century
So much for chivalry
I know you'll come to me
I have a way with men like you, baby

[Chorus]
You're all I wanted, boy, I never needed anybody else
Your logic's flawed and you've been telling lies to yourself
When you gonna let your little baby come, oh, come to you
When you gonna let me drive you crazy like nobody do
You're all I needed boy, I never needed anybody else
I know you're scared to see me only and nobody else
When you gonna love your baby?
When you gonna love your baby?

[Verse 2]
I did the Playboy dip that made us famous
And you was watching there with your crew
I should have known just by the circumstances and who
I was meeting you through
That you were bad news

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I know that's not the way
Most people meet but, hey
We're living in the fast lane
Post-modern day
You're not sure you can change
Or get out of the game
You're not the only one
I've heard say, "Maybe"

[Chorus]
You're all I wanted, boy, I never needed anybody else
Your logic's flawed and you've been telling lies to yourself
When you gonna let your baby tie you up and drive you crazy?
You're all I needed boy, I never needed anybody else
I know you're scared to see me only and nobody else
When you gonna love your baby?
When you gonna love your baby?

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
Ayy, killer shit
Villainous, hero, don't give a shit
Hancock, Will Smith
Adrenaline, with a twist
Take pride that I'm so Chi
These young bucks just a nuisance
To my sidekicks
This shit here like magic
Yeah, this here like magic
Abracadabra, rabbits
No hook but so hooked
Take crack at my habits
Neutron but too bomb
Did it all with no tablets
It's a write off if it costs right
Get your light blue
Then the off white

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I ain’t fucking with your drama, no
Baby, all you wanna do is hit it, hit it, hit it, hit it, hit it
Make me lose my mind, girl, I can see it
I ain’t fucking with your drama, no, yeah, yeah
Baby, all you wanna do is hit it, hit it
Get it, bang, bang, bang
Fuck me real good, tell me that you'll never let me go

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
No fares, dope fiends
Don't try that nose sting
Police rushed in
And they red lights, they got rocks and
Code D, codeine
On that James Dean, call it James Dean
Say watch that, watch that
You might die driving the same thing
Same thing, same thing
Whoop whoop, see that shit?
Triple entendre no accident
Might crash tryna catch this shit
Contact if you catch a whiff
All contact that I catch adrift
That I kick-block
Then stop, on ken dot
Tryna stack of bricks
Like 10 rocks crush it up and don't touch it up
While you uppercut
Shoryuken fuck it up
Nigga, let 'em hit it raw
Send it through your system through a car antenna
Nigga, how she feelin' when it lands deeply in her jaw

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I ain’t fucking with your drama, no
Baby, all you wanna do is hit it, hit it, hit it, hit it, hit it
Make me lose my mind, girl, I can see it
I ain’t fucking with your drama, no, yeah, yeah
Baby, all you wanna do is hit it, hit it
Get it, bang, bang, bang
Fuck me real good, tell me that you'll never let me go

[Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco]
Higher from the back, fire from the top
Fire to the buyer to the tryer of the rock
Supplier to the buyer to the drivers of the drop
Lighter to the higher, to the writer to the cops
Lighter to the pipe or set fire to the crops
Freebase, crack, rock
Supply it worldwide when they fire at the box
Police raid, trap hot
Police state, black plot
Drier than the fire so there's violence a lot
Price is going higher so they're firing the shots
Die or  survive, it's survival of the block
That's your girl, I could X that, by any means, I get it clean
One last hit, and that's it, she won't act it, can't intervene

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I ain’t fucking with your drama, no
Baby, all you wanna do is hit it, hit it, hit it, hit it, hit it
Make me lose my mind, girl, I can see it
I ain’t fucking with your drama, no, yeah, yeah
Baby, all you wanna do is hit it, hit it
Get it, bang, bang, bang
Fuck me real good, tell me that you'll never let me go

[Verse 1]
Hey porter, hey porter!
Would you tell me the time?
How much longer will it be 'til we cross
That Mason-Dixon Line?
At daylight, would ya tell that engineer
To slow it down?
Or better still, just stop the train
'cause I want to look around

[Verse 2]
Hey porter, hey porter!
What time did you say?
How much longer will it be 'til I
Can see the light of day?
When we hit Dixie, will you tell that engineer
To ring his bell?
And ask everybody that ain't asleep
To stand right up and yell

[Verse 3]
Hey porter, hey porter!
It's getting light outside
This old train is puffing smoke
And I have to strain my eyes
But ask that engineer if he
Will blow his whistle please
'Cause I smell frost on cotton leaves
And I feel that Southern breeze

[Verse 4]
Hey porter, hey porter!
Please get my bags for me
I need nobody to tell me now
That we're in Tennessee
Go tell that engineer to make
That lonesome whistle scream
We're not so far from home
So take it easy on the steam

[Break]

[Verse 5]
Hey porter, hey porter!
Please open up the door
When they stop the train, I'm gonna get off first
'cause I can't wait no more
Tell that engineer I said thanks a lot
And I didn't mind the fare
I'm going to set my feet on Southern soil
And breathe that Southern air

[Intro: Pharrell]
Two step to this!

[Chorus: Pharrell]
Spin around, ma
Drop, drop, like it's hot, drop, drop, like it's hot

Drop, drop, like it's hot, drop, drop, like it's hot

Drop, drop, like it's hot, drop, drop, like it's hot
I got the rollie on my arm and I'm pouring Chandon
And I roll the best weed 'cause I got it going on

[Verse 1: Pharrell]
No steroids can make you hit what I'm pitching
Chef boy-ar-P is back in the kitchen
You niggas is scratching, my niggas is itchin'
Don't keep "Pacin" but these dudes blow they "Pistons"
Yes, nigga, P stands for polish
None of y'all is fucking with he, and this is obvious
I'm Ron Artest, laying down to your garbage
While my niggas in the street pushing shit like Ben Wallace
And any ya'll could get it, even fans in the stands
These guns is a sun, you'll catch a tan with ya man
I'm no cheeto, trust this is real/rio
Everything is grande nothing is poquito
Security's behind me, with the torpedo
Cause the wrist stay frigid
How you say it? Frio
Or where I'm from, in Virgina, we say ch-ill
And the Enzo's a quarter-million for each whe-el

[Chorus: Pharrell]
Spin around, ma
Drop, drop, like it's hot, drop, drop, like it's hot
Spending money mang
Drop, drop, like it's hot, drop, drop, like it's hot
Spin around, ma
Drop, drop, like it's hot, drop, drop, like it's hot
I got the rollie on my arm and I'm pouring Chandon
And I roll the best weed 'cause I got it going on

[Verse 2: Jay Z]
I got haters on my jizzock, plus the freaking cizzops
All of whom want to hit me with shizzots til I drizzop
Thank God for hip hop, or I'd be in the bizzox, uh
Jail or casket, either way you rizzot
But now I'm so fresh you could smell me through a Ziploc
Mr. S Dizzot, it's not gon' stizzop
Too much pizzazz for these piss-ass niggas to get past
Too cool for cizzops to cuff his iz-ass
Snitch as they may, they can't get the boy
These niggas giving out cases like a liquor store
Runnin' to the DA tryin' to get me for
All the money it made, I'm like forget the law
I'm not 'frizzaid, it's Jizzay, homie, you got plizzayed
Take it like a man, the flow ran you off the stizz-age (go sit down)
Wastin' ya time tryin' to sue S Dot
Tell ya lawyer "Take that civil case and drop it like it's hot"

[Chorus: Pharrell]
Spin around, ma
Drop, drop, like it's hot, drop, drop, like it's hot
Spending money mang
Drop, drop, like it's hot, drop, drop, like it's hot
Spin around, ma
Drop, drop, like it's hot, drop, drop, like it's hot
I got the rollie on my arm and I'm pouring Chandon
And I roll the best weed 'cause I got it going on

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
(Worldwide)
International, nah I'm universal
'But you a gangsta, how you get to do commercials?'
With them big wigs, 'Yeah, cuh, you do it big'
I stay real, stay sharp, and tell it like it is
I never fake the funk, niggas know I ain't no punk
They want beef? 'Yeah, cuh,' pop the trunk
We go all the way, we do it life-size
Now my life right, 'cause my wife on my right side
Yeah, and she protecting my interest
Now I'm on the move, they got me hoppin' these fences
Ay little homie, your defense is defenseless
A pimp apprentice, hey, come here princess
(Come here, come here)
I know ya tired of the chit-chatter
It really don't matter, it's like a seesaw platter
I check money, check niggas, check bitches
Now drop it like your ass on switches (Ziip)

[Chorus: Pharrell]
Spin around, ma
Drop, drop, like it's hot, drop, drop, like it's hot
Spending money mang
Drop, drop, like it's hot, drop, drop, like it's hot
Spin around, ma
Drop, drop, like it's hot, drop, drop, like it's hot
I got the rollie on my arm and I'm pouring Chandon
And I roll the best weed 'cause I got it going on
What does dedication mean to you?

Umm, nowadays, dedication mean to me...umm, the same thing it's meant all the rest of-whatever, same thing it's always meant man. Just get on the mixtape, have fun, enjoy myself. Say things that I wouldn't say on my album or, you know what I mean, say things that I wouldn't on a album. On anyone's album for that case or whatever

Anyway, yeah, dedication still means the same thing: just get on this shit and go crazy and just talk what I want to talk, say what I want to say. And all the people that's featured on the mixtape, shoutout to them anyway. I tell them the same thing, man do what you want, say what you want, let's just have fun, enjoy ourselves, and show people that we could rap. We can make words rhyme. Yeah and it's still dedicated to you fuck-niggas

D5! Whattup 5!?

[Nicki Minaj]
Think I'm playing! This shit is a fucking joke!
This is a joke. This is a joke. This is a joke?
Say one more disrespectful thing to me.
Say one more disrespectful thing to me --
I'll go up against your head!

[Randy Jackson]
Time out, time out, time out, time out, time out.

[Mariah Carey]
I am not being disrespectful.

[Nicki Minaj]
Up against your head!
Up against your head

Don’t tell me I'm insecure, don’t tell me I'm inadequate,
You gone get sent to 

[inaudible] over that!;
Don’t- You done came on idol feeling unsure, feeling inadequate.
You’re the insecure one sitting up there running down her resume every five minutes.
Every time you take a shot at me I'mma take it back,
And if you gotta fucking problem then handle it.

I told them, I'm not fucking putting up with your fucking highness over there
Figure it the fuck out. Figure it out.

[Mariah Carey]
Why, why...

[Nicki Minaj]
Figure it out.

[Mariah Carey]
... do I have a 3-year-old sitting around me?

[Nicki Minaj]
I’m not sitting here for 20 minutes
And having you run down your resume everyday.
No! Goodbye!

[Mariah Carey]
Listen... I can’t see my kids because you decided to make...
To have ... to have a little baby fit and going all around the stage.

[Nicki Minaj]
Good, well then go see them now, go see them now.
You’re boring as fuck! You’re boring as fuck!

[Intro]
Hey
That's right

[Verse 1]
Asked sweet mama, let me be her kid
She said, "You might get hurt if you don't keep it hid"
Well, I, I know my baby if I see her in the dark
I said I know my rider if I see her in the dark

[Verse 2]
Now, I'm going to Rosedale, take my rider by my side
Still barrel house, but it's on the riverside, yeah
I know my baby, Lord, I said, is really sloppy drunk
I know my mama, Lord, a brown-skin, but she ain't no plum
Uh-huh, see my baby, tell her, tell her hurry home
Had no loving since my baby been gone, yeah
See my baby, tell her hurry on home
I ain't had, Lord, my right mind
Since my rider's been gone
Hey, mama says she's my rider
I want to tell you she's my rider
I know you're mine, she's my rider
She ain't but sixteen, but she's my rider
I'm going to Rosedale, take my rider by my side
Anybody ask you and me met, I keep them satisfied
But, uh, see my baby, tell her, tell her to shake my milk
Ain't no love, Lord, since you nowhere
Ah, yeah
My, my, my, my

[Bridge]
Won't you come in my kitchen

[Verse 3]
She's a kindhearted lady
She studies evil all the time
She's a kindhearted woman
She studies evil all the time
Squeeze my lemon till the juice runs down my leg
Squeeze it so hard I fall right out of bed
If you squeeze my lemon
Till the juice runs down my leg
I wonder if you know what I'm talking about
Oh, but the way that you squeeze it, girl
I swear I'm going to fall right out of bed

[Verse 4]
Ah, she's a good rider
Hey, yeah
She's my kindhearted lady
I'm going to take my rider by my side, yeah
I said her front teeth are lined with gold
She's got a mortgage on my body, got a lien on my soul
She's my brown-skin sugar plum

[Intro: Young Thug]
Hello world
Yeah this your ?
You know, it's amazing what's going on out here in these streets
You know, you got these boys out here playing
They come off the porch not ready
I come to find out what it really is
They ain't mama's baby, they mama's boy
See if they was mama's baby they could learn something, but they mama's boy
They don't know when to shut up, they don't know when to get out the way they don't know how to stay in they lane
When you come off the porch you got to already be ready
Because when you hit these streets...
It's on the job training

[Verse 1: Peewee Longway]
I been juugin', I been makin' plays in exclusive J's
Fuck ya bitch and let her rub my waves, I'm stuck in my ways
Poppin' molly I've been up for days vampin' wit' the Js
Longway, longway, jumpin' off the stage, bitches grabbin' my chain
Machine Gun Kelly ride the wave, Guwop fuck up the stage
Diamond hittin' neon like a rave, leave a bad bitch in a daze
Uno dos cups I'm dazed, ? I blaze
Make a big juug at Blaze, John Dillinger still come for your safe
FN 20 shots still on my waist
Gas bags still comin' in from the bay, E-40 holla back at ya ???
Let's see how many bags she can flip in a day
Makin' juug, makin' juug wit' my people
Griselda Blanco, El Chapo, clean bricks in, bring nacho
Pablo Esco', Gucci Tarantino, makin' juug, compadre, vato
Longway!

[Bridge: Gucci Mane]
Long, yeah that was Longway man
What's happenin'?
1017's finest nigga, Guwop
All we do is goddamn make legends nigga (Everything red this summer)
We make nothing but classics nigga
Street niggas, Trap music fuck nigga
Don't get this shit confused wit' no Hip-Hop nigga
2013 nigga, everythang red on my end
Red Phantom, red 'rari, red Bentley, red Charger sucka

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
VVS crystals all over me, dope covered with crystals
Sticky purp need some scissors, lean so dark look like liquor
So I just pulled up in the Enzo ho, Guwop came back in a Bentley on 4s
Poured me a 4 and forgot where to go, and I'm dope but I'm lost just like Weezy and Zoe
Gucci and PeeWee - new Eazy and Dre, Wee got the uzi and I got the K
Like Birdman and Wayne and we hoggin the lane, we sippin and spillin codeine on the plane
Fuck the champagne I'm in love with the drank, smoke on some dank because cigarettes stank
Fresh prince of the six ? Hillary Bank
? bought me a pint
Woke up today a decision to  make, I skeet on her chest  or I skeet on her face
These worrisome-ass bugs keep sucking my blood I need some spray to keep these mosquitoes away
I follow the leader, my plug was a teacher
He showed me the roads now I'm leading the way
458, this ain't a date, so ho you get dick and Doritos today

[Verse 3: Young Thug]
Baby I'm not president, I ball like George Jefferson
Her teeth whiter than a peppermint
I buy her a maid, this and that so therefore she ain't coming back
Babygirl chasing her a sack
Young Thugger Young Thugger, Young Stack is my brother
I fuck her, I love her, but I cannot cuff her
I pull up on donuts, they take all my orders
That lean is my drank and that pussy my supper
I like my bitch brown like dumped in Coca Cola
Her ass keep clapping, Magnolia Magnolia
She walk down that runway, she coming she coming
Ain't talkin' no gun but she don't got no tummy
Got bricks like a mummy
I tell ya father, I slaughter ya daughter
I'm with that lay, ain't talkin' to stay, I fuck the yay yay
Ay Bloody Jay, you know we go harder
We ridin' on Bentleys, we started from MARTA
We come from the street, I'm full, I can't eat
Ain't nobody starving, Monique Parker

[Outro: Peewee Longway]
Straight like that baby
Bitch, ho, slut, whatever you wanna go by
Longway! Longway! Longway! All blue on my end nigga
MPA, 1017, if you ain't know fool
Fuck you sayin'?!

Turn up! Turn up! Turn up!
Turn down for what?!

[Hook]
Where did my baby go?
I wonder where she ran off to
I miss my baby so
I'm calling but I can't get through
Please tell that girl if you meet her
That someone's longing to see her
Where did my baby go?
I wish that she would get back soon (get back soon)

[Verse 1]
I'm searching for the lover I knew
Have you seen her?
Where did she go?
Feels like I've just lost my only friend
Flames subsided, colors faded
Love just got so complicated
Wish that I could see her smile again
So if you see her out there, tell her I'm still here
Waiting for the day when she will reappear

[Hook]
Where did my baby go?
I wonder where she ran off to
I miss my baby so
I'm calling but I can't get through
Please tell that girl if you meet her
That someone's longing to see her
Where did my baby go?
I wish that she would get back soon (get back soon)

[Verse 2]
Maybe I was wrong and I
Ignored her for too long and I
Didn't even notice when she slipped away
Maybe while I lay fast asleep then
Out into the night she creeps
I'll leave the light on, so she'll come back someday
Oh, if you see her out there, tell her it's not fair
And that life's just not the same when she's not here

[Hook]
Where did my baby go?
I wonder where she ran off to
I miss my baby so
Just what am I supposed to do?
Please tell that girl if you meet her
That someone's longing to see her
Where did my baby go?
I wish that she would get back soon (get back soon)
Where did my baby go?
I wonder where she ran off to
I miss my baby so
Just what am I supposed to do?
Please tell that girl if you meet her
That someone's longing to see her
Where did my baby go?
I wish that she would get back soon, get back soon, get back soon, get back soon, get back soon
I'm facin' trouble everyday
Tryna' walk away from a life of sorrow
It's a struggle everyday
Trying not to rob G's, still I borrow

[Verse 1:]
I need to take it slow
My heart is growing cold
I'm tryna' hide my feelings
From the people that I know
And everywhere I go I'm trying to lay low
Can't afford to get in no trouble cuz I'm on parole

I'm tryna' live life right
God knows with all my might
But I'm just barely getting by
Cuz money's way too tight
And I can say this right
The struggle and the fight
It's weakin' all the muscles in my body like kryptonite
It's making me feel like there is no other way
But the different streets get that dough
Got me hopin' and then prayin' for a better day...So!

[Hook: x2]
I'm facin' trouble everyday
Tryna' walk away from a life of sorrow
It's a struggle everyday
Trying not to rob G's, still I borrow

[Verse 2:]
Streets, I ain't no longer on it
Don't need feds all upon it
I done left that life alone
Cuz all I did was impress, my homie!
And then my conscience told me
"Careful you tendarone!"
Always complaining after I ain't never did
She always lonely. So what am I to do
Gotta get money for food, cuz if she starves to death
Then I gotta deal with her attitude
And I in that type of mood cuz I ain't type of dude
It's bad enough, I gotta deal with all this I'm going through
It's making me feel like there is no other way
But to hit the streets and get that dough
Got me hopin' and then prayin' for a better day...So!

[Hook: x4]
I'm facin' trouble everyday
Tryna' walk away from a life of sorrow
It's a struggle everyday
Trying not to rob G's, still I borrow

Tempt me and anything can happen—I ain't rapping
I ain't shootin' at your soldiers, bitch; I'm going for the captain
I ain't shooting at your shoulders, bitch; I'm going for your cap
And I won't stop cappin' 'til your wings start flappin'
And you, you just an angel in the streets full of gangstas
And me, I'm from the home where murder make you famous
And I think I'm 'bout to get that trench off the hanger
And the mask out the drawer, but I never hide the banger, I'm a—
Straight player; if you love her, don't bring her
I'll tell her a lil' shit, like, I can make her ass a singer
And she believe that—we back at the crib
She like, "How it shoot if it's plastic, for real?"
I'm like, "Fall back, ma—your ass need to chill"
Then she rolled on my dick like an ecstasy pill, haha
I smoke Beverly Hills, whatever—that kill
That leave a nigga with that heavenly feel, yeah
Step, and I will step in your grill, yeah
Leave a nigga with that heavenly feel, yeah (Gangsta Gri-Zillz!)
Shoutout my nigga Drama, man, for still fuckin' with me with this crazy shit man. Cause obviously he could be like, man, I don't really fuck with you no more, man, I'm doin' this shit without a motherfucker. But he still fucks with your boy and I appreciate that man, I hope we can make the fuckin' computers crash again. Ya dig?

K, K, K (Spitta), K (Yuh)

[Verse 1: Curren$y]
Time and time again, I gotta grab my phone and call Lil Wayne:
"Let me use your throwaway, 'cause niggas out here playin', man"
They just don't get it 'til I pop the trunk and come back with it
Barrel on the burner big enough to spit a hundred midgets
I'm from the Crescent City, moving nothing less than fifty
That's more shells than you'll find in the seat
And you don't need to know your alphabets to recognize a G
I'm in the Lambo', making doughnuts, like I work for Krispy Kreme, ha
Excuse my flossin', dog—I'm still known to tote a snub
Niggas thought I lost all my blickas in that Katrina flood
I still got big, U—MAC-11 from '97
Sometimes, you gotta show niggas better than you can tell 'em

[Bridge: Mack Maine]
I—I—I—I be on that gangster shit, straight up on that gangster shit

[Bridge: Mack Maine]
Chevys riding, swerving out, mufflers stuffed with 'dro and blow
Mack Maine, Young Money—motto still "Fuck a ho"
Burners on the front seat, 'case a hater come that close
Body drop when the shotty pop, it'll prolly make your body rock

[Verse 2: Mack Maine]
Body rock—yup! Nigga, lean with it, rock with it
Thing'll make you lean—I be seen round the clock with it
See, I don't stop with it—hustle for that new money
Smelling like them new hundreds; diarrhea, loot runnin'
See, I just recruit something that help me move it every day
More workers than Mary Kay; vibing to that Mary J
I'm off the chain, like free slaves; bitch, I'm 'bout my chips
I'm Mack Maine, bitch! I'm on that gangster shit

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne & Mack Maine]
Time and time again, I gotta turn around and tell Fee Dawg:
"Grab that AK off my backseat—it's gon' be blood all on them, dog"
Clip longer than a bitch; if a nigga trip, pop it on in, and give a nigga that shit
Pull it right over and park that whip—everybody better run when the trunk door lift
Shit, the only thing I'm runnin from: myself, with a gun 'til them fuckboys come
The nigga that talk ain't talking 'bout nothing; I'm a rudeboy—I murder for fun
I'm hot, bitch—word to the Sun; I'm the Birdman's son, I'm the chosen one
I'm the god, just looking for a nun; I'm the president: My job here is done (Ugh)

[Bridge: Mack Maine]
Chevys riding, swerving out, mufflers stuffed with 'dro and blow
Cash Money, Young Money—motto still "Fuck a ho"
Burners on the front seat, 'case a hater come that close
Body drop when the shotty pop, it'll prolly make your body rock

[Break: Lil Wayne]
Lean with it (Rock with it)

We 'bout to stop 'em in they tracks
And show 'em that we root
Let's—boom! get shot
We 'bout to stop 'em in they tracks
And it keep my motherfucking name
Boom! Get shot, bitch!

[Intro]
You know
Check
Its akon man, my man P
Its the magic city baby
Yo i think we got one on this one

So all them haters, wanna scream my name? (then keep on calling)
And they wouldn't support us before but wanna scream now? (let them keep on calling)
We gonna let them just keep on calling baby , just keep calling (so keep on calling)
And for our supporters, you know you can just keep calling as long as you want (keep on calling)

I used to be up on the corner all day, tryin to figure out whats gonna get me out there
Dope dealing and hugging the block, i done found out ain't gonna get me nowhere
Used to keep a nine milli for protection, just in case a nigga wanna take my bread
Then the voice came down from the sky and said...Akon use your head..

I had to re-evaluate my thoughts and think about what Got me this far,(this far)
Had to keep a strong faith and believing, know one day I'd be a star (A star)
But I knew that it wouldn't come easy(Come easy)
Seen a whole lotta hate and believe me (believe me)
Despite all the bullshit we had to still work hard, to get to where we are
So when you hear them calling out "Akon", let them keep on calling
When you hear the world calling out "P-money", let them keep on calling
Cause we went through hell and back to get here, so keep on calling
Let me hear you now, let me hear you now, let me hear you just keep on calling

Senegal West Africa to New Zealand (New Zealand)
Blessed to have the gift to make music with meaning (With meaning)
Cause i never thought i'd come this far, with a mansion and a fancy car
Never thought success would come this quick in the beggining ( but I seen it)

And all along I'm sitting there thinking that its harder when you came from the hood (Came from the hood)
When all I had to do was put my mind to it, and realise that it was all good (It was all good)
Cause once i got rid of what held me down, best believe I won't be turning back
I had to keep on moving and to keep on grooving right here on this P-Money track
And so

When you hear them calling out "Akon" Let them keep on calling
When you hear the world calling out "P-Money" Let them keep on calling
Cause we went through hell and back to get here, so keep on calling
Let me hear you now, let me hear you now, let me hear you just keep on calling

Keep on calling, keep on calling, just keep on calling, keep on calling
Just keep on calling, keep on calling, just keep on calling, keep on calling

When you hear them calling out "Akon" Let them keep on calling
When you hear the world calling out "P-Money" Let them keep on calling
Cause we went through hell and back to get here, so keep on calling
Let me hear you now, let me hear you now, let me hear you just keep on calling

[Verse: 1 Gucci Mane]
I know selling dope is wrong but I'm the dope man
One side of beans on my plate, I need some steak man
Got mouths to feed and my nigga's got to eat fam
By any means necessary, we don't give a damn

[Hook]

Praying to the Trap God
To the Trap God
I'm on my knees praying to the Trap God
Life's Hard
Life's so hard
Put your faith in god and you can be a Trap God
Trap God i'm a Trap God
The FEDS they try to label me as a drug czar
You a Trap God
You a Trap God
Put your faith in god and you can be a Trap God

[Verse 1]
Big Guwop the Trap God
But I don't think I'm god
Got a Challenger and a Charger ho
Bitch I'm in love with Dodge
I got body kits on all my cars
They hips like Nicki Minaj
And your girlfriends a masseuse she giving my dick a massage
And don't wear that body suit no more
Cause I'm gonna catch a charge
Multi-Million dollar CEO
Wearing Jordans to his job
Baby sucking my dick while I'm counting a million
She thinking she thinking she smart
The twentys and fiftys and hundreds she pull them apart
So she can keep all of the odds

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Am I a bad man cause I feed my fam with the dope
Call me clearance sale Gucci everything gotta go
Grill stove Guwop T-Shirts for the low
Hella green washing powder WalMart on Gresham road
Man these niggas say they killers
But these niggas just some ho's
Godzilla for a nigga
Cinderella for the hoes
Big Guwop they call me Trap God
Every verse a quote
I'm a walking egg beater
And the dope white like the pope

[Hook]

Life can be only what you make it
When you're feeling down, you should never fake it
Say what's on your mind and you'll find in time
That all the negative energy, it would all decease
And you'll be at peace with yourself
You won't really need no one else
Except for the man up above, yeah
Because He'll give you love
Oh, oh, ooh ooh ooh, if you looked into my life

If you looked at my life

If you looked at my life
And see what I see
(If you looked into my life)
If you looked at my life
And see what I see (Mmm)

[Verse 2]
Take your time, baby, don't you rush a thing
Don't you know I know we all are struggling
I know it is hard, but we will get by
And if you don't believe in me, just believe in He, yeah
'Cause He'll give you peace of mind (Yes, He would)
And you'll see the sunshine (For real, yes, you would)
And you'll get to free your mind
And things will turn out fine
Oh, I know that things will turn out fine
Yes, they would, yes they would, ay

If you looked at my life
And see what I see (Take your time, one day at a time
It's all on you, what you gonna do?)
If you looked at my life
And see what I see (La-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah)
If you looked at my life
And see what I see (La-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah)
If you looked at my life
And see what I see (La-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah)
If you looked at my life
And see what I see (La-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah)
(My life, my life, my life, in the sunshine)

[Intro: 2Pac Interview]
So, okay, you want to see some macho shit? I’m the most macho nigga out here. I'm the most.. I thought you niggas knew, I’m the most thuggish nigga out here. I have no mothafuckin’ fear… I have no fear, I have only ambition, and I want mine, and I will do anything to protect and feed my family

[Intro: Meek Mill]
Take money!
Yeah! Take money! Haha
Unh!

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
First off, fucked your bitch, nigga, get a blood test
You a upset, nigga, where the love at?
When we talking 'bout Philly, know I fucking run that
Same place I've been up corners you can never come back
You fraud nigga, ball like I'm Chrissy Paul, nigga
I cross niggas, when you hate it 'cause you lost, nigga
You soft nigga, then you disrespect a boss, nigga
You dissin' to get you on, that'll get you off nigga
Broad nigga, and you was screamin' "come to my hotel"
Nigga, we was slingin work out the motel!
No scale, Barry Reese, I know you so well
I caught your chick, I pulled that bitch like she a coat tail
Let's keep it trilla, you ain't never make a dope sale
You ain't never played that corner--make a coke sale
On a late night, swimmin with the great whites
You was rockin' durags, big tees, fake Mikes
Boy you had a wild week, shoppin' on Canal Street
Same place you bought your fake chain and your time-piece
How we gon' believe you? Nigga I should lead you!
Talkin' "PC," that was never Beanie Sigel!
That was never ME, why you lying to the people?
I was locked down, still doing shit illegal
Running around in jail like, "I ain't give a hell," when
You was on PC, locking it with males

[Interlude: Meek Mill]
And I ain't got time for this shit, let me get another one

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
23 and 1 never get to see the sun
Had to get a glass visit just so you could see your son
Took a deal on your homie, 'cause you couldn't beat the gun
They was tryna give you life, man, you know that wasn't right
Then you left him in the hood, on his head, he had a price
You ain't even give a call, other niggas shot him twice
Niggas trynna get a buzz off my name for some likes
Dead rapper, I'm at you, I'mma give you one tonight
Ca-ssidy! Boy, you so trash to me
Do the math I dissed you, that's subtract to me
You ain't poppin, what the fuck could you add to me?
You just another dead body, another casualty
I'm in the streets, so I do this beat casually
And I ain't even write this shit, why you mad at me?
Cause you nursery rhyming, flow perfectly timing
And I'm giving gas, I'm in the Aston, one Swizzy's designing
Now beat it, I know you're heated but I know you need it
I got that Justin Bieber please believe it, nigga I know you see it
They play piano at your viewing, let Alicia key it
I asked Swizzy "could she do it?" he said "nigga, beat it"
Swizz don't fuck with you, Melo didn't either
You fucked that check up, you bit the hand that feed you
And you was 6 feet, you got me digging deeper
Hold up, let's switch the beat, so I can spit some "Ether!"

[Interlude: Meek Mill]
Oh shit! You purple-dickie wearing-, durag-, over-sized fitted-, fake Air 1-wearing nigga!

[Verse 3: Meek Mill]
I say, come on with your soft ass, all you niggas all trash
Couldn't bet a 100 grand, nigga, that's a small tab
I'mma hit him where it hurs, this gon' make his dog mad
'Cause this verse gon' hit this nigga harder than that car crash
That you should've died in, I'm mad that you survived it
But I came to murder you and have you scuba diving
Swimming with the fishes, all you niggas is bitches
Dick riders, knocking on the wood, superstitious
Pause that, I'm all that, I'm really in the trenches
And when I see you, nigga, I'mma have you jumping fences
Cutting through the alleys, you must be on the molly
Sniffing all that white shit and fucking with that Bobby
Come to your hotel and meet you in the lobby
Just to Worldstar you and do you just like Tommy...
Hearns did Martin, I burn in the Martin
That Aston when I start it like a lion when it's roaring
Boy you lying, you ain't touring, you can't even get a show
Shit you like a pound of reggie, they can get you for the low
And I'm like a brick of Diesel, it cost 60 for the flow
You ain't a gangsta, you a wanksta, nigga, 50 even know, whoa!

[Verse 4: Meek Mill]
You say you a gangsta, but you never pop nothing
And you locked your homie out when you heard the cops coming
Rapping for a long time, nigga, you ain't got nothing
You ain't wanna battle Mook neither, nigga, stop fronting
Damn, homie, in high school, you was the man, homie
Fuck happened to you?
You had a doghouse with a doghouse in the backyard?
Now you living in a doghouse in the backyard?
Nigga, I was broke then, now I got Black Card
Your career maxed out, your shit like a MAC card
Easy, nigga, I talk greasy, nigga
And I'mma stunt on Instagram just to tease you, nigga
Couple months we at the funeral
I swear to God that shit was beautiful
Five-X tees, durag's, the usual
Your mama screaming like "Cassidy what they do to you?" OH!

[Outro: Meek Mill]
And this shit called "Kendrick You Next"
I'm just on some shit this time around, everybody get it
You say my name, I give you a thousand, it's just that simple
Meek Milly! Enuff, what up?

[Verse 1]
He's my drugstore cowboy
Italian alloy, classical American
And I'm America's sweetheart
Chic, delicious, sweet tart
Sipping on my Diet Coke
Singin' in the trailer park

[Verse 2]
He like my jeans tight (Yeah)
He likes me mean, right? (Right)
He like my long hair, corset, heels high
We were born to kill, stripped for success
I'm his sweet mess
Do you love me? Yes, yes
Hell yes!

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, I'm a four alarm fire
And I'm what you desire
Like a siren in the night
(Going Nero, Nero)
Baby you's a man on the wire
Risking all that you got
For the love of your life
(You're my hero, hero)

[Chorus]
Let me be your dangerous girl
Let me be your dangerous girl
Let me be your dangerous girl
Let me be your dangerous girl

[Verse 3]
He's the get-rich-quick type
Mafioso-hit type
Girl, I'm gonna marry him
I'm the bad girl next door
Baby's always wantin' more
Buyin' diamond jewelry
Take me to the Jersey Shore

[Verse 4]
He like my mink white (White)
We go out all night (Night)
We're living off the grid
Shinin' in the crime light
We were born to kill, best of the best
The new wild west
Honey, put on that party dress
Hell yes!

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, I'm a four alarm fire
And I'm what you desire
Like a siren in the night
(Going Nero, Nero)
Baby you's a man on the wire
Risking all that you got
For the love of your life
(You're my hero, hero)

[Chorus]
Let me be your dangerous girl
Let me be your dangerous girl
Let me be your dangerous girl
Let me be your dangerous girl

[Bridge]
Me and my baby plannin' world domination
Together, takin' over our fair nation
'Cause we're born to kill, keepin' it fresh
Gold chain, white mesh
Fame is the name of the game
Yes, yes (Yes, yes, yes, yes)

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, I'm a four alarm fire
And I'm what you desire
Like a siren in the night
(Going Nero, Nero)
Baby you's a man on the wire
Risking all that you got
For the love of your life
(You're my hero, hero)
Baby, I'm a four alarm fire
And I'm what you desire
Like a siren in the night
(Going Nero, Nero)
Baby you's a man on the wire
Risking all that you got
For the love of your life
(You're my hero, hero)

[Chorus]
Let me be your dangerous girl
Let me be your dangerous girl
Let me be your dangerous girl
Let me be your dangerous girl

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, I'm a four alarm fire
And I'm what you desire
Like a siren in the night
(Going Nero, Nero)
Baby you's a man on the wire
Risking all that you got
For the love of your life
(You're my hero, hero)

[Chorus]
Let me be your dangerous girl
Let me be your dangerous girl
Let me be your dangerous girl
Let me be your dangerous girl

[Intro]
(Machine gun rap for all my niggas in the back) Uh
(Machine gun rap for all my niggas in the back) Uh
(Machine gun rap for all my niggas in the back) Uh
(Machine gun rap for all my niggas in the back) I

[Chorus]
I just love when I'm with you
Yeah, this shit is on ten
We used to be friends, girl, and even back then
You would look at me with no hesitation and you'd tell me
Baby, it's yours, nobody else's
Yeah, this shit belong to nobody
It's yours, nobody else's
Yeah, this shit belong to nobody and that
What made me think about the game, girl
And how I switched it up with a new thing
Young nigga came through on his Wu-Tang
And nowadays when I ask about who got it
They say it's yours, nobody else's
Yeah, this shit belong to nobody
It's yours, nobody else's
Yeah, this shit belong to nobody
It's yours, it's yours, it's yours, it's yours
That's for sure, that's for sure (Yeah)
It's yours, it's yours, it's yours, it's yours
That's for sure, that's for sure

[Bridge]
How you feel about
Comin' home with a nigga for the night?
If you nervous, hit the lights
I know we only fuckin' out of spite 'cause your man don't
Do you right, do you right
I could fuck you so good, then I hit you with the 9 a.m. in Dallas
Who you like, baby, who you like?

[Verse]
Machine gun raps for all my niggas in the back
Stadium packed, just glad to see the city on the map
I just gave the city life, it ain't about who did it first
It's 'bout who did it right, niggas looking like "Preach"
Open cases on me for a half a million each
I find peace knowing that it's harder in the streets, I know
Luckily I didn't have to grow there
I would only go there 'cause niggas that I know there
I don't know what's getting into me, I just like the rush
When you see your enemy somewhere in the club and you realize
He just not in a position to reciprocate your energy
You ain't ever worried 'cause he's not who he pretends to be
People like Mazin who was a best friend to me
Start to become a distant memory
Things change in that life, and this life started lacking synergy
And fuckin' with me mentally, I think it's meant to be
Yeah, paranoid, always rolling with my mothafuckin' boys
But you gotta understand when it's yours
They don't really leave your ass with a mothafuckin' choice, man

[Chorus]
I, I just love when I'm with you
Yeah, this shit is on ten
We used to be friends, girl, and even back then
You would look at me with no hesitation and you'd tell me, baby
It's yours, nobody else's
Yeah, this shit belong to nobody
It's yours, nobody else's
Yeah, this shit belong to nobody and that
What made me think about the game, girl
And how I switched it up with a new thing
Young nigga came through on his Wu-Tang
And nowadays when I ask about who got it
They say it's yours, nobody else's
Yeah, this shit belong to nobody
It's yours, nobody else's
Yeah, this shit belong to nobody
It's yours, it's yours, it's yours, it's yours
That's for sure, that's for sure (Yeah)
It's yours, it's yours, it's yours, it's yours
That's for sure, that's for sure

[Outro]
How you feel about?
(It's yours, it's yours)

[Produced by Noah "40" Shebib]

[Hook: John Legend]
Last night I dreamt of an angel
I almost passed away oh yesterday but I'm blessed today
On top of the world I’m so thankful
It ain't no mystery, it's meant for me to make history

[Verse: Kanye West]
Niggas thought I couldn't rhyme but I tricked 'em
My pulse quickened, I
Brought myself outta last place, I Michael Vick'd 'em
Niggas thought I let 'em down like Tyson
I got the belt like Lewis
I took these beats, I passed 'em to myself, I'm Kordell Stewart
Back on the corner, back on the block
The Quincy Jones of hip hop, it's my time like Warner
Since I shine like Shyne in '99 with his
A lot of people talkin' real outta like with this
There's a war going on a few bitches wanna start with me
Showing the New World, I'mma Order even more of me
So I can live forever like diamonds
Throw your diamonds up, cause almost dying ain't stop me from rhyming
I hate a deadbeat nigga that rely on his man
See he'll lie on his dick but won't lie on the stand
And go to every single barbershop and lie to the fans
So it's time for Kanye to put the Chi on again
I'm the 2003, Do Or D-I-E
They trying to say the best nigga is Twista, then me
It's all R.O.C., it's all family tree
I got that new G5 he got that new Hum-Vee
Incorporate Young Hov and that's The Blueprint 3
And The Blueprint 2 is 3 mil right now
So cut all that, "I don't like Bonnie & Clyde shit out
Listen

[Bridge: John Legend + Sample]
Oooh hooo
I got nowhere to
Oooh hooo
I got nowhere to
Oooh hooo
I got nowhere to

[Bridge: Kanye West]
Dawg, there's nowhere to hide
All I got is my pride
I almost died
I keep that 2Pac feeling alive
You have no idea how I'm feeling inside
It's the Roc throw your diamonds up in the sky

[Hook: John Legend]
I remember when I was a lad
Times were hard and things were bad
But there's a silver lining behind every cloud
Just poor people, that's all we were
Trying to make a living out of black land dirt
We'd get together in a family circle singing loud

Daddy sang bass
Mama sang tenor
Me and little brother would join right in there
Singing seems to help a troubled soul
One of these days and it won't be long
I'll rejoin them in a song
I'm going to join the family circle at the throne
No, the circle won't be broken
By and by, Lord, by and by

Daddy sang bass
Mama sang tenor
Me and little brother would join right in there
In the sky, Lord, in the sky
Now I remember after work
Mama would call in all of us
You could hear us singing for a country mile
Now little brother has done gone on
But, I'll rejoin him in a song
We'll be together again up yonder in a little while

Daddy sang bass
Mama sang tenor
Me and little brother would join right in there
In the sky, Lord, in the sky

Daddy sang bass
Mama sang tenor
Me and little brother would join right in there
In the sky, Lord, in the sky

Songwriter:  Carl Perkins
You're from Timmins and I'm from Toronto
You worked at McDonald's and I eat McDonald's
We should be together, I think we should be together
All these other girls they're totally crazy, oh, oh, oh
Only you can make me feel the way I feel
Damn, I'm dying to make you feel like a woman, baby

[Verse 1]
I never dreamed you'd leave in summer
I thought you would go then come back home
I thought the cold would leave by summer
But my quiet nights will be spent alone

[Verse 2]
You said there would be warm love in springtime
That is when you started to be cold
I never dreamed you'd leave in summer
But now I find myself all alone

[Verse 3]
You said then you'd be the life in autumn
Said you'd be the one to see the way
No I never dreamed you'd leave in summer
But now I find my love has gone away

Why didn't you stay?

[Skit: Maleek]
Get it right Terio
Ooh, ooh kill 'em, ooh kill 'em, ooh

[Intro: Meek Mill]
You ready? You ready?
I don't think they is

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Nowadays everybody wanna talk like they got something to say
But nothing comes out when they move they lips
I spit crack for my niggas that be moving bricks
With they exclusive bitch
Sippin' on Amaretto when she loose and shit
Niggas sleeping on me then I Freddy Krueger shit
With a few Philly niggas that be shootin' shit
I'm like Dre, I wish I had my nigga Snupe for this
Oh, I grew up, I screw up a oz of crack
Then I blew up they knew us before all this rap
I maneuvered with shooters
You fuck around with me, get smoked like a hookah
My ruger go booyah, I do it for the streets
You do it for the nigga with the backpack
I do it for the niggas on the corner
Tryna make a meal ticket with a crack pack
Hold up wait a minute let me back track
Hov gave you 24, let you have that
Man you claiming you the king of New York
What the fuck wrong with you nigga, step back
Hundred shots, aim straight at your snap cap
Everybody want the crown so I snatch that
Heard your gun go doo-doo-dooo-dooo
Well my gun go blat-blat-blat-blat-blat
What the fuck I gotta whisper to niggas
To earn my respect just to get to these niggas
Go Ether, Takeover or Jigga on niggas
Or really go 2Pac and Biggie on niggas
What the fuck wrong with him
Like really I'm sick of you niggas
You've been in the game like a year and some change
And you feeling yourself so I'm killing these niggas like...

[Bridge: Meek Mill]
(H-h-h-hold up, wait)
Let the beat come back and the streets come back
Niggas on the west tryna make the east come back
Make me grow these nappy braids, make the beast come back like
(H-h-h-hold up, wait)
And a nigga fuck around get the R.I.C.O Act
Shoot shoot, and one, where my free throw at?
And my lil' nigga Bobby can't eat those flats
Like ooh kill 'em, ooh kill 'em
Ooh kill 'em, ooh kill 'em

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
They know Meek Milly, I barely went gold
But Meek Milly look like he sold two million
All this new money I'm getting my nigga
I swear I don't know what to do with it
Yeah it's Meek Milly, I'm bombing on rappers
I really don't give a fuck who with 'em
Pair with a nigga like me one time, like me one time
And ya'll forgot about me
Acting like I don't really want mine
What the fuck wrong with em
Know how we feeling, let me get back to it
Terio like ooh kill 'em, ooh kill 'em
Ooh kill 'em, ooh kill 'em, ooh kill 'em, ooh

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Gucci got it going on, bout to roll one a mile long
Walking through hell with gasoline draws on
Hit the bank, the guap falling off, they got me all wrong
Bullshit on top of bullshit, it's getting piled on
See I'm an OG, you better get your shot, take your child home
You'd be long gone, all gone, no one to call on
Big diamonds on my bezel, damn near bigger than rhinestone
Meanwhile 1017 on the milestone
Follow, hollow, hello, I'm painting everything red, no more yellow
I'm pulling double hurdles
Wish I never met her, Rihanna umbrella
Gucci ?, I'm like fuck a Cinderella

[Bridge 1: Gucci Mane]
Punchanella, Punchanella wearing cashmere sweater
This year I'm doing better so my pink more wetter
And she ? let her, my joint's patent leather
I want your bitch I go get her, smashed her now I can't get with her

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
Punchanella, Punchanella, give me the pussy don't let up

Kissed the lil girl one time, then I'll never let her let up
Kissed the lil baby one fucking time, and I'll never let up

[Zoe]
Justin? It's Zoe
Um, Kelly did not have me call
However, I just listened to Eminem in her car
It is the most disgusting thing I have ever heard in my entire life
And I seriously wanna call his fucking agent
And tell them how fucking disgusting he is
It, like, makes me upset
I'm now nauseous and I can't eat lunch, goodbye

[Verse 1]
You laughed at me, you made me cry
You made a joke, then wonder why
I am a loser, I am a loser
I say hello, you say good-bye
I reach to you, you don't even try
I am a loser, I am a loser

[Refrain]
If losin' you makes me happy
Then why does it makes me cry
Losin' you makes you a winner
Then how did our love ever die?

[Verse 2]
I'm born to lose, you know it's true
And here I stand (Ooh-ooh), I'm losin' you
I am a loser, I am a loser
You are the one to let me know
You needed me, now I have to go
I am a loser (Alright), I am a loser

[Refrain]
If losin' you makes you happy
Then why does it makes me cry?
If losin' you makes you a winner
Then how did our love ever die? Ever die?

[Verse 3]
I am a fool, you know it's true
I believed in you (Ooh-ooh), now you don't even try
I am a loser (Alri-), I am a loser (Wh-what?)
What foolish kind of guy am I?
You break my heart, I wonder why
I am a loser (Alright), I am a loser (Ooh-ooh, alright)

[Chorus]

These R&B niggas vegetarians man they don't want beef
Got the baddest bitches saying 'Oh my God' and I ain't even no priest
And I'll tell these hoes like this
Bitch Im a dog and I ain't got no leash
And peace to all my fallen soldiers
It's real out in these streets

King

[Verse 1]
I'm gonna raise a fuss, I'm gonna raise a holler
About a workin' all summer just to try to earn a dollar
Every time I call my baby, and ask to get a date
My boss says, "No dice son, you gotta work late"
Sometimes I wonder what I'm a gonna do
But there ain't no cure for the summertime blues

[Verse 2]
Well my mom and pop told me, "Son you gotta make some money"
If you want to use the car to go ridin' next Sunday
Well I didn't go to work, told the boss I was sick
"Well you can't use the car cause you didn't work a lick"
Sometimes I wonder what I'm a gonna do
But there ain't no cure for the summertime blues

[Verse 3]
I'm gonna take the weeks, gonna have a fine vacation
I'm gonna take my problem to the United Nations
Well I called my congressman and he said "Whoa!"
"I'd like to help you son but you're too young to vote"
Sometimes I wonder what I'm a gonna do
But there ain't no cure for the summertime blues
My girl likes franks, not pork and beans

I wish I could change, I wish I could change
I wish I could stop saying the same old things
I wish I could be who you want me to be
I wish I could stop being the same old me

[Pre-Chorus]
I wish I could lose all of my blues
I wish I could stop putting my blues on you
I wish I could love like nobody loves
I wish that my goods outweighed my bads enough

[Chorus]
There's no way, there's no way, there's no way
I can get back that girl, cause I'm too complicated
She's not complicated
But I'm too comp-
There's no way, there's no way, there's no way
I can get back that girl, cause I'm too complicated
She's not complicated
But I'm too

[Verse 2]
I wish I could change, I wish I could change
I wish I could stop placing the blame, whoa
I can't stop it, I can't break down
I can't drop it, can't see how

[Pre-Chorus]
I wish I could lose all of my blues
I wish I could stop putting my blues on you
I wish I could love
I wish that my goods outweighed my bads enough

[Chorus]
There's no way, there's no way, there's no way
I can get back that girl, cause I'm too complicated
She's not complicated
But I'm too comp-
There's no way, there's no way, there's no way
I can get back that girl, cause I'm too complicated
She's not complicated
But I'm too complicated

[Bridge]
You know it's killing me
Baby, how can I let you go
Suddenly, there's nothing I need more
There's no way, there's no way
There's no way, there's no way
I can't stop it, I can't break down
I can't drop it, can't see how

[Chorus]
There's no way, there's no way, there's no way

[Intro: Faith Evans]
This goes out to you, and you, and you
Check it out, one-two, one-two
(Ba-da ba, Ba da-da Ba-da-da)

[Verse 1: Faith Evans]
All this love and aggravation
I wasted so much of my life
All this truth and separation
We worked so hard to make things right

[Pre-Chorus: Robin Thicke]
Got that lovin', got that seed
Got that suga', got that sweet
Got that money, got that beat
Got that whatever you need
Oh, I can't fight it
You're my world
Got me thinking I'm no good
Chocolate lover, you're so sweet
Got me thinking on my feet, say

[Chorus: Robin Thicke]
Their'll be no problems to get out of (No baby)
I got to be down
And amazing or I'll go crazy
In this house
I got to be down

[Robin Thicke & Faith Evans]
We gotta get it together (Come on)
We gotta get it together (Sweet baby)
We gotta get it together (I got to be down)
We gotta get it together

[Verse 2: Faith Evans]
You were always number one to me
Even when I cursed your name
And if I could I would've been gone (You know baby)
But nothing's like being in love with you

[Pre-Chorus]
Got that lovin', got that seed
Got that suga', got that sweet
Got that money, got that beat
Got that whatever you need
Oh, I can't fight it
You're my world
Got me thinking I'm no good
Chocolate lover, you're so sweet
Got me thinking on my feet, say

[Chorus]
Their'll be no problems to get out of (No baby)
I got to be down
And amazing or I'll go crazy
In this house
I got to be down

We gotta stay together (I got to be down)
We gotta get it together

[Bridge: Robin Thicke and Faith Evans]
I'll go crazy (C'mon, baby)
Livin' without you
I've got to be down
And amazin', I'll go crazy (So crazy)
Livin' without you
I've got to be down

We gotta get it together (Come on)
We gotta get it together (Sweet baby)
We gotta get it together (I got to be down)

Come on, come on baby, got to be down

[Chorus: Robin Thicke]
I've gotta ask myself
"What's it gon' be, babe?"
Am I gon' save myself
What's it gon' be?
I've gotta ask myself
"What I'm gon' do, babe?"
Am I gon' save myself
What's it gon' be?

[Verse 1: Robin Thicke]
I gotta pop up, pop up
Gotta get up everyday
Something for me and my family
I gotta make decisions
And be somebody
I'm growing up as fast as I can
I gotta make some money
Don't wanna live by their rules

[Pre-Chorus 1: Robin Thicke]
In and out the day
In and out the night
I'ma find a way
Just to survive

[Chorus: Robin Thicke]
I've gotta ask myself
"What's it gon' be, babe?"
Am I gon' save myself
What's it gon' be?
I've gotta ask myself (I've gotta ask myself)
"What I'm gon' do, babe?"
Am I gon' save myself
What's it gon' be? (Oooh)

[Bridge: Robin Thicke]
Something beautiful inside of me (Oh yeah)
Something wonderful inside of me (Oh yeah)
Something beautiful inside of me (Oh yeah)
Something wonderful inside of me

[Verse 2: Robin Thicke]
I gotta pop up, pop up
Gotta live up to the words
Everyone's talking, talking
I gotta be somebody
And for my baby
I'm growing up as fast as I can
I've got to make life better
For everyone

[Pre-Chorus 2: Robin Thicke]
Everyone (Everyone)
Everyone (Everyone)
Everyone
Just to survive, babe

[Chorus: Robin Thicke]
I've gotta ask myself
"What's it gon' be, babe?"
Am I gon' save myself
What's it gon' be?

[Bridge: Robin Thicke]
Something beautiful inside of me (Oh yeah)
Something wonderful inside of me (Oh yeah)
Something beautiful inside of me (Oh yeah)
Something wonderful inside of me

[Chorus: Robin Thicke]
I've gotta ask myself
"What's it gon' be, babe?"
Am I gon' save myself
What's it gon' be?
I've gotta ask myself
"What I'm gon' do, babe?"
Am I gon' save myself
What's it gon' be?
I gotta pop up, pop up
Something for me and my family
(Oooh)
And be somebody
I gotta make some money
Up and down my back, my spine, in my brain
It injures me, babe....
Anger, can make you old, yes it can
I said anger, can make you sick, children... oh Jesus
Anger destroys your soul
Rage, there's no room for rage in there
There's no room for rage in here
Line up some place to go to be mad
It's a sin to treat your body bad
When anger really gets the best of us
We've really lost our heads
We often say a lot of things, oh darlin'
Wish we'd never said
Oh, reason is beyond control
And the things we do for spite
Makes me ashamed
And I mean this, baby, makes me want to the things right
Someday soon I hope and pray like Jesus
I'll reach that wiser age
Hope I will learn I really never never profit
From things I do in rage
One more time-anger, oh anger
When it's flaming hot
Anger burns to the bitter end
Know what I'm talkin' 'bout
When it cools I find out too late
I have lost at love, love, love, dear friend
I said, anger will make you sick
Children, oh Jesus
Anger destroys your soul
I ain't gonna let you get the best of me, babe
I'm gonna go somewhere and cool
This is not the way my head's supposed to be, babe
You've got me feelin' like some silly fool
But I know a real nice place where I can go
And feel the way I'm supposed to feel
I don't want to be mad at nobody
I don't want to be feelin' bad
Up and down my back, my spine, in my brain
It injures me, babe
Anger, can make you old, yes it can
I said anger will make you sick, children, oh Jesus
Anger destroys your soul
Anger
Anger

[Intro: Robin Thicke & Lil Wayne]
All night long I wait
Yeah, hey mama

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Kick him out the bed, I'm comin' over
Got something to show ya
Behold ya eyes, I's wanna hold ya
Just hold ya tight like a four-leaf clover
I be goin' through your flowers, baby, your garden's open
A sight for sore eyes, good Lord I'm focused
Can hardly notice anything other
Than the woman with the face of my future baby mother
Tell 'em

[Verse 2: Robin Thicke]
I'm a big man, she's a big girl
Put on them heels and put on that skirt
She wants to get naughty, we can get bad
She's a good girl with the good girl dance
I'm ice cream, she's a hot swirl
We can get married and live in our world
Let's play rough, we can get wild
I can go home but I'll stay, cheat but I want you

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
So I go by Weezy, love me or leave me
I hate to leave her, I think I need her
She's such a teaser, such a diva
We can park right here, baby, fuck the meter
Throw it to me, baby, I can be ya receiver
Call me in the last minute, I can be ya reliever
Call me at the last minute, I be there even
Late night, early morning or maybe this evening

[Verse 4: Robin Thicke]
She ain't no stunt, she ain't no filly
I wanna get mad, but then not really
She's so fly, I could get mine
But I do it much better with her by my side
Love is alright, we gon' get blitzed tonight
All my girls wanna make that money
All my thugs wanna take that money
All night long I'ma milk that honey so

[Chorus: Robin Thicke]
All night long I wait for your lovin', babe
All night long I wait to tear you to pieces
All night long I wait for your lovin', babe
All night long I wait (All night long I wait for you, girl, all night long)

[Bridge: Robin Thicke]
All night long I wait, to see you, babe
And watch the sun rise in your face
All night long I wait for you to play
And let my open arms take you away

[Verse 5: Lil Wayne]
She say she wanna be the one I get next to, yes boo
Let's do that, who that? You that
The one I wanna get next to, let's move
Get you to the crib, now I see you
As the one I wanna give sex to, sex you
Sexy you, you sexy devil, you
Angel, lookin' like ya single
Thank you, have yourself a drink
I drink too, saw you when I came through
Nah, can't do, nothin' if it ain't you
It's Wayne boo, I don't do what them lames do
I come at you from a whole other angle
Now one time for the ladies in the high skirts
Two times for the ladies in the tight jeans
Three times for the ladies who ain't got no panties on
Let's go home

[Chorus: Robin Thicke]
All night long I wait for your lovin', babe
All night long I wait to tear you to pieces
All night long I wait for your lovin', babe
All night long I wait (All night long I wait for you, girl, all night long)
All night long I wait for your lovin', babe
All night long I wait to tear you to pieces
All night long I wait for your lovin', babe
All night long I wait (All night long I wait for you, girl, all night long)

[Outro: Robin Thicke]
All night long I wait for your lovin', babe
All night long I wait (All night long I wait for you, girl, all night long)
All night long I wait for your lovin', babe
All night long I wait (All night long I wait for you, girl, all night long)

[Verse 1]
Oh baby, oh baby, oh
We both know the truth
If it were the real me and you
This wouldn't be the right thing to do
Now the room is all hazy
We're too lost in the fumes
I feel like it's just me and you
Yeah we got nothing to lose

[Pre-Chorus]
It's too late to run away from it all
It's too late to get away from it all
I'm done with running so
I give in to you

[Chorus]
This moment has caused a reaction
Resulting in a reattachment
Will you take me to nirvana?
I don't think this will last
But you're here in my arms

[Verse 2]
Oh baby, oh baby, oh
We both feel the same
I'm not gonna give you my name
And I don't think you want that to change
We're in this together
We don't know who we are
Even if it's moving too fast
Maybe we should take it too far

[Pre-Chorus]
It's too late to run away from it all
It's too late to get away from it all
I'm done with running so
I give in to you

[Chorus]
This moment has caused a reaction
Resulting in a reattachment
Will you take me to nirvana?
I don't think this will last
But you're here in my arms

[Half Chorus]
Will you take me to nirvana?
I don't think this will last
Cause you're here in my arms
Will you take me to nirvana?
I don't think this will last
Cause you're here in my arms
See those flowers, they need love
See the bluebirds, they need love
See the babies, they need love
All God's children, oh need love

See your mother, she needs love
And my father, he needs love
That's true baby, and I need love too

See those rain drop, rivers they need love
And the mountains and the valleys, they need love
God forgive us, and send us more love from above
Don't find good love every day, we ought to think
Before we throw good love away

Doesn't matter, what you are
A thief or a beggar or even a superstar
As long as you were made by God above
Oh, I know, I know, you need love, we need love

Baby, oh, I need love, I need your love
(I'm standing here), oh baby standing in the need of love, I need love
I need it, I got to have it baby
Oh can't you see that I'm standing in the need
I'm still here cause I need love
I'm still with you dear
Cause I need your love
And I know, oh yes I know
Though you feel you don't need loving
You still need loving too, oh yes you do

It don't matter no, it doesn't matter what you are
A thief or a beggar or a superstar
As long as the Lord made you from above
I know, I know
You were made for love (cause love is what you need and understanding) oh, understanding

You were made for love
Sweet understanding why can't we see we were made for love
You were made for love baby, sweet understanding
Why can't we see, we (you) were made for love
(why is it so hard for us today to see the real)
We were made from love, you were made of love baby you were made to love baby

What's the only thing that's gonna get us together
(love's the only thing that's gonna make this cold-blooded world alright)
What is this we're singing about?
For the love of Jesus, let's do it!

I need a whole lot of love, sugar
I need a whole lot of sweet love
It's a fact
(who) even the slightest thing needs love
(who) all of the folks in jail need love
(who) even a mean old man needs love
Why can't you understand that I need love?
I just want you to know, I just want you to know,I just want you to know.....

[Verse 1: King Krule]
Well, if only
I had a heart to rip into
Because you owe me
A breakdown that would not include
Not to stay around
And see this night through
Girl, don't stay around
And bathe with me in blue
Just one of those things
Just one of those things
So i let you know
I just want you to know, I just want you to know,I just want you to know.....

[Outro]
"In God’s name think what you’re doing"
"No! Jesus Christ! Oh my God!? No, no dear God, no, Christ!"
I remember like it was yesterday
We were over Gwen's
And we was trying one more time to make amends
Oh yes we was
Suddenly it occured to me it did not matter
Whether I was mad at her
Or she was mad at me
Naw, babe
Understanding my condition
I must surely be a wishing
And a hoping to be free

Some say, you can leave, but it's going to cost you
She said, you can leave, but it's going to cost you, yeah
She said, you can leave, but it's gonna cost you dearly, oh
You can leave, but it's going to cost you, hah, dearly

Sometimes your eyes was red as fire
Intoxicated
Sometimes your spirit was moving on me
It wanted to fight me
I had to fight to defend my life
I didn't mind it
You see, I find it
A bit stimulating
But after fighting
We're making love
Ooh baby, ooh baby, ooh baby
Cause after all, you was my wife
Hey, can you still boogie
Boogie down the road sometime

Hey, you can leave, but it's going to cost you
She said, you can leave, but it's going to cost you
You were trying to put me down
She said, you can leave, but it's going to cost you
I used to sing this song, I'm dancin' on
She said, you can leave, but it's going to cost you
Mystery man, what's going down

That young girl is going to cost you
If you want happiness, you got to pay
Oooh baby, used to be the apple of my eye
How come you loved me, baby?
How come you loved me
You used to be my heart's desire
My heart's desire, yeah

I'm gone, get used to it, baby
I'm gone, get used to it, baby
I'm gone, get used to it, baby
I'm gone, get used to it, baby
I'm gone, get used to it, baby
I'm gone, get used to it
I'm gone, get used to it, baby
I'm gone, get used to it
You tried to have them shackle me
Bring me in
Tell me what for
So I'd satisfy you baby
You have won the battle
Oh but Daddy's gonna win the war
Her lawyers worked so hard
Tryin'a take my riches
Rich things, too
Trying to sell my home
Tried to take my life
Not my child too
Tryina upset my woman
Examinin' my soul
But I was strong, baby
Stood my ground and prayed
Asked the Lord to help
Wish he was in a position
To upset the judge

You can leave, but it's going to cost you
You can leave, but it's going to cost you
You can leave, but it's going to cost you
You can leave, but it's going to cost you
You use to say that I was a gorgeous hunk of man
That didn't help me baby
Ah, when you was on the stand
This is Anna's song
Ah, making love all night long
Take a bath in milk, and lay on your satin sheets
Laugh and smile and(oh oh)
Lay a while and(oh oh)
Chocolate mint, candy sweets

(laying across the bed)
(laying across the bed, laying across the bed)
This is Anna's song
(this is Anna's song, this is Anna's song)
Keep on singing (loving my song)
All night long (loving my song)

Oooh work so hard, see me make a dollar
(never worked so hard)
I know I should for my own good
"What's it, husband, makes you so stubborn?"
And oh
Didn't you notice the snow, starting to fall
Come let us sit a while, just listen
To the children laughing and running wild
Anna!
Anna!
Anna!

Yeah this is Anna's song - hey baby
Hey baby, loving you all night long
Let it happen again and again and again baby and again

[Hook: Gucci]
Rain rain rain this way
That's what all the strippers say
Rain man, go away
That's what all these haters say
And I'm a rain man
And I can make it rain
I make it thunderstorm
I make it hurricane
And I'm a rain man
And I can make it rain
I make it thunderstorm
I make it hurricane
YEAAAAAHHHH (x6)

[Verse 1: Gucci]
Most big booty strippers like me
A good kush burning nigga like me
Old dope cooking nigga like me
VBS, don't bitch I'm icy
Now I could probably fuck her for the free
I gave her five hundred just from GP
A little flashy baby I might be
But them other niggas nothing like me
Gucci made it rain on her (on her)
Then he swung his chain on her (on her)
Then he hurricaned on her (on her)
God damn he put the thing on her (on her)
Now shawty got an ass on her (on her)
And I'mma pop some bands on her (on her)
Young OJ, that's my little bro
Any bitch that he wants, I pay for her

[Hook: Gucci]
Rain rain rain this way
That's what all the strippers say
Rain man, go away
That's what all these haters say
And I'm a rain man
And I can make it rain
I make it thunderstorm
I make it hurricane
And I'm a rain man
And I can make it rain
I make it thunderstorm
I make it hurricane
YEAAAAAHHHH (x6)

[Verse 2: Gucci]
Gucci made it rain on her forehead
Told the waitress to bring some more bread
She asked to hit the kush, I told her "go ahead"
Probably tinted Versaces or the Dolces
Super Cali kush it's expadoceous
Crazy-colored karats, did you notice?
Multi-colored Jacob, baby focus
Kush by the bag, baby smoke it
Now it ain't hard to tell that I'm rolling
Get money in the 6, see I'm posted
I buy my own CDs and my posters
I make it rain, but its only for promotion

[Hook: Gucci]
Rain rain rain this way
That's what all the strippers say
Rain man, go away
That's what all these haters say
And I'm a rain man
And I can make it rain
I make it thunderstorm
I make it hurricane
And I'm a rain man
And I can make it rain
I make it thunderstorm
I make it hurricane
YEAAAAAHHHH (x6)

[Outro: Gucci]
And I can make it rain (x8)

[Intro]
Aquí no hay frontera. Esta tierra lo que nombraron los Estados Unidos que tiene la sangre de nuestra raza. Somos una gente ancestral, con un futuro feriante. Que viva Mexico!

[Hook]
How then, can they talk of some border
When they are the invaders?
How then, can they reform immigration
When they invaded their neighbor?

[Verse 1]
America existed before Columbus
Thirty thousand years ago we were here in Mexico
Where's all my Motiacans at? Cock your rifle let it blow
Blow, blow, blow, blow, blow all invaders gotta go
This one for my people, my Mexicano people
The whole earth is yours and no human is illegal
Come across the border every woman and man
The US is the alien, Mexico this is your land

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
We see the same men living out like cavemen
Coming out the cave and them trying to enslave men
How can we obey them? It's better we betray them
Rise up like the reverend Nat Turner and slay them
Mexican people get your education
Tell your little children that this their nation
You own California, You own Arizona
You own San Diego, and Texas the Lone Star

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Take a look at Mexico, then look at New Mexico
What is a New Mexico if there is a Mexico?
All of America They used to call Amexem
Immigration laws are a fraud and we reject them
We are the Olmec, Toltec, pyramid builder
Astronomer, philosopher, and healer
Mexican people rise up right now
And realize that this is your land now
Sing!

[Hook] x2

Get out!

[Hook] x2
So if you think you're too old
Your thinking that you're too cold
You gave up on your true goals
The system gotcha
I'm giving you a new soul
You're never ever too old
To manifest your true goals
Or the system gotcha

[Verse 1]
You're never too old to sell a key
So how could you be too old to emcee?
I'm from where it originated so get me
Why would I stop what I created, even at sixty?
Shout out to Herc and Cindy
Hip hop lifts me and never left me
You know where KRS be
Right there where the best be
When I spit a free I can't help it if that's how God blessed me
So I'm never empty, writer's block never tempts me
With twenty albums I mastered this evidently
So I ask you gently
You don't see how to spot me on the block with my classic medley?
I can't stop, people won't let me
I don't talk sexy, but I do come correctly and you can check me
But just don't compare me to the next G
KRS-ONE: when you get older you'll respect me

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I keep it moving all over the country
Doing underground spots with the ceiling above me
I keep it dark and ugly, microphone crusty
We will be here forever; trust me
I rock the spots that be dusty and banged out
I do house parties, raves and gang hangouts
Others took the same route, we didn't take the main route
You know who they are, I ain't gotta call they name out
They superstars, but in 1986 you ain't know who we are
And notice when I said "who we are", as opposed to "who we were"
Cause the past and future already occurred, but it was blurred
Time reversal symmetry just occurred
My being is timeless if the future remembers me
And there's no end to me, word!
Past and future happen at the same time, especially in the memory
We share the same mind. Images of my future telling me the same sign
In 1983 who I'd be in '09, but it's past 2011 and I flow fine
Rapping at 70? Believe that it's no crime
These youngins rent they style, I own mine
As you can see, I don't be relying on my old rhymes
I'm spitting raw rhymes, right here, right now
25 years, I never put the mic down
Two thousand and seventy three
Two thousand and eighty four
Two thousand and ninety three

Light years ahead
You and me gone be getting down on a space bed
We gone get married in June
We gonna be getting down on the moon
Light years - interplanetary funk
Gonna get down
Star wars interplanetary funk
Still getting down
Music won't have no race - only space
Peaceful space

Now it's time for the trip, step inside my mothership
I can tell by your way that you really wanna stay
Space, funky space
Peaceful space
It's every place
Wait till I feel cool
Hey baby, let's get cool
You know, you look like somebody I met a long time ago
I know I ain't ever met you though
Oooh you look like I've been knowing you for a thousand years
Gosh ooh I don't know what's happening
You know I'm really involved
But I might be checking you out
You know, getting some other reaction
Seems to me though that the reason we together here
Is we supposed to be together

Come on baby let's go peace loving and check out
This new smoke, naw this thing I got
It ain't classified as dope
Smoke I got from Venus
Have had it all week, it's getting old come on
And try this new thing with me baby
Too cold
Come on now baby let's take off clean
Get in this here machine and
Rock it, rock it, rock it, rock it

Hey little baby, let's magnetize magnets!
Makes your love rise, baby

Owww!
I used to hear a sparrow singing, baby
Oh, but one day as I went along I didn't hear his song
But I know the sparrow should sing
Sing on such a morning in spring
Oh sparrow, why don't you sing?

Sing to me, oh, sparrow come around
Come around, why don't you come around?
Sing about melody, aww, melody
About the things you see
Anything you want to sing about
Just sing it on out now, sing it on out

Let the world know what life's all about
Sing, little sparrow, sing
Sing, little sparrow, sing
Oh sing, little sparrow, won't you sing for me?

And for the rest of all my world
They'll appreciate it, I know
Every time I'm feeling low
I know I can always count on you
Sing, little sparrow
About the troubles you're in, places you've been
You can sing I know it, don't you try to pretend
Sing while you're here, sing a song, my dear
Let me hear your song, do you mean to call
Sing, little sparrow, sing
Want you to sing, little sparrow, sing
I want you to sing, little sparrow, sing
A pretty bird song

Sing to me, let me hear your agony
Did you say, "Man's sucking up the land?"
Sing to me of peace and love
Sing to me of God above
Sing sparrow, oh sparrow, sing

Sing to me about man's inhumanity
And all the injustice you see
Sing sparrow, sing, little sparrow, sing
Sing about what to give
Sing about about how to live
I want you to sing your tune sparrow
Oh, little sparrow, sing

Sing to me of jealousy
Aww, sing what that's all about
Sing it all out, shout, little sparrow
Aww, sing at me
Sing me a, sing me a song
I wanna know what's wrong, little bird, tell me
Aww, sparrow
Sing sparrow 'cause I wanna know
You sweet, itty, bitty, pretty bird
Sing before you go
Sing to me, Marvin Gaye before you fly away
Never stop singing sparrow till we hear your song

Sing your song
Sing your song
On and on and on and on
On and on and on and on and
I remember a bird
In this life... of... happiness and sadness (Alright)
When you've lost... out on love... (I know)
And it all... ends up in madness (Play that horn)
And you say, "Love, please go away. Don't torture me night and day."
Then something that's real... Someone you feel comes in

Now I'm falling in love again
I'm falling in love again
I'm falling in love all over
I'm falling in love again
I, I found somebody who says she love me
I'm falling in love again, falling in love again, falling in love
Once again... Hey baby
She's pretty, outside and in...
She's so wonderful
I tried not to let my heart step in
But what to do, baby
What could I do
When somebody real comes in
Someone who feel comes in
Now I'm falling in love again
I'm falling in love again
I found somebody
She says she love me
I'm falling in love again
Oh, beautiful woman
Falling in love again
Falling in love again
Falling in love

The world's so great, baby
So love me
As though there was no tomorrow
There is no tomorrow
So let's have a toast and whisper
See you later
I love you
I love you, baby
I love you

Let's live, not regret it
Let's live, not regret it
Let's live, not regret it
Let's live, not regret it
Time...Time...
Jesus said time would heal ALL WOUNDS
Time...Time...Time...Time
But we have to live right to get the time
Time...Time...Time...Time
Time...Time...Time...Time
Please, Time, you got to be a friend of mine

Sometimes I am unable to move
I let temptation get me off of my groove
Sometimes I get it
Sometimes it's hard
To stay with it
But right now, get it, gotta get it, get it
Got to stay with it
Makin' up my mind, yeah
Gonna get it together
Gonna love every day every night till I get it
All right
Pretty good lovin', oh
Get it together
Gonna love every day every night till I get it
All right - good lovin', oh
Gonna get it together
Gonna love every day every night till I get it
All right - good love
Gonna get it together
Gonna love every day every night till I get it
All right, baby
Gonna get it together
Gonna love every day every night till I get it
All right
(Tick tock tick tock tick tock tick tock -
My life's a clock and it's winding down)

I've been racing against time
Trying my best to find my way
Change our world in just one day
Blowin' coke all up my nose
Gettin' in and out my clothes
Foolin' 'round with midnight hoes
But that chapter of life's closed

From the day you're born
Till the day you're in the ground

I've been racing against time
Trying my best to find my way
Change our world in just one day
Blowin' coke all up my nose
Gettin' in and out my clothes
Foolin' 'round with midnight hoes
But that chapter of life's closed

From the day you're born
Till the day you're in the ground
When did you stop loving me? When did I stop loving you?
When did you stop loving me? When did I stop loving you?
When did you stop loving me? When did I stop loving you?
When did you stop loving me? When did I stop loving you?

[Intro]
Hey, baby, where you goin'?
No, please don't rush off so soon
If you leave me like this
I don't know what I'm gonna do

[Chorus]
Finally, my eyes are open
I dream about you all night long
The only thing that I've been hopin' for
Is 'fore you to go to work, babe, we get it on
I ain't tryin' to make you blush, but I just wanted to tell ya
I think you're great
I know you're late, but I need another taste
Breakfast can wait

[Verse 1]
Grits and gravy (Grits and gravy)
Cheese eggs and jam
Can't nobody cook it like you, girl

This here early morning, need something else on my plate
I think I want another bite of you, babe
Breakfast can wait

[Verse 2]
Breakfast can wait
You really put it on me
You shut it down last night (Shut it down)
I thought the police was gonna come
(Was it loud?) Loud? Yeah, quite
Yeah, I ain't tryin' to make you blush
I just think you're great
Ain't no need to rush
Breakfast can wait

[Chorus]
Finally, my eyes are open
I dream about you all night long

Is 'fore you to go to work, babe, we get it on
I ain't tryin' to make you blush, but I just wanted to tell ya
I think you're great
I know you're late, but I need another taste
Breakfast can wait

[Verse 3]
Hotcakes smothered in honey (Wait a minute)

Fresh cup of coffee, no, no
I'd rather have you in my glass
Only thing's that's gonna sweeten my tongue
Only thing that's gonna last now
Is another bite of you, babe
Breakfast can wait (You don't even have to ask)

[Chorus]
Finally, my eyes are open (Oh yeah)

[Intro]
I'm a do my thing
I'm a do, I'm a do, I'm a do my thing

[Verse 1]
I was born at the end of december
Not afraid that the cold of the winter
Would keep me inside, hey
Ever since mama left me at home
I had to search for a class of my own
And go there in my mind

[Verse 2]
I had a dream like Dr. King
I had a song I had to sing
And I knew it wasn't make believe
When the teacher said to me
Baby, who do you wanna be
Said I don't know but I know that I'm a gonna leave

[Chorus]
I'm so gone (Just you)
All I do is walk alone (Just me)
I'm so gone (Just you)
I can make it on my own (Just me)
Alright

[Verse 3]
Everybody wanna follow the crowd
But I belong in the front singing loud
And I'll go solo, hey
But the fame is a hell of a temptress
Not my wife but I guess she's a mistress, oh
Can I let her go

[Verse 4]
She can play tricks on your mind
Have you leave your soul behind
She's turned some niggas out
But she can't keep her spell on me
She can't keep blackmailing me
I'm free to leave, to be just me

[Chorus]
I'm so gone (Just you)
All I do is walk alone (Just me)
I'm so gone (Just you)
I can make it on my own (Just me)
Alright

[Bridge]
So many (So many people tryna be somebody else)
Tryna be somebody else (Or whatever sells)
I've got my own lane (I've got my own lane, I'm driving by myself)
Hope you wish my well

[Chorus]
I'm so gone (Just you)
All I do is walk alone (Just me)
I'm so gone (Just you)
I can make it on my own (Just me)
Alright
I'm so gone (Just you)
All I do is walk alone (Just me)
I'm so gone (Just you)
I can make it on my own (Just me)
Alright

[Outro]
If I fall then let me fall, yea yea yea
Oh cause I only got myself to blame
Oh it's just me
All I do is walk alone

[Produced by John Legend & Pharrell Williams]

[Verse 1]
You don't have to cry yourself to sleep at night with wet pillows
Girl, I know you're hurt
Did you know that you can dry your pillows with your dreams and smile
It really works
Lay your head back in my arms, oh, I know your worth
So just reach inside your heart and pack your bags
And let's leave this earth

[Hook]
Let's aim high, oh girl
All you gotta do is close your eyes, inhale the sigh and visualize
Let's aim high

[Verse 2]
You work so hard for your boss, to him it's just work
Never considers your dreams, selfish and mean
Damn, that's gotta hurt
Just lay your head back in my arms, girl
I know you're worth
So allow me to abduct your mind with these words
Open your eyes, you're now a bird

[Hook]
Let's aim high, oh girl
All you gotta do is close your eyes, inhale the sigh and visualize
Let's aim high

[Bridge]
You possess the power to do
If you concentrate, mountains will move
If you just believe that it's true
Please make no mistake, I'll be there too

[Outro]
You possess the power to do
If you concentrate, mountains will move
And if you just believe that it's true
Make no mistake, I'll be there too
Let's aim high

[Produced by Dave Tozer & John Legend]

[Verse 1]
Is that music in my ear
It's like I heard nothing for a thousand years
My eyes were closed, locking in my tears

I was so surrounded but still all alone
A great big house but so far from home
How'd you breathe life in this heart of soul

[Hook]
It's like I can feel, it's like I can breathe
It's like I can live, it's like I can love
For the first time, for the first time
For the first time, for the first time

[Bridge]
I'm electric, finally exposed
You see through me, strip off all my clothes
If this is falling, then let me go, oh

[Hook]
It's like I can feel, it's like I can breathe
It's like I can live, it's like I can love
For the first time, for the first time
For the first time, for the first time

[Verse 2]
I'm finally awake and I can feel my heart
It's beating like a drum when I'm right here where you are
I can feel it, I can feel it, oh
Can you feel it

[Hook]
It's like I can feel, it's like I can breathe
It's like I can live, it's like I can love
For the first time, for the first time
For the first time, for the first time
It's like I can feel, it's like I can breathe
It's like I can live, it's like I can love
For the first time, for the first time
For the first time, for the first time

If you’re in my section girl you here to party
Brent Musberger: We welcome you back to Ann Arbor, Michigan and what a pleasure for Herbie and me to introduce Marshall Mathers. Some of you may know him as Eminem, but he's gonna join the Saturday night crew with our music intro starting next Saturday Night.

But folks, I wanna take you to the World Premiere of one of his new videos, called Berzerk. Take a listen, it's headed to the top of the charts.

[Berzerk video plays]

BM: Was that Rick Rubin who was helping produce that, with you Marshall, when you did that?

Eminem: Yeah, sorry. Live TV. Live TV freaks me out a little bit.

Kirk Herbstreit (KH): No!?

Eminem: Umm...yes. I'm sorry, what was the question?

BM: That was Mr. Rubin, one of the all-time greats...producer, huh?

Eminem: Yes, yes.

BM: How long does that take you to shoot a video like that? How many takes? How many hours?

Eminem: Umm...sometimes it's uh...it's usually a two day process, sometimes it could go to three. There's a lot of takes, there's a lot of sticking around waiting...But...it's cool 

[Herbstreit tries to interject] if the video comes out, then i guess it's worth it. You know.
KH: You wanna take it to break?

BM: Yeah...we'll take....you know...you gotta be in shape too, but stay right here with us, we're gonna kick off the 2nd half and I wanna talk about how you're gonna intro Saturday Night Football when we come back.

[commercial break]

BM: 8 EST on ABC, Marshall Mathers will open Saturday Night Football. Mathers, it's a pleasure to have you on the show.

Eminem: Absolutely, pleasure to be here. It's an honor to be able to do that. So..

KH: So you have the single out...album's coming out in November. What are you most excited about with this no album?

Eminem: Nothing.

KH: No?

Eminem: No...uhh...it'll be out Nov 5th. I'll probably be most excited to just be done with it. It's called the Marshall Mathers LP2. And..it's kind of a re-visit to the first Marshall Mathers LP...and umm...that's pretty much all i can say about it.

BM: One final question before you leave. Some of my friends in Montana wanted me to ask you. Will the Lions cover 4.5 tomorrow against Minnesota?

Eminem: Will the Lions cover 4.5?

BM: Yeah.

Eminem: Ummm...I'm not sure man...I don't ever make a prediction on the Lions cause I don't ever wanna jinx it, but I'm such a die hard Lions fan, like...to the core. So...yes, they'll win.
KH: That's all you'll say, leave it at that.

Eminem: Yeah...I'm hoping I didn't just jinx it.

BM: Here's the kickoff Marshall...just stick right here with us now. It's gonna be Wolverines ball. They've got the lead...out to the 25 yard line.

Marshall, again, it was a pleasure having you with us here tonight.

Eminem: And Brent, just how they got fantasy football or whatever. I got you on my fantasy announcer team. It would be you, of course the late great Pat Summerall and John Madden and Al Michaels. If you guys would get together and just call the game....Kirk, you're great too, much respect.

[All laugh]

KH: Not quite to that status yet, I get it!

Eminem: Right. But, you being a legend and you know, if you got with Al Michaels man and John Madden and just called ONE Lions game. The Super Bowl probably would be great this year.

KH: We'd all appreciate that wouldn't we?

Eminem: Man, that would be like a dream come true for me. You are a legend my friend. Thank you.

BM: YOU're the legend my friend! 13 Grammys, 1st rap song to win an Academy Award, an original score...Youve sold 100 million records world wide. YOU my friend are the legend.

KH: No doubt about that!

Eminem: I'm really uncomfortable right now.

[All laugh]

BM: Marshall, take care my friend. We look forward to seeing that video next week.

Eminem: Absolutely, Thank you, thank you...

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
If I were a lame
Only just for a week
I'd look myself in the mirror
And shoot the first thing I seen
No honestly I'd try and find someone else
And I'd make it seem like it's his fault
That I'm broke and can't get on
And he's doin' shit I can't do for myself

[Hook]
If I were a lame
I'd probably understand
How it feels to hate myself so much
I gotta hate another man
Shit I'd say that I'd
Should be right in his place
And talk shit behind his back
But I'm smiling while I'm in his face
Cause I'm just a lame

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
If I were a lame
I'd talk shit to the hoes
Like you shouldn't fuck with that nigga
He ain't rich
I heard he really broke
I would get on a song
And talk as bad as I can
'Bout how I wish I'd catch him slippin'
How his mixtapes don't be shit
And how I'm gone end his career
But I'm his number one fan

[Hook]
If I were a lame
I'd probably understand
How it feels to hate myself so much
I gotta hate another man
Shit I'd say that I'd
Should be right in his place
And talk shit behind his back
But I'm smiling while I'm in his face
Cause I'm just a lame

[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]
It's killin' me how niggas act anytime I come around
No matter how much I do for myself
They wanna bring me down
But I just gotta do me at the end of the day
Cause I'm not a lame
So I can't understand
How it feels to hate myself so much
I gotta hate another man
No it ain't my fault
My shit flies off the shelf
So stop tryna be somebody
And worry about just bein' yourself
Nigga just be yourself

And don't be a lame
No don't be a lame

[Verse 1]
When we see your blue planet we feel tingly inside
Spaceship cold from the vacuum of space traveling
Kitten hatch by the dozen, we feel tingly inside
Burn and burn the reactor churns

[Pre-Chorus]
In our heads, in our heads
The spaceship, the spaceship
The arctic planet whoa oh

[Chorus]
We are alone, the world is not our home
We breathe the air, but we care
We feel the pain, we cannot explain
There are no words, to be heard

[Verse 2]
When we get where we're going we feel tingly inside
Eyes that glow like a burning dwarf

[Pre-Chorus]
In our heads, in our heads
The spaceship, the spaceship
The arctic planet, whoa oh

[Chorus]
We are alone, the world is not our home
We breathe the air, we care
We feel the pain, we cannot explain
There are no words, to be heard
A child's face is lost in outer-space
His eyes are red, in our heads
We move along, we are pretty strong
We breathe the air, but we care

[Solo]

[Chorus]
We are alone, the world is not our home
We breathe the air, we care
We feel the pain, we cannot explain
There are no words, to be heard
A child's face is lost in outer-space
His eyes are red, in our heads
We move along, we are pretty strong
We breathe the air, but we care

[Outro]
But we care
But we care
But we care
But we care

We care!
We care!
We care!

[Verse 1]
My life's an open book
You read it on the radio
We got nowhere to hide
We got nowhere to go
But if you still decide
That you want to take a ride

[Chorus] 

[x2]
Meet me at the wrecking ball
Wrecking ball
Wear something pretty and white
And we'll go dancing tonight

[Verse 2]
I see your smoky eyes
Right across the bar
I've seen that look before
Shining from star to star
Though I can't take that chance
If you got time for one dance

[Chorus] 

[x2]

[Verse 3]
The restless line of cars
Goes stretching down the road
But I won't telephone
Because you might say hello
What is it makes me feel this way?
What is it makes me want to say

[Chorus] 

[x2]

Colombia Ruffhouse Records present
A Refugee Camp production
Fugees, The Score
And now for our feature presentation

[Spoken Word: Ras Baraka, Wyclef Jean, Pras]
Yo
I was fuckin' with, the other day, I was chillin' with Scott
And this nigga was like (Yeah, yeah, what happened?)
And the minute we gotta sit in front our crib with a shotgun
'Cause jokers gonna be bustin' up in there tryna get food, clothing, shelter
TVs, forks, radios, whatever they get they hands on, kid
This shit is getting mad ill out here, man (That shit always happenin', man)
Jokers running around, like, with masks on (Man, fuck that, know what I'm sayin'?)
Until my man Petey think he like Charlie Chan, or Robert De Niro, or Bruce Lee or some shit (A gangster)
He be jumping from behind trees on motherfuckers (What you wanna do, kid, what you wanna do?)
Or cowboys, bang-bang, or whatever, you know
Like my man, he tried to shoot a joker he had beef with (I got the Uzi at the house, know what I'm sayin'?)
He wound up shootin' my man up in the street, in the hospital (Let me smoke this L, then tell me what you wanna do)
Trying to be cowboys, they can't even shoot
Trying to be gangsters, but when the beast come on the motherfuckin' block, everybody break out (Cowboy-ass niggas)
They beat my man Bob G. up the other day
Cops, pigs just vampin' on him, yo (Man, fuck the po-po, it's good for his ass)
Everybody standin' around just watching that shit take place (Those niggas ain't doing right, that nigga ain't smart)
This always take place
Because they only gangsters when it come to being gangsters to theyself
They wanna be Corleone or Luigi (Nigga, I am Corleone, what? What?)
Or Gambino or Gotti or whatever the fuck that is (I am Gambino)
Some people don't even like you, you know what I'm sayin'?
They run around callin' theyself Rahim or Fuquan or Mustapha
No shit, 'cause we think they got power  (What you wanna do then?)
Fuck them, I got power (What? What?)
I got power, I got a family (You ain't got no car, nigga)
I got family business on Avon, on Chancellor, on Prince Street (Y'all blowed up)
Chadwick, on Stratford, Chancellor, uh, uh, Vailsburg
All of the Brick City, boy, that's my family (I got family just around the corner)
We gon' settle the score, once and for all (Where your girl at?)
I ain't gon' sit around and let jokers kill me softly, kid
I'm going out, I'm going out like a bang
And all of these zealots out here (Man)
Tryna steal and tryna bite and take what I got
Like all these big record companies (Yeah)
These, uh, corporations, these stores, they try to rob me?
Naw man, I'm going— I'ma get mine (Man, fuck outta here)
And my girl, we gon' go out together
She gon' be a soldier, kid
When I go out, she go out (My girl gon' be a star)
And we gon' make what we believe manifest (Hopefully y'all don't go eye-to-eye)
Fuck that, 'cause if you ain't ready now, you ain't never gon' be ready (I'm always ready)

[Verse 1]
I used to see you every day
I used to see you every day
I danced around your folk and soul
I danced to all your fucking soul
I left you with your nose a bleedin'
And your toes a creepin' around
Ahhh so mundane and incomplete
Hand my down my pants
And get me off this street

[Chorus]
I'm passed out in your garden
I'm in, I can't get off
Soft
So I'd pop myself in your body
I'd come into your party, but I'm soft

[Verse 2]
Behind the fringe of a whiskey high
Mutiliating cat-like eyes
And in your nose blood, decadence
You try to drag me into your bohemian dancing
Ah, you paint my fingers and you paint my toes
You let your perfect nipple show

[Chorus]
I'm passed out in your garden
I'm in, I can't get off
Soft
So I'd pop myself in your body
I'd come into your party, but
I'm soft, but
I'm soft

[Coda]
I'm passed out in your garden
I'm in, I can't get off
I'm so soft
I'd pop myself in your body
I'd come all over your party, but
I'm soft

I'm passed out in your garden
I'm in, I can't get off
I'm so soft
I'd pop myself in your body
I'd come all over your party, but
I'm soft

It's alright by me, if I let you go
We've done it thousands of times
It's just like Georgia to Maine
Five months alone, lookin down at your feet

(Pick it up
I'll pick it up)

[Verse 2]
Im partially for this
Yeah, I'll do it to you
Tell me please it's a sign, to carry on
Sequoias hide me from you
Leaving nothing inside
Except for 100 days and nights

(I'll pick it up)

[Chorus]
You seem so torn on this
You would again
It's what you're working towards
So do it (so do it)
So do it (Ahh)
You seem so torn on this
You would again
It's what you're working towards
So do it (so do it)
So do it (Ahh)

[Verse 3]
If it were up to me
Id probably make you go
Just so you know how i feel
Your mouth is runnin
You better hurry (pick it up)

Oh pick it up
Spit it out
Oh spit it out

These are the reasons we speak up

[Chorus]
You seem so torn on this
You would again
It's what you're working towards
So do it (so do it)
So do it (Ahh)
You seem so torn on this
You would again
It's what you're working towards
So do it (so do it)
So do it (Ahh)

(I'ma be right here wit it) Dalé

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Word to my son man, I don't let them see the monster in me
Load my 30, leave the crib and bring that choppa with me
I run them streets and make it home soon as my momma hit me
Put my son to sleep and right back to the drama quickly
Papi said he got them bricks and we gon' take 'em down
I call Omelly, "Bring them shooters, we gon' break it down"
He said he coming and he coming in with 80 pounds
We finna line a nigga up and we gon' take 'em down
"Hello" (Dimelo?) "Papi, where you at?"
(En camino) He said it's in and I'm like, "Papi, bring the set"
He brought his shooter, I'ma prolly bring the MAC
I spent my money on a lawyer and it's time to get it back
I got niggas in the bushes and they lurking
Young niggas barely legal but they murking
I hit them with the Desert Eagle and it's curtains
I'ma shoot him in his head cause I heard that nigga working

[Interlude: Omelly & Vock]
Hey Vock man, what's the deal man?
It's Omelly, what's poppin? (What's up cool?)
Heh, ain't shit chillin
Ay, but look tho, I got a sting for us
Get the fuck outta here! What's the score?
80 joints nigga, heh (80 joints?! Who?)
Meek connect man (get the fuck outta here, Papi?!)
Yeah man, just bring the ladders man
Are you kidding me? Say no more man, I'm on my way

[Verse 2: Omelly]
Riding four deep, on my way to Meek
Said he got a lick for us, know this nigga sweet
Said he got 80 jawns, who to call but me?
So I called my dogs cause my dogs gotta eat
Let him off the leash, now it's time to feast
Got McDonald's money but I'm tryna eat Philippe's
Tired of all this drought shit, this broke shit ain't me
If this sting go right, it's gon' put me on my feet where I need to be
I ain't lying Meek, this nigga move, I'm leaving him
I got some loose cannons and they all agreeing with me
Black glove, black hoodies, I brought the team with me
Black strap, MAC-10, brought the machines with me
Now we slidin' down the North, to 23rd and Berks
Cause Papi, he got that work
Young hitters, they with me, they tryna murk
I just tell them, "Chill, we gon' take him for what he worth", uhh

[Interlude: Papi & Young Breed]
Yo, these fucking mama bichos, these fucking cocksuckers
What, what's up, Papi? Talk to me
They tryna set me up, huh? (Who?)
They tryna take my gold (who?! Who want problems?!)
Oh no, Papi, not today, I need you here (it's too easy)
I have a ticket waiting for you in Miami International
And Breed, one more thing: dios me lo bendiga
I'm ready to eat baby, let's get it

[Verse 3: Young Breed]
Yeah, ay
Load up the AK and the motherfuckin' MAC-11
Hundred thangs to a dope boy, fucking blessing
Hit up Boobie, told him, "Meet me on 183rd"
Funny how 187 get your boy hundred birds
Bang, Dade County niggas ain't a game
We call them sticks missed calls, they gon' let 'em ring
SKs, I just grabbed last month nigga
My new shooter ain't prayed in a month nigga
Got the devil in him, all he know is M-1s
Told him bring back all the paper into 10 tons
See them boys selling dope, just a day job
But dropping bodies how they really pay the bill boy
So Papi, how you want it? Body bag, closed casket
Keep it clean, let them live, bring back all the dope and cash?
Paper right, on sight, boy that's just how it go
Tell them how you want it, Papi (matalo!)

[Outro: Papi]
I told these mama bichos not to fuck wit me
Esto es "Self Made 3" papa, and this is "The Plug"
Griselda Blanco lives, Griselda Blanco lives

Since you been away, oh baby
Any chance that you could take my call? Take my call
If I dialed you today, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl you say that you don't wanna talk, but it's cool
I've been thinking about you all day long, hoping you pick up your phone
Girl I know that I don't wanna lose your love
Oh baby, oh baby

[Chorus]
Oh girl I got a secret place that we can go
'Cause I really wanna be alone
And baby nobody else gotta know
Just meet me later on the low
Don't tell me you're my heartbreaker
Cause girl my heart's breaking, heartbreaker
Don't tell me you're my heartbreaker
Cause girl my heart's breaking, heartbreaker

[Verse 2]
Girl you see me standing here, standing here
Standing in the rain, oh baby

Don't tell me you're my heartbreaker
Cause girl my  heart's breaking, heartbreaker

[Bridge]
So what I'm really tryna say is
And what I hope you understand
Is despite of all the imperfections of who I am
I still wanna be your man
I know it hasn't been easy for us to talk
With everyone being around but
It's just personal, this just, for me and you
And I want you to know that I still love you
And though the seasons may change
Sometimes love goes from sunshine to rain
I'm under this umbrella and I'm calling your name
And you know I don't wanna lose that, 'cause I still believe

[Verse 3]
I still believe in love, I still believe in us
I hope you believe in us, the way I believe in us, you don't see
'Cause what you don't see is when we don't speak I really don't sleep, I wanna talk to you
And if I'd have the world in my hands I'd give it all to ya
I wanna know if you feeling, the way that I'm feeling
I wanna know if you feeling, the way that I'm, the way that I'm
And you taught me to be careful with your heart, your heart
You taught me to be careful with your heart, your heart, with your heart

[Intro: Ric Flair]
It's so hard for me to sit back here, in this studio
Looking at a guy out here, hollering my name
When last year I spent more money on spilt liquor
In bars from one side of this world to the other, than you made
You're talking to the Rolex wearing
Diamond ring wearing, kiss stealing, woo!
Wheeling dealing, limousine riding, jet flying son of a gun
And I'ma have a hard time, holding these alligators back

[Chorus: Meek Mill & French Montana]
These pussy ass niggas
Ain't bout that life, ain't bout that life (you ain't bout that life)
Ain't bout that life, ain't bout that life (you ain't bout that life)
Ain't bout that life, ain't bout that life (you ain't bout that life)
Ain't bout that life, ain't bout that life (you ain't bout that life)
These pussy ass niggas
Ain't bout that life, ain't bout that life (you ain't bout that life)
Ain't bout that life, ain't bout that life (you ain't bout that life)
Ain't bout that life, ain't bout that life (you ain't bout that life)
Ain't bout that life, ain't bout that life (you ain't bout that life)

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Anybody wanna act loco?
Who you with? Numerous shots from the .44
Young nigga in the low low
Jumpin' out the thing with a little bad bitch like YOLO
.44 on my hip line, this time ain't no joke
In the hood where there ain't no hope
Now everybody ridin' dirty like it ain't no soap
Everybody get to rappin' when there ain't no coke
Where the money nigga? Cop 44 a bird where I live at
Probably buy the whole load if you get it back
Fishscale when it's stamped in the rental wrapped
Little nigga you ain't stuntin', give that rental back, oh
I like fast cars, fast broads and my last car was like a NASCAR
It go vroom, vroom, then skrr, skrr 'fore I blast off
She go up and down like NASA, bike life on your bitch nigga
Pop a wheelie all in that pussy, she switchin' gears on this dick nigga
Still young, reckless, and rich nigga, yellow diamonds like piss nigga
Stones they glistening nigga, ya'll suckas don't do it like this nigga

[Chorus: Meek Mill & French Montana]
These pussy ass niggas
Ain't bout that life, ain't bout that life (you ain't bout that life)
Ain't bout that life, ain't bout that life (you ain't bout that life)
Ain't bout that life, ain't bout that life (you ain't bout that life)
Ain't bout that life, ain't bout that life (you ain't bout that life)
These pussy ass niggas
Ain't bout that life, ain't bout that life (you ain't bout that life)
Ain't bout that life, ain't bout that life (you ain't bout that life)
Ain't bout that life, ain't bout that life (you ain't bout that life)

[Verse 2: French Montana]
That nigga right there, that nigga right there
Look at that nigga right there

You ain't bout that life, you ain't bout that
That price tag you ain't bout that
That bitch you lovin' we popped that
That shit talk you ain't bout that
Don't get caught in that traffic
Niggas ain't bout that action
You can keep your chain
My niggas don't want that plastic
Niggas talkin' bout they got mils
Niggas talkin' bout they got wheels
Niggas talkin bout they got skill
He alright, he not real
Got a little flow, that's cool with me
Got a little dough, that's cool with me
Got a little watch, a little jewelry
Them Self Made niggas, Volume 3
That work get through like woo!
Shorty got that Ric Flair pussy like woo

[Chorus: Meek Mill & French Montana]
These pussy ass niggas
Ain't bout that life, ain't bout that life (you ain't bout that life)
Ain't bout that life, ain't bout that life (you ain't bout that life)

Ain't bout that life, ain't bout that life (you ain't bout that life)

[Verse 3: K Kutta]
You say y'all with it, but don't handle your business
When the car pull up
Y'all niggas slippin', with the window rolled up
That choppa with to whippin'
Choppa went to whippin', ain't no God, ain't no priest
Just your body, floating in blood, exposed to the street
I'm bout that life, I don't play no game, that snitch shit lame
In the booth, you know I'm flame, Ross put me in the game
MGB, come and get that bang, that molly gang
MMG, cut that check, plus a Rollie and a chain
Y'all niggas fake like reed rocks, roll the Ghost, drop the top
Bad bitch, suck the cock, in the crib or in the car
Pussy nigga hate cause I'm a star
Pussy nigga hate like I'ma stop
Pussy nigga wave like who ya are
Pussy nigga skate if around my car

[Chorus: Meek Mill & French Montana]
These pussy ass niggas
Ain't bout that life, ain't bout that life (you ain't bout that life)
Ain't bout that life, ain't bout that life (you ain't bout that life)
Ain't bout that life, ain't bout that life (you ain't bout that life)
Ain't bout that life, ain't bout that life (you ain't bout that life)

[Verse 4: Torch]
You ain't bout that life, you ain't about that yay
You ain't never seen a brick broke down in whole trays
All I know is gunplay
Hit my nigga Gunplay night time, broad day
I just sat in that cage, I done make front page
Kick the door where y'all stay
I ain't even tryna aim, everybody in that bitch catch a stray
I done pushed that drop, I done whipped that Mazi
I done flipped that molly
You ain't seen a dead body, I done held my dope thang
To seen the niggas who shot 'em in they own blood
Had to wipe momma's tears, she dreamin' I'm dead
My niggas gettin' bread, my niggas beat the Feds
Every night I send a photo, my bad
You ain't bout that life, that life, keep 100 shots in that pipe
200 on my dash, thousand grams of that white
Sky Dweller my watch, two kilos my Cuban
Courtside like Mark Cuban, you getting money? Then prove it nigga

[Chorus: Meek Mill & French Montana]
These pussy ass niggas
Ain't bout that life, ain't bout that life (you ain't bout that life)
Ain't bout that life, ain't bout that life (you ain't bout that life)
Ain't bout that life, ain't bout that life (you ain't bout that life)
Ain't bout that life, ain't bout that life (you ain't bout that life)

[Verse 5: Iceberg]
I'm 'bout that life, when the shit on sight, and they sit on tight
With niggas who snipe, with that big ol' fire, nigga sit on down
You's a goddamn joke, what you out there doin?
You goin' get yourself hurt
This not that movie, these guns really shootin'
And these packs really movin'
I need them M's and y'all niggas still playin'?
I'm tryna build my brand
Lil man can't hear that he got killed for a grand
What the fuck is you saying?
I'm tryna shower my bitches with black balls
Nino Brown someone's baby momma
Fuck nigga, keep talkin' crazy
I'ma buy your bitch and start claiming your daughter nigga
All my work from across the border nigga
If he a fuck nigga, I'll fuckin' shoot him nigga
When we pull up, hoes get starstruck
This Live House, MMG, I'ma teach you fuck niggas to boss up

[Outro: Meek Mill]
These pussy ass niggas ain't bout that life

[Leaked Verse 1: Diddy]
Man these niggas ain't bout that life, naw
And this shit they talkin' I got that twice
Bitch I'm Diddy ho fuck your advice
I said bitch I'm Diddy ho fuck your life
Ho shut your mouth when you in the presence of kings

I got love for all my hatin' niggas I heard you said some things
You bitch niggas need love too I might take you under my wing

[Leaked Verse 2: Rick Ross]
Car expensive, jack a nigga
What they know? I head crack a nigga
Shots fired don't ask a nigga
Gangsta got killed by a rappin' nigga
Rollie gold, I'm Michael Corleone
Scarface bitch I got it goin' on
One time for all the feds watchin'
Get inside tips, when your money long
Got big, my plan bigger
I'm a die tryna squeeze my damn trigger
Niggas hate when you touch that 50 M's
Bentley white, I got five of them
Pull up on the corner with shinin' rims
Smiling like a nigga when he got a deal
Dying, always on my mind for real
Empire, always what I want to build

[Chorus]
Love is like the sea
Leaves you on your knees
Then it pull you in
Then it takes ya, takes ya over, over
Love is like the sea
Leaves you on your knees
First, you're floating high
Then it takes ya, takes ya
Under, under

[Verse 1]
Well, it's cold
Cold under water
In the nighttime
But I dove
Dove to the bottom
To see what I'd find

[Pre-Chorus 1]
That's when I saw a light
A glowing paradise
Thought I'd stay a while
It's been callin' me underwater, child
Everything that I ever dreamed
Taking my breath away (Ay)
Currents got hold of me
Sweeping me away
Wish that I could stay
Takes me to the top
It's a cycle that never stops

[Chorus]
Love is like the sea
Leaves you on your knees
Then it pull you in
Then it takes ya, takes ya over, over
Love is like the sea
Leaves you on your knees
First you're floating high
Then takes ya, takes ya
Under, under

[Post-Chorus]
(Takes ya, takes ya over)
(Takes ya, takes ya under)
(Takes ya, takes ya over)
Over!
(Takes ya, takes ya, under)

[Verse 2]
See, I've been told
Told you only find it once in a lifetime
So you better hold
Hold on stronger then ever
Like it's the last time

[Pre-Chorus 2]
So when you see the light
Like a ship in the night
You have found the place
You been looking for
Like a distant shore
Don't you ever look back again
Here's something you should know (Know)
The sea is still in control (That's right)
Cherish everyday
Cause you never know
It can take away
The very thing that you love the most (Love the most)

[Chorus]
Love is like the sea
Leaves you on your knees
Then it pull you in
Then it takes ya, takes ya (Takes ya, takes ya over)
Over, over
Love is like the sea
Leaves you on your knees (leaves you on your knees)
First you're floating high
Then takes ya, takes ya (Takes ya, takes ya under)
Under, under

[Post-Chorus]
(Takes ya, takes ya over)
(Takes ya, takes ya under)
(Takes ya, takes ya over)
Over!
(Takes ya, takes ya under)
Listen, love is like the sea, yeah
(Takes ya, takes ya over)
(Takes ya, takes ya under)
Can you feel the pull?
(Takes ya, takes ya over)
It's calling you
(Takes ya, takes ya under)

[Chorus]
Love is like the sea
Leaves you on your knees
Then it pulls you in (If you ever felt this way before)
Then it takes ya, takes ya
Over (Then you know)
Over
Love is like the sea
Leaves you on your knees
First you're floating high (Oh, get down on your knees)
Then it takes ya, takes ya
Under, under (Take me away)

(Zaytoven)
I wanna thank God
For opportunity, success
Wealth and health

[Verse 1]
My daddy name Gucci, he the Gucci Mane (Gucci)
Honestly, he turned me on to the ice game (Brr, brr)
He fed the fam with three tops, that the con game
Well fuck you, who are you?
You ain't God mane (God)
I fell out with my right-hand man, he tried to top on me
I guess it's clear we ain't homies like I think we homies (Homie)
I'm at the top and I swear to God, it's really lonely (God)
But I'm not coming down, no stoopin' down, I keep it movin' (Go)
These young nigga's got no respect who make music (Genius)
Broke ass nigga never can get used to it (No)
And the bottom of Sun Valley don't do it like the top do it (Top, top)
Bouldercrest we hear AK's more than church music (Grrat, grrat, grrat)

[Chorus]
In this car, horse on the car, with the top off it (Catch up)
Topless broads drivin' Gucci charger with no bra (Mwah)
Headshot dead in the bushes with his head off (Bow, bow, bow)

Decapitated (Woo, woo)
Decapitated (Grrat, grrat, pow)
Decapitated (Bang, bow, God damn)
Decapitated (It's Gucci, brr)

[Verse 2]
I know Africans that cut off legs
Jamaican's that cut off heads (What's up bumbaclot)
This millionaire still in the feds
You in the county and you can't get outta jail, nigga?
Damn, that's so sad (That's so sad)
That's so bad (Bad)
You played out, JJ Fad (Huh?)
Mob ties, put a head in your bed (Horse head)
You touch Guwop and they gon' mummy wrap your head
I got so much overhead, I gave him diamond bricks instead (Diamonds)
And I chumm without a charm, diamond chain and watch instead (Brr, bling, blaw)
1017, my grandaddy house and I stay next door to Ned
Cooking dope instead of eggs
Hundred PT's in my fridge (It's Gucci)

[Chorus]
In this car, horse on the car, with the top off it (Vroom)
Topless broads drivin' Gucci charger with no bra (Mwah)
Headshot dead in the bushes with his head off (Pow, pow)
Dick cut off, throat slit, block knocked off
Decapitated (Huh?)
Decapitated
Decapitated (God damn)
Decapitated (Wop)

Here's what you do to me, yeah
I think it's time to take control
Girl, I just want to love you

[Pre-Chorus]
Bad that you want to give it
I want to give it to you
I know you won't admit it

Let's go all the way

[Chorus]
('Cause basically I)
I just wanna ride with you

That's how I describe you

[Pre-Chorus]
Bad that you want to give it
I want to give it to you
I know you won't admit it
But at least I know the truth
The way you move around me
There's somethin' seductive to it
Got a place we can go if you're down
Let's go all the way

[Chorus]
('Cause basically I)
I just wanna ride with you

Niggas don’t know us, we never saw these niggas

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
I got V12 sittin' on rims and I parked the bull back in my Benz
Got a FN with a seatbelt strapped on it 'cause it's my friend
Breaking bricks down in my den, I got bills stacked to my chin
Diamond jeans cost an M&M, why? So bright cut off a limb

[Guitar Strumming]

[Verse 1]
Are you lost in your lies?
Do you tell yourself I don't realize
Your crusade's a disguise
Replaced freedom with fear, you trade money for lives

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm aware of what you've done

[Chorus]
No, no more sorrow
I've paid for your mistakes
Your time is borrowed
Your time has come to be replaced

[Verse 2]
I see pain, I see need
I see liars and thieves abuse power with greed
I had hope, I believed
But I'm beginning to think that I've been deceived

[Pre-Chorus]
You will pay for what you've done

[Chorus]
No, no more sorrow
I've paid for your mistakes
Your time is borrowed
Your time has come to be replaced!!!

[Bridge]
Thieves and hypocrites!
Thieves and hypocrites!
Thieves and hypocrites!!!

[Chorus]
No, no more sorrow
I've paid for your mistakes
Your time is borrowed
Your time has come to be replaced

No, no more sorrow

Your time has come to be replaced
Your time has come to be erased!!!

[Hook: Akon]
You funny, used to walk away from me
Same bitch in my face talking ‘bout I ain’t had no money
You funny, used to walk away from me
Same bitch in my face talking ‘bout I ain’t had no money
Do you recognize me?
Say do you recognize me?
Say do you recognize me?
‘Cause now you’re all in my face, while I’m splashing all in your face

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Well remember 1994, Freaknik, man I ain't had shit
In '96 the Olympics came and I ain't had shit
Used to walk outside DeKalb mall broker than a bitch
Window shoppin', window shoppin', I ain't have shit
Sold a nick for a dime thought I did some major shit
But the end of the day man, I ain't had shit
Me and Coca hit a lick but guess what, we ain't had shit
Me and Portro cooked some bricks but guess what, we ain't had shit
Me and OJ at the 508 man we ain't had shit
Had to give my lunch to me for free cause I ain't had 50 cent
Bought a 50 slab for Christmas it was the best money I've ever spent
Made the profit spent it so quick man that I ain't had shit!

[Hook: Akon]

[Verse 2: Young Scooter]
Black Migo Gang you better recognize
So I thank God everyday I'm still alive
Bring you rappers to my block bet you won't survive
Niggas snitchin' to the cops they ain't got a dime
Quarter million worth of watches just to tell the time
I just left Colombia the streets is mine
And you can get a split nigga for a dime
And everybody rich nigga that I'm around
And I can make the work do the Julio
I put wings on the bricks and fly 'em to your door
All my hoes shitted on me five years ago
Now I'm shitting on these hoes like a toilet bowl

[Hook: Akon]
I’m mad that my facial expressions was like that because I’m not homophobic at all, and that whole thing just came off real homophobic. I didn’t really notice it until I got home and saw it. I apologize to Jason for that, because people was laughing and shit, and you know… I really don’t think that’s funny. I saw they were making all the memes and pictures and making fun of him. There’s people out there that think I was doing that to be funny, and truthfully I got gay people in my family. I don’t give a fuck if you gay or you not, I just found it odd that MTV wanted to stand me next to this nigga when they are talking about gay people, that’s all. You know what I’m saying?

[Intro: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Own it
It's yours
It's yours

[Verse 1: Drake & PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Yours
You're still the one that I adore
Ain't much out there to have feelings for
Guess whose it is? Guess whose it is? (Yours)
Guess whose it is? Guess whose it is? Yours
A few bottles on the table, a few waters
It ain't a secret, baby, everybody saw us
Guess whose it is? Guess whose it is?
Guess whose it is? It's yours
Next time we fuck, I don't wanna fuck, I wanna make love
Next time we talk, I don't wanna just talk, I wanna trust
Next time I stand tall, I wanna be standin' for you
And next time I spend, I want it all to be for you, oh
Peakin', I'm peakin'
Wake up with me this weekend, we can, oh
Guess whose it is? Guess whose it is?
Guess whose it is? It's yours

[Chorus: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Own it, own it, own it, own it
Own it, own it, own it, own it
Own it, own it, own it, own it
Own it, own it, own it, I said
Go own that shit, own that shit
Own that shit, own that shit
Go and own that shit, own that shit
Own that shit, you own that shit, go and
Own it, own it, own it, own it
Own it, own it, own it, own it
Own it, own it, own it, own it
Own it, own it, own it, own it
Go own that shit, own that shit
Own that shit
Own that shit, own that shit
Own that shit

[Verse 2: Drake]
Niggas talk more than bitches these days
Just let that shit sink in, ha!
Niggas talk more than bitches these days
Who could get the pussy quicker these days
Still straight with the weed and the liquor these days
'Cause the new drugs got the kids trippin' these days (Trippin')
Bunch of journalists been searchin' for a story
My ex-girl been searchin' for a "sorry" (How you do?)
Couple bitches tryna have me on the Maury
Like nigga, it's yours, you should be supportin'
But where you been at? On tour, gettin' money
Y'all don't even really check for me
You ain't even hit me when that nigga had threats for me, girl
You don't love me, you just say that shit to get to me, girl
'Cause you got the Batphone and my work line
You should call
When the last time you did somethin' for the first time?
You done done it all
I swear to God, niggas talk more than bitches these days
Got you thinkin' that I'm different these days
Broken telephone for every single conversation
By the time it gets to you, shit switches these days, but oh (Yeah)
It's yours, it's yours, it's yours, it's
It's always gonna be yours

[Chorus: PARTYNEXTDOOR & Drake]
Own it, own it, own it, own it
Own it, own it, own it, own it
(It's always gonna be yours)
Own it, own it, own it, own it
Own it, own it, own it, I said
(It's always gonna be yours)
Go own that shit
Own it
Own it
It's yours, it's yours
Own it, own it, own it, own it
Own it, baby, own it, it's yours
Own that shit, own that shit, own that shit

[Verse 1]
Worst—
Motherfucker never loved us
Fucker never loved us
You ain't know, now you know now
Still at it, scrub J's with a toothbrush
Shit, niggas still playing my old shit
But your shit is like the police askin' us questions
Nigga, we don't know shit
Flexin'—nigga, I'm just flexin'
Nigga never loved us
Do it look like we stressin'?
Look at you, look at you and look at you
Aww, I'm glad that they chose us
'Cause, man, it's a mission
Tryna fight to the finish just to see, am I finished?

[Chorus]
On my worst behavior, no?
They used to never want to hear us
Remember? Motherfucker never loved us
Remember? Motherfucker
Remember? Motherfucker never loved us
I'm on my worst behavior
Don't you ever get it fucked up
Motherfuckers never loved us
Man, motherfuckers never loved us
Worst behavior
Motherfuckers never loved us
Fucker never loved us
Worst behavior

[Verse 2]
Hold up, hold my phone
Motherfuckers never loved us
Fucker never loved us
Now you want to roll one
Motherfucker never loved us
So everywhere we go now, full cup
Always hated the boy, but now the boy is the man
Motherfucker, I done growed up
You know me? You know me?
I'm liable to do anything when it comes to that you owe me
You owe me, you owe me
Bitch, you better have my money when I come for that shit like O.D.B

[Chorus]
On my worst behavior, no?
They used to never want to hear us
Remember? Motherfucker never loved us
Remember? Motherfucker
Remember? Motherfucker never loved us
I'm on my worst behavior
Don't you ever get it fucked up
Motherfuckers never loved us
Man, motherfuckers never loved us
Worst behavior
Mothafuckers never loved us
Fucker never loved us
Worst behavior

[Verse 3]
Who's hot, who not?
Tell me, who rock, who sell out in stores?
You tell me who flop, who copped the new drop
Whose jewels got rocks
Who else making rap albums, doing numbers like it's pop?
Same old pimp, Drake, you know ain't nothin' changed
With these funny style niggas, we done put on in the game
I just ask for some blessings at my grandmother's grave
Then it's back to L.A., open the mail, starin' at the check
Enough to make you throw up, man, it's gross what I net
I'm with my whole set, tennis matches at the crib
I swear I could beat Serena when she playin' with her left
Oh, where I reside it look like a resort inside
Nigga, where your shit from? I imported mine
Bar mitzvah money like my last name Mordecai
Fuck you, bitch, I'm more than high
My momma probably hear that and be mortified
This ain't the son you raised who used to take the Acura
5 a.m. then go and shoot Degrassi up on Morningside
For all the stuntin', I'll forever be immortalized
Yeah, back and forth across the borderline
Hate to leave the city, but I've got to do the overtime
Gone all the time, even the important times
I should let you know ahead I'm comin' back on my worst behavior

[Outro]
Remember?
Remember? Motherfucker
Remember?
Hold up, hold my phone
They used to never want to hear us
Remember? Motherfucker never loved us
Remember? Motherfucker
Remember? Worst behavior

[Verse 1]
Somewhere between psychotic and iconic
Somewhere between I want it and I got it
Somewhere between I'm sober and I'm lifted
Somewhere between a mistress and commitment
But I stay down, girl, I always stay down
Get down, never lay down
Promise to break everybody off before I break down
Everyone just wait now, so much on my plate now
People I believed in, they don't even show they face now
What they got to say now? Nothin' they can say now
Nothin' really changed but still they look at me a way now
What more can I say now? What more can I say now?
You might feel like nothin' was the same

[Chorus]
I still been drinkin' on the low, mobbin' on the low
Fuckin' on the low, smokin' on the low
I still been plottin' on the low, schemin' on the low
The furthest thing from perfect, like everyone I know
I just been drinkin' on the low, mobbin' on the low
Fuckin' on the low, smokin' on the low
I just been plottin' on the low, schemin' on the low
The furthest thing from perfect, like everyone I know

[Verse 2]
And I hate that you don't think I belong to ya
Just too busy runnin' shit to run home to ya
You know that paper my passion
Bittersweet celebrations, I know I can't change what happened
I can't help it, I can't help it, I was young and I was selfish
I made every woman feel like she was mine and no one else's
And now you hate me, stop pretendin', stop that frontin', I can't take it
Girl, don't treat me like a stranger, girl, you know I seen you naked
Girl, you know that I remember, don't be a pretender
Gettin' high at the condo, that's when it all comes together
You know I stay reminiscing and make-up sex is tradition
But you been missin', girl, and you might feel like nothin' was the same

[Chorus]
I still been drinkin' on the low, mobbin' on the low
Fuckin' on the low, smokin' on the low
I still been plottin' on the low, schemin' on the low
The furthest thing from perfect, like everyone I know
I just been drinkin' on the low, mobbin' on the low
Fuckin' on the low, smokin' on the low
I just been plottin' on the low, schemin' on the low
The furthest thing from perfect, like everyone I know

[Beat Switch]

[Bridge]
Drinkin', smokin', fuckin', plottin'
Schemin', plottin', schemin', gettin' money
Drinkin', fuckin', smokin', plottin'
Schemin', plottin', schemin', gettin' money

[Verse 3]
Uh, this the life for me
My momma told me this was right for me
I got 'em worried, like make sure you save a slice for me
I should have Spoons serve you up with a fork and knife for me
Your actions make us doubt you
Your lack of effort got me rappin' different
This the shit I wanna go out to
Play this shit at my funeral if they catch me slippin'
Naked women swimmin', that's just how I'm livin'
Donate a million to some children, that's just how I'm feelin'
A nigga fillin' up arenas, who the fuck could see us?
I had to Derrick Rose the knee up before I got the re-up
Yours truly, the boy
I just build and build more, y'all niggas build to destroy
Y'all niggas party too much, man, I just chill and record
No filler, you feel it now if you ain't feel it before

[Outro]
Yes, Lord, this the shit I wanna go out to
Yeah, yeah, this the shit I wanna go out to

[Produced by Noah "40" Shebib and Hagler / Co-produced by Jake One]

[Spoken Intro: Shawn Lawrence]
"There's three balls and a strike
Here's the pitch
It's belted deep to center
Revere goes back, jumps at the wall, and it's gone!"

[Verse 1: Drake]
Yeah, isn't it amazing
How you talk all this shit and we still lack communication?
How beautiful our kids would be, girl, I don't need convincing
How every conversation starts with, "This time will be different"
Oh, oh, the idea is fun
Oh, the idea is fun
Oh, the idea is so fun every time
At least we try for home run every time

[Chorus: Drake]
Swanging, eyes closed, just swanging
Same city, same friends, if you're looking for me
Same city, same friends, if you're looking
I'll be here, just swanging
Don't talk to me like I'm famous
And don't assume, 'cause I don't respect assumptions, babe
I'm just tryna connect with somethin', babe
Yeah, swanging

[Verse 2: Drake]
Ayy
She just wanna run around the city
And make memories that she can barely remember
And I'd allow her
Talk about pussy power (Yeah)
She just wanna run over my feelings
Like she drinking and driving in a eighteen-wheeler
And I'd allow her
Talk about pussy power
She used to say, "You can be whoever you want, even yourself"
Yeah, I show up knowin' exactly who I was
And never leave as myself
But when it falls apart, I'm always still down
To pick a million tiny little pieces off the ground
Wish you would learn to love people and use things
And not the other way around

[Chorus: Drake]
Swanging, eyes closed, just swanging
Same city, same friends if you're looking for me
Same city, same friends if you're looking
I'll be here, just swanging (Ayy)
Don't talk to me like I'm famous (Ayy)
And don't assume 'cause I don't respect assumptions, bae
I'm just tryna connect with somethin', baby
I'll be here, just swanging (Ayy, ayy)

[Verse 3: Drake]
I remember when my schedule was as flexible as she is
She call and tell me be here before the sun up
I be dressed before we hung up
I take Eglinton to 401 East
And exit at Markham Road in the East End
Where all the pretty girls are sleeping
My license been expired, I renew it after the weekend
Fuck, I know I said that shit the last seven weekends
Girl, I guess procrastination is my weakness
I hate stoppin' for gas this late
'Cause there's niggas creepin and not like how we're creepin'
Summer is comin', know you could feel it
Twenty on pump, whatever, I ain't got enough to fill it
Won't knock on your door
My uncle say, "You drive my whip like it's yours"
I got the pedal to the floor
I'm on my motherfuckin' way, swangin'
Don't fall asleep on me, hang in there
I'll be there, just swangin'
I'll be there, just swangin'
I treat you good, girl, like you're famous
I know I'm late, it's always the same shit
But don't fall asleep on me, hang in there
I'm on the road right now, swangin, girl

[Verse 1: Jhené Aiko]
What's up?
Been a minute since we kicked it, you've been caught up
With them bitches, I don't get it, you're a star, love
You shouldn't have to deal with that
I'd never make you feel like that
'Cause

[Chorus: Jhené Aiko]
I love me
I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me
I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you
What are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling, you
You give, but you cannot take love

[Verse 2: Drake]
Yeah, I needed to hear that shit, I hate when you're submissive
Passive aggressive when we're texting, I feel the distance
I look around the peers that surround me, these niggas tripping
I like when money makes a difference but don't make you different
Started realizing a couple places I could take it
I want to get back to when I was that kid in the basement
I want to take it deeper than money, pussy, vacation
And influence a generation that's lacking in patience
I've been dealing with my dad, speaking of lack of patience
Just me and my old man getting back to basics
We've been talking 'bout the future and time that we wasted
When he put that bottle down, girl, that nigga's amazing
Well, fuck it, we had a couple Coronas
We might have rolled a white paper, just something to hold us
We even talked about you and our couple of moments
He said we should hash it out like a couple of grown-ups
You a flower child, beautiful child, I'm in your zone
Looking like you came from the seventies on your own
My mother is sixty-six and her favorite line to hit me with is
"Who the fuck wants to be seventy and alone?"
You don't even know what you want from love anymore
I search for something I'm missing and disappear when I'm bored
But girl, what qualities was I looking for before?
Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, huh?

[Chorus: Jhené Aiko]
I love me
I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me
I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you
What are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling, you
You give, but you cannot take love

[Verse 3: Drake]
Uh, thinking 'bout Texas, back when Porscha used to work at Treasures
Or further back than that, before I had the Houston leverage
When I got Summer a Michael Kors with my momma's debit
A weak attempt at flexing, I'll never forget it
'Cause that night I played her three songs
Then we got to talking 'bout something we disagreed on
Then she start telling me how I'll never be as big as Trey Songz
Boy, was she wrong
That was just negative energy for me to feed off
Now it's therapeutic blowing money in the Galleria
Or Beverly Center Macy's where I discovered Bria
Landmarks of the muses that inspired the music
When I could tell it was sincere without tryna prove it
The one that I needed was Courtney from Hooters on Peachtree
I've always been feeling like she was the piece to complete me
Now she engaged to be married, what's the rush on commitment?
Know we were going through some shit, name a couple that isn't?
Remember our talk in the parking lot at the Ritz
Girl, I felt like we had it all planned out
I guess I fucked up the vision
Learning the true consequences of my selfish decisions
When you find out how I'm living, I just hope I'm forgiven
It seem like you don't want this love anymore
I'm acting out in the open, it's hard for you to ignore
But girl, what qualities was I looking for before?
Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, huh?

[Chorus: Jhené Aiko]
I love me
I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me
I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you
What are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling, you
You give, but you cannot take love

[Outro: Baka Not Nice]
Been Baka aka Not Nice from time, G
Been a East Side ting
Scarborough ting from time, G
Been have up di ting dem from time, G
So I don't know what's wrong with these
Little wasteman out here, eh?
Y'all need to know yourself

[Intro: Drake]
Yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Look, look

[Verse 1: Drake]
I don't know why they been lyin' but your shit is not that inspirin'
Bank account statement just look like I'm ready for early retirement
Fuck any nigga that's talking that shit just to get a reaction
Fuck going platinum, I look at my wrist and it's already platinum
I am the kid with the motor mouth
I am the one you should worry 'bout
I don't know who you're referring to
Who is this nigga you heard about?
Someone just talking that bullshit
Man, someone just gave you the run-around
Niggas downplayin' the money
But that's what you do when the money down
I don't waste time puttin' money down
I just go straight to who got it and buy it in cash
Pussy so good that you gotta come see me on tour
And you gotta fly in first class
This has been years in the makin'
It's all for the city, they know I come right every summer
Cash Money Records forever, I'm always big timin'
Bitch, I came up right under Stunna, you know it

[Chorus: Drake]
Jealousy in the air tonight, I could tell
I will never understand that, but oh well
Been ready, it's real, I don't know about you
She just want to smoke and fuck
I said, "Girl, that's all that we do"
Okay, now you're talkin' my language
Now you're talkin' my language
Now you're talkin' my language
Now you're talkin' my language
Been ready, it's real, I don't know about you
She just want to smoke and fuck
I said, "Girl, that's all that we do"

[Verse 2: Drake]
I'm 'bout to roll one and light it
And fuck it, man, no one's invited
I got to kill off the weak shit that's got all you niggas excited
I can't even listen, you wildin'
I'd much rather sit here in silence
I send all my money to banks in the islands
And eat with Italians, I do
People are funny
You don't even know 'bout the shit that I been through
I just want some head in a comfortable bed
It could all be so simple
Talkin' that shit with your back to me
Just know it always get back to me
Come get your girl
She been here for three days and she way too attached to me
Hate when they get too attached to me
I got to get on the bus and get back on the road
Get what I can out the country
And then I just get on the jet and go back to the cold
Can't even drive with the top off
Been workin' so hard on the album, I missed the whole summer
I just might bring in some girls from Miami to heat up the city
And that's word to Stunna, you know it

[Chorus: Drake]
Jealousy in the air tonight, I could tell
I will never understand that, but oh well
Been ready, it's real, I don't know about you
She just want to smoke and fuck
I said, "Girl, that's all that we do"
Okay, now you're talkin' my language
Now you're talkin' my language
Now you're talkin' my language
Now you're talkin' my language
Been ready, it's real, I don't know about you
She just want to smoke and fuck
I said, "Girl, that's all that we do"

[Outro: Birdman & Drake]
Famous and dangerous
You understand me?
Showtime, headlines, Big Tyme
"Sunshine," tote 9's, bust mines
Flatline, hard grind, high life
Stay fly, it's jet time – stunt, nigga!
Every time you see a nigga – stunt, nigga!
Every time you see a nigga – stunt, nigga!
Swag on head to feet nigga – stunt, nigga!
I just might bring in some girls from Miami to heat up the city
And that's word to Stunna, you know it

[Intro]
Yeah
We had the type of nights where mornin' comes too soon
And nothin' was the same

[Verse 1]
Watch me, goin' out of the way, when I shoulda went home
Only time of the day I get to spend on my own
I was trippin' off how I used to sleep at ya crib
Should drive by right where you live and pick you up on the way
We ain't spoke in so long, prolly put me in the past
I can still get you wet, and I can still make you laugh
You should call into work if that ain't too much to ask
I could pour you up a drink and we can burn somethin'

[Chorus]
Come through, come through, come through, come through
Girl you know we got thangs to do
Girl you know we got thangs to do
So get your ass in that car and come through

Know ya, know ya got that thang that I like
Come through, come through, come through
Girl you know we got thangs to do
Girl you know we got thangs to do
So get your ass in that car and come through

[Verse 2]
Yeah, last night I brought DOA to the studio
They already had a stage and a booty pole
It's supposed to be a lot of hard workin' goin' on
But who the fuck can focus with this twerkin' goin' on?
Someone put a order in for a chicken (for a chicken)
Told my girl to order in, I need the kitchen (need the kitchen)
Yeah, they know I got the hookup, they just wait on me to cook up
Baby, I heat up the stove, you do the dishes, ya know?
Rap game, crack game, ain't that different, ya know?
Last album had it boomin' somethin' vicious, ya know?
And ya know I need ya back in my life
Girl, ya know ya got that, know ya got that thing that I like
Girl, you got that thing for real
When I was on a mission to make it
Who used to sleep on the floor with you when you lived in the basement?
Who else got all the things you need at 4am when it's late?
I always pour you up a drink and let you burn somethin'

[Chorus]
Come through, come through, come through, come through
Girl you know we got thangs to do
Girl you know we got thangs to do
So get your ass in that car and come through
Know ya got that thang that I like
Know ya, know ya got that thang that I like
Come through, come through, come through
Girl you know we got thangs to do
Girl you know we got thangs to do
So get your ass in that car and come through

[Bridge]
Why has it been so long? Why has it been so long?
Why has it been? Why has it been?

[Outro]
Who you been crying to? Who you been flying to?
Whose bed are you sleeping in? Someone's been hiding you
Where have you been? You deserve rounds tonight
Come through girl you deserve rounds tonight
Come through girl you deserve rounds tonight
Come through girl you deserve rounds tonight

They don't work hard as you
Damn, that's so crazy
At the end of the night when you count
Numbers don't lie to my baby
Locker room full of money
Girl, you just did it
I get it, I get it
Man, fuck all that talking, take shots to the kidney
Down payment on the Jaguar
Your roommate got credit
Twelve months on the lease
That's a come-up, baby, don't you ever forget it
Connections are heavy
Every real nigga they fuck with you
Nails chipped out in diamonds
You sparkle, but fuck, man, the spark ain't enough for you

[Chorus: Detail]

I hope you don't fall
That's you on the top of the ceiling
Don't you ever forget 'bout your story
I get it, you did it, you did it
Got a link on the champagne
Your best friend is bartending
Your parents saying this another phase in your life
They can't wait until it's all finished
Shine on them hoes
Let 'em know that you run shit
I get it, I get it
I'm working too hard, let's get into some fun shit
281 to my city
Heard you had trouble at customs
Your girl got a DUI?
I'll make the calls to get y'all through customs
Tell your best friend, "Girl, get your paperwork right"
I get it, I get it
What's up for the night?

[Chorus: Detail]
Oooh, I got the 305 to my city

Extendos, cinnamon rolls, Pillsbury big biscuits
7 .62s, and 5 .56s
Telling is prohibited, snitches witness
Turn a blind eye and a deaf ear
You probably want to mind your business
Act like you can't see or hear
A-tisket, a-tasket
Now the fuck nigga in the casket
My money stretch like elastic
Serving that tragic magic
That nasal candy, that nostril dust
You don't really want to go to war with us
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
Bringing in work in U-Haul trucks
Got more bags than Kris Kringle (Santa)
Puffing on a spliff of Bullwinkle (spinach)
Manipulate a broad with the lingo (slang)
She let me hit it we ain't even have to mingle (game)
All up in her panties like a single
Put it down like I'm Mandingo (beat 'em)
Having my chips like Reno (feddy)
Guns longer than the neck on a flamingo (thumpers)
If you're ready already, then you ain't gotta get ready
I'm out here selling that Becky, bout my chalupa, my fetti
Hoping the law don't catch me grittin' out here pushing that white
Serving fiends, smoking out of homemade pipes
I'm a thug from the mud, I've got the block in my blood
I'll take the top off the bottle and drink up all of the suds
Down and dirty bout mine, I'll put some cheese on your thoughts
Some bread on your head, no matter the cost, my...

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Money stacked up like Pablo, peso after peso
You don't want to war with Pablo
They'll kill you when he say so
Touch down with it like Pablo
In Zone 6, I'm Pablo
Diamonds on my neck like Pablo
And the feds on my ass like Pablo
Pablo, Pablo, Pablo
Pablo, Pablo, Pablo
Pablo, Pablo, Pablo
Pablo, Pablo, Pablo
Pablo, Pablo, Pablo
Pablo, Esco
Pablo, Pablo, Pablo
You don't want to go to war with Pablo

[Verse 3: Trinidad James]
My big brother, the dope man

Tax a bitch like Uncle Sam
Fuck niggas be like "aw man"
Cause we young niggas and we getting it
And y'all niggas is jealous
Cause y'all niggas ain't getting shit
I say yes, nigga, indeed

Pick your eyes up when I speak
Got that big ranch, real horses
Y'all niggas blue cheese
Only talk big money, with real niggas
Y'all niggas too cheap, Pablo!

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Money stacked up like Pablo, peso after peso
You don't want to war with Pablo
They'll kill you when he say so
Touch down with it like Pablo

Feds on my ass like Pablo
Touch down with the dope like Pablo
In Zone 6, I'm Pablo

[Outro]
Escobar did not fear Colombian authorities
But he did fear American justice, and American prisons
When he could not get the law changed
To keep him from being brought to trial in the U.S
He tried to kill the lawmakers

Throw away your television
Time to make this clean decision
Master waits for its collision now

[Pre-Chorus]
It's a repeat of a story told
It's a repeat and it's getting old

[Verse 2]
Throw away your television
Make a break, big intermission
Re-create your supervision now

[Pre-Chorus]
It's a repeat of a story told

Renegades with fancy gauges
Slay the plague for it's contagious

Oy, oy, oy

Take the noose off your ambition
Re-invent your intuition now

Throw away your television
Salivate to repetition
Alleviate this ill condition now

It's a repeat

[Chorus: Sampha]
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
There's no need for us to rush it through
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
This is more than just a new lust for you
(Oh, don't think about—)

[Verse 1: Drake]
Done sayin' I'm done playin'
Last time was on the outro
Stuck in the house, need to get out more
I've been stackin' up like I'm fundraising
Most people in my position get complacent
Wanna come places with star girls
And they end up on them front pages
I'm quiet with it, I just ride with it
Moment I stop having fun with it, I'll be done with it
I'm the only one that's putting shots up
And like a pot luck, you need to come with it, don't run from it
Like H-Town in the summertime, I keep it one hundred
Met a lot of girls in my times there
Word to Paul Wall, not one fronted
I was birthed there in my first year
Man, I know that place like I come from it
Backstage at Warehouse in '09 like, "Is Bun coming?
Fuck that, is anyone comin'
'Fore I show up there and there's no one there?"
These days, I could probably pack it
For like twenty nights if I go in there
Back rub from my main thing, I've been stressed out
Talkin' to her like back then they didn't want me, I'm blessed now
Talkin' to her like this drop, bet a million copies get pressed out
She tell me, "Take a deep breath
You're too worried about being the best out"

[Chorus: Sampha]
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
There's no need for us to rush it through
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
This is more than just a new lust for you
(Oh, don't think about—)

[Verse 2: Drake]
Uh, someone go tell Noel to get the Backwoods
Money got my whole family going backwards
No dinners, no holidays, no nothin'
There's issues at hand that we're not discussin'
I did not sign up for this
My uncle used to have all these things on his bucket list
And now he's actin' like, "Oh, well, this is life, I guess"
Nah, fuck that shit
Listen, man, you can still do what you wanna do
You gotta trust that shit
Heard once that in dire times when you need a sign
That's when they appear
Guess since my text message didn't resonate, I'll just say it here
I hate the fact my mom cooped up in her apartment
Telling herself that she's too sick to get dressed up and go do shit
Like that's true shit
And all my family from the M-Town that I've been 'round
Started treating me like I'm "him" now
Like we don't know each other, we ain't grow together
We just friends now
Shit got me feeling pinned down
Pick the pen up or put the pen down?
I'm writing to you from a distance like a pen-pal
But we've been down

[Chorus: Sampha]
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
There's no need for us to rush it through
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
This is more than just a new lust for you
Oh, don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
There's no need for us to rush it through, oh
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
This is more than just a new lust for you, oh, oh
(Don't do that—)

[Outro: Sampha]
Don't give up, on your hopes
And you tell me somethin's gone wrong
Wholehearted, wholehearted, you care, you care
'Cause I'm such a dreamer, a believer in a sense
Well, if it's all a dream
Then I'm on fire, feels like, I'm on fire
Tell me when I'm lyin', tell me when I'm tryin'

[Intro]
Hey Mr. DJ, put a record on

Me, I got my own back

[Verse 1]
Who the only one you trust? (me)
CEO, so who I'm signed to? (me)
When I got beef, man, who I run to? (me)
She live with you, but why she riding with (me)?
Bags of kush, who my weed man? (me)
PTs, BTs, man, who my lean man? (me)
So much jewelry, I got a million on (me)
Versace down, these hoes keep kissing on (me)
Yellow diamonds, dripping, pissing, say I rap explicit
In the kitchen whipping, doing the dishes, I'm my own assistance
I hit a lick so low cuffed on myself, then I took me to Lenox
If you ain't getting no money with me then what you doing with me?

[Hook]
Me, me, I only think of me
Hoes say that I'm conceited cause it ain't a "we"
I book the club and do the show, chop up the bag with me
I cop the dope, then front the dope, then me come shop with me
On the TV watching me, in a Bentley listening to me
I'm my own stylist, I'm dressing me; I'm my own goon, I'm shooting for me
I'm so turnt I'm jocking me, you hating on me and I'm hating on me
Watching you watching me, and she cheating on you and she cheating on me
Me, me

[Verse 2]
Mimi, Mimi, me, yeah the bitch name Mimi, me
Fucking and sucking me, but I know the bitch running game on me
And she put the thang on me, why you put the blame on me?
That's a shame on me, and her credit card on E, car on E
So, yeah, she put her mouth on me
Put it on freeze is a mini disease
Powerful me, can you do it for me?
Shopping for you like I'm shopping for me
Like I'm trapping for you but I'm trapping for me
Boss of a nigga but working for me
Struggle for you but she cuddle for me
Boss of my label, I'm rapping for me
And where would I be if it wasn't for me?
Tony Montana Six wasn't for me
Wasn't for you and she wasn't for me
Don't leave it to beaver, man, leave it to me
Looking at me and I'm jam of the week
Riding through the through with the top in the teeth
Gucci Gambino, who talking to me?
Baby Latino, she fine in some jeans
Gucci bilingual, I'm talking to ti

[Hook]
Me, me, I only think of me
Hoes say that I'm conceited cause it ain't a "we"

I'm so turnt I'm jocking me, you hating on me and I'm hating on me
Watching you watching me, and she cheating on you and she cheating on me
Me, me

[Verse 3]
I got lean by the PT, but I'm serving me
And they should name me De-me-trius cause all I think about is me
MTV, that's Me TV
HOV, but I'm ridin' just me
One deep chilling in this damn RV
With a touchdown, I'm a front this shit to me
Give it to me, leave it to me
You screaming, "Why did it happen to me?"
Your girlfriend squirting and spitting on me
I guess baby girl happy to see me
Got a trapping disease, smoking disease
Them hustlers ain't welcome? I'm happy to leave
Your uncle and brother be coping for me
10 bales of the weed in they family trees
Snitch of the force, say you got it from me
Average go broke it won't happen to me
Don't got jumper but putting up the numbers
So much cash I need another machine
Rappers are fake, Gucci a G
Who am I featuring? I'm featuring me
Don't need a road manager, managing me
Manage the dope and the weed and the lean

[Hook]
Me, me, I only think of me
Hoes say that I'm conceited cause it ain't a "we"
I book the club and do the show, chop up the bag with me
I cop the dope, then front the dope, then me come shop with me
On the TV watching me, in a Bentley listening to me
I'm my own stylist, I'm dressing me; I'm my own goon, I'm shooting for me

[Outro]

[Verse 1]
(Yeah)
Shit I'm a hustler in the land of the free
Got one foot in the game the other one on the beat
Every morning I wake up to my family's needs
And they gotta eat so I gotta leave
If you don't like it then it's more for me
Ain't nobody gonna help me get these dollars but me
In the home of Mercedes, Bentley's, impalas and Prius
Ain't no room for the needy, only room for the greedy

[Chorus]
Ay you's a fool if you think someone'll do it for ya
Nobody's gonna do it for ya.)
Ay you's a fool if you think someone'll do it for ya

Nobody's gonna do it for ya.)
Ay you's a fool if you think someone'll do it for ya
Nobody's gonna do it for ya

[Verse 2]
I know some people tell me I shouldn't smoke
Same people be mixing their Henny with Coke
Same people addicted to reality soaps
Shit, life's a joke nigga leave me alone
Say what's the difference if I'm minding my business?
Ain't nobody offending, ain't no reason for bitchin'
I've been grinding and mining with my hands in the trenches
Where was you at?

[Chorus]
Ay you's a fool if you think someone will do it for ya
Nobody's gonna do it for ya
Ay you's a fool if you think someone will do it for ya
Nobody's gonna do it for ya
You's a fool if you ain't wanna do it for ya
Nobody's gonna do it for ya
Ay you's a fool if you think someone will do it for ya
Nobody's gonna do it for ya

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Cooked kilos all on my neck, these niggas ain’t no threat
Sky Dweller gold all plain, and I ain’t comin in no jet
And all I want is straight cash, I ain’t even takin' no checks
Cause these hoes don't do credit
And they don’t pop pussy if the money on debit
I got them kilos, she only want me cause I got bricks
She only want me cause I got shit
Before a nigga ain’t have shit
Man, she only want me cause I got kilos
Thirty-six O's in the Pyrex, I be going HAM in the projects
Got a bad bitch with me and she all that
She ain’t nothing but a jump shot, all net (Swish)
Ya'll suckers play foul like Artest

Selling all these bricks, need a hard hat

Say these niggas used to wanna be like Mike
Now these niggas wanna be like me
And these hoes twerkin' on Instagram

Long nose like Ginobili nigga, five rings like Kobe nigga (Bling!)
I was flippin kilo after kilo (After kilo)
Rockin that Versace shit way before the Migos (Migos)
Started with them grams at the project with a stack
Then I flipped it to a brick and then I did the Project Pat
Like, homie what’s the problem? Semi or revolver?
Catch a nigga with the bricks, he know we gon' rob him
Once I caught the lick, we was fresh up out the drop
Man the bitches on the corner watch a player like a scout
I said all I wanted was a kilo, all them bitches wanna freeload
All I wanted was a drop with the head cracked like cee-lo
Thirty-six them Os nigga, thousand grams on gold nigga
Power plants 'bout to blow nigga, DC, Coke Boys nigga
On the corner, pistol on me, smoking on California
Ten chains, catch pneumonia, yeah

[Verse 3: Yo Gotti]
Ain’t no refunds nigga
Wanna get your money back? Better bring your guns nigga
Ain't no receipts in the streets, all sales, you know they final nigga
So if you lose somethin', then it’s your loss
If you don’t weight up, then your scale off
If you trap right, it'll pay off

[Hook: Louie V Gutta]
Yeah, I used to pray to get a kilo, a kilo
Thirty-six O's up that raw for my amigo

Rappers try to step to this with no prediction
It doesn't matter 'cause I'm smashin' and bashin' and crashin'
I hate rappers with a passion when I'm chilling with DJ Fashion
Yo, I need a frickin' Kleenex
Or I die like River Phoenix when I'm chilling with Phoenix
With two Coronas, I'm on the microphone
And I'ma own this, yo, and I'ma bone this in Arizona
Yo, rappers that ain't able
That can't stay stable, I'm on two turntables
With my man, but he doesn't matter 'cause he kicks lyrics galore
And he's only five foot four
Yo, check it out, I bust rhymes and get groovy
My man got carded at a rated R movie
But it really didn't matter, he wasn't insulted
He said "I'm 27 years old,o, I'm an adult kid."
But yo, still Slim Shady gets ill
With the skill and I'ma always build and kill
My baby's mama just to piss the world off
Just to piss the girl's off, yo, I hurl off
The top of the building, kill women and children
And then it hit me, suddenly my wrist tried to slit me
Couldn't believe it, yo, y'all couldn't conceive it
It's Slim Shady, I'll fuck a girl in her cleavage
Bleep that out and you can keep it, just bleep it
Yo, y'all keep it a secret, I'm top secret
Like Pop Secret, rappers, they don't wanna see
Slim Shady, I'm from the motherfuckin' D

[Intro]
That girl looking good over there man. What should I do?

[Kanye]
It's your big brother Kanye To The. And I know how you feel about shawty. Man, I was going through the same thing when I was your age

[Young Leek]
I got you

[Hook: Ne-Yo]
I'm just saying
This is where you should be
Girl let him know that he alright but
You wanna rock with me
Let it go
Come and let me
Give you what you need
Come and let me
Give you what you need
Girl don't play
Send him on his way
Come ride with me

[Verse Two: Kanye West]
And the party was just so tense is
But all this waiting around is just so senseless
And I've been calling her phone so relentless
Mama said the phone bill was so expensive
Your eyes slanted like Lucy Liu
You're frank couture to the juicy suit
Your lips sweater than a Juicy Fruit
From your Louie Vuitton bag to your Gucci boots
Whether we on a train or a two seat Coupe
I'mma fiend for you like Pookie do
I was there with 

[?] Whoopty Woo
She was there with her man, some goofy dude
And I ain't really trying to be rude to dude
All I need is a change to advance, take my hand
Understand from a dance I could end up your man
If I'd been scared wouldn't have seen her again
Oh

[Hook]

[Verse 1]
Shyness is nice and shyness can stop you
From doing all the things in life you'd like to
Shyness is nice and shyness can stop you
From doing all the things in life you'd like to

[Refrain]
So, if there's something you'd like to try
If there's something you'd like to try
Ask me, I won't say "no"
How could I?

[Verse 2]
Coyness is nice and coyness can stop you
From saying all the things in life you'd like to

[Refrain]
So, if there's something you'd like to try
If there's something you'd like to try
Ask me, I won't say "no"
How could I?

[Verse 3]
Spending warm summer days indoors
Writing frightening verse
To a buck-toothed girl in Luxembourg

[Chorus]
Ask me, ask me, ask me
Ask me, ask me, ask me
Because if it's not love
Then it's the bomb, the bomb, the bomb, the bomb, the bomb, the bomb, the bomb that will bring us together

[Bridge]
Nature is a language - can't you read?
Nature is a language - can't you read?

[Chorus]
So ask me, ask me, ask me
Ask me, ask me, ask me
Because if it's not love
Then it's the bomb, the bomb, the bomb, the bomb, the bomb, the bomb, the bomb that will bring us together
If it's not love
Then it's the bomb
Then it's the bomb that will bring us together
So ask me, ask me, ask me
Ask me, ask me, ask me

[Hook: Waka Flocka Flame]
Play with them choppers, choppers
Play with them choppers, choppers
Play with them choppers, choppers
Choppers, choppers
Play with them choppers, choppers
Play with them choppers, choppers

Choppers, choppers
Play with them choppers, choppers
Play with them choppers, choppers
Play with them choppers, choppers... squad

[Verse 1 : OG Boo Dirty]
Shot fired, man down, 100 drone, boy, rocks a don
My young niggas, they wretched, bout to snatch a plug, kidnap it
With them choppers, choppers, choppers, choppers, choppers
Yeah we wet ya block up, block up, block up, block up, block up yeah
It's just me, Guwop, and Waka, riding around with them choppers
Broad day we sparkling, we strapped up desperado
I'm just cruising through the streets, me and Road Runner
4 choppers, too deep, me and Road Runner
Leave big holes in you like doughnuts
Leave the icing on your bitch face like doughnuts
Choppers leave you chopped like cold cuts
Young mob, bricksquad, bitch get your choppers

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
I heard your man, he done passed on, he didn't last long
I'm a drop them bands on, they gone sing a sad song
Killed your granddaddy, fuck nigga, and your grandson
Filled a nigga full of holes, throw his ass a tampon
Catch the tuly with the cooly, tech with the breathing holes
Got a couple O's but half of them ain't breathing though
Got O's that'll kill your ass they don't need no reason for
I'm a buy some reefer smoke and send you to your reefer ho
Knock on your door, it's nice to meet you
Street sweeper, it's nice to bleach you
Thousand t-shirt, I bring my blamer cause i ain't got no trust for people
Hood ass Gucci got me, all I need is important people
Told a goon so I'm a leave em, set it off like Queen Latifah

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Young Scooter]
Aks and 223s carve these extended clips
Got hundred round drums, they shoot down bricks
Million dollars worth of licks, i hit his own 6
Bricksquad niggas know for taking niggas' shit
Scooter and Waka Flocka, OG and Gucci Mane
We shoot head shots, bullets bust your brain
Check your mailbox, I sent you 4 things
You don't cash out, hit you for playing games
Where the young niggas at, I'm talkin' bout shootin' choppers
A green light your nine, next notch off your pocket
When you playin' with the Rockets, gotta keep it solid
Thousands rounds at your ass, your whole hood dying

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Young Dolph]
I pay 200 dollars for my first chopper
All I want for Christmas is a motherfucking chopper
On my knees, saying my prayers with my fucking chopper
Too in love with the streets, I never had a ho problem
I leave it for them suckers
Them bitches say he's cool, but he's a dirty motherfucker
I ain't got time for it, ain't no need me lying to her
I would rather go buy half a pound, get on my click and blow it
A 100 in the chopper, 100 hell rocking
Everything over here 100, that's why they can't stop us
Real street niggas go fuck up the whole profit
20 bands worth of guns sitting in one closet

[Verse 1]
I would rather not go
Back to the old house
I would rather not go
Back to the old house
There's too many bad memories
Too many memories there

[Verse 2]
When you cycled by
Here began all my dreams
The saddest thing I've ever seen
And you never knew
How much I really liked you
Because I never even told you
Oh, and I meant to
Are you still there or have you moved away?
Or have you moved away?

[Verse 3]
I would love to go
Back to the old house
But I never will
I never will
I never will
It's gone alright
Well soak it in
I mean this sponge side
Was coated in
The warmth of your tide
They're breaking in
All across my coastline
It's what I'm waking in
To find heaven
Has bled into my bed
And I'm drifting away

Victor walked out into the High Street
Victor walked to the edge of the town
Victor came to the trash heaps
And his tears came tumbling down
He cried

Are you in heaven, father?
I need you so
Have you melted yet lover?
For reasons unknown
You're sweet like no other
This haze has a warm hold
It radiates me undercover
All through your burdened soul
That's bled into my bed
And I'm drifting away
Neither of us remain
Neither of us remain
So let my waves take what I adore

Swept away
And off the shore
Neither of us remain
On the floor
I know you want this
More and more
So let my waves take
What I adore

[Intro]
(We got London on da Track)

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
See, my girlfriend is Italian and my car Italian too
Ferrari wagon with the stallion, I got on ten rose gold medallions
And plus Guwop eat racks for breakfast, bitch, you know I dine with champions (Champ)
Supercharge my old Camero, pull up and I'm smashing it (Woo)
Watch and chain and ring Lil Darryl, I got a retarded wrist
Them rings and bracelets Jackie Chan 'cause, man, they do karate kicks
All my hoes wear bodysuits and all my cars got body kits (Pull up)
And yeah I got it, ain't fucked up 'bout it, and I don't care none 'bout a bitch (No)
Catch you at the drive-thru, put that pistol on you, take your shit
He said, "I'm just a Black brother like you," what you try to kick some knowledge, nigga?
Matter fact, order a double decker, double stack with cheese, bitch (Don't forget the cheese, fuck nigga)
And if you pull a trick and blow my lick, then I'ma squeeze, bitch

[Chorus: Young Thug & Gucci Mane]

[Verse 2: Young Dolph]
Shoot a snitch leavin' court like Nino (Bah), Dolce and Gabbana tuxedo (Woah)
Garbage bag full of cheese, got a big bag of Cheetos
Hit him with that .50 cal two times, pair of free throws (Free throws)
Live from Castalia, in my trap with a pair of freak hoes (Woah)
These pistols right here, they for anybody, they some freak hoes (Stupid)
Thousand-dollar straps, nigga, I don't fuck with cheap hoes
Your bitch a freak for certain (Certain), me and my niggas workin' (We workin')
Never let a nigga fuck me out my money, I'm a virgin (Uh-huh)
Hood rich nigga, but I still eat Church's (Uh-huh)
That hoe ain't gettin' no money, don't need her around me 'cause she worthless (Hell nah)

Long as she'll help me sell this bud (Ayy)
And she said she bust a hundred times, that's a hundred slugs

[Verse 3: Young Thug]
Last verse, should've went first, hearse
Talkin' slick, get your fuckin' gums burst (Sheesh)
These bitches just turn into green just like fuckin' turf
These bitches, they give me massages like a fuckin' nurse
Huh? Ten-seven, that's that coca-yola
All my bitches smell like flowers, just like lotus (Woo)
Calm down, stand down, man down
Ambulance at the circus, dead clown (Blatt)
I'm a rich nigga, but my bitch booty big like burgers
I've been servin', so you know my strap ain't no virgin
I sneak the bitch a molly-olly, that's her main purpose
She got a twenty-five like Christmas inside of her purses

[Chorus: Young Thug & Gucci Mane]
Baby girl ain't no virgin (Uh-uh)
Baby girl ain't no virgin (No way)
Baby girl ain't no virgin (None of that)
Baby girl ain't no virgin
What you mean, she ain't no virgin? (Burr)

Baby girl ain't no virgin (Well, turn up)
Wait, she can only be with me
I know she's my true love
I've got to keep this straight now
Never seen myself this way
The man she needs in her life
I've got to keep this right

Follow her tonight, to give
What she looking for, she looking for, she looking for
'Cause she's all alone, she's all alone, she's all alone, she's all alone

Follow her tonight, to give
What she looking for, she looking for, she looking for
'Cause she's all alone, she's all alone, she's all alone, she's all alone

All alone

All alone

Wait, she can only be with me
I know she's my true love
I've got to keep this straight now
Never seen myself this way

[Part 1: Pound Cake]

[Spoken Intro: Jimmy Smith]
Good God Almighty—like back in the old days
You know, years ago they had the A&R men to tell you what to play, how to play it and you know, whether it's disco and rock
But, uh, we just went in the studio and we did it
We had the champagne in the studio, of course
You know, compliments of the company
And we just laid back and did it
So we hope you enjoy listening to this album half as much as we enjoyed playing it for you
Because we had a ball
Only real music is gonna last
All that other bullshit is here today and gone tomorrow

[Chorus: Timbaland]
Cash rules everything around me, frikki-frikki-frik
C.R.E.A.M.; get the-get the-get the-get the
Get the-get the-get the-get the money, dollar-dollar
D-d-d-d-dollar-dollar, dollar-dollar bill, y'all (Y'all, y'all)
Cash rules everything around me, C.R.E.A.M
Get the-get the-get the-get the-get the
Get the-get the-get the-get the mon-mon-money
Frikki-frikki-frikki, dollar-dollar-dollar bill, y'all (Y'all, y'all)

[Verse 1: Drake]
Yeah
Uh, after hours at Il Mulino
Or Sotto Sotto, just talkin' women and vino
The contract like '91 Dan Marino
I swear this guy Michael Rapino's boosting my ego
Overly focused, it's far from the time to rest now
Debates growin' 'bout who they think is the best now
Took a while, got the jokers out of the deck now
I'm holdin' all the cards and niggas wanna play chess now
I hear you talking, say it twice so I know you meant it
Fuck it, I don't even tint it, they should know who's in it
I'm authentic, real name, no gimmicks
No game, no scrimmage, I ain't playin' with you niggas at all
My classmates, they went on to be chartered accountants
Or work with their parents
But thinkin' back on how they treated me
My high school reunion might be worth an appearance
Make everybody have to go through security clearance
Tables turn, bridges burn, you live and learn
With the ink I could murder, word to my nigga Irv
Yeah, I swear shit just started clickin', dog
You know it's real when you are who you think you are

[Chorus: Timbaland]
Cash rules everything around me, frikki-frikki-frik
C.R.E.A.M.; get the-get the-get the-get the
Get the-get the-get the-get the money, dollar-dollar
D-d-d-d-dollar-dollar, dollar-dollar bill, y'all (Y'all, y'all)
Cash rules everything around me, C.R.E.A.M
Get the-get the-get the-get the-get the
Get the-get the-get the-get the mon-mon-money
Frikki-frikki-frikki, dollar-dollar-dollar bill, y'all (Y'all, y'all)

[Verse 2: JAY-Z]
Uh, I had Benzes 'fore you had braces
The all-black Maybach, but I'm not a racist
Inside's whiter than Katy Perry's face is
Yellow diamonds in my Jesús
I just might learn to speak Mandarin
Japanese for the yen that I'm handlin'
International Hov, that's my handle
My saint's Changó, light a candle
El Gran Santo on the mantle
Case y'all didn't know, I speak Spanish too, uh
Shout out to World Wide Wes
Everywhere we go, we leave a worldwide mess
Yes, still Roc La Familia
Says a lot about you if you not feeling us
The homie said, "Hov, it ain't many of us"
I told 'em, "Less is more, nigga, it's plenty of us"

[Chorus: Timbaland]
Cash rules everything around me, frikki-frikki-frik
C.R.E.A.M.; get the-get the-get the-get the
Get the-get the-get the-get the money, dollar-dollar
D-d-d-d-dollar-dollar, dollar-dollar bill, y'all (Y'all, y'all)

[Verse 3: JAY-Z]
Cake, cake-cake, cake-cake, cake
Five hundred million, I got a pound cake
Niggas is frontin', that's upside-down cake
Get 'em a red nose, they clown cakes
They shoulda never let you 'round cake
Look at my neck, I got a karat cake, uh
Now here's the icin' on the cake
Cake, cake-cake, cake-cake, uh
I'm just gettin' started, oh yeah, we got it, bitch
I've done made more millionaires than the lotto did
Dame made millions, Biggs made millions
Ye made millions, Just made millions
Lyor made millions, Cam made millions
Beans'a tell you if he wasn't in his feelings
Uh, I'm back in my bag
My eyes bloodshot, but my jet don't lag
A pair of Jordan 3's, tryna chase this cash
Gucci airbag just in case we crash
Uh, last night was mad trill
I'm fresh out of Advil—Jesus, grab the wheel

[Part 2: Paris Morton Music 2]

[Verse: Drake]
Yeah, uh
Look, fuck all that "Happy to be here" shit that y'all want me on
I'm the big homie, they still be tryna lil bro me, dog
Like I should fall in line
Like I should alert niggas when I'm 'bout to drop somethin' crazy
And not say I'm the greatest of my generation
Like I should be dressing different
Like I should be less aggressive and pessimistic
Like I should be way more nervous and less dismissive
Like I should be on my best behavior and not talk my shit
And do it major like the niggas who paved the way for us
Like I didn't study the game to the letter
And understand that I'm not doin' it the same
Man, I'm doing it better
Like I didn't make that clearer this year
Like I should feel, I don't know, guilty for saying that
They should put a couple more mirrors in here so I can stare at myself
These are usually just some thoughts that I would share with myself
But I thought "Fuck it", it's worth it to share 'em
With someone else other than Paris for once
I text her from time to time, she a mom now
I guess sometimes life forces us to calm down
I told her she could live with me if she need to, I got a compound
But I think she's straight
'Cause she supported since Hot Beats
Right before Wayne came and got me out of the back room
Where I was rapping with Jas over beats that I shouldn't have
In the hopes for the glory
He walked right past in the hallway
Three months later, I'm his artist
He probably wouldn't remember that story
But that shit stick with me always
Couldn't believe when he called me
You never know what could happen to you
And I just spent four Ferraris all on a brand new Bugatti
And did that shit 'cause it's somethin' to do
Yeah, I guess that's just who I became, dawg
Nothing was the same, dawg

[Intro: Drake]
Yeah
Alright, yeah

[Verse 1: Drake]
Comin' off the last record
I'm gettin' twenty million off the record
Just to off these records, nigga, that's a record
I'm livin' like I'm out here on my last adventure
Past the present when you have to mention
This is nothin' for the radio, but they'll still play it though
'Cause it's that new Drizzy Drake, that's just the way it go
Heavy airplay all day with no chorus
We keep it thorough, nigga
Rap like this for all of my borough niggas
I reached the point where don't shit matter to me, nigga
I reached heights that Dwight Howard couldn't reach, nigga
Prince Akeem, they throw flowers at my feet, nigga
I could go a hour on this beat, nigga
Yeah, I'm just as famous as my mentor
But that's still the boss, don't get sent for
Get hype on tracks and jump in front of a bullet you wasn't meant for
'Cause you don't really wanna hear me vent more
Hot temper, scary outcome
Here's a reason for niggas that's hatin' without one
That always let they mouth run
Bench players talkin' like starters, I hate it
Started from the bottom, now we here, nigga, we made it
Yeah, Tom Ford Tuscan Leather smellin' like a brick
Degenerates, but even Ellen love our shit
Rich enough that I don't have to tell 'em that I'm rich
Self-explanatory, you just here to spread the story
Wassup?

[Verse 2: Drake]
Sittin' Gucci Row like they say up at UNLV
Young rebel, Young Money, nothin' you could tell me
Paperwork takin' too long, maybe they don't understand me
I'll compromise if I have to, I gotta stay with the family
Not even talkin' to Nicki, communication is breakin'
I dropped the ball on some personal shit, I need to embrace it
I'm honest, I make mistakes, I'd be the second to admit it
Think that's why I need her in my life, to check me when I'm trippin'
On a mission, tryna shift the culture
Tell me who dissin', I got some things that'll hit the culprit
Them strep throat flows, them shits to stop all of the talkin'
All of the talkin', got one reply for all of your comments
Fuck what you think, I'm too busy, that's why you leave a message
Born a perfectionist, guess that makes me a bit obsessive
That shit I heard from you lately really relieved some pressure
Like ayy, B, I got your CD, you get an E for effort
I piece letters together and get to talkin' reckless
Owl chains like credentials, you know you see the necklace
My life's a completed checklist
I'm tired of hearin' 'bout who you checkin' for now
Just give it time, we'll see who's still around a decade from now
That's real

[Verse 3: Drake]
How much time is this nigga spendin' on the intro?
Lately I've been feelin' like Guy Pearce in Memento
I just set the bar, niggas fall under it like a limbo
The family all that matters, I'm just out here with my kinfolk
Off everything my pen wrote, we went from Bundy to Winslow
This for shorty up on Glengrove who love when I catch my tempo
I sip the Pora and listen to Cappadonna (Talk to 'em)
The fresh prince, just had dinner with Tatyana, no lie
All these nineties fantasies on my mind
The difference is that with mine, they all come true in due time
I might come through without security to check if you're fine
That's just me on my solo like "Fuck it", like "YOLO"
Wanted to tell you, "Accept yourself"
You don't have to prove shit to no one except yourself
And if you end up needin' some extra help, then I could help
You know, back on your feet and shit
Tryna get my karma up, fuck the guilty and greedy shit
How much time is this nigga spendin' on the intro?
How this nigga workin' like he got a fuckin' twin though?
Life is soundin' crazy, 40 on Martin Scorsese
And I wouldn't change a thing if you paid me
Now real nigga, wassup?
Ayy, yeah, ayy
How much time is this nigga spendin' on the intro?

[Spoken Outro: Curtis Mayfield]
If there's hell below, I'll see you when you get there
Are you enjoyin' yourselves?
If we may, we would just like to close off with somethin' a bit inspirational
Hopefully something a bit relevant as to us all are having the same fears, shedding similar tears, and of course dying in so many years
It don't mean that we can't have a good life
So we'd like to just maybe close out with something, some food for thought, for all of us

[Produced by Noah "40" Shebib]

[Verse 1]
You say you love me
But they feel like words to me
Well, this just ain't working
Stop thinking you can run over me
Drifting, settling
Off to a foreign place
If I can't see what's in front of me
It's a mystery, well, then apparently

[Pre-Chorus]
Things just ain't the same
And I'm ready for change
Go on, be gone
Bye bye, so long

[Chorus]
Can't you see that you're fading, fading, fading?
Fa-a-ading away, away, away, away
I opened up my eyes and I finally realized
Today, today, it's too late
You're fading away

[Verse 2]
Put a sock in it, just stop running your mouth
Got my mind made up, I ain't coming back again
No way, no way, no way, no way
'Cause I'm so fed up, boy, you got me messed up
If we hooking back up, don't press your luck today, today
I'm blowing you away, yeah, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Things just ain't the same
And I'm ready for change
Go on, be gone
Ta-ta, so long

[Chorus]
Can't you see that you're fading, fading, fading?
Fa-a-ading away, away, away, away
I opened up my eyes and I finally realized
Today, today, it's too late
You're fading away

[Bridge]
Saw you turn into a ghost right in front of my eyes
Tell me, what's a girl to do when she's crying inside?
I'm about to go insane, I'm jumping off this train
Whether wrong or right, I'll be gone by night

[Chorus]
Can't you see that you're fading, fading, fading?
Fa-a-ading away, away, away, away
I opened up my eyes and I finally realized
Today, today, it's too late
You're fading away

[Intro]
You should tell me what's bugging you
And I'ma tell ya 'bout me
Make a wish and tell me your deepest thoughts
And I'ma make it easy
Make a wish and tell me what's bugging you
And I'ma tell ya 'bout me
Make a wish and tell me your deepest thoughts
And I'ma make it easy

[Verse 1]
Emotions running wild
I could feel it when I'm next to you
Something's on ya mind
You wanna stay, but won't tell me
It's a bunch of secrecy
So what are you tryna hide?
I know what that look means
You hold my hand so tightly
Whenever we say goodbye
Standing by the door
I could tell you can't take no more
Blow your secret open wide

[Chorus]
So maybe if you say it (Say it)
Tell me what it is you like (Like)
Baby, baby, don't be shy (Shy)
Maybe you can spend the night (Night)
If you say it
But if you playing (Not with it)
'Cause you know what I wanna hear (Hear)
Say it, that'll make it more clear (Clear)
I need to know how you feel
So baby, why won't you (Say it)
Say it (Say it)

[Post-Chorus]
Won't, won't you tell me
What, what's goin' on?
Why, why you waitin' on it?
What you waiting for?
Soon you should tell me or I might be gone
But I'm here for you, baby
You should put me on

[Verse 2]
I won't shoot you down
Make you feel some kinda way
If you'll be honest with me
Put away your pride
I can see it in your face
You want me permanently (Uh)
Like how I whine when we dancing
I know how it happened
And I'm right there with you
But I won't be the first to put myself out there
The feeling is mutual
But I bet if you (Say it)

[Chorus]
So maybe if you say it (Say it)
Tell me what it is you like (Like)
Baby, baby, don't be shy (Shy)
Maybe you can spend the night (Night)
If you say it
But if you playing (Not with it)
'Cause you know what I wanna hear (Hear)
Say it, that'll make it more clear (Clear)
I need to know how you feel
So baby, why won't you (Say it)
Say it (Say it)

[Bridge]
Your eyes steady talking
And you're tryna fight it
But some things, baby, are not worth hiding
And we can find heaven
If we go look together
So won't, won't you tell me
And get it off your chest
Your eyes steady talking
And you're tryna fight it
But some things, baby, are not worth hiding
And we can find heaven
If we go look together
So won't, won't you tell me
And get it off your chest

[Chorus]
So maybe if you say it (Say it)
Tell me what it is you like (Like)
Baby, baby, don't be shy (Shy)
Maybe you can spend the night (Night)
If you say it
But if you playing (Not with it)
'Cause you know what I wanna hear (Hear)
Say it, that'll make it more clear (Clear)
I need to know how you feel
So baby why won't you (Say it)
Say it (Say it)

[Bridge]
Your eyes steady talking
And you're tryna fight it
But some things, baby, are not worth hiding
And we can find heaven
If we go look together
So won't, won't you tell me
And get it off your chest
Your eyes steady talking
And you're tryna fight it
But some things, baby, are not worth hiding
And we can find heaven
If we go look together
So won't, won't you tell me
And get it off your chest

[Chorus]
So maybe if you say it (Say it)
Tell me what it is you like (Like)
Baby, baby, don't be shy (Shy)

Say it (Say it)

[Verse 1]
We stay moving around solo
Ask us where you at, we don't know
And don't care (Don't care)
All we know is we was at home 'cause you left us there
You got your boys and got gone
And left us all alone
Now she in the club with a freaky dress on
Cats don't want her to keep that dress on
Tryna get enough drinks in her system
Take it to the tele and make her a victim

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Patron on brain, ball player in her face
They shake the spot, she's just another case

[Chorus]
Easy for a good girl to go bad
And once we've gone (Gone)
Best believe we've gone forever
Don't be the reason, don't be the reason
You better learn how to treat us right
'Cause once a good girl goes bad, we done forever

[Verse 2]
He's staying with a flock of them, oh yeah
Got a girl at home, but he don't care
Won't care (Won't care)
All he'll do is keep me at home, won't let me go nowhere
He thinks because I'm at home, I won't be gettin' it on
And now I'm finding numbers in the jacket pockets
Tricks calling the house, non-stop it's
Getting out of control, finally I can't take no more

[Pre-Chorus 2]
He finds a letter on the stairs, saying this is the end
I packed my bag and left with your best friend, oh

[Chorus]
Easy for a good girl to go bad
And once we've gone (Gone)
Best believe we've gone forever
Don't be the reason, don't be the reason
You better learn how to treat us right
'Cause once a good girl goes bad, we done forever

[Bridge]
We stay moving around solo
Ask us where you at, we don't know
And don't care (Don't care)
All we know is we was at home 'cause you left us there
You got your boys and got gone
And left us all alone, oh

[Chorus]
Easy for a good girl to go bad
And once we've gone (Gone)
Best believe we've gone forever
Don't need a reason, don't need a reason
You better learn how to treat us right
'Cause once a good girl goes bad
We done forever

[Outro]
We gone forever
We gone forever

[Verse 1: Rihanna]
It's been a minute since I saw you, boy
Must admit, it's good to hear your voice
And I guess that I forgot just how you make me feel when you're around
See you haven't lost your sense of style
And you still could melt me with your smile
Can't deny that I still got these feelings deep inside

[Pre-Chorus: Rihanna]
It's funny how things could change, but still remain the same
Isn't love just a crazy game?
Baby, here I go again

[Chorus: Rihanna]
I look into your eyes and then my heart remembers when
And I realize, I've never gotten over you
Every time I hear your name
It's like the sun shined through the rain
And I realize it's happening
Baby, here I go again
Here I go again

[Verse 2: Rihanna]
Still remember how you make me weak
How I fought to find the words to speak
I just can't escape the memories
I tried, but I just can't break free
Thought I closed the door on what we had
But these feelings just keep coming back
Didn't think that you could make me lose control like that

[Pre-Chorus: Rihanna]
It's funny how things could change, but still remain the same
Isn't love just a crazy game?
Baby, here I go again

[Chorus: Rihanna]
I look into your eyes and then my heart remembers when
And I realize, I've never gotten over you
Everytime I hear your name
It's like the sun shined through the rain
And I realize it's happening
Baby, here I go again
Here I go again

[Verse 3: J-Status]
Sweet lovin' is my ting
So you know mi got fi swing
That's why yuh request it again
Without a doubt yuh want to spend
And to experience it again
Because yuh love the way yuh felt back then
So make me light it up again
Reignite the flames again
'Cause I really miss 'dem days when we used to chill
Up on the hill watch the sun set in West Negril
Girl yuh Bajan beauty it a gimme di chill
Not to mention the way you are within'

[Pre-Chorus: Rihanna]
It's funny how things could change, but still remain the same
Isn't love just a crazy game?
Baby, here I go again

[Chorus: Rihanna]
I look into your eyes and then my heart remembers when
And I realize I've never gotten over you
Everytime I hear your name
It's like the sun shined through the rain
And I realize it's happening
Baby, here I go again
Here I go again
Baby, here I go again

Do indie girls like to take pictures of dead leaves?
Yes, I guess I'm young and handsome
I spread girls like cancer
Fans screaming, they telling me that it's not enough

All right, all right. Um, alright. We can all freestyle. I'm sorry

[Verse 1]
Some boys kiss me, some boys hug me
I think they're okay
If they don't give me proper credit, I just walk away
They can beg and they can plead
But they can't see the light (That's right)
'Cause the boy with the cold hard cash is always Mister Right

[Chorus]
'Cause we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl
You know that we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl

[Verse 2]
Some boys romance, some boys slow dance
That's all right with me
If they can't raise my interest, then I have to let them be
Some boys try, and some boys lie
But I don't let them play, no way
Only boys that save their pennies make my rainy day

[Chorus]
'Cause we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl
You know that we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl
Living in a material world
And I am a material girl
You know that we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl

Boys may come, and boys may go
And that's all right, you see
Experience has made me rich, and now they're after me

[Chorus]
'Cause everybody's living in a material world
And I am a material girl
You know that we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl
Living in a material world
And I am a material girl
You know that we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl

Kisses don't, no, they don't, never don't lie
You can run if you want, but you can't hide
Tellin' you, it's the truth, don't you ask why
Kisses don't, no, they don't, kisses don't lie

[Verse 1]
Emotions come and go
Who knows how the wind will blow?
There's so little in this world to trust in
Seduce themselves with lies
Some don't realize
They call it love, but it's really only lustin', yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
So you see, you and me
We're gettin' close to the danger zone
Show me how, tell me now
Should I stay or should I go?
'Cause I'm caught between "yes" and "no"

[Chorus]
'Cause when you kiss me
I feel everything that I've been missin'
I try to slow down, but my heart won't listen
And it's tearin' me all up inside
And when you touch me
I feel a rush, but I'm afraid that it might crush me
Should I put my trust in somethin' I don't trust in?
I try to run, but there's no place to hide
'Cause, baby, kisses don't lie

[Post-Chorus]
Kisses don't, no, they don't, never don't lie (Baby, kisses don't lie)
You can run if you want, but you can't hide
Tellin' you, it's the truth, don't you ask why (Woah)
Kisses don't, no, they don't, kisses don't lie (Woah)

[Verse 2]
You whispered in my ear
But are your words sincere?
'Cause pretty words can cut just like a knife
You see, I'm nobody's fool
I play by my own rules
So please think twice before you step into my life

[Pre-Chorus]
So you see, you and me
We're gettin' close to the danger zone
Show me how, tell me now
Should I stay or should I go?
'Cause I'm caught between "yes" and "no"

[Chorus]
'Cause when you kiss me
I feel everything that I've been missin'
I try to slow down, but my heart won't listen (Listen, hey, oh)
And it's tearin' me all up inside (Inside)
And when you touch me
I feel a rush, but I'm afraid that it might crush me (Crush me, baby)
Should I put my trust in somethin' I don't trust in? (Trust in, hey, yeah)
I try to run, but there's no place to hide
'Cause, baby, kisses don't lie

[Post-Chorus]
Kisses don't, no, they don't, never don't lie (Don't lie, baby, kisses don't lie)
You can run if you want, but you can't hide
Tellin' you, it's the truth, don't you ask why (Woah)
Kisses don't, no, they don't, kisses don't lie (Woah)
Kisses don't, no, they don't, never don't lie

And when you touch me
I feel a rush, but I'm afraid that it might crush me
Should I put my trust in somethin' I don't trust in? (Trust in, baby, yeah)

[Intro: Rihanna]
Oh, oh
Oh, oh

[Verse 1: Rihanna]
I'm not concerned with people
Who prey on the wealth of their fellow man (Oh yeah)
'Cause they only wanna know you and roll you
Only for the things you have
I just think it's so sad

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Get dem haters out your circle (Haters)
Smile in your face, but all they wanna do is bring you down (Bring you down, no, no)
Down (Down, yeah)

Anything to bring you down
Down (Down)

[Verse 2: Dwane Husbands & Rihanna]
They keep evil thoughts in their hearts (What you don't know)
You can't let them knock your hustle
After them not how much you struggle
They turn green with envy when you're on top
And dem heart is full with strife
Dem all gon' try fi take your life (Dem haters)

[Chorus: Rihanna & Dwane Husbands]
Get dem haters out your circle (Know they're gonna smile in your face)
Smile in your face, but all they wanna do is bring you down (Bring you down)

[Bridge: Rihanna]
You know they talk about you when they tell the lies
So don't be fooled, you better recognize
They're not there for you, they don't care for you
Trust me 'cause I know it's true
You know they smile in your face and make you think they're down
But then they turn against you when you're not around
It's just jealousy and dishonesty
So hold on to your sanity

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Get dem haters out your circle (Believe me when I tell you)
Smile in your face, but all they wanna do is bring you down (No, no)
Down (Down)

[Outro: Rihanna]

Trust me 'cause I know it's true
You know they smile in your face and make you think they're down
But then they turn against you when you're not around
It's just jealousy and dishonesty
So hold on to your sanity

[Verse 1]
I never should've waited so long to say
What I've always known since the very first day
Thought that you would stay forever with me
But the time has come to leave

[Chorus]
Before we turn out the lights and close our eyes
I'll tell you a secret I've held all my life
It's you that I live for, and for you, I die
So I'll lay here with you 'til the final goodbye
Mmm

[Verse 2]
Hold on me close, close to my lips
Listen intently as I tell you this
Outside, the world wages its wars
I'll rest in peace as long as you know

[Chorus]
Before we turn out the lights and close our eyes
I'll tell you a secret I've held all my life
It's you that I live for, and for you, I die
So I'll lay here with you 'til the final goodbye

[Bridge]
Promise you our love
Will carry on
Until you turn eternal
We belong

[Chorus]
Before we turn out the lights and close our eyes
I'll tell you a secret I've held all my life
It's you that I live for, and for you, I die
So I'll lay here with you 'til the final goodbye
His respectful lips for the last time
And spell out the lyrics to love in the sky
It's you that I live for, and for you, I die
So I'll lay here with you
'Til the final goodbye

[Outro]
Goodbye

Ooh, yeah
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Rihanna]
When you stand so close to me
I'm feeling butterflies
Is this the way that it supposed to be when I look into your eyes?
All you have to do is say my name
Just a stutter, more like butter
Since I met you, boy, my whole worlds changed
I can't hide this or deny this

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Boy, you got me catching feelings
Got me thinking maybe you're the one
I didn't understand the reason
That my heart was beating like a drum
I didn't understand the meaning
Then you opened up my eyes to a crazy little thing called love (Crazy little thing called love)
A crazy little thing called love
Whoa, yeah

[Verse 2: Rihanna]
My best friends tell me "Rihanna, what's got into you?"
I said "LeAndra, I can't explain these feelings I'm going through"
They tell me "Girl, it's not like you to fall this way"
I try my best to wear a disguise, but it's written on my face

[Chorus: Rihanna & J-Status]
Boy, you got me catching feelings
Got me thinking maybe you're the one (Maybe you're the one)
I didn't understand the reason

I didn't understand the meaning
Then you opened up my eyes to a crazy little thing called love
(Crazy little thing called love)
A crazy little thing called love
(A crazy, crazy little thing called love)
Woah, yeah

Hey Rihanna, baby girl, for you mi sing the song, yeah

[Intro]
Hey, ayy, yeah
Yeah, ayy, yeah
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Baby boy, what you done to me?
I saw you smiling suddenly
I can't get you out my mind
I got it bad boy, I can't lie
I want your time and your full attention
I wanna talk to you and not to mention
Good love that you give to me
I think about it constantly
No, I won't apologize for feeling like I do (Ooh-ooh, ooh)
It's just the simple facts of life
I'm crazy over you

[Chorus]
I'm a selfish girl when it comes to you
Every minute of the day, I'm addicted to
What you're giving me
Boy, it's killing me
And when it comes to love, I'm not tryna share you
You might think I'm greedy, but I just don't care
I need you in my world 'cause I'm a selfish girl

[Verse 2]
I understand that you got your crew
But I've got something in mind for you
Make you lose all track of time
Guaranteed to blow your mind
I don't care what anybody got to say
Maybe they never had it quite this way
Let them talk and criticize
They all need to recognize

[Pre-Chorus]
They might say I'm a bit extreme
To need you night and day
But what I feel can't be concealed
There ain't no other way

[Chorus]
I'm a selfish girl when it comes to you (I'm a selfish girl)
Every minute of the day, I'm addicted to
What you're giving me
(What you're giving me boy)
Boy it's killing me
And when it comes to love, I'm not tryna share you
(When it comes to love, I don't share)
You might think I'm greedy, but I just don't care
I need you in my world 'cause I'm a selfish girl

[Bridge]
Boy, you got me trippin'
I didn't know what I was missing
This is crazy (Crazy)
So amazing (So amazing)
I don't mean to be demanding
But I hope you're understanding
I'm not playing, boy (I'm not playing, boy)
I'm just saying, boy

[Pre-Chorus]
They might say I'm a bit extreme
To need you night and day
But what I feel can't be concealed
There ain't no other way

[Chorus]
(I'm a selfish girl) I'm a selfish girl when it comes to you
Every minute of the day (Every day), I'm addicted to
What you're giving me
Boy it's killing me
And when it comes to love, I'm not tryna share you
You might think I'm greedy, but I just don't care
I need you in my world 'cause I'm a selfish girl
(Need you in my world, I'm a selfish girl)

[Outro]
Boy, you got me trippin'
(Boy, you got me trippin')
I didn't know what I was missing (Know what I was missing)
This is crazy (Crazy)
So amazing (So amazing)
I didn't mean to be demanding, but I hope your understanding

[Intro]
Yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
No, mm

[Verse 1]
What's up?
I know we haven't spoken for a while
But I was thinkin' 'bout you
And it kinda made me smile
So many things to say
And I'll put 'em in a letter
Thought it might be easier
The words might come out better
How's your mother? How's your little brother?
Does he still look just like you?
So many things I wanna know the answers to
Wish I could press rewind
And rewrite every line to the story of me and you

[Chorus]
Don't you know I've tried and I've tried to get you out my mind?
But it don't get no better as each day goes by
And I'm lost and confused, I've got nothin' to lose
Hope to hear from you soon
P.S., I'm still not over you, you, you
(Still not over you)
You, yeah, mm

[Verse 2]
Excuse me, I really didn't mean to ramble on
But there's a lot of feelings that remain since you've been gone
I guess you thought that I woulda put it all behind me
But it seems there's always somethin' right there to remind me
Like a silly joke or something on the TV
Boy, it ain't easy
When I hear our song, I get that same old feeling
Wish I could press rewind, turn back the hands of time
And I shouldn't be telling you, you

[Chorus]
Don't you know I've tried and I've tried to get you out my mind?
But it don't get no better as each day goes by
And I'm lost and confused, I've got nothin' to lose
Hope to hear from you soon
P.S., I'm still not over you, you, you
(Still not over you) You, yeah, mm-mm

[Bridge]
Did you know I kept all of your pictures?
Don't have the strength to part with them yet, oh no
Tried to erase the way your kisses taste
But some things, a girl can never forget

[Chorus]
Don't you know I've tried and I've tried to get you out my mind?
But it don't get no better as each day goes by
And I'm lost and confused, I've got nothin' to lose
Hope to hear from you soon
P.S., I'm still not over you, oh
(Still not over you)
Oh, I tried to forget you
Don't you know I've tried and I've tried to get you out my mind?
But it don't get no better (Don't get no better)
As each day goes by (As each day goes by)
And I'm lost and confused, I've got nothin' to lose

[Intro]
Ohh-oh
Ohh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-ooh
Hey, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Some girls play the game
They all walk and talk and they dress the same
Nothing new to say (Nothing new to say)
Don't they realize
It's so easy to see right through their disguise?
Makes me wonder why

[Pre-Chorus]
When the whole world's turning left
Is when I'm going right
I need someone to let me be
Just who I am inside

[Chorus]
'Cause a girl like me is just a little different from all the rest
And a girl like me
Never gonna settle for second best
Could it be a boy like you?
Can give me anything if I asked him to?
Would take all my dreams and to make them true
Show me all the reasons you oughta be, with a girl like me (Girl like me)
Oh-woah-oh, oh-oh (Woah-oh, oh-oh)
Just like me (Just like me)

[Verse 2]
The possibility
Got me trippin', thinkin' of what could be
Between you and me (You and me)
Still, I need to know
Should I keep this feeling or let it go?
I can't wait no more
So now's the time to speak your mind
And show me what you feel
So tell me if you wanna take a chance on something real

[Chorus]
'Cause a girl like me (Girl like me), just a little different from all the rest (Woah-oh, oh-oh)
And a girl like me
Never gonna settle for second best (Never gonna settle)
Could it be a boy like you?
Can give me anything if I asked him to? (If I asked him to?)
To take all my dreams and then make them true
Show me all the reasons you oughta be, with a girl like me
Like me
Oh-woah-oh, oh-oh (Oh-woah-oh, oh-oh)
Just like me (Just like me)

[Bridge]
Mirror, mirror, on the wall
Catch me now before I fall
Wish I may or wish I might
Find the answer here tonight
Mirror, mirror, on the wall (Yeah, yeah)
Catch me now before I fall (Before I fall)
Wish I may or wish I might
Find the answer here tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause when the whole world's turning left
Is when I'm going right
I need someone who'll let me be just who I am inside

[Chorus]
'Cause a girl like me is just a little different from all the rest
And a girl like me
Never gonna settle for second best
Could it be a boy like you? (Could it be a boy like you?)
Can give me anything if I asked him to? (If I asked him to?)
Would take all my dreams and then make them true
Show me all the reasons you oughta be, with a girl like me
Oh-woah-oh, oh-oh (Woah-oh, oh-oh)
Just like me (Just like me)

[Outro]
Mirror, mirror, on the wall (On the wall)
Catch me now before I fall (Oh-woah-oh, oh-oh)
Wish I may or wish I might
Find the answer here tonight
'Cause a girl like me, just a little different from all the rest
And a girl like me (Girl like me), never gonna settle for second best

[Verse 1]
Here we lay, face to face once again
The silence cuts like a knife as we pretend
And I'm wondering who will be the first to say what we both know
We're just holding onto could have been's, that we should be letting go

[Chorus]
It feels like you're a million miles away
As you're lying here with me tonight
And I can't even find the words to say
I can find a way to make it right
And we both know that the story's ending
We play the part, but we're just pretending
And I can hide the tears
'Cause even though you're here
It feels like you're a million miles away
Away, hey, yeah

[Verse 2]
Was it me? Or was it you that broke away?
From what we were
'Cause like the seasons, love is change
And every time I think about it
It tears me up inside
Like the rivers of emotion
But I got no more tears to cry

[Chorus]
It feels like you're a million miles away
As you're lying here with me tonight
And I can't even find the words to say
I can find a way to make it right
We both know that the story's ending
We play the part, but we're just pretending
And I can hide the tears
'Cause even though you're here
It feels like you're a million miles away
Away, hey, hey, hey, yeah

[Bridge]
Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah
Hey, ooh-yeah
We can try to talk it over
But we've walked that road before
While our song is playing its last note
And we both know for sure
That it's time to close that door

[Chorus]
It feels like you're a million miles away
As you're lying here with me tonight
And I can't even find the words to say
I can find a way to make it right
And we both know that the story's ending
We play the part, but we're just pretending
And I can hide the tears
'Cause even though you're here
Feels like you're a million miles away
Hey, yeah
A million miles away

'Cause once you're mine, once you're mine
There's no going back

She's a beast, I call her Karma (Come back)

Shawty's heart is on steroids, 'cause her love is so strong
You may fall in love when you meet her (Meet her)
If you get the chance, you better keep her (Keep her)
She's sweet as pie, but if you break her heart
She turn cold as a freezer (Freezer)
That fairy tale ending with a knight in shining armor
She can be my sleeping beauty, I'm gon' put her in a coma (Woo!)
Damn, I think I love her, shawty's so bad
I'm sprung and I don't care
She ride me like a roller coaster, turn the bedroom into a fair (A fair)
Her love is like a drug, I was tryna hit it and quit it
But lil mama so dope, I messed around and got addicted

[Chorus: Katy Perry]
So you wanna play with magic?
Boy, you should know what you're fallin' for (You should know)
Baby, do you dare to do this?
'Cause I'm coming at you like a dark horse (Like a dark horse)
Are you ready for, ready for (Ready for)
A perfect storm, perfect storm? (A perfect storm)
'Cause once you're mine, once you're mine
There's no going back

[Chorus: Aloe Blacc]
Liar, liar! No you don't ever tell the truth
Liar, liar! Can't nobody say you're fireproof

[Verse 1: Blondfire]
Follow you to dust
Leaving footprints on the clouds as we're walking home
Iron hearts all turn to rust
Buy tears on the days on a diamond street
It speaks apocalypse
Chasing shadows, living dreams that don't exist, anymore
We need to find a way
Find a way
Find a way
Find a way
Find a way

[Pre-Chorus: Blondfire]
Well, we are, who we are, when we're all going under
When the past with the last and will last until we're under

[Chorus: Aloe Blacc]
Liar, liar! No you don't ever tell the truth
Liar, liar! Can't nobody say you're fireproof

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2: Blondfire]
All closed and in your head
Counting heartbeats 'till the feeling's good and gone
On a dull path in a rush
A sad greed pouring rain over everything
It will lead us to apocalypse
Where the whispers and the sand and the sun eclipse, forever more
We need to find a way
Find a way
Find a way
Find a way
Find a way

[Pre-Chorus: Blondfire]
Well, we are, who we are, when we're all going under
When the past with the last and will last until we're under

[Chorus: Aloe Blacc]
Liar, liar! No you don't ever tell the truth
Liar, liar! Can't nobody say you're fireproof

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro: Blondfire]
People talking but I can't hear them, no
I just sit there and watch them come and go
There might be something underneath it all
But at least I'll find the love found down the moon
But at least I'll find, we'll all find out in the end

[Intro]
Ok, number seven!

[Hook: Sterling Fox]
Shame on me for loving you
Can't deny that you've been untrue
You lie so sweet but you love to tease
Putting out fire with your gasoline
Woah! Yeah!

[Verse 1]
I'm baptized and born again
You can go to hell with your fucked-up friends
Crazy little bitch in the first degree
Shame on you for loving me
Yeah! Woah!

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus: Sterling Fox & Audra Mae]
(Oh, my, my!) That's what I get for loving you
(Lie, lie, lie!) You know I can't live without you

(Cry, cry, cry!) 'Cause I'll get my kicks without you

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse: Sterling Fox]
That's what I get for loving you
Oh I can't live without you
That's what I get for loving you
Oh I can't live without you

[Hook 2: Audra Mae]
Shame on me for loving you
But you can't deny that you've been untrue
You lie so sweet but you love to tease
Putting out fire with your gasoline
Uh-dut-dut-dut, dut-up!

[Chorus: Sterling Fox & Audra Mae]
(Oh, my, my!) That's what I get for loving you

And I believed in you and I-
Believed in you and you

Can't lean, can't walk, can't crawl, can't limp

Coming up the hill too swift, I whip one
Blood or crip, give a damn, I hit one
If you don't have a gun then you better go get one
One of them nights when I don't wanna fight
Put your hands on me and I'm ending your life
Sit to my left 'cause you know that ain't right
Call me Tyron 'cause you know that ain't right
I'm the type of nigga that get in a fight by the end of the night

If they rob you once, they'll rob you twice

[Chorus: Jason Mraz & (Travie McCoy)]
Hey yo, never let go of me (Yeah)
Hold tight; it's gonna get hard to breathe (Hold tight, baby)
I will never let you drown (Never)
Even if we're going down
Hey yo, never let go of me (It's Travie)
When I'm sinkin'

[Verse 1: Travie McCoy]
Let's go!
Loose lips sink ships, that's what someone told me
But this boat will stay afloat for as long as you hold me
We been through rough water, anytime it was tougher
But the fact I came back to remind you I love ya
And if that's not enough, well I can one up ya
I pinky promise, touch thumbs, I'll never make you suffer
And all I ask in return is some reciprocation
I'll be your oxygen when you're running out of patience
So take a deep breath, and hold it tight
My heart is yours, just reassure me that you'll hold it right
Don't be offended, I'm just the cautious type
To always be around and hold you down and never under, like

[Chorus: Jason Mraz & (Travie McCoy)]
Hey yo, never let go of me (Ha, never let go)
Hold tight; it's gonna get hard to breathe (Hold tight, baby, hold tight)
And I will never let you drown (Never)
Even if we're going down (Going down)
Hey yo, never let go of me (Yeah, yeah, yeah, let's go)
When I'm sinkin'
Oh-oh-oh-oh (I said oh), oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (I said oh)
Oh-oh-oh-oh (I said oh), oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 2: Travie McCoy]
This is my message in a bottle, I hope that you receive it
If it washes up at your feet then open it and read it
To whom it may concern, insert your name here
It's destiny that we were both born in the same year
Three months apart, but on the same sphere
Staring at the sun, inhaling the same air
This type of love we got, they'll never get it
I'll be the Leo DiCaprio to your Kate Winslet
Sometimes I panic, but I never take it for granted
I'll hold you 'til my lips turn blue like Jack in Titanic
And if I lose my grip, then just promise me this
You'll keep my love in a locket and always rock it, like

[Chorus: Jason Mraz & (Travie McCoy)]
Hey yo, never let go of me (Never let go, never let go)
Hold tight, it's gonna get hard to breathe (Hold tight, mama, hold tight)
And I will never let you drown (Nah)
Even if we're going down (Going down)
Hey yo, never let go of me (Yeah, yeah, yeah, Like)
When I'm sinkin'
Oh-oh-oh-oh (I said oh), oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (I said oh)
Oh-oh-oh-oh (I said oh), oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
(Come on)

[Bridge: Travie McCoy & (Jason Mraz)]
There's times where like... we find it hard to hold on to something
That was never meant to be held onto (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
But you let it go (Oh-oh-oh-oh)

[Chorus: Jason Mraz & (Travie McCoy)]
Hey yo, never let go of me (Never let go, never let go)
Hold tight, it's gonna get hard to breathe (Hold tight, mama, hold tight)

I won't care less bout the money but my soldier
I lost a bomb, I lost the pack, I lost my soldier
She a down bitch, a motherfucking soldier

[Verse 1: Young Thug]

I live life on boats, like I'm sponsored by nautica, nigga
Everything I say's a quote, I just took of them folks
Got a dope bag in my throat, I'm trying my best not to choke
We gonna chase that fucking paper to the ceiling
Zero tolerance for these bitches, they just want chillen
I made a pledge to Migo to take care all my nephews and nieces
Then ran into my Migo then turned to a fucking receiver
I'm receiving, you know I'm cricket like '
I'm a freak, I get the pack, and take all the clothes off they body
I know bitches, that gone come and fuck you and take all your riches
I know math well, me and Gucci spending nothing but digits, get it

Cried a river with all them tears, even aborted a couple kids
After I did that other bid, I thought you would've left me, I was down on my dick
But you were still there to help you, you the chef that kept me fed
You see, I ain't scared to say it, it was nothing, just to play it
So I was shooting for the head and I was moving from them feds
Watching every move and knowing whereabouts
Money I make more, fake hoes don't care about
It's like four niggas try to share a house, it ain't gone work, I make 'em tear it down
Get that eviction notice, grip the 40, might let them niggas have it
Scooter and Gucci, you know we causing havoc

[Hook: Gucci Mane]

Dear diary
33 years old (33)
I'm a couple million up
I'm a single parent
It's Guwop
Very successful
I'm love my little boy
It's just the truth
Cherish my mother

[Hook x2]
And I just want half
But these hoes want half
How the hell you get a bitch half?
I would've cut that bitch in half
Cause I could never give a bitch half

[Verse]
What if I was on my last
You mean she'd get half of my cash
Man that bitch can kiss my ass
It's Guwop, she will never get half
This AK knock a nigga in half
Like a magician I cut a bitch just, half
I came up, me and Juice I had a half
I cut the head down of 50 dollar slabs
Now I'm trappin hard, I'm on Gresham ave
A nigga play me, I'm a cut him in half
Dirty gang, you gon' take a blood bath
It's Gucci Mane, got 3 million in cash
I got a real real big stash
I hate it when I see the task
These bitches man, they love to harass
I mean these bitches love to harass
You's a stalker, You's a stalker, You's a stalker
34 bowls on Herschel Walker
Gucci Mane man, I'm a smooth talker
And I control a bitch like a snake charmer

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2]
Gucci Mane not Tiger Woods, I can't even putt
I can give a mutt, half for me, half a, half a what
Roll my dick, I didn't have shit, had to hit a lick
Broke as shit, couldn't pay the rent, ain't that bout a bitch?
Man Gucci don't got half what Michael got but got a lot
I don't cross over, I cross the country, fuck a jump shot
Don't pun Mr. Backboy, Bessma is a stack boy
You think it's hamburger helper, how Gucci would fuck the extra
Don't wanna give you half, you ain't water whippin', bitch in Bessma
I will not give you half
You didn't put that hater on a stretcher
Man I don't pass no mid to Gucci he gon' break out with a rash
These trashcan bitches, man don't need to make me laugh laugh
Fat ass, ugly ass, go get that paper bag
I'm a player hater, punching bag, he know I got a sack
In my building shoot the say designer, Gucci gotta swag
Gucci can't wear skinny jeans he's walking with a bag
I like all money green but I don't like my hoes to match
I like all money green but I don't like my hoes to match
I sign my check and employ myself, I don't even gotta scratch
I sign my check and employ myself, I don't even gotta scratch
Half

Big Guwop slappin' bread, whopper with cheese
In Belize, still got that big Mac on me
I'm unguardable, you need to put Shaq on me
I need to fumigate, mosquitos love to suck on me
I need some rat traps, too many mice 'round me
A compulsive gambler, don't bring no dice 'round me
I'm a robber, I'll rob your blind, don't take your eyes off me
I'm a kleptomaniac, don't leave yo' bitch round me
I'm the same Gucci Sosa, influenced Chief Keef
With the suit and 20 chains doing a mixtape with Scream
I'm the same Gucci nigga in the hood with the plan
If you niggas want something soft, y'all need to shit on yo' hands
It's Gucci

[Chorus]
I tell it like it is 'cause this the life I live
Gucci Mane, I'm the realest nigga ever lived
Bad bitch in the crib, pints in the fridge
Gucci Mane, I'm the realest nigga ever lived
These rappers wear Fugazzi shit but Gucci diamonds real
Gucci Mane, I'm the realest rapper ever lived
I'm a multimillionaire and yet I kill rob and steal
Gucci Mane, I'm the realest trapper ever lived

[Verse 2]
Gucci Mane, I'm the realest nigga ever lived
In my old school with a digital dummy playin' Aaliyah
I got fans all in Japan but I was born in Birmingham
I'm sellin' Cali kush in Bessemer, Alabama, I'm the man
Dope in Alabama, they was 100 a gram
I cook so many Graham crackers think that I'm a elf
2000 pounds of midgy and I sold that shit myself
I'm on Custer Ave on Moreland, got room this shit hot as hell
My trap house dope going ham, honey baked
VVS white boogers fine for space crammed in my Rollie base
Yo' wife lookin' stupid, got that never-seen-a-Rollie face
Then she seen one but not like the one Gucci wore yesterday

[Chorus]
I tell it like it is 'cause this the life I live
Gucci Mane, I'm the realest nigga ever lived
Bad bitch in the crib, pints in the fridge
Gucci Mane, I'm the realest nigga ever lived
These rappers wear Fugazzi shit but Gucci diamonds real
Gucci Mane, I'm the realest rapper ever lived
I'm a multimillionaire and yet I kill rob and steal
Gucci Mane, I'm the realest trapper ever lived

Getting shots off my yapper, how bad you want a hit?

I'm worth a hunnid bricks, still rob yo ass for 4 bricks
Can't find a fork, I'm cookin dope with the remote, BITCH

I fucked yo mama secretary at the office

(Hook)

Yea, you lookin at the man nigga
Guwop
She ended up being with him, should've been with me

If it was meant to be then it would be so I'mma see
But until then I'mma fall back like a G
I think I need to fall back
I think I need to fall back

Why you say it way back? You can say it up front
I don't think I'm all that, I'm just kinda laid back
22s on the bed, 20 Os in the front
Had them hoes hang hard, tryna make it, think so
Put a rock on you, big, it's like a cruise ship
So don't call me Gucci Mane, so don't call me ...
Ever since people in Beverly Hills sending you gifts
Use your crown, no hate, he don't ware enough, baby
We can rent our crustaceous, take a vacation
Fly to Bora Bora, call you Dora the Explorer
Doors can't give a ball, it's all involved
Haters can't crawl cause they know you're their boss
You done make it who you are, you was born to be a star
Watch your wrist like that, you deserve a new car
Me only copping that but I love you copping that
You started copping that but you acting fine so I think I need to phone back
She ended up being with him, should've been with me
I thought that we were meant to be but I can tell was not to be
If it was meant to be then it would be so I'mma see
But until then I'mma fall back like a G
I think I need to fall back
I think I need to fall back

Bang, bang, titty, I done bang, bang nitty
Most girls are the same, I was saying you was different
All your friends with you, they be like 'bitch, you tripping'
If you wasn't, I be with him, I'm a YM fly nigga
Can't fall in love with a stripper but I just love the way your face fall on my zipper
I ain't no tricker, but love got me tripping
Might have to tip her if she show me titty
Bad to the bone, baby, bad, hop on my lap, cause she want with my cash
She doing too much and I'm moving too fast
Damn, a nigga need to fall, fall back
Fall back? No more chilling, how your day go?
I'mma A ho, O, cause I'm single, no bitch, you play, don't play me
Like a Lego so yeah, I'm gonna let go

She ended up being with him, should've been with me
I thought that we were meant to be but I can tell was not to be
If it was meant to be then it would be so I'mma see
But until then I'mma fall back like a G
I think I need to fall back
I think I need to fall back
I'm in my Bentley, ocean rider, won't you jump off in my lap
You wanna get no Channel, clicking crabs outside
I need to fall back cause she got me all trapped
Try to throw me y'all test, said you met your real love
Make the head go, when she see me panics up
I have her walking out of filth, you got her walking out of church
Don't be quick, that loser chose her, ruler, come and get a chop
Baby, I don't think you want it, boo, but you should see what you count, Gucci

She ended up being with him, should've been with me
I thought that we were meant to be but I can tell was not to be
If it was meant to be then it would be so I'mma see
But until then I'mma fall back like a G
I think I need to fall back

Gas, gas, gas gas gas

Show a little young nigga something, I could show a little young nigga something
Show a little young nigga something, I could show a little young nigga something
I can front an ya'll nigga, got 100 young niggas
That's 100 young niggas getting money
Rather hang with my young niggas, OG's ain't 100

[Verse]
Jackpot, trap spot, crack rock, duece pot
Too hot, 2Pac, rob you with your own Glock
New watch, blue drop with no top, I'm so hot
All my shows sold out, my bitch got her toes out
Ten stripper, seven out of ten got so ass shots
A nigga got her locked, I need to send a bitch a green dot
She feeling like a codeine fiend when the lean out
I'm a lean junkie, pint buyer bring that clean out
I got big old diamond rings, man they look just like wedding rings
Hold another up, you's a runner-up trap king
A bird brain nigga go for anything, anything
Air heads, butterfly, ice cream, ice cream
But you can't throw piss on me, say it's lemonade
And you ain't fooling me, I know that chain fugazy
I'm being honest, you suck on me it's your lucky day
I'm sucka free, don't need no suckas round me anyway
It's Guwop

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2]
My mother sold dope, grandma yay
My favorite uncle Goat and he still smoke yay
I sold my uncle Goat a dub on his check day
I know it's wrong, I pun his ID like the next J
I'm smoking weed, I'm tryna' forget a couple court dates
Gorilla out of jail turned into a cupcake
Put a word out, a nigga get his cake baked
I told my niggas run a G on yo' auntie
Gucci got a lot of G's on me VVV
It's 2013, I'm still so icy
I heard Tip and Jeezy say that they don't like me
Red bottom Gucci nigga do it just like Nike
BUR!

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3]
Everything glitter ain't gold, like Ace Hood's Rolly is
It's not a diss but take my Gucci clothes off and I'm Gucci still
I can't stop hustling still my mom live where Oprah live
I used to drive by and wish I live like Holyfield
And fuck Dr. Phil, is he bringing up the Double Seal
They say I'm bipolar, but my diamonds they sholl is
Your favorite rapper pussy and his shooter's bisexual
If you can't count I'm nearly 100, don't say you on my level bro
They call me trap god, I'm a man of god
I was still a trap god at the Traveler's lodge
At the Golf Knights Inn, or the  Econolodge
I cut my diamonds like jumbo Now & laters, dope so hard

Gave her three bricks of the heron and told her act like you're pregnant
I eat roxys for breakfast
Plug in Cali not Texas
I've got a girl that could tote it
Airport it, she float it
It's way less risk than the postal
She fake it, act like she blowed it
Got a connect on the open
More power than Oprah
I got 500 OG's in the game, task force don't even know it
Man I'm a wiz with the dope
I'm plug with the smoke
I'm tryna' lock down the city then I'mma lock down the coast
And I'm El Chapo with the choppas
Knock the meat out your taco
And I'm in Scooter durango
I got 20 rectangle

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Young Scooter]
Money, walking in my Bally, smoking on a pound of Cali
OG kush that's all I smoke
That blue dream bullshit you can have it
Ran off on my plug from Cali
He was doing too much camping

[?] had to work my magic
Put 448 in every wrapper
Nigga that's what a pound weigh
Swag, bells and bricks of yay
10 inch blunts, we roll em up the long way
Yea, I'm smoking on that California
I got some gutter bitches, most of my bitches foreign
Yea, I wake up count my money every morning
Got a house full of gass but ain't no stoves homie
We got cheap cheap prices, jug house rolling
Racks stacked to the ceiling, banks came for it

[Hook]

[Outro]

[Verse 1]
I left the North, I travelled South
I found a tiny house and I can't help the way I feel
Oh yes, you can kick me, and you can punch me
And you can break my face
But you won't change the way I feel
'Cause I love you

[Chorus]
And is it really so strange?
Oh, is it really so strange?
Oh, is it really so, really so strange?
I say no, you say yes
And you will change your mind

[Verse 2]
I left the South, I travelled North
I got confused, I killed a horse, I can't help the way I feel
Oh yes, you can punch me and you can butt me
And you can break my spine
But you won't change the way I feel
'Cause I love you

[Chorus]
And is it really so strange?
Oh, is it really so strange?
Oh, is it really so, really so strange?
I say no, you say yes
But you will change your mind

[Verse 3]
I left the North again, I travelled South again
And I got confused, I killed a nun, I can't help the way I feel
I can't help the way I feel
I can't help the way I feel
I lost my bag in Newport Pagnell

[Verse 4]
Why is the last mile the hardest mile?
My throat was dry, with the sun in my eyes
And I realised, I realised, I could never
I could never, never, never go back home again

[Verse 1]
Is it wrong to want to live on your own?
No, it's not wrong, but I must know
How can someone so young sing words so sad?

[Chorus]
Sheila take a, Sheila take a bow
Boot the grime of this world in the crotch, dear
And don't go home tonight
Come out and find the one that you love and who loves you
The one that you love and who loves you (oh)

[Verse 2]
Is it wrong not to always be glad?
No, it's not wrong, but I must add
How can someone so young sing words so sad?

[Chorus]
Sheila take a, Sheila take a bow
Boot the grime of this world in the crotch, dear
And don't go home tonight
Come out and find the one that you love and who loves you
The one that you love and who loves you (oh)

[Verse 3]
Take my hand and off we stride
You're a girl and I'm a boy
Take my hand and off we stride
I'm a girl and you're a boy

[Outro]
Sheila take a, Sheila take a bow
Throw your homework onto the fire
Come out and find the one that you love
Come out and find the one you love

[Chorus 1]
He was a sweet and tender hooligan, hooligan
And he said that he'd never, never do it again
And of course he won't (oh, not until the next time)
He was a sweet and tender hooligan, hooligan
And he swore that he'll never, never do it again
And of course he won't (oh, not until the next time)

[Verse 1]
Poor old man
He had an accident with a three-bar fire
But that's OK
Because he wasn't very happy anyway
Poor woman
Strangled in her very own bed as she read
But that's OK
Because she was old and she would have died anyway

[Chorus 2]
Don't blame the sweet and tender hooligan, hooligan
Because he'll never, never, never, never, never, never do it again
Not until the next time

[Verse 2]
Jury, you've heard every word so before you decide
Would you look into those "Mother me" eyes?
I love you for you my love, you my love, you my love, you my love
Jury, you've heard every word but before you decide
Would you look into those "Mother me" eyes?
I love you for you my love, you my love
I love you just for you my love

[Chorus 3]
Don't blame the sweet and tender hooligan, hooligan
Because he'll never, never do it again
And in the midst of life we are in death, etc
Sweet and tender hooligan, hooligan
Because he'll never, never do it again
And in the midst of life we are in death, etc

[Outro]
Etcetera, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera
In the midst of life we are in debt, etc
Etcetera, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera
In the midst of life we are in debt, etc

Just will you free me?
Will you find me?
Will you free me?
Will you find me?
Will you free me, free me, free me, free me, free me, free me, free me?
Jury will you free me?
Will you find me?
Will you free me?
Will you find me?
How will you find me, find me, find me, find me, find me, find me, find me?

Etcetera, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera... Etcetera!
Etcetera, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera
In the midst of life we are in debt, etc
Oh, oh

[Verse 1]
Smoke lingers 'round your fingers
Train - Heave on to Euston
Do you think you've made the right decision this time?

[Verse 2]
You've left your tired family grieving
And you think they're sad because you're leaving
But did you see the jealousy in the eyes of the ones who had to stay behind?
And do you think you've made the right decision this time?

[Verse 3]
You've left your girlfriend on the platform
With this really ragged notion that you'll return
But she knows that "when he goes, he really goes"
And do you think you've made the right decision this time?

[Verse 1]
Call me morbid, call me pale
I've spent six years on your trail
Six long years on your trail
Call me morbid, call me pale
I've spent six years on your trail
Six full years of my life on your trail

[Bridge]
And if you have five seconds to spare
Then I'll tell you the story of my life

[Chorus]
Sixteen, clumsy and shy
I went to London and I
I booked myself in at the Y.W.C.A
I said "I like it here, can I stay?
I like it here, can I stay?
Do you have a vacancy for a back-scrubber?"

[Verse 2]
She was left behind and sour
And she wrote to me equally dour
She said "In the days when you were hopelessly poor
I just liked you more"

[Chorus]
And if you have five seconds to spare
Then I'll tell you the story of my life

[Chorus]
Sixteen, clumsy and shy
I went to London and I
I booked myself in at the Y.W.C.A
I said "I like it here, can I stay?
I like it here, can I stay?
And do you have a vacancy for a back-scrubber?"

[Verse 3]
Call me morbid, call me pale
I've spent too long on your trail
Far too long chasing your tail

[Bridge]
And if you have five seconds to spare
Then I'll tell you the story of my life

[Chorus 2]
Sixteen, clumsy and shy that's the story of my life
Sixteen, clumsy and shy, the story of my life
That's the story of my life
That's the story of my life
That's the story of my life, the story of my life
That's the story of my life
That's the story of my life
That's the story of my life
That's the story of my life
That's the story of my life

[Verse 1]
Girl afraid
Where do his intentions lay?
Or does he even have any?

She says
"He never really looks at me
I give him every opportunity
In the room downstairs he sat and stared
In the room downstairs he sat and stared
I'll never make that mistake again"

[Break]
("I'll never make that mistake again")
("I'll never make that mistake again")

[Verse 2]
Boy afraid
Prudence never pays
And everything she wants costs money
"But she doesn't even like me
And I know because she said so
In the room downstairs she sat and stared
In the room downstairs she sat and stared
I'll never make that mistake again, no"

[Verse 1]
Young bones groan and the rocks below say
"Throw your skinny body down, son"
But I'm going to meet the one I love
So, please don't stand in my way
Because I'm going to meet the one I love
No, Mamma, let me go

[Verse 2]
Young bones groan and the rocks below say
"Throw your white body down"
But I'm going to meet the one I love
At last, at last, at last
I'm going to meet the one I love, la-de-da, la-de-da
No, Mamma, let me go

[Verse 3]
I thought that if you had an acoustic guitar
Then it meant that you were a protest singer
Oh, I can smile about it now but at the time, it was terrible
No, Mamma, let me go
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

[Verse 1]
The rain falls hard on a humdrum town
This town has dragged you down
Oh the rain falls hard on a humdrum town
This town has dragged you down
And everybody's got to live their life
And God knows I've got to live mine
God knows I've got to live mine

[Chorus]
William, William it was really nothing
William, William it was really nothing
It was your life

[Verse 2]
How can you stay with a fat girl who'll say, oh
"Would you like to marry me?
And if you like you can buy the ring"?
She doesn't care about anything
"Would you like to marry me?
And if you like you can buy the ring"
I don't dream about anyone
Except myself

[Chorus]
William, William it was really nothing
William, William

[Verse 1]
If you're wondering why
All the love that you long for eludes you
And people are rude and cruel to you
I'll tell you why
I'll tell you why
I'll tell you why
I'll tell you why

[Chorus 1]
You just haven't earned it yet, baby
You just haven't earned it, son
You just haven't earned it yet, baby
You must suffer and cry for a longer time
You just haven't earned it yet, baby
And I'm telling you now

[Verse 2]
If you're wondering why
When all I wanted from life was to be famous
I have tried for so long, it's all gone wrong
I'll tell you why
I'll tell you why
I'll tell you why
I'll tell you why
But you wouldn't believe me

[Chorus 1]
You just haven't earned it yet, baby
You just haven't earned it, son
You just haven't earned it yet, baby
You must suffer and cry for a longer time
You just haven't earned it yet, Baby
And I'm telling you now

[Verse 3]
I'll tell you why
I'll tell you why
Today I am remembering the time
When they pulled me back and held me down
And looked me in the eyes and said

[Chorus 2]
You just haven't earned it yet, baby
You just haven't earned it, my son
You just haven't earned it yet, baby
You must stay on your own for slightly longer
You just haven't earned it yet, baby
And I'm telling you now

[Outro]
You just haven't earned it yet, baby (oh, oh)
You just haven't earned it yet, baby (oh, oh)

[Chorus]
Golden lights displaying your name
Golden lights it's a terrible shame
But oh, my darling
Why did you change?

[Verse 1]
Boy in a million, idol, a big star
I didn't tell you how great you were
I didn't grovel and scream and rip
Your brand new jacket at the seams
You made a record, they liked your singing
All of a sudden the phone stops ringing
Ah, I never thought that you would let
The glory make you forget

[Chorus]
Golden lights displaying your name
Golden lights it's a terrible shame
But oh, my darling
Why did you change?

[Verse 2]
Top ten idol, king of your age
Who do you turn to when you're backstage?
Don't you remember you once knew a girl
You loved her more than the world
Is life always like this, brother?
Good for one side but bad for another
I must put you behind me tonight
Cause you belong to the lights

[Chorus]
Those golden lights displaying your name
Golden lights it's a terrible shame
But oh, my darling
Why did you change?

[Outro]
Oh, oh, my darling
Why, why did you change?
Oh, whoa, oh

[Verse 1]
Mine eyes have seen the glory of the sacred wunderkind
You took me behind a disused railway line
And said, "I know a place where we can go
Where we are not known"
And then you gave me something that I won't forget too soon

[Pre-Chorus]
But I can't believe that you'd ever care
And this is why you will never care

[Chorus]
But these things take time
And I know that I'm
The most inept that ever stepped

[Verse 2]
I'm spellbound, but a woman divides
And the hills are alive with celibate cries
But you know where you came from
You know where you're going
And you know where you belong
You said I was ill and you were not wrong

[Pre-Chorus]
But I can't believe that you'd ever care
And so you never care

[Chorus]
But these things take time
And I know that I'm
The most inept that ever stepped

[Verse 3]
Oh, the alcoholic afternoons
When we sat in your rooms
They meant more to me than any
Than any living thing on earth
It had more worth
Than any
Living thing on earth, on earth, on earth

[Outro]
Vivid and in your prime
You will leave me behind
You will leave me behind

[Verse 1]
A sad fact widely known
The most impassionate song to a lonely soul
Is so easily outgrown
But don't forget the songs that made you smile
And the songs that made you cry
When you lay in awe on the bedroom floor
And said, "Oh, oh, smother me mother"
Oh, la da dey, la da dey, la da dey, la da dey
Oh na na na, la da dey, la da dey, la da dey
Oh la day, la da da dey di la da da dey di

[Verse 2]
The passing of time and all of its crimes
Is making me sad again
The passing of time and all of its sickening crimes
Is making me sad again
But don't forget the songs that made you cry
And the songs that saved your life
Yes, you're older now and you're a clever swine
But they were the only ones who ever stood by you

[Verse 3]
The passing of time leaves empty lives waiting to be filled
The passing of time leaves empty lives waiting to be filled
I'm here with the cause, I'm holding the torch
In the corner of your room (can you hear me?)
And when you're dancing and laughing and finally living
Hear my voice in your head and think of me kindly
Oh, la da dey, la da dey, la da dey, la da dey
Oh na na na, la da dey, la da dey, la da dey
Oh la day, la da da dey di, la da da dey di

[Outro]
Do you love me like you used to?
Oh, la da dey, la da dey, la da dey, la da dey
Oh na na na, la da dey, la da dey, la da dey
Oh la day, la da da dey di, la da da dey di

(You're clever)
(Everybody's clever nowadays)
(You're clever)
(Everybody's clever nowadays)

(You are sleeping - you do not want to believe)
(You are sleeping - you do not want to believe)
(You are sleeping - you do not want to believe)
(You are sleeping)

[Verse 1]
All the lies that you make up
What's at the back of your mind?
Oh, your face I can see and it's desperately kind
But what's at the back of your mind?
Two icy-cold hands conducting the way
It's the Eskimo blood in my veins
Amid concrete and clay and general decay
Nature must still find a way
So, ignore all the codes of the day
Let your juvenile impulses sway
This way and that way, this way, that way
God, how sex implores you
To let yourself lose yourself

[Chorus 1]
Stretch out and wait, stretch out and wait
Let your puny body lie down, lie down
As we lie, you say
As we lie, you say
Stretch out
Stretch out and wait, stretch out and wait
Let your puny body lie down, lie down

[Verse 2]
As we lie, you say
Will the world end in the night time?
I really don't know
Or will the world end in the day time?
I really don't know
And is there any point ever having children?
Oh, I don't know
All I do know is we're here and it's now

[Chorus 2]
So, stretch out and wait, stretch out and wait
There is no debate, no debate, no debate
How can you consciously contemplate
When there's no debate, no debate?
Stretch out and wait
Stretch out and wait
Stretch out and wait
Wait
Wait
Wait
Wait, oh

[Verse 1]
I know I'm unloveable
You don't have to tell me
I don't have much in my life but take it - it's yours
I don't have much in my life but take it - it's yours

[Verse 2]
I know I'm unloveable
You don't have to tell me
Message received loud and clear, loud and clear
I don't have much in my life but take it - it's yours

[Verse 3]
I know I'm unloveable
You don't have to tell me
For message received loud and clear, loud and clear
Message received
I don't have much in my life but take it - it's yours

[Verse 4]
I wear black on the outside cause black is how I feel on the inside
I wear black on the outside cause black is how I feel on the inside
And if I seem a little strange, well, that's because I am
And if I seem a little strange, well, that's because I am
But I know that you would like me if only you could see me, if only you could meet me
I don't have much in my life but take it - it's yours
I don't have much in my life but take it - it's yours
All the streets are crammed with things
Eager to be held
I know what hands are for
And I'd like to help myself
You ask me the time
But I sense something more
And I would like to give you
What I think you're asking for
You handsome devil
You handsome devil

Let me get my hands
On your mammary glands
And let me get your head
On the conjugal bed
I say, I say, I say

I crack the whip
And you skip
But you deserve it
You deserve it, deserve it, deserve it
A boy in the bush
Is worth two in the hand
I think I can help you get through your exams
Oh you handsome devil

Let me get my hands
On your mammary glands
And let me get your head
On the conjugal bed
I say, I say, I say

I crack the whip
And you skip
But you deserve it
You deserve it, deserve it, deserve it

And when we're in your scholarly room
Who will swallow whom?
And when we're in your scholarly room
Who will swallow whom?
You handsome devil

Let me get my hands
On your mammary glands
And let me get your head
On the conjugal bed
I say, I say, I say
There's more to life than books you know
But not much more
There's more to life than books you know
But not much more
Not much more
Oh you handsome devil
Oh you handsome devil

[Verse 1]
Every day you must say
So how do I feel about my life
Anything is hard to find
When you will not open your eyes
When will you accept yourself?

[Verse 2]
I am sick and I am dull
And I am plain
How dearly I'd love to get carried away
Oh, but dreams have a knack of just not coming true
And time is against me now

[Chorus 1]
Who and what to blame?
Anything is hard to find
When you will not open your eyes
When will you accept yourself?
For heaven's sake
Anything is hard to find
When you will not open your eyes
Every day you must say
How do I feel about the past

[Verse 3]
Others conquered love, but I ran
I sat in my room and I drew up a plan
Oh, but plans can fall through, as so often they do
And time is against me now

[Chorus 2]
And there's no one left to blame
Tell me when will you
When will you accept your life
The one that you hate
For anything is hard to find
When you will not open your eyes
Every day you must say
How do I feel about my shoes

[Verse 4]
They make me awkward and plain
How dearly I would love to kick with the fray
But I once had a dream and it never came true
And time is against me now
Time is against me now

[Chorus 3]
And there's no one but yourself to blame
Anything is hard to find
When you will not open your eyes
Anything is hard to find
For heaven's sake
Anything is hard to find
When you will not open your eyes
When will you accept yourself?
When?

[Verse]
Yeah! Our story goes
He went down to the crossroads
He sat down and kept his eyes closed
Well, everyone has a price, child
And what it cost him
Was his soul

[Chorus]
You think you're getting away
No escape from the deal you made
You walked right into his plan
Run as fast as you think you can
Back from wherever you came
Call the devil by any name
Oh no! Now, who you do blame?
Should have listened to what I'd said
What I'd said, what I'd said, yeah!

[Hook]
I don't know if I'll be coming home again, home again
No, I don't know if I'll be coming home
It's a long road to hell without no soul

[Chorus Variation]
Just when you think you're getting away
No escape from the deal you made
You walked right into his plan
Run as fast as you think you can
Back from wherever you came
Call the devil by any name
Oh no! Now, who you do blame?
Should have listened to what I'd said
What I'd said, what I'd said, yeah!
Let me tell you it's a hard road to hell without no soul

[Chorus]
Every time that you get undressed
I hear symphonies in my head
I wrote this song just looking at you oh, oh
Yeah, the drums they swing low

Haha, yeah, is it weird that I hear

Uh, oh, yeah, is it weird that your eyes
Remind me of a Coldplay song? (A Coldplay song)
Is it weird that I hear
Trumpets when you’re turning me on?
Is it weird that your bra (that your bra)

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Gucci Mane I’m fucking nervous
This shit done turned me to another person
My momma told me I was fucking worthless
Cause’ I was servin’ servin’ servin’ servin’
But I can’t flip no motherfuckin’ burgers
I got this strap I’ll motherfuckin’ murder
My nigga scooter that’s my main dog
That nigga Flocka will never fall off
Now Bricksquad is more than just me
I make a million dollars in my damn sleep
I thank the lord for all the game he gave me
I’m sipping vodka mixed with cranberry and

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
A gangster’s life is up and down
One day you up next minute you down
My nigga you gotta stay down, down
You know that brick fare is up and down
One minute its 40 one minute its 20 one minute it’s not around
You know it’s up and down
One minute I’m out one minute I’m in but nigga I gotta stay out
Im stayin down
You know them up and downs
Cause’ when you up they frown and when you down they smile

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
Nigga don’t wanna see another nigga
With a stack like a five hunda
Me and my nigga got old schools
Old schools and them fuckers running
Pulling up to the racetrack
Nigga you know I got 3 hundred thousand dollars and I’ll do that
Cause’ y’all niggas ain’t really got no money
Nigga ain’t never seen half wet
The shit I done seen or the shit I did
Gucci mane I been ballin’
But to tell the truth I was a broke kid
Ain’t never had no Pro-Keds
Always stayed dead fresh
8th grade I was best dressed
Boulder crest screaming bolder crest
I wasn’t even no dope man, Still I had on cortez
My brother turned me to a weed man
But he still showed me how to handle business
Im wrestling with this oil based
I’m re rocking like he man
Bought 2 bricks he said “what it do”
I said cook this shit we gon’ see man

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
A gangster’s life is up and down

[Verse 1]
In a river the color of lead
Immerse the baby's head
Wrap her up in the News Of The World
Dump her on a doorstep, girl
This night has opened my eyes
And I will never sleep again
You kicked and cried like a bullied child
A grown man of twenty-five
Oh, he said he'd cure your ills
But he didn't and he never will

[Chorus 1]
Oh, save your life
Because you've only got one
The dream has gone
But the baby is real
Oh, you did a good thing
She could have been a poet
Or, she could have been a fool
Oh, you did a bad thing
And I'm not happy
And I'm not sad

[Verse 2]
A shoeless child on a swing
Reminds you of your own again
She took away your troubles
Oh, but then again
She left pain

[Chorus 2]
Oh, please save your life
Because you've only got one
The dream has gone
But the baby is real
Oh, you did a good thing
She could have been a poet
Or, she could have been a fool
Oh, you did a bad thing
And I'm not happy
And I'm not sad

[Outro]
Oh oh
Oh
Oh la la
And I'm not happy
And I'm not sad
Oh oh
Oh
Oh la la
And I'm not happy
And I'm not sad

[Verse 1: Justin Timberlake]
Baby, every day in training to get the gold
That’s why your body's crazy
But you can’t run from yourself, that’s where it’s difficult
Girl, I can see in your eyes that there’s something inside that made you evil
Where did you go? 'Cause it just ain't fair
Over here thinking 'bout the shit you say
Don't know why it gets to me

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
It cuts right on my heart, yeah, it hurt, won't lie
Still can't see, think I saw you with another guy
Fair fight, knocked down, then I got over you
Can't fight no more, you knock me out
What am I supposed to do?

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
I don't understand it
Tell me how could you be so low?
Been swinging after the bell and after all of the whistle blows
Tried to go below the belt, through my chest, perfect hit to the dome

Baby, now I really know what we're fighting for
This rematch sex is amazing
But nobody wins when if somebody’s heart is swole
'Cause when I see you move like you got something inside that made you lethal
Where did you go? It just ain't fair
Over here thinking 'bout the shit you do
Don't know what I got to lose

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
It cuts right on my heart, yeah, it hurt, won't lie
Still can't see, think I saw you with another guy
Fair fight, knocked down, then I got over you
Can't fight no more, you knock me out

[Kanye West]
And I swear she a riot folks
How she order all that food and a motherfucking Diet Coke?
He said "You lying yo, why is you lying Joe?
Cut it out, quit it G, you hurting my kid-i-neys."
Naw, she talking bout a couple of kids for me
She's hinting at a ring from Tiffany's
Right then and there I had an epiphany
I swear since that day I've been treating fat girls differently
She told me if you read music you a genius
I don't play but I'll introduce you to my pianist
She said you need a little ice just to keep me cool
No dimes but baby here go the family jewels
I'm tight with my doe like my family Jews
Uh! I said "Jews" my career is screwed
I ain't mean in the Hanukkah sense of the word
I realize it's a sensitive word
Plus a lot of best friends is white
I mean ah, I mean my Air 1's, my diamonds and my Benz is white
And I ain't one of them producers that pretend to write
Ayo, Teefa, uh why don't you come on grab the mic

[Teefa]
Yo yo
I know you use to being a womanizer
Coming at me and girls talking 'bout a men-a-
You're some fool
Thinking I'm gon' strip like Moulin Rouge
While you biting off my garter
I'm not easy you gotta come harder
I want a man, not just a baby father
Teefa no 

[?] no appetizer
Haha
Why you kick it with your guys fo'?
You got eyes for girls, just spread it out
You done pissed Teefa off like draining my bladder out
Haha

[Interlude]

[Kanye]: Aw, you crazy

[Teefa]: You got me up in here tripping

[Kanye]: Nah, but look, I said, I said look

[Kanye]
Ayo my Rocafella chain hurt the game very bad
My girl rocking the little lamb that Mary had
A little bit of Ghost’s style mixed with Mos's style
I'm versatile I'm the poster child
Getting cheese so I'm suppose to smile, get it
We making hits like Sosa now, hit it
And I hate when girls acting bougie as hell
And I already seen them naked like Blu Cantrell
Aw, forget it, forget it

[Verse 1]
Take me from the city, let's go for a drive
Take me, Take me anywhere, just make me feel alive
Make me feel this fire, higher than the sun
Things could be so easy but we're always on the run

[Chorus]
Always on the run, always on the run
Things could be so easy but we're always on the run
Always on the run, always on the run
Things could be so easy but we're always on the run

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh! Oh-oh-oh!
On the run, on the run, run, run, run
Oh-oh! Oh-oh-oh!
Things could be so easy but we're always on the run

[Verse 2]
We could save our money, we could buy a house
Hit back on our patio, watching fireflies
We could feel this fire, higher than the sun
Things could be so easy but we're always on the run

[Chorus]
Always on the run, always on the run
Things could be so easy but we're always on the run
Always on the run, always on the run
Things could be so easy but we're always on the run

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh! Oh-oh-oh!
On the run, on the run, run, run, run
Oh-oh! Oh-oh-oh!
Things could be so easy but we're always on the run

[Verse 1]
I was low, didn't believe in getting higher
Didn't know, how easy it is to walk through the fire

[Hook]
Oh-oh-oh-oh! You
Opened the stars in my heart
You let in the light from the dark
It's like the first time I realized that all you need is love

[Chorus]
And I'm feeling, never letting go
Oh, you take me, somewhere off the globe
Do you feel it? It's like the first time
I realized that all you need is love

Yeah, I'm feeling, never letting go
Oh you take me, somewhere off the globe
Do you feel it? It's like the first time
I realized that all you need is love

[Verse 2]
I was saved, cause nothing's too free for my heart's content
All the way, yeah, up to the edge and I'm fine jumping

[Hook Variation]
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh! Cause you
Opened the stars in my heart
You let in the light from the dark
It's like the first time I realized that all you need is love

[Chorus]
And I'm feeling, never letting go
Oh, you take me, somewhere off the globe
Do you feel it? It's like the first time
I realized that all you need is love

[Intro]
Watch out!

[Verse 1]
I see you on the street, and you walk on by
You make me wanna hang my head down and cry
If you gave me half a chance
You'd see my desire burning inside of me
But you choose to look the other way

[Pre-Chorus]
I've had to work much harder than this
For something I want
Don't try to resist me

[Chorus]
Open your heart to me, baby
I hold the lock and you hold the key
Open your heart to me, darling
I'll give you love if you, you turn the key

[Verse 2]
I think that you're afraid to look in my eyes
You look a little sad, boy, I wonder why
I follow you around, but you can't see
You're too wrapped up in yourself to notice
So you choose to look the other way
Well, I've got something to say

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't try to run, I can keep up with you
Nothing can stop me from trying
You've got to

[Chorus]
Open your heart to me, baby
I hold the lock and you hold the key
Open your heart to me, darling
I'll give you love if you, you turn the key

[Post-Chorus]
Open your heart with the key
One is such a lonely number

[Bridge]
(Ah, ah, ah, ah)
Open your heart, I'll make you love me
It's not that hard, if you just turn the key

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't try to run, I can keep up with you
Nothing can stop me from trying
You've got to

[Chorus]
Open your heart to me, baby
I hold the lock and you hold the key
Open your heart to me, darling
I'll give you love if you, you turn the key

[Post-Chorus]
Open your heart with the key
One is such a lonely number

[Bridge]
(Ah, ah, ah, ah)
Open your heart, I'll make you love me
It's not that hard, if you just turn the key

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't try to run, I can keep up with you
Nothing can stop me from trying
You've got to

[Chorus]
Open your heart to me, baby
I hold the lock and you hold the key
Open your heart to me, darling
I'll give you love if you, you turn the key

[Post-Chorus]
Open your heart with the key

[Outro]
Open your heart, I'll make you love me  (Come on, baby)
It's not that hard, if you just turn the key (I'm gonna get to you)
Open your heart, I'll make you love me (Ow, come on, baby)
It's not that hard, if you just turn the key
(Watch out, watch out, watch out)
Open your heart, I'll make you love me (Ow, come on, baby)
It's not that hard, if you just turn the key
(Watch out, watch out, watch out)
Open your heart, I'll make you love me (I'm gonna get to you)
It's not that hard, if you just turn the key (Mmm, come on, baby)

[Verse 1]
Papa, I know you're going to be upset
'Cause I was always your little girl
But you should know by now
I'm not a baby
You always taught me right from wrong
I need your help, daddy, please be strong
I may be young at heart
But I know what I'm saying

[Pre-Chorus]
The one you warned me all about
The one you said I could do without
We're in an awful mess
And I don't mean maybe, please

[Chorus]
Papa, don't preach, I'm in trouble, deep
Papa, don't preach, I've been losing sleep
But I made up my mind, I'm
Keeping my baby, ooh
I'm gonna keep my baby, mm

[Verse 2]
He says that he's going to marry me
And we can raise a little family
Maybe we'll be all right
It's a sacrifice

[Pre-Chorus]
But my friends keep telling me to give it up
Saying I'm too young, I ought to live it up
What I need right now
Is some good advice, please

[Chorus]
Papa, don't preach, I'm in trouble, deep
Papa, don't preach, I've been losing sleep
But I made up my mind, I'm
Keeping my baby, ooh
I'm gonna keep my baby, ooh, ooh

[Bridge]
Daddy, daddy if you could only see
Just how good he's been treating me
You'd give us your blessing right now
'Cause we are in love
We are in love (In love), so, please (So)

[Chorus]
Papa, don't preach, I'm in trouble, deep
Papa, don't preach, I've been losing sleep
But I made up my mind, I'm
Keeping my baby, ooh
I'm gonna keep my baby, ooh, ooh

[Outro]
Papa, don't preach, I'm in trouble, deep
Papa, don't preach, I've been losing sleep
Papa, don't preach, I'm in trouble, deep
Papa, don't preach, I've been losing sleep
Papa, don't preach (Oh, I'm gonna keep my baby)
Papa, don't preach (Ooh)
Papa, don't preach (Don't you stop loving me, daddy)
Papa, don't preach (I know I'm keeping my baby)

[Verse 1]

Became my salvation, salvation
Through the war, yeah
You got me wide open, wide open
Now I'm sure

[Chorus: All & AJ]
In a world like this where some back down

[Verse 1: Nick]
Out in the rain, looking for sunshine
I call your name, but you're like a ghost
I let you disappear
Should've never let you go, oh-oh-oh!
I want to say that just for the record
That you still got my heart and my soul
And though we're worlds apart
Yeah, I gotta let you know, oh-oh-oh!

[Pre-Chorus: Howie]
You are the piece I can't replace
You left a mark that won't erase, oh-oh

[Chorus: All]
No one else can teach me how to love again
'Cause you left a permanent stain on my heart
And I've been feeling it
Never mind what people say, 'cause they don't understand
How you left a permanent stain on my heart
You're never leaving it

[Verse 2: AJ]
Some tried to break through the walls that
I built up, but they don't compare to you
One chance, I swear
I'll never let you go, oh-oh-oh!

[Intro: Brian]
We're not over

[Verse 1: Kevin]
The roses you left me
Slowly fading to grey
You're coat on the chair
And the scent of your hair I miss
The clock on the wall
It reminds me of all the better times
When we walked in the park
And we whispered in the dark
And we laughed and cried

[Pre-Chorus: Kevin]
And I never knew alone
Wherever you are is home

[Chorus: All]
Without your lips on mine
No the sun doesn't shine
And no I can't breathe
I can't breathe
Your words are a symphony
Music that sings to me
No I can't breathe
I can't breathe
I can't breathe

[Verse 2: AJ]
Oh, I walked by the store
Where we sat on the floor
And we ate like kings
And someone said hey
We're locking the door
No time to play

[Pre-Chorus: AJ]
And I never knew alone
Wherever you are is home

[Chorus: All]
Without your lips on mine
No the sun doesn't shine
And no I can't breathe
I can't breathe
Your words are a symphony
Music that sings to me
No I can't breathe
I can't breathe
I can't breathe

[Interlude: Brian]
We're not over
We're not over

[Bridge: Brian]
Without your lips on mine
No the sun doesn't shine
And no I can't...
You know I can't breathe yeah!

[Chorus: All & Brian]
Without your lips on mine
No the sun doesn't shine
(You know I can't breathe yeah)
And no I can't breathe
I can't breathe
Your words are a symphony
Music that sings to me
No I can't breathe
I can't breathe
(We're not, we're not over)
I can't breathe
I can't breathe
(Oh you are, you are my life)
I can't breathe
(Don't say it's over, don't say it's over, yeah!)

[Outro: Brian]
Oh-oh, we're not over...

One, two, three, four

[Verse 1: Nick]
Madeleine
What's up with those tears in your eyes?
What happened when you shut down
And all the amber lights turn into red?
In the silence of your cave
You feel safe, you decorate it with velvet drapes
Outside you see the dark woods
But you don't know there's fields of gold ahead

[Pre-Chorus: Nick]
Hold on, don't let go
Hold on, you'll know
That help is on its way

[Chorus: Nick]
Rise up, rise up, rise up Madeleine
The sun will come out again
Rise up, rise up, rise up Madeleine
The summer will come and
Kiss you with honesty
Love you unconditionally
Trust you and let you breathe
Give you back your dignity
So rise up, rise up, rise and live again
As only you can Madeleine
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, Madeleine

[Verse 2: AJ with Brian]
'Member when
You used to sit and watch from the bridge
And wonder where the ships would go
Who was on and what they would find out?
(Oooh-oooh)
You wrote it in a notebook
And said someday that this would be a story to tell
And you put it in a movie
Maybe be the movie star
Something stole your tears and wiped your smile away
Hey-hey

[Pre-Chorus: AJ with Brian]
Hold on, don't let go
Hold on, and you'll know
Help is on its way

[Chorus: All, AJ with Brian, AJ]
Rise up, rise up, rise up Madeleine
The sun will come out again
Rise up, rise up, rise up Madeleine
The summer will come and kiss you with honesty
Love you unconditionally
Trust you and let you breathe
Give you back your dignity
So rise up, rise up, rise and live again
As only you can Madeleine
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh

[Bridge: Howie with Kevin & Brian]
Let the sunshine warm your heart today

[Interlude: AJ]
So rise up, rise up, rise up Madeleine
Oh-oh-oh-oh!

[Chorus: All, Nick with Brian, Nick]
Rise up, rise up, rise up Madeleine
The sun will come out again
Rise up, rise up, rise up Madeleine
The summer will come and kiss you with honesty
Love you unconditionally
Trust you and let you breathe
Give you back your dignity
So rise up, rise up, rise and live again
As only you can Madeleine
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, Madeleine
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, Madeleine

[Gucci Mane: Tweets the Negative Effects of Lean]

Woke up the other day out this hospital bed & I'm so embarrassed & ashamed of my behavior that was brought to my attention.

I just wanna man up right now & take this time to apologize to my family, friends, the industry & most of all my fans. I'm SORRY!

I've been drinking lean for 10+ years & I must admit it has destroyed me. I wanna be the first rapper to admit, I'm addicted to lean & that shit ain't no joke. I can barely remember all the things I've done & said. However there's no excuse.

I'm currently incarcerated but I will be going to rehab because I need help. I wanna thank everyone that has stood by me during this difficult time. Please keep me in your prayers. #GUWOP

I wanna personally apologize to Birdman, Ross & Drake. Dem my niggas. I 100% regret my words & actions .

Keyshia Dior Kaoir I'm sorry. Please forgive me.
All dem fake guwop twitter pages y'all niggas can fall back now.
And in the death
As the last few corpses lay rotting on the slimy thoroughfare
The shutters lifted an inch in temperance building, high on Poacher's Hill
And red mutant eyes gazed down on Hunger City
No more big wheels
Fleas the size of rats sucked on rats the size of cats
And ten thousand peoploids split into small tribes
Coveting the highest of the sterile skyscrapers
Like packs of dogs assaulting the glass fronts of Love-Me Avenue
Ripping and rewrapping mink and shiny silver fox, now legwarmers
Family badge of sapphire and cracked emerald
Any day now, the year of the Diamond Dogs
"This ain't rock and roll! This is genocide!"

[Verse 1: AJ]
I've seen it all a thousand times
Falling down, I'm still alive
Am I? Am I?
So hard to breathe when the water's high
No need to swim, I'll learn to fly
So high, so high

[Pre-Chorus: AJ]
You find the truth in a child's eyes
When the only limit is the sky
Living proof, I see myself in you

[Chorus: All]
When walls start to close in
Your heart is frozen over
Just show 'em what you're made of
When sunlight is fading
The world will be waiting for ya
Just show 'em what you're made of

[Verse 2: Kevin]
Gloves are off, ready to fight
Like a lion, I will survive
Will I? Will I?
Gotta stand for something
Even if you stand alone
Don't be afraid, it's gonna be alright

[Pre-Chorus: Nick & AJ]
You find the truth in a child's eyes
When the only limit is the sky
Living proof, I see myself in you (whoa-oh!)

[Chorus: All]
When walls start to close in
Your heart is frozen over
Just show 'em what you're made of
When sunlight is fading
The world will be waiting for ya
Just show 'em what you're made of

[Interlude: All]
Oooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Oooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Oooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Just show 'em what you're made of
Oooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Oooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Oooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Just show 'em what you're made of

[Bridge: Howie]
You find the truth in a child's eyes
When the only limit is the sky
Living proof, I see myself in you

[Chorus: All & Brian]
When walls start to close in
Your heart is frozen over
Just show 'em what you're made of
(You can show 'em what you're made of)
When sunlight is fading (oh-oh-oh)
The world will be waiting for ya
(For you, for you)
Just show 'em what you're made of
(You can show 'em what you're made of)

[Outro: All]
Oooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Oooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Oooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

Oooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Just show 'em what you're made of

[Intro: AJ]
We can only make believe
We can only make believe

[Verse 1: Howie]
Something that you said
Got into my head
Here I am falling from the edge
Waiting for the day
I can run away with you, with you

[Pre-Chorus: Nick]
Like angels on fire we burn the sky
One kiss and we'd say goodbye

[Chorus: All]
If we can only make believe
You and me, together
We can be a king and queen
Rule another world forever
We'd set our course to live or die
Across the universe I'd be by your side
If we could only make believe

[Reprise: AJ]
We can only make believe
We can only make believe

[Verse 2: Brian]
Catch another breath
I got nothing left
This love I have is pulling me to death
Waiting for the night
I can feel alive in you, ooh-ooh

[Pre-Chorus: Nick]
Like angels on fire we burn the sky
One kiss and we'd say goodbye

[Chorus: All]
If we can only make believe
You and me, together
We can be a king and queen
Rule another world forever
We'd set our course to live or die
Across the universe I'd be by your side
If we could only make believe

[Bridge: Nick & AJ]
If we close our eyes
Let our hearts collide
Leave the world outside
Leave it all behind
If we close our eyes
Let our hearts collide
Leave the world outside
Leave it all behind
Leave the world outside
Leave it all behind...

[Chorus: All & AJ]
If we can only make believe
You and me, together
We can be a king and queen
Rule another world forever
We'd set our course to live or die
Across the universe I'd be by your side
If we could only make believe

[Outro: Nick & All]
(If we could only make believe)
If we close our eyes
Let our hearts collide
(If we could only make believe)
Leave the world outside
Leave it all behind
(If we could only make believe)
If we close our eyes
Let our hearts collide
(If we could only make believe)
Leave the world outside
Leave it all behind

[Verse 1: AJ]
I know that you're hurting now
Seems like there's just no way out
Feels like it's all gone wrong
You keep on slipping till you can't hold on
Don't worry, I'm right by your side
My shoulder's yours if you need to cry
There are times when life is just too much
I know you want to, but don't give up

[Chorus: AJ & All]
Try, baby, try
Give me a moment of your time
No, no, don't close your eyes
I know you're hurting now
We can work it out
If we just try, if we just try

[Verse 2: AJ]
Oh, yeah, no, no
It's always been just me and you
You know I've been down there too
Always when I needed you
You were strong, let me hold you, baby
When hope is gone

[Chorus: AJ & AJ]
Try, baby try
Give me a moment of your time
No, no, don't, don't, don't close your eyes
I know you're hurting now
We can work it out, if we just try, try

[Bridge: All & AJ]
Holding on, holding on
We used to know how to
Oh, oh, oh if the nights are so long
Sing my favorite song, if we just...

[Chorus: AJ & All]
Try, baby try
Give me a moment of your time
No, no, don't, don't, don't close your eyes
I know you're hurting now
We can work it out, if we just try, we can try

[Verse 1: Howie & Brian]
Let me tell you about this girl I know
First glance and damn she stole my heart
She amazes me
The way she moves, just the way she moves
Hold me back, just the way she moves
Take me to the disco
Make me dance
Oh honey spinning 'round like a queen
And the way you do your thing
Oh your mesmerizing me
I'mma tell you how I feel and the feeling is so real
Baby it's just so simple

[Chorus: AJ & All]
You've got to call me
And I'mma call you back
Kiss me

You’ve got to trust me, trust me
Hold me
Whenever you’re alone
Baby
Even when your crazy
Love me
Baby I'mma love you back
You’ve got to trust me

[Verse 2: AJ & Kevin]
Our love, you and me
Underneath the willow tree
Kissing, loving, making sweet sexy babies
The grass is greener on the other side
There's no other side when it's you and I
Tonight let's count the stars
Oh-oh, time will always be our enemy
For tonight baby
Come lie here next to me
I can never get enough of your blue eyes
Just another butterfly, sigh

[Chorus: AJ & All]
You've got to call me
And I'mma call you back
Kiss me
And I'mma kiss you back
Love me
And baby I'mma love you back
You’ve got to trust me, trust me
Hold me
Whenever you’re alone
Baby
Even when your crazy
Love me
Baby I'mma love you back
You’ve got to trust me

[Bridge: Nick]
Mmmmh!
Let's believe that we'll find out
How it feels when something so right
Don't you think it's time
To let your guard down?
Don't you think it's time?
Don't you think it's time?

[Chorus: All & AJ]
You’ve got to call me
And I'mma call you back
Kiss me
I'mma kiss you back
Love me
And baby I'mma love you back
You’ve got to trust me, trust me (hey!)
Hold me
Whenever you’re alone

You’ve got to trust me (trust me)

[Intro: Howie]
Love...

[Verse 1: Nick]
Is it too much to ask for
One minute to breathe?
'Cause you take my breath away
Like I'd never sink

[Pre-Chorus 1: Brian, Howie & Nick]
You're the reason
Why cavemen drew on the walls
The reason why
After every summer we fall
You're the reason
I never wanna sleep at night
'Cause nothing I could dream
Is better than you by my side
You know that I...

[Chorus: All & Nick]
Oooh-oooh
Love somebody, love somebody
You know that I
Oooh-oooh
Love somebody, love somebody
You know that I
I'm so in love, I could die right now
And be fine, I need you tonight
You-you-you know that I
Oooh-oooh
Love somebody, love somebody
You-you-you know that I

[Interlude: Nick]
Love somebody, love somebody

[Verse 2: Kevin & Nick]
When you wake up with no make up
You try hiding your face
(You-you-you know that I)
And it's so cute, you don't even know
How beautiful you are to me

[Pre-Chorus 2: Brian, Howie & AJ]
You're the reason
Why cavemen drew on the walls
The reason why
After every summer we fall
And the way that you look
In those purple jeans
It's still the sexiest thing
That I've ever seen
You know that I...

[Chorus: All & Nick]
Oooh-oooh
Love somebody, love somebody
You know that I
Oooh-oooh
Love somebody, love somebody
You know that I
I'm so in love, I could die right now
And be fine, I need you tonight
You-you-you know that I
Oooh-oooh (oh yeah)
Love somebody, love somebody
You-you-you know that I

[Bridge: AJ, Howie & Nick]
When the game's on
You wear the jersey of my favorite team
(Oooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh)
I yell at the TV, knock over your beer (love)
You're not even mad at me
You know I love you, baby

[Chorus: All, Nick & Howie]
(Love!) Oooh-oooh
Love somebody (love somebody)
Love somebody (I know that)
Oooh-oooh (baby, I'm so in love)
Love somebody, love somebody
You know that I
I'm so in love, I could die right now
And be fine, I need you tonight
You-you-you know that I
Oooh-oooh (I know)
Love somebody, love somebody
You-you-you know that I

[Outro: Nick]
I'm gonna love you, gonna love you
Gonna love you, girl
I'm gonna love you, gonna love you
Gonna love you, girl
I'm gonna love you, gonna love you
Gonna love you, girl
Love somebody, love somebody

[Verse 1: Brian]
Hard to believe it's almost a year
Since I got to hold your head on my shoulder
Dodging the daylight
Taking the blame like it's all I got left
So lately I've spent...

[Pre-Chorus: AJ]
Every single night like it's 25 to life
And this sentence I've been living
It's alone and unforgiving
I'm guilty as charged
'Cause I went and broke your heart
But even I got rights
You're always gonna be my...

[Chorus: All]
One, always be my one phone call
All I want, all I need is one phone call
I'm gonna leave my message at the tone
Begging, pretty baby please come home
'Cause you're my one
Always be my one phone call (ooh-ooh-ooh)

[Verse 2: Kevin with Brian]
First time it rings
I can't help but think of the first time I saw you
That moment I knew
Holding the phone tight, I hear the tone twice
If you just pick up, swear I can fix us

[Pre-Chorus: Howie]
Every single night feels like 25 to life
And this sentence I've been living
It's alone and unforgiving
I'm guilty as charged
'Cause I went and broke your heart
But even I got rights
You're always gonna be my...

[Chorus: All & Brian]
One, always be my one phone call
All I want, all I need is one phone call
I'm gonna leave my message at the tone
Begging, pretty baby please come home
'Cause you're my one (my one)
Always be my one phone call (ooh-ooh-ooh)

[Bridge: Nick]
So let me make my case
And pray you won't erase
The message that I'm leaving
For you now
But if you do, at least you knew

[Chorus: Howie, AJ, (Brian) & All]
'Cause you're my one
Always be my one phone call
All I want, all I need is one phone call (ooh-ooh-ooh)
I'm gonna leave my message at the tone
Begging, pretty baby please come home (oh baby, come home)
'Cause you're my one
Always be my one phone call (ooh-ooh-ooh)

[Outro: AJ, (Nick), Brian & All]
You'll always be my one (ooh-yeah)
You'll always be my one
'Cause you're my one ('cause you're my one)
Always be my one phone call (phone call)
You'll always be my one phone call

[Verse 1: Kevin & Howie]
Been down the back roads
Where the girls are homegrown
That southern thang so sexy how they talk slow
And something happens in the woods of Kentucky
Drinking Moonshine, bonfire, pour the gasoline
Farther south, where the sweet Tequila flows
(Where the sweet Tequila flows)
Tiny clothes, yo te amo, Mexico
Señoritas, great us, sipping margaritas on the beach
They got something you can’t teach

[Chorus: All]
I've been all around, all round the world
Every single part, every part of the world
Touching down in Rio, Monaco, LA, Tokyo
But it all just feels like home
And it all still feels like home
And it all just feels like home
And it all still feels like home

[Verse 2: Nick]
Rock out in Bangkok
Where the party, don’t stop
Eyes open, blood shot
Seeing things I’d never thought
Sweating in the heat
God I love the way they speak
Burning up the streets, dancing like a freak

[Chorus: All]
I've been all around, all round the world
Every single part, every part of the world
Touching down in Rio, Monaco, LA, Tokyo
But it all just feels like home
And it all still feels like home
And it all just feels like home
And it all still feels like home

[Bridge: AJ]
So many things to see
So many eyes to meet
I couldn't count them all if I had eternity
So I just want you to know
Everywhere that I go
You take a piece of me

[Interlude: All]
Beijing, Stockholm, Bueos Aires, to tango
Moscow, Cape Town, showed us how to get down
London, Berlin, this is where it all began
San Juan, Sydney, can’t forget the NYC

[Chorus: All]
I've been all around, all round the world
Every single part, every part of the world
Touching down in Rio, Monaco, LA, Tokyo
But it all just feels like home

[Outro: Kevin, Nick & AJ]
Yet it all still feels like home
And it all still feels like home
And it all just feels like home
Yet it all still feels like home

[Intro]
Yeah
It's another one of those...
Y'all niggas know
412, Wiz Khalifa

[Verse 1]
Yeah
I'm so incredible. wait
With no metal to waste
I flow great, and that'll level ya face
And I'll still let a nigga have it
You talk greasy but you still a faggot
I front on cowards cause you niggas backwards
I got my money right, game on top
And it's been said that I'm the key to put this game on lock
I'm from the city of the triflin' hoods
But when you see me, got a smile on my face
Nothin' sweet, it's just that life is good
Yea, I dodged the hood, slums came up out that
Rap game about that, to gain pay without crack
See I'm a youngin' with too much on my plate
To let some small change half a youngin' dumped in a cage
I seen niggas make sales
Niggas get knocked and make bail
And take lives, their worries ain't jail
With no regards for life cause their livin' ain't well
Who gotta make it to heaven cause they livin' in hell
But me, I don't do much just keep to myself
And stop these cock-suckin' mothafuckas seekin' my wealth
I was told the world's cold but I see for myself
And I'm too hot to take the backseat or the shelf
So I'm here, for some reason though, they hate it to death
The love's gone, only hatred is left
Only achin' and stress
A king not to be mistaken for less
And this here is for the taking, this is history in the making, yeah!

[Interlude: Wiz Khalifa]
Yeah
It's ya boy Wiz, man
Prince of the City of Steel, you already know, man
It's history in the making what we doing right here
Fuckers can hate it if you want to, just sit back and laugh, smoke and get money on y'all niggas, you already know
Ain't nan' nigga gon' stop my grind
Work too hard to get here, you feel me
Let's do it!

[Verse 2]
Where I'm from, it's kinda hard to trust
Cause the hate's from most of your own people
They're fake and they're all see-through
Hate to see a nigga when he's stackin' his bucks
Rather him be down in the dumps, and out on his luck
But I'll be damned if my grind stop
My mind tickin' like a time watch
And I'm gonna be spittin' 'till the time's not
Presently there, I touch minds everywhere
And I'll ride hoping heaven is near
See the pain in your eyes, young with every stare
I seek peace, but these streets will never be fair
Cause somebody done took Greg's life
Son reached, deceased
No time to blink or think twice, damn
Wonder when it's gonna be my time to meet death
I'm stressed, need to ease my mind
And unless one of y'all try to see what's mine
Then I'll eat through your flesh, bones, and leave that spine
You see I did the right thing
I stayed up out the gun and knife game
I knew about the pain it might bring
And we all got problems
I chose to smoke blunts just to drown 'em
The top, but I rose from the bottom
And I'm here now, ain't no body harming young
My screw's loose, they say something's wrong with young
Your time's up, I'm just warning young
Cause this here's for the taking, this is history in the making, yeah!

[Outro]
Yeah, y'all muhfuckas better play close attention to what's going on, man, that's what it is
Rostrum Records
What up Benjy! Yeah
Thanks for that doe, nigga, I needed that
What up Chad!
ID Management, ID Labs, E. Dan, Hub, BLAH!
What up Pittsburgh!

[Verse 1: Brian]
Wanna be there just in time
Wanna be your shining knight
Protect you like a soldier
I wanna be the first in line
Be the one to save your life
All I wanna do is hold ya

[Pre-Chorus: Nick]
But somebody shot you down
Right in the middle of a war outside
Words mean so little
When you've heard those lies
You need someone to make you believe
Make you believe, oh, oh, oh

[Chorus: All]
I will be your soldier
I, I'll stand and fight until its over
Oh, and if your heart is getting colder
You know I will always be your soldier
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
And if your heart is getting colder
You know I will always be your soldier

[Verse 2: AJ]
You don't have to hide your scars
I'll be there when you fall apart
And fix you like a soldier
You don't have to go to far
Baby just lay down your arms
Now that the battle's over

[Pre-Chorus: Nick]
But somebody shot you down
Right in the middle of a war outside
Words mean so little
When you've heard those lies
You need someone to make you believe
Make you believe, oh, oh, oh

[Chorus: All]
I will be your soldier
I, I'll stand and fight until its over
Oh, and if your heart is getting colder
You know I will always be your soldier
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
And if your heart is getting colder
You know I will always be your soldier

[Interlude: All]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
And if your heart is getting colder
You know I will always be your soldier

[Bridge: Howie]
Somebody shot you down
Right in the middle of the war outside
Words mean so little
When you've heard those lies
You need someone to make you believe
Make you believe

[Chorus: All, Brian & AJ]
I will be your soldier (I will, ooh)
I, I'll stand and fight until its over (over, yeah)
Oh, and if your heart is getting colder (you know, you know)
You know I will always be your soldier (soldier)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Outro: AJ, Brian & All]
I will always be soldier, oh yeah
And if your heart is getting colder (you know, you know)
You know I will always be your soldier

[Verse 1]
I wish I could unzip my skin and take it off
Just to take a walk but I can’t do it
I don’t think I’ll make it on my own (on my own)
As when I take out my pen
And I wage it all, turn the page and fall
It just comes natural
I'm gonna make it on my own (on my own)

[Hook]
I just need time to walk it off
But I can’t do it
I’ll write it on my own time
Hey look I made it on my own (on my own)
I know she thinks that I don’t try, but I realize that I can do better
Write, write on 

[4x]
Makin’ a mess as I progress
No time to cry about it, do better
Write, write on 

[2x]

[Verse 2]
I wrote the greatest lines at the strangest times
Now it's payin’ off, but I still feel lost
Cuz I can’t do it
I don’t think I’ll make it on my own (on my own)
So in between now it pacifies
I change my name to free, but she feels safe to me
So I’m livin’ dangerously
I’m gonna make it on my own (on my own)

[Hook]

[Outro]

Write on, write it on your own time (write, write on)
Write on, write it on your own time (write, write on)...

[Verse 1]
Do I make you feel like Christmastime?
Put me in a party dress one time
Love me 'til I see the sunshine

[Pre-Chorus]
Say you'll never leave me
Say you'll never leave me

[Chorus]
Who has a face like smarty does?
Who has a voice like smarty does?
Who has a choice like smarty does?
Nobody, nobody, nobody
Who has a face like smarty does?
Who has a voice like smarty does? (Nobody)
Who has a choice like smarty does?
Nobody, nobody, nobody

[Verse 2]
Say I make you feel like Christmastime
Say I make you feel like Christmastime
Tell me you don't feel like Christmastime
Put me in a party dress, li-lime

[Verse 3]
Baby, if you loved me, you would call me your bunny
Tell me that I'm just a baby, honey
Beat me and tell me no one will love me
Better than you do
Better than you do

[Pre-Chorus]
Dance me all around the room
Dance me around the room
Keep out the stars, turn out the lights
This little world is yours tonight
Dance me all around the room
(And say you'll never leave me)

[Chorus]
Who has a face like smarty does?
Who has a voice like smarty does?
Who has a choice like smarty does?
Nobody, nobody, nobody
Who has a face like smarty does?
Who has a voice like smarty does? (Nobody)
Who has a choice like smarty does?
Nobody, nobody, nobody

[Bridge]
Say I make you feel like
Like you did, like you did, when you were thirteen
Say I make you feel like
When you were the dirty, heavy metal king
Say I make you feel all right, all right, all right
Kissing me 'til I see the sunshine
Kissing me 'til I see the sunshine

[Pre-Chorus]
Keep out the stars, turn out the lights
This little world is yours tonight
Is yours tonight
This little world is yours tonight
Say you'll never leave me
Say you'll never leave me

[Chorus]
Who has a face like smarty does?
Who has a voice like smarty does?
Who has a choice like smarty does?
Nobody, nobody, nobody
Who has a face like smarty does?

All that's real to me is Marilyn and Jesus
Jumping off of bridges
Sparklers and streamers, honey
I wanna fly, I wanna fly, I wanna fly

[Chorus]
Boy, you wanna come to my motel, honey?
Boy, you wanna hold me down, tell me that you love me?
Don't you know that I have really never loved nobody but you?
Boy, you wanna come to my motel, honey?
Boy, you wanna hold me down, tell me that you love me?
Don't you know that I have really never loved nobody but you?

[Verse 2]
All that's real to me is Halloween and Jesus
Coney Island beaches
Chandeliers and seizures, honey
I wanna fly, I wanna fly, I wanna fly

I can't be with the man I love
I can't be, if he treats me rough
I can't see him, I can't call him up

[Verse 3]
All that's real to me is trailer parks and beaches
Alabama breezes
Platinum and peaches, honey
I wanna fly, I wanna fly, I wanna fly

I can't be with the man I love
I can't be, if he treats me rough
I can't see him, I can't call him up

[Chorus]
Boy, you wanna come to my motel, honey?
Boy, you wanna hold me down, tell me that you love me?
Don't you know that I have really never loved nobody but you?

Ah, give it to me

There goes the howl
Ah, give it to me
There goes the boogie
There goes the howl
Ah, give it to me
There goes the boogie
There goes the howl
Ah, give it to me
There goes the boogie
There goes the howl

[Verse 1]
Red was the color of her eyes
She put me in a meditation state
Her skin is white, so white
Looked like it had no expiration date
Black is the color of the night
When it's time for feeding, her body wakes
There's just something 'bout the demon that she brings out of me
When we raise hell I can't stay away

[Bridge]
Aw, give it to me now
(So evil in the dress)
It circulates you start to feel it
(Devil in the flesh)
Once she starts to evoke the spirit
(Got you on the floor)
Ooh, she comes alive when you look killing
(Hungry for some more)

[Chorus]
Hey, I think she's got that true blood
Every time you're 'round I can smell it in you
She's got that true blood
I come around and raise the hell out of you
It's that demon next to me that's got me screaming
Make me wanna build a coffin for two
She's got that true blood
But baby, I just do it for the thrill out of you

[Post-Chorus]
It makes me say...

[Verse 2]
Now I feel my fever on the rise
And the bones in my body start to quake
Straight up from my toes to my mind
She controls me but I don’t want to escape
All of you ones that have tried
Find out that they have made the final mistake
But when she got a bite of my type
She told me that she found her perfect bloodmate

[Bridge]
Aw, give it to me now
(So evil in the dress)
It circulate you start to feel it
(Devil in the flesh)
Once she starts to evoke the spirit
(Got you on the floor)
Ooh she comes alive when you look killing
(Hungry for some more)

[Chorus]
Hey, Ithink she's got that true blood
Every time you're 'round I can smell it in you
She's got that true blood
I come around and raise the hell out of you
It's that demon next to me that's got me screaming
Make me wanna build a coffin for two
She's got that true blood
But baby, I just do it for the thrill out of you

[Post-Chorus]
It makes me say...
It makes me say...

[Verse 3]
Her pheromones invaded my instinct
I stalked your scent like an animal
Roast me in your perfection, I'm mad
I don't wanna think
'Cause the others wanna burn with me
But they don't hold a candle
It feels like

[Break]
It feels like...
The others wanna burn with me
But they don't hold a candle (candle, candle, candle)
Now, some funky guitar...
Give it to me...
(Break...)

[Chorus]
Hey, Ithink she's got that true blood
Every time you're 'round I can smell it in you
She's got that true blood
I come around and raise the hell out of you
It's that demon next to me that's got me screaming
Make me wanna build a coffin for two
She's got that true blood
But baby, I just do it for the thrill out of you
It makes saying...

[Interlude]
Ah, give it to me
There goes the boogie
There goes the howl
Ah, give it to me
There goes the boogie
There goes the howl
Ah, give it to me
There goes the boogie
There goes the howl
Ah, give it to me
There goes the boogie
There goes the howl

[Verse 3]
Yeah...

Now that you got me
(Now that you got me)
Tell me what you gonna do with me
(Tell me what you gonna do)
I can taste your blood
I found out you're my perfect fit
C'mon, mamma (C'mon)
Show me what you're working with
C'mon, mamma (C'mon)
And, show me what you're working with

[Intro]
¿Cómo puede ser verdad?

[Verse 1]
Last night I dreamt of San Pedro
Just like I'd never gone, I knew the song
A young girl with eyes like the desert
It all seems like yesterday, not far away

[Chorus]
Tropical the island breeze, all of nature wild and free
(Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)
This is where I long to be, La Isla Bonita
And when the samba played, the sun would set so high
(Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes, your Spanish lullaby

[Verse 2]
I fell in love with San Pedro
Warm wind carried on the sea, he called to me
Te dijo, "Te amo"
I prayed that the days would last, they went so fast

[Chorus]
Tropical the island breeze, all of nature wild and free
(Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)
This is where I long to be, La Isla Bonita
And when the samba played, the sun would set so high
(Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes, your Spanish lullaby

[Bridge]
I want to be where the sun warms the sky
When it's time for siesta, you can watch them go by
Beautiful faces, no cares in this world
Where a girl loves a boy, and a boy loves a girl

[Pre-Chorus]
Last night I dreamt of San Pedro
It all seems like yesterday, not far away

[Chorus]
Tropical the island breeze, all of nature wild and free
(Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)
This is where I long to be, La Isla Bonita
And when the samba played, the sun would set so high
(Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes, your Spanish lullaby
(Pa-pa-pa-pa-pa)
Tropical the island breeze, all of nature wild and free
(Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)
This is where I long to be, La Isla Bonita
And when the samba played, the sun would set so high
(Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes, your Spanish lullaby

[Outro]
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
Te dijo, te amo
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
Él dijo que te ama
Pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa (Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)
La Isla Bonita
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Spanish lullaby

[Verse 1]
Girl, this little game you play
You don't stop 'til you go too far
So what's a man like me to say?
With a bullet laying in my heart

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Damn love, we go from so hot to so cold
What am I gonna do about this damn, love?
Is this shit in sync or insane love?
I guess that's the way we play it

[Chorus]
She loves me now, she loves me not
She loves me now, but only when I walk away
She loves me now, she loves me not
She loves me now, but only when I walk away

[Verse 2]
What's that, baby, what you say?
'Cause you don’t want to light up this torch
'Cause I'll burn it down all the way
Burn it down 'til there ain't no more

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Damn love, how did this sound get so amp'd up
Turn off and silence this damn love
Is this shit in sync or insane love
I guess that’s the way we play it

[Chorus]
She loves me now, she loves me not
She loves me now, but only when I walk away
She loves me now, she loves me not
She loves me now, but only when I walk away

[Bridge]
Cold, so cold, yeah
Cold, so cold, yeah

[Verse 3]
You should see the look on your face
Baby, when I finish what you start
I can’t hear a word you say
With a bullet laying in your heart
Damn love, how did this shit get outta my hands love?
I laid you to rest you say (Damn love)
This shit’s insane, it’s insane love
Ain’t that the way we play it

[Chorus]
She loves me now, she loves me not
She loves me now, but only when I walk away
She loves me now, she loves me not
She loves me now, but only when I walk away

[Bridge]
Cold, so cold
Only when I walk away
Cold, so cold
You love me, don't you?
Only when I walk away
Cold, so cold
Only when I walk away
Cold, so cold
Only when I walk away
Cold so cold
Tell me, you love me don't you?
Only when I walk away

Ah, so cold
Ah, so cold
Ah, so cold
Ah, so cold

Only when I walk away
Only when I walk away
Only when I walk away
You love me don't you?
Only when I walk away
Only when I walk away
She loves me now
She loves me not
She loves me now
But only when I walk away
She loves me now
She loves me not
She loves me now
But only when I walk away

Only when I walk away
Only when I walk away
What am I gonna do with all this damn love
What am I gonna do with all this
Only when I walk away
Only when I walk away

Hol' up, hol' up
Only when I walk away
(I fuckin' hate you) Hol' up
(You fuckin' ruined me) Hol' up
Only when I walk away
Don't you ever...

[Verse 4]
She only love me when I walk away
Call me on the phone, tell me, "Baby, please stay."
(Only when I walk away)
She only love me when I walk away
Calling, yelling, begging, crying, "Baby, please stay."
(Only when I walk away)

She only love me when I walk away
Call me on the phone and tell me, "Baby do you stay?"
(Only when I walk away)
She only love me when I walk away
Calling, yelling, begging, crying, "Baby, please stay."
(Only when I walk away)

She only love me when I walk away
Call me on the phone, tell me, "Baby, please stay."
(Only when I walk away)
She only love me when I walk away
Calling, yelling, begging, crying, "Baby, please stay."
(Only when I walk away)

She only love me when I walk away
Call me on the phone, tell me, "Baby, please stay."
She only love me when I walk away
Calling, yelling, begging, crying, "Baby, please stay."
(Only when I walk away)

She only love me when I walk away
Call me on the phone, tell me, "Baby, please stay."
She only love me when I walk away
I said, "Fuck you bitch we don't care what you say."

Time goes by so slowly
Time goes by so slowly
Time goes by so slowly
Time goes by so slowly

[Chorus]
Every little thing that you say or do
I'm hung up, I'm hung up on you
Waiting for your call, baby, night and day
I'm fed up, I'm tired of waiting on you

Time goes by so slowly for those who wait
No time to hesitate
Those who run seem to have all the fun
I'm caught up, I don't know what to do

Tick tick tock, it's a quarter to two
And I'm done, I'm hanging up on you

I can't keep on waiting for you
I know that you're still hesitating
Don't cry for me, 'cause I'll find my way
You'll wake up one day, but it'll be too late

Every little thing that you say or do
I'm hung up, I'm hung up on you

[Intro: Justin Timberlake]
Hey, hey, hey, come on
We're having too much fun right here

[Verse 1: Justin Timberlake]
She's got a secret, but I know
She wanna break it down for me like she tryna get some paper
Who needs a stage with the lights low
'Cause you already dropped the bullet and turned it into something major

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
Now can we discuss how fast you just got undressed
Girl, if sex is a contest, then you're coming first (And)
Don't rush, go slow, I-I can't lie, I'm impressed
Standing ovation, encore, when love curtains close

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake & (Timbaland)]
It's a cabaret (Put on a show, get on the floor)
'Cause even though I'm a professional, I like to do my work at home
Cabaret (Put on a show, get on the floor)
You giving me everything you got, all I really want now is more
(Put on a show, get on the floor)
(Get on the floor, get on the floor)
(Put on a show, get on the floor)
You giving me everything you got, all I really want now is more

[Verse 2: Justin Timberlake]
Fantasy play the role
And all these new moves that I'd like got me feeling like a stranger
Say my name, do you know
'Cause I got you saying Jesus so much, it's like we are laying in the Manger

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
Now can we discuss how fast you just got undressed
Girl, if sex is a contest, then you're coming first (And)
Don't rush, go slow, I-I can't lie, I'm impressed
Standing ovation, encore, when love curtains close

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake & (Timbaland)]
It's a cabaret (Put on a show, get on the floor)
'Cause even though I'm a professional, I like to do my work at home
Cabaret (Put on a show, get on the floor)
You giving me everything you got, all I really want now is more
(Put on a show, get on the floor)
(Get on the floor, get on the floor)
(Put on a show, get on the floor)
You giving me everything you got, all I really want now is more

[Verse 3: Drake]
Okay, this just in girl the paper so long
Always seem like I gotta wait for so long
So long 'til you get off from work, but listen
I got some better positions for you to take in for so long
Always strap up just for safety then go long
Then do my touchdown dance in it no clothes on
We might fuck around and slip tonight
You're Kryptonite, you should probably have a cape to throw on
On my Eddie Murphy Boomerang for ya
Got a bunch of old girls that I threw away for ya
I been in the gym doing two-a-days for ya
So I can lift ya up when I do the thang to ya
D-do do the thing to ya, girl truth be told
You set the pace then you ride it like cruise control
The shit feel so right gotta tell somebody
I just can't decide who should know, I’ll keep a secret for ya

[Bridge: Drake]
I'm tryna ease your mind, word to Boosie
Pole in my bedroom that was there when I moved in

[Verse 4: Drake]
Okay fine, I'm a terrible liar
Girl what difference does it make if it was there, or it's mine
You the girl that's gonna be there when it's marrying time
And I'm gonna fuck you like we are having an affair
I swear it's like I'm undercover way I'm cuffing you though
Presidential shit girl you up on the poles
Say this is a private show, oh boy don't start
Keep this whole stripper thing secret in a pole vault
North pole boy from the T.O
They ain't really ready for me and that J.T. though
Cook for ya and then I break it down like a kilo
Got a camera watching our every single move like casinos

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake & (Timbaland)]
It's a cabaret (Put on a show, get on the floor)
'Cause even though I'm a professional, I like to do my work at home
Cabaret (Put on a show, get on the floor)
You giving me everything you got, all I really want now is more
(Put on a show, get on the floor)
(Get on the floor, get on the floor)
(Put on a show, get on the floor)
You giving me everything you got, all I really want now is more

[Verse 1: Justin Timberlake]
Walking around middle of the night
Might end a man's life with that innocent face
Cause everything below your neck killin' everything next
It's murder, murder
You say I need to watch out, something might go down, good
I really wanna take this under the ground, under the ground
And I'mma be down to go to that level
And even when you speak regular a sick freak, girl, I say ok
So come on and leave me cause the deeper you take me the better
You killin' me softly but we can go as hard as you want to
Bed's way under the ground, under the ground
And I'll be down and throw it at that level

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
Ooooh, that girl is murder (Everybody get down)
Ooooh, that girl is murder (Everybody get down)
Under the lights and sound
Everybody get down, down
You know that she's a killer
Watch it get down, watch it get down
Watch it get down, watch it get down
Murder...

[Verse 2: Justin Timberlake]
You dancing around, hanging out the window
Talking real big with your little slim waist
And with all that below your waist
Girl, you know the next scene is murder
Maybe you need to watch out something might go down
Girl, your body is gonna end up
Under the ground, under the ground
I would be down to go to that level
And even when you dress regular a freak chick
Girl, you complement my taste
So girl don't be stingy the more that you give me the better
You know you killin' me softly but we can go as hard as you want to
Until the bed's way under the ground, under the ground
I would be down to go to that level

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
Ooooh, that girl is murder (Everybody get down)
Ooooh, that girl is murder (Everybody get down)
Under the lights and sound
Everybody get down, down
You know that she's a killer
Watch it get down, watch it get down
Watch it get down, watch it get down
Murder...

[Verse 3: JAY Z]
Yoko Ono, she got that Yoko Ono
You know that shit that made John Lennon go solo
Know that shit gotta be lethal
If that pussy broke up The Beatles
Chocha ruined pop culture
All them player days is over
Got me buying Rovers, rings
Jumping over brooms and church rooms, kaboom
That bomb, that P
It's a problem call the police
Red bottoms, white sheets, that's murder, she a beast
Faces of death, she fine or what
Suicide, I'm trying to cut
White chalk, line 'em up
Give new meaning to dying to fuck

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
Ooooh, that girl is murder (Everybody get down)
Ooooh, that girl is murder (Everybody get down)
Under the lights and sound
Everybody get down, down
You know that she's a killer
Watch it get down, watch it get down
Watch it get down, watch it get down
Murder...

[Outro: Timbaland]
I line 'em up, she shoot 'em down
I line 'em up, she shoot 'em down
I line 'em up, she shoot 'em down
I line 'em up, she shoot 'em down
(Murder)

[Verse 1]
Weight is coming off, soaring high
Pleading you to stay, come alive

[Pre-Chorus]
Say you mean it, seal it up
Say you want to try
Say you haven't had enough
Say you want to

[Chorus]
Once you get the feeling, it
Wants you back for more
Says it's going to heal it, but
You won't make the call
One step back, you're leaving it
Now it's moving on
Why won't you believe in it
Untill it's gone?

[Verse 2]
Fading at the light
Softly say
Get it out my mind anyway

[Pre-Chorus]
Say you mean it, seal it up
Say you want to try
Say you haven't had enough
Say you want to

[Chorus]
Once you get the feeling, it
Wants you back for more
Says it's going to heal it, but
You won't make the call
One step back, you're leaving it
Now it's moving on
Why won't you believe in it
Untill it's gone?
Once you get the feeling, it
Wants you back for more
Now it gets ethereal
Feet ain't on the floor
One step back you're leaving it
Jumping at the wall
Why won't you believe in it
'Till it's gone?

[Bridge]
You gave to me
All I know
I will stay here
I will not go
You gave to me
All I know
I will stay here
I will not go
(Running out
You can make it through it
Running out
You can make it all)

[Pre-Chorus]
Say you mean it, seal it up
Say you want to try
Say you haven't had enough
Say you want to

[Chorus]
Once you get the feeling, it
Wants you back for more
Says it's going to heal it, but
You won't make the call (say you)
One step back, you're leaving it
Now it's moving on
Why won't you believe in it
Untill it's gone?
Once you get the feeling, it
Wants you back for more
Now it gets ethereal
Feet ain't on the floor (say you)
One step back you're leaving it
Jumping at the wall
Why won't you believe in it
'Till it's gone?

[Verse 1]
Keep your old and wasted word
My heart is breaking like you heard
But the town has always turned
These lies and made them all burn

[Chorus]
Keep your old and wasted words
My heart is breaking like you heard
But the town has always turned
These lies and made them all burn
Let me be the one, to go on , to go on, to go on
Let me be the one, to try it on

[Verse 2]
Can you feel the leeches bite
That boy that she took out tonight
He's brave and walking sure
Through all the spots you're working for

[Chorus]
Keep your old and wasted words
My heart is breaking like you heard
But the town has always turned
These lies and made them all burn
Let me be the one, to go on , to go on, to go on
Let me be the one, to try it on

[Outro]
When the light is out
And words have gone
Let me be the one to try it on
When the light is out
And words have gone
Let me be the one to try it on
When the light is out
And words have gone
Let me be the one to try it on
When the light is out
And words have gone
Let me be the one to try it on
When the light is out
And words have gone
Let me be the one to try it on
When the light is out
And words have gone
Let me be the one to try it on
When the light is out
And words have gone
Let me be the one to try it on
When the light is out
And words have gone
Let me be the one to try it on
When the light is out
And words have gone
Let me be the one to try it on
When the light is out
And words have gone
Let me be the one to try it on
When the light is out
And words have gone
Let me be the one to try it on
When the light is out
And words have gone
Let me be the one to try it on

[Verse 1]
Nod my head so dumb with love
There's something else I'm dreaming of
Shut my eyes pretend it's there
Keep me here, unaware
I would promise all I could
Think about it afterward
Humour me just think it through
It's all I ever asked of you

[Pre-Chorus]
Coming back
Coming back
Coming back
Coming back

[Chorus]
You come out and say the word
Quick how all the tables turned
Hate that there's a space to fill
Always have and always will
I'm there when your fingers snap
It's not where we left it at
I can see the love we trapped
Coming back

[Verse 2]
Along the barren streets we slide, poke at any dirt we find
Magnify for us to see, then dig them up desperately
I would promise all I could, think about it afterward
Humour me just think it through, it's all I ever asked of you

[Pre-Chorus]
Coming back
Coming back
Coming back
Coming back

[Chorus]
You come out and say the word
Quick how all the tables turned
Hate that there's a space to fill
Always have and always will
I'm there when your fingers snap
It's not where we left it at
I can see the love we trapped
Coming back

[Outro]
Your eyes
Your eyes
Your eyes
Your eyes
Your eyes
Your eyes
Your eyes
Your eyes
Your eyes
Your eyes
Your eyes

[Chorus]
Can I wake you up?
Can I wake you up?
Is it late enough?
Is it late enough?
There's a story in which my eyes shut

[Verse 1]
Could you bag me up?
Could you bag me up?
Could you bag me up?
Could you bag me up?
Could you bag me up?
Could you bag me up?
There's a story in which my eyes shut

[Verse 2]
Is it late enough?
Is it late enough?
Is it late enough?
Is it late enough?
Is it late, is it late, is it late, is it late?

[Verse 3]
Can I wake you up?
Can I wake you up?
Is it late, is it late, is it late, is it late?
There's a story in which my eyes shut

[Chorus]
Can I wake you up?
Can I wake you up?
Is it late enough?
Is it late enough?
There's a story in which my eyes shut

[Bridge]
Could you bag me up?
Could you bag me up?

[Chorus]
Can I wake you up?
Can I wake you up?
Is it late enough?
Is it late enough?
There's a story in which my eyes shut

[Bridge]
Could you bag me up?
Could you bag me up?

[Verse 4]
Saw you hang back
With your eyes looking down
And it's all wasted now
Told you but you can't take it

[Chorus]
Can I wake you up?
Can I wake you up?
Is it late enough?
Is it late enough?
There's a story in which my eyes shut

[Bridge]
Could you bag me up?
Could you bag me up?
Could you bag me up?
Could you bag me up?
Could you bag me up?
Could you bag me up?

[Verse 1]
Don't think it's what you're afraid of
Come in you know what's been made up
Hold you tight, words have a new sound
Reading the signs that just seep out

[Pre-Chorus]
You've gotta leave it
Leave it, leave it, leave
You've gotta leave it
Leave it, leave it, leave

[Chorus]
Don't you go evade me now
Come see what you've done

[Verse 2]
Each of your reasons has broken
Call it off once you have spoken
Fill to the top then split open
Repeating over and over

[Pre-Chorus]
Now you have to leave it
Leave it, leave it, leave
You've gotta leave it
Leave it, leave it, leave

[Chorus]
Don't you go evade me now
Come see what you've done
I've been thinking lately how
All these feelings won

[Bridge]
Won't see the out, never come back
Won't see the out, never come back
Won't see the out, never come back
Won't see the out, never come back
Won't see the out, never come back
Won't see the out, never come back
Won't see the out, never come back
Won't see the out, never come back

[Chorus]
Don't you go evade me now
Come see what you've done
I've been thinking lately how
All these feelings won

[Verse 1]
Held your standards close to heart
But late one night you threw them down
Simple promises you said you'd never break
But now you have
All throughout the morning though
I'm begging no
Your lips they stay perfectly still

[Chorus]
Still... still... 

[x2]

[Verse 2]
Did he fill the empty spaces
Was he everything I'm not?
There's no force behind my mouth
But in just three words
He brings you down
There's a movement
Out the door
I swear but no
Your lips they stay perfectly still

[Chorus]

[Verse]
Go on my gun
Stop you and carry on
You haven't been there
Time to sell the rose around
She takes it now
You give it up

[Chorus]
You'll steal this one, when all is over
You'll go and you can, see all you gave her
You'll flee the door, your eyes glowing
She's there but you can't, keep on going

[Verse 2]
Racing on
Ties it up and moves along
You're waiting there
Came into the room and then
You stare me down
You turn around

[Chorus]
You'll steal this one, when all is over
You'll go and you can, see all you gave her
You'll flee the door, your eyes glowing
She's there but you can't, keep on going

[Instrumental Bridge]
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah

[Chorus]
You'll steal this one, when all is over
You'll go and you can, see all you gave her
You'll flee the door, your eyes glowing
She's there but you can't, keep on going

[Verse 1]
I could go and ask her first
You could try but it won't work
I don't want my cover blown
I should do this on my own

[Pre-Chorus]
The night has gone
And I'm walking home
But I still don't
I still don't know

[x2]

[Chorus]
If only
One of us
Had the guts tonight

[Verse 2]
It's so hard to find the silent type
Someone shy who won't spread the hype
You're so cold and you're in this crowd
I am on my way now

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[x2]

[Verse 1]
Said all I want from you is to see you tomorrow
And every tomorrow
Maybe you’ll let me borrow, your heart
And is it too much to ask for every Sunday?
And while we're at it, throw in every other day to start

[Pre-Chorus]
I know people make promises all the time
Then they turn right around and break them
When someone cuts your heart open with a knife
Now you're bleeding
But I could be that guy to heal it over time
And I won’t stop until you believe it
'Cause baby, you’re worth it

[Chorus]
So don't act like it’s a bad thing to fall in love with me
'Cause you might fuck around and find your dreams come true with me
Spend all your time and your money just to find out that my love was free
So don't act like it’s a bad thing to fall in love with me, me
It’s not a bad thing to fall in love with me, me
Fall, yeah

[Verse 2]
Now how about I be the last voice you hear tonight?
And every other night for the rest of the nights that there are
And every morning I just wanna see you staring back at me (Staring back at me)
'Cause I know that’s a good place to start

[Pre-Chorus]
I know people make promises all the time
Then they turn right around and break them
When someone cuts your heart open with a knife
Now you're bleeding
(Don't you know) But I could be that guy to heal it over time
And I won’t stop until you believe it
'Cause baby, you’re worth it

[Chorus]
So don't act like it’s a bad thing to fall in love with me
'Cause you might fuck around and find your dreams come true with me
Spend all your time and your money just to find out that my love was free
So don't act like it’s a bad thing to fall in love with me, me
It’s not a bad thing to fall in love with me, me
Not such a bad thing to fall in love with me
(Not such a bad thing to fall in love with me)

[Bridge]
No, I won’t fill your mind
With broken promises and wasted time
And if you fall, you’ll always land right in these arms
These arms of mine

[Chorus]
Don't act like it’s a bad thing to fall in love with me
'Cause you might fuck around and find your dreams come true with me
Spend all your time and your money just to find out that my love was free
So don't act like it’s a bad thing to fall in love with me, me
It’s not a bad thing to fall in love with me, me
Not such a bad thing to fall in love with me

[Verse 1]
Keeps coming closer
I don‘t, but she thinks I know her
Beautiful smile with those sad eyes
That was my type
Amnesia that’s over
I can see your breathing, girl, is colder
I can see you need me but I don’t care
My whole memory of me and love
Gone so far from me, girl
It’s not fair
I could feel it almost start to change (Almost starts to change)
But then it hurts too much
That’s when it starts to fade

[Chorus]
So cold, baby, now I’m going crazy
I don’t know why you need me alone
If it was true, if it was you
Don’t you think?
Don’t you think I would know?
Amnesia, every memory fades away till it’s gone
Where did you go?
Amnesia, went from everything to nothing
No we anymore, she’s a stranger that I used to know

[Verse 2]
Now, these photos of us
So happy, so in love
Tell me what happened
Who are they? Where did they go?
And when was enough, enough
When did all the fire turn colder?
When did your heart start to beat slower?
My whole memory of me in love,is gone so far from me, It's not fair
And I can feel it almost start to change (almost start to change)
But it just hurts to much, I let it go away

[Chorus]
So cold, baby, now I’m going crazy
I don’t know why you need me alone
If it was true, if it was you
Don’t you think?
Don’t you think I would know?
Amnesia, every memory fades away till it’s gone
Where did you go?
Amnesia, went from everything to nothing
No we anymore, she’s a stranger that I used to know
I can feel it almost start to change (almost start to change)
But then it hurts too much I let it go away uuuh

[Bridge]
So cold, baby (so cold), now I’m going crazy
I don’t know why you need me alone
If it was true, if it was you
Don’t you think?
Don’t you think I would know?
Amnesia, every memory fades away till it’s gone
Where did you go?
Amnesia, everything and nothing
No we anymore she’s a stranger
Amnesia, every memory fades away till it’s gone
Where did you go?
Amnesia, everything and nothing
No we anymore she’s a stranger that I used to know
And I don’t know you anymore
Everything to nothing
Everything to nothing
She’s a stranger that I used to know
Amnesia, amnesia, amnesia

[Outro]
Go on and tear me apart
And do it again tomorrow
I almost forgot
Who you are
I try to forget about it every time I see ya, See ya
Thought I could do without it
Now I know I need ya, need ya
This is turning into some kind of fucking amnesia, I need ya
Memories fade away
Love is so insane
I try to forget about it, every time I see ya, see ya
Thought I could do without it
Now I know I need ya, need ya
This is turning into some kind of fucking amnesia, I need ya
Memories fade away
Love is so insane
So tear me apart and do it again tomorrow
I almost forgot who we are
I’ll let you drive me crazy for another day
Isn’t this love insane, insane? Yeah

[Intro]
Sounds are calm
When we become the animals that were made in the jungle

[Verse 1]
Why you standing so far away? Minding manners and looking on by
Why don't you come out to play?
And get closer to your animal, inside

[Bridge]
Baby, I act like the gentleman that your mama would love (ooh, get to know me)
Baby, you act like a lady, don’t have to cover it up (things you wanna show me)
Make me remember the reason why I wanted your love, (teach me slowly)
I think you're ready to try, walk a little closer and...

[Chorus]
Now take me to your jungle, I'm not afraid
And if you're looking for your animal, hop in my cage
Crawl in and tear off your hide, don’t taunt
Come in, come in, gimme what I don't know, I want
Come in, come in, gimme what I don't know, I want
Come in, come in, gimme what I don't know, I want
Come in, come in, gimme what I don't know, don't know, I want
Come in, come in, gimme what I don't know, I want

[Verse 2]
Show me your teeth, and spread your wings
Down and dirty, you're loving me so loud
Rare breed but you’re out as a stray, sideshow in front of the whole crowd

[Bridge]
Baby, I act like the gentleman that your mama would love (ooh, get to know me)
Baby, you act like a lady, don't have to cover it up, things you wanna show me
Make me remember the reason why I wanted your love, (teach me slowly)
I think you're ready to try, walk a little closer and...

[Chorus]
Now take me to your jungle, I'm not afraid
And if you're looking for your animal, hop in my cage
Crawl in and tear off your hide, don’t taunt
Come in, come in, gimme what I don't know, I want
Come in, come in, gimme what I don't know, I want
Come in, come in, gimme what I don't know, I want
Come in, come in, gimme what I don't know, don't know, I want
Come in, come in, gimme what I don't know, I want

[Intro]
Sounds are calm
When we become the animals that were made in the jungle

[Spoken Bridge: Timbaland]
Deep in the jungle where the creatures meet
The animals come out and make the sounds of the beat
They pull off they skin so you can really see
That you’re dealing with a whole new breed

[Chorus]
Now take me to your jungle, I'm not afraid
And if you're looking for your animal, hop in my cage
Crawl in and tear off your hide, don’t taunt
Come in, come in, gimme what I don't know, I want
Come in, come in, gimme what I don't know, I want
Come in, come in, gimme what I don't know, I want
Come in, come in, gimme what I don't know, don't know, I want
Come in, come in, gimme what I don't know, I want

[Intro]
Sounds are calm
When we become the animals that were made in the jungle

[Outro]
Come in, come in, gimme what I don't know, I want
Come in, come in, gimme what I don't know, I want
Come in, come in, gimme what I don't know, I want
Come in, come in, gimme what I don't know, don't know, I want
Come in, come in, gimme what I don't know, I want

[Intro]
(Listen...)

[Verse 1]
Now baby, the day you were born
They picked you up and wrapped you up
So cold but so hot everything melts on you
It's cool you got on nothing, baby
Cause I know what to do, girl, let's coordinate, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
First I take you out, then you turn around (Baby)
Then you back it up, ooh yeah, like we at our own place
So I take you home, wear whatever you want, baby
'Cause I know that we’re gonna end up back where we started

[Chorus]
And you don’t gotta worry what you wear tonight
Those heels lift you up where you fit me right, said oh
You already got it on, oh, baby
Tell me what's better than the two of us
'Cause you by yourself is more than enough for me
Honey, I don’t think she heard me, so I say
Oooh, baby, you got it... on
I said ooh, baby, you got it... on

[Verse 2]
Now everything you put on
Everything you put on looks better on you, than the one you tried on before
Don’t make me pick girl, don’t make me choose
Don’t you feel like you’re back in the twelfth grade
Now you're my first lady so let’s take you back to our first date
This is what we'll do...

[Pre-Chorus]
First I take you out, then you turn around (Baby)
Then you back it up, ooh yeah, like we at our own place
So I take you home, wear whatever you want, baby
'Cause I know that we’re gonna end up back where we started

[Adlib]
And what I'm saying is....

[Chorus]
And you don’t gotta worry what you wear tonight
Those heels lift you up where you fit me right, said oh
You already got it on, oh, baby
Tell me what's better than the two of us
'Cause you by yourself is more than enough for me
Honey, I don’t think she heard me, so I say
Oooh, baby, you got it... on
I said ooh, baby, you got it... on

[Bridge]
And it sounds like falling in love
Sounds like falling in love right now
Sounds like falling in love
Sounds like falling in love right now
It sounds like falling in love
Just like falling in love over and over again with you
Sounds like falling in love
Sounds like falling in love right now
Sounds like falling in love
Sounds like falling in love right now
It sounds like falling in love
Just like falling in love over and over again with you, oh baby

[Outro]
You don’t gotta worry what you wear tonight
Baby, you got it... on
Tell me what's better than the two of us... nothing!
Baby, you got it
I don’t think she heard me so I say
I say ooh, baby, you’ve got it... on
I’m telling you, mama
Ooh, baby, you’ve got it... on
Don’t matter what you wear
Baby, you’ve got it on
And it sounds like falling in love
Sounds like falling in love
Sounds like falling in love
Yeah, baby, you got it on

[Spoken Intro]
This ain't rock 'n' roll, this is genocide!

[Verse 1]
As they pulled you out of the oxygen tent
You asked for the latest party
With your silicone hump and your ten inch stump
Dressed like a priest you was
Tod Browning's Freak you was
Crawling down the alley on your hands and knee
I'm sure you're not protected, for it's plain to see
The Diamond Dogs are poachers and they hide behind trees
Hunt you to the ground they will, mannequins with kill appeal

[Chorus]
(Will they come?) I'll keep a friend serene
(Will they come?) Oh baby, come on to me
(Will they come?) Well, she's come, been and gone
Come out of the garden, baby
You'll catch your death in the fog
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs

[Verse 2]
The Halloween Jack is a real cool cat
And he lives on top of Manhattan Chase
The elevator's broke, so he slides down a rope
Onto the street below, oh Tarzan, go man go
Meet his little hussy with his ghost town approach
Her face is sans feature, but she wears a Dali brooch
Sweetly reminiscent, something mother used to bake
Wrecked up and paralysed, Diamond Dogs are stabilised

[Chorus]
(Will they come?) I'll keep a friend serene
(Will they come?) Oh baby, come on to me
(Will they come?) Well, she's come, been and gone
Come out of the garden, baby
You'll catch your death in the fog
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs

[Bridge]
(Oo-oo-ooh) call them the Diamond Dogs
(Oo-oo-ooh) call them the Diamond Dogs
Oh, hoo!
Ah ooh!

[Verse 3]
In the year of the scavenger, the season of the bitch
Sashay on the boardwalk, scurry to the ditch
Just another future song, lonely little kitsch
(There's gonna be sorrow) try and wake up tomorrow

[Chorus]
(Will they come?) I'll keep a friend serene
(Will they come?) Oh baby, come on to me
(Will they come?) Well, she's come, been and gone
Come out of the garden, baby
You'll catch your death in the fog
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs

[Outro]
Oo-oo-ooh, call them the Diamond Dogs
Oo-oo-ooh, call them the Diamond Dogs
Bow-wow, woof woof, bow-wow, wow
Call them the Diamond Dogs
Dogs!
Call them the Diamond Dogs, call them, they call them
Call them the Diamond Dogs, call them, call them, ooh hoo!
Call them the Diamond Dogs
Keep cool, Diamond Dogs rule, OK
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
(Beware of the Diamond Dogs)
(Beware of the Diamond Dogs)
(Beware of the Diamond Dogs)
(Beware of the Diamond Dogs)

[Intro: Caleb Followill]
Homegrown
Rock to the rhythm and bop to the beat of the radio
Ain't got the slang but you got the face to play the role
And you can play with me

[Verse 1]
And all the bros
Try for the courage and try for Charity's tight clothes
She's got a hat and all the hat says is 'asshole'
She'll be bobbing to me

[Pre-Chorus]
Pretty hairdos and those lipstick kisses blown, yeah, that's the right move
Make me feel like I'm the one who moves you
The only one you see

[Verse 2]
Now, take it down
And don't you let those tears quench the thirsty ground
And don't you be so scared that you can't make a sound
Make a sound for me

[Chorus]
All of London sing
'Cause England swings and they sure love the tales I bring
Those raining days they ain't so bad when you're the king
The king they want to see

[Refrain]
Homegrown
Rock to the rhythm and bop to the beat of the radio
Ya' ain't got the slang but you've got the face to play the role
And you can play with me-uh

[Pre-Chorus]
Pretty hairdos and those lipstick kisses blown, yeah, that's the right move
Make me feel like I'm the one who's moving you
The only one you see

[Chorus]
All of London sing
'Cause England swings and they sure love the tales I bring
Those raining days they ain't so bad when you're the king
The king they want to see

[Verse 1]
This your beat I'm sorry, but her eyes were so starry
I just had to get some-uhh...one up it
Hit the bricks, drop the coins, pick up the shit
Like a pooper scooper even dog shit was once eukanuba
Underdogs of the past can be the shit up in the future
I brush my shoulders off to remove my bazooka
What we doing? Deck full of spades, hold a mic like Bob Barker
It's manure if you new to the ways of the lupester
The base meaning is I'm a roofer, (woo!), I'm going like fuschia
All I need is a coup and a princess behind me like King Koopa
If a nigga with me and he black he might shoot ya
And that's motherfuckin real, even my mother, is fucking, real
Kitchen counter tapping then undercover skills
Your beat is in my bedroom giving head to 'em
Stretch it out, stand up in it and call it leg room
Beat the beat till it's beat there's eggs to 'em
Then repeat, eat it till it sleep, then wake it up
But then don't speak to it cause now it's like the feds to 'em
Beats having trouble going to sleep cause now I'm like Fred to 'em
And if I can be any meaner, our patina was Martin and Gina
To her I would have ran, but now she like Pam
She still want the flow but now I'm like damn
Whisk her away, but I had to scram back to the bullshit
Scramble to ya pulpits and tell the preacher he legit
Beats get weaker the deeper that I get
Damn right she ain't even get the shaft, I'm just speaking from the tip
When the fire gone then I quit, cellphone still along on the trip
So I can speak to the choir from the throne on my ship
And noble or sober or my song nobler
Eating with our hands and the waiter is a fan
Shout out to Mike Ferro keeping paper in my hands
Tailored Savile Row, or Mastermind Japan
Sky dropped six on the blazer
Drop top Aston versus Cobra, I'mma race ya
Free Rico, before he do his bid
Got a father tatted on him, gone show him where it is
Black dragon slayer they ain't knowing what he did
Want everybody in Bull city eating like a pig, lets do it!
Durk, Mouse, Paris, Keef, Boolu, Dub, Pharris
Drama, Common, Flict, Ye, Chance, Illinois, Lupe

[Verse 1]
Yeah
Had hit records on my demo
Did y'all boys not get the memo?
I do not stay at the Intercontinental
And anything I got is not a rental
I own that mu'fucka
Figured out this shit is simple
My stock been going up like a crescendo
A bunch of handshakes from the fakes
But nigga, I do not wanna be friends though

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I told y'all mu'fuckas
Man, this shit is not a love song
This a "fuck-a-stripper-on-the-mink-rug" song
This a "fuck-them-boys-forever, hold-a-grudge" song
"Pop-some-fucking-champagne-in-the-tub" song
Nigga, "just-because" song
Damn

[Chorus]
What's the move? Can I tell the truth?
If I was doing this for you then I'd have nothing left to prove
Nah, this for me though
I'm just tryna stay alive and take care of my people
And they don't have no award for that
Trophies, trophies
And they don't have no award for that
Shit don't come with trophies, ain't no envelopes to open
I just do it cause I'm 'sposed to, nigga

[Verse 2]
Bitch I go to Dreams with a suitcase
I got my whole country on a new wave
She like, "I heard all your niggas stay where you stay"
House so big I haven't seen them boys in two days
Bitch, I use a walkie-talkie just to get a beverage
I saw my parents split up right after the wedding
That taught my ass to stay committed, fuck the credit
Bitch, check the numbers, I'm the one who really get it

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I told y'all mu'fuckas
Man, this shit is not a love song
This a "doing-me-and-only-God-can-judge" song
"I-do-not-know-what-the-fuck-you-thought-it-was" song
"Pop-some-fucking-champagne-in-the-tub" song
Nigga, "just-because" song
Damn

[Chorus]
What's the move? Can I tell the truth?
If I was doing this for you then I'd have nothing left to prove
Nah, this for me though
I'm just tryna stay alive and take care of my people
And they don't have no award for that
Trophies, trophies
And they don't have no award for that
Shit don't come with trophies, ain't no envelopes to open
I just do it cause I'm 'sposed to, nigga

[Intro]
Sho' 'nuff, shorty!
What'd he do? Yeah!
Ooooohhh!
Sho' 'nuff, pimping
Oh boy, uh

[Verse 1]
What y'all know about a supermodel?
Fresh out of Elle magazine
Buy her own bottles
Look, pimp juice, I need me one
Bad than a mother (Oh, na)
I hear you saying (I need a bad girl, oh)
Let me hear you (if you're a bad girl, oh)
Players, when you see me
Act like you know me
I keep a dollar worth of dimes
You know pimping ain't easy
For all my chicks in the club
Who knows how to cut a rug
(If you're a bad girl
Get at me, bad girl)

[Chorus]
Ooh, work me, baby
Shaking it the way I like
I'm ready to be bad
I need a bad girl (say yeah)
Get at me, bad girl
What sexy lady's
Coming home with me tonight?
I'm ready to be bad
I need a bad girl (super bad, baby)
Get at me, bad girl

[Verse 2]
Now, I've seen a lot of broads
All on one to call
Everyone looked the same
But take a look at my dame (my dame)
For sure, she take that Hypnotic or Alizé
There ain't much more I can say
But I need a (I need a bad girl)
Bad girl, yeah (if you're a bad girl)
Got one thou' on the bar, now
Chick need a drink on the floor, now
Look at them bad girls moving it
Making faces while they doing it

So close, I'm smelling like your perfume
If you're a bad girl

[Chorus]
Ooh, work me, baby
Shaking it the way I like
I'm ready to be bad
I need a bad girl (say yeah)
Get at me, bad girl

[Post-Chorus]
I'ma get me one of them, get me one of them
Get me one of them, get me one of them
Get me one of them, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Get at me, bad girl
I'ma get me one of them, get me one of them
Get me one of them, get me one of them (maybe two or three)
Get me one of them, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh (that's cool with me, shorty)
Get at me, bad girl (I need a bad girl)

[Bridge]
If you want to party
I got what you're looking for
Come see me in the V.I.P. (for bad company)
It's very necessary
To be that kind of girl for me
If you are, then, baby girl, let's leave

[Chorus]
Ooh, work me, baby
Shaking it the way I like
I'm ready to be bad
I need a bad girl (say yeah)
Get at me, bad girl
What sexy lady's
Coming home with me tonight?

[Outro]

Get at me, bad girl (get at me, bad girls)
I'ma get me one of them (around the world)
Get me one of them

Get me one of them (if you're out there)
Get me one of them (I wanna see you)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh (if you hear me)
Get at me, bad girl
I'll make you a deal, like any other candidate
We'll pretend we're walking home 'cause your future's at stake
My set is amazing, it even smells like a street
There's a bar at the end where I can meet you and your friend
Someone scrawled on the walls "I smell the blood of Les Tricoteuses"
Who wrote up scandals in other bars

I'm having so much fun with the poisonous people
Spreading rumours and lies and stories they made up
Some make you sing and some make you scream
One makes you wish that you'd never been seen
But there's a shop on the corner that's selling papier-mâché
Making bullet-proof faces; Charlie Manson, Cassius Clay
If you want it, boys, get it here, thing

So you scream out of line:
"I want you! I need you! Anyone out there? Any time?"
Tres butch little number whines "Hey dirty, I want you
When it's good, it's really good, and when it's bad I go to pieces"
If you want it, boys, get it here, thing
Well, on the street where you live
I could not hold up my head
For I gave all I have in another bed
On another floor, in the back of a car
In the cellar of a church with the door ajar
Well, I guess we must be looking for a different kind
But we can't stop trying 'til we break up our minds
'Til the sun drips blood on the seedy young knights
Who press you on the ground while shaking in fright
I guess we could cruise down one more time
With you by my side, it should be fine
We'll buy some drugs and watch a band
Then jump in the river holding hands
If you want it, boys, get it here, thing
For hope, boys, is a cheap thing, cheap thing

Is it nice in your snow storm, freezing your brain?
Do you think that your face looks the same?
Then let it be, it's all I ever wanted
It's a street with a deal and a taste
It's got claws, it's got me, it's got you

[Chorus]
See, the cement has never meant so much
My hot head cools to the stone cold touch
I look to settle my seed with the dust
Brain, leave me be, can't you see that these eyes are shut?

Enter my bed through that window
I hit zero
As guiltless loveless sins flow
Through me, you threw me
I descend smoothly
My concrete bed beckons
Can you hear me?

I was born in seconds
Do you fear the
Way you steer me
Towards the ground?
No, no, no I was never scared
Pain, had made my vision impaired
But now I'm free of care
See, life isn't fair, then at least death's there
To hold both hands
And stroll through lands
And as it stands
The empty vessel of a man
Can't be moved
It's not the cracks or the grooves
But the pavement soothes
The pavement was soothing
My body wasn't moving

Brain was buried deep beneath the ground
Fears would drown
The pavement is soothing
My body wasn't moving
Pain was buried deep beneath the ground
As fears would drown

[Chorus]
See, the cement has never meant so much
My hot head cools to the stone cold touch
I look to settle my seed with the dust
Brain, leave me be, can't you see that these eyes are shut?

[Intro]
I'm on fire but what can I do
I'm singing in the choir but I'm lookin' at you
I'll be outside pick me up after school
Baby blue, baby blue

[Verse 1]
Pour me up a bit of that liquid courage
Lookin so good, like an Axl Rose
Cuttin' school listenin' to techno music
Will we ever do right, God knows
Me and Claudeen at the 7-Eleven
Smokin' in the back, in our mini skirts
Take us back to class, so we look like heaven
You say I'm so fine that it hurts

[Chorus]
I'm on fire but what can I do?
I'm singing in the choir but I'm lookin' at you
I'll be outside pick me up after school
In your Thunderbird, baby blue
Thunderbird, baby blue
Baby blue

[Verse 2]
Baby if you want to join our entourage
Paint your face on it here we go
Platinum, keepin' 'em so dangerous
Keeping it cool yeah, God knows
Ridin' around town blue and leather
Walking them streets like the queen of hearts
Laughing at nothin' we’re alone together
Where your night ends, ours starts

[Chorus]
I'm on fire but what can I do?
I'm singing in the choir but I'm lookin' at you
I'll be outside pick me up after school, baby blue
Baby blue

[Bridge]
Will you or wouldn’t you do anything to have me?
Will you or won't you do anything to love me?
Cause I'm a bad girl and I got a good plan
Bank across the street, you're a dangerous man
They ask you who's sweet, you tell them I am, baby blue, baby blue

[Chorus]
I'm on fire but what can I do?
I'm singing in the choir but I'm lookin' at you
I'll be outside pick me up after school
In your Thunderbird, baby blue
Thunderbird, baby blue
Baby blue

[Verse 1]
The dance floor's a temptress
Can't make out what your saying
But you rub me the right way
With your child-like persuasion

[Pre-Chorus]
I got my hands in my pockets
And I'm crossing my fingers
She'll find I'm a simple stone
Washed up and so slow
I'd take one in the temple
I'd take one for you

[Chorus]
I'd take one in the temple
I'd take one for you
I'd take one in the temple
I'd take one for you

[Verse 2]
I feel all amiss now
I'm tossed in the scatter
And your eyes keep on shifting
To the boys that don't matter

[Pre-Chorus]
I've got my hands in my pockets
I'm still crossing my fingers
I'd take one in the temple
I'd take one for you

[Chorus]
I'd take one in the temple
I'd take one for you
I'd take one in the temple
I'd take one for you

[Pre-Chorus]
I've got my hands in my pockets
And I'm crossing my fingers
I just want to be noticed
I just want to be noticed

[Chorus]
I'd take one in the temple
I'd take one for you
I'd take one in the temple
I'd take one for you
I'd take one in the temple
I'd take one for you
I'd take one in the temple
I'd take one for you

[Verse 1]
Bite your tongue
Don't make a scene, dear
Everybody's been here least once before
We've been here more

Your heart breaks
Rolls down the window
I've seen it all go, come back around
And I've heard the sound

[Chorus]
The tip of your tongue
The top of your lungs is doing my head in
I say, "Love, don't mean nothing
Unless there's something worth fighting for."
It's a beautiful war

[Verse 2]
When I hold
The warmth of your body
There is nobody that I'd rather hold
Shattered and cold

[Chorus]
The tip of your tongue
The top of your lungs is making me crazy
I say, "Love, don't mean nothing
Unless there's something worth fighting for."
It's a beautiful war

I say, "Love, love – it don't mean nothing
Unless there's something worth fighting for."
It's a beautiful war

It's a beautiful war
It's a beautiful war

I say, "Love, love..."
I say, "Love, don't mean nothing
Unless there's something worth fighting for."

I say, "Love, don't mean nothing
Unless there's something worth fighting for."

[Outro]
It's a beautiful war
It's a beautiful war
It's a beautiful war
It's a beautiful war

[Verse 1]
I was running through the desert
I was looking for drugs
And I was searching for a woman
Who was willing to love
So I could take her like a woman
Yeah take her like a woman
I was looking for a bad girl
Looking for a bad boy
Someone who could take all the night away
Oh baby I could shake it like a woman
Yeah shake it like a woman
I got the eyes on me of a jealous man
And if you're looking to run
Well then you've already ran
I break down like a woman
I break down like a woman

[Chorus]
I go back to Rock City
That's where she saw me
Everybody's seen her
Everyone believes me

[Verse 2]
I've been several miles and plenty more
And I found myself face-first on the floor
Searching for something
But never finding something
And I don't know where I belong
I'm just trying to get myself back home
And get a little work
Yeah find my little woman

[Chorus]
And I go back to Rock City
That's where she saw me
Everybody's seen her
Everyone believes me

[Bridge]
Oh my my, oh my my, oh my my
I need to find something
I'm searching for something

[Chorus]
I go back to Rock City
That's where she saw me
Everybody's seen her
Everyone believes me
I go back to Rock City
That's where she saw me
Everybody's seen her
Everyone believes me
Whoap
I tell you now that I don't understand
Why everybody gives a big hi-damn
Oh where I'm going to
Don't mean a thing to you

I see you sitting in your masquerade
I'd love to pour you some of my lemonade
And get it off alright
We're caught in an early night

I know you hate me so, but I ain't gonna go
I'm staying here all right

I am your family tree
I know your A-Z
This is a secret proposition lay your hands on me
Nothing to talk about, darlin', it's all make believe

I see your hands are shaking but my heart is breaking me down

Its a pretty day and I'm gonna get alright
I lost my head and you ain't nowhere in sight
I see you got it all wrong
I got no calls on my phone
I just keep holding out, until I find a doubt
That you ain't coming home

I am your family tree
I know your A-Z
This is a secret proposition lay your hands on me
Not gonna talk about darlin', its so neighbourly

I see your hands are shaking but my heart is breaking me down

I am your family tree
I know your A-Z
This is a secret proposition lay your hands on me
Not gonna talk about darlin', its so neighbourly
Picking up the pieces in the world I know
With one in the fire and one in the snow
It's a comeback story of a lifetime
A comeback story of a lifetime
I bent on believing everything is alright
I break with the day and I've been with the night
It's a comeback story of a lifetime
A comeback story of a lifetime

I walk a mile in your shoes
And now I'm a mile away
And I've got your shoes

The brighter the lights they're burning me out
Everyone says it's a lovely sound
I don't know where they're leading me
Trying my best hoping that you'll see

I walk a mile in your shoes
And now I'm a mile away
And I've got your
I walk a mile in your shoes
And now I'm a mile away
And I've got your shoes

You'll rue the day when you understand
I did my best to be an honest man
Race isn't over to the finish line
It's a comeback story of a lifetime

I walk a mile in your shoes
And now I'm a mile away
And I've got your shoes
Now I'm a mile away
And I've got your shoes
Now I'm a mile away
Tonight, somebodies lover
Is gonna pay for a sin
It's coming out, it's coming out
I don't know, just what is leading me
Or if time is on my side
It's coming out, it's coming out

I don't know why I keep acting this way
Everybody knows it's strange and
It's something along the way
It's something along the way

When I see, lights on Broadway
I know it's gonna be a long night
It's coming out, It's coming out

I don't know why I keep acting this way
Everybody knows it's strange and
It's something along the way
It's something along the way
A war in my head, I can feel it all
The neon lights my way
There's something along the way
There's something along the way

Tonight, I'm gonna leave my body
Tonight, I'm gonna leave my body
Tonight, somebody's lover is gonna pay for his sin
It's coming out, It's coming out

I don't know why I keep acting this way
Everybody knows it's strange
And it's something along the way
Something along the way

A war in my head, I can feel it all
The neon lights my way
There's something along the way
There's something along the way

Tonight, I'm gonna leave my body
Tonight, I'm gonna leave my body

[Verse 1]
Rosé wine and a skinny cigarette
Locks fall down your neck
I saw you right before your eyes caught mine
Better than the rest

[Chorus]
I can feel it coming back again
I got a feeling coming back again
And you got me on the ropes
Yeah, you got me on the ropes again
And I can feel it coming back again
Oh, I can feel it coming back again, oh

[Verse 2]
Careless hands and grimace hides a smile
Face of closing time
I'm not much for talking
Until I'm pushed aside
Then I speak just fine

[Chorus]
And I can feel it coming back again
I got a feeling coming back again
And now you got me on the ropes
Yeah, you got me on the ropes again
And I can feel it coming back again
Oh, I can feel it coming back again, oh

[Outro]
I can feel it coming back again, oh
Oh, I can feel it coming back, oh
And I can feel it coming back again, oh
Oh, I can feel it coming back again, oh
I can feel it coming back, oh
Oh, I can feel it coming back again, oh

[Verse 1]
There's this boy I know he's afraid of the ocean
Never quite found love but he drank the love potion
I'll be on the chain smoking in the basement
Shattered like the windows

[Chorus]
All my life I was born to lead
Worry not just leave me be
I'll abide til the end
And I'll take it on the chin for you my friend

[Verse 2]
Parked my bag of bones back of the station
He said make yourself at home so I started day drinking
Said I believe in time after 7, 8 or 9
You'll fall yourself to pieces

[Chorus x2]

[Outro]
I'll take it on the chin for you my friend

[Verse 1]
Rise and shine
Get on your way
By the look in your eyes there's nothing to say
I got it all
In my hands
And I know that you know just where I stand
Where I stand

[Verse 2]
One more thing
Before you go
Pick it up and then I'll hit it on down the road
I got no time
For playing games
I'm in and I'm out and it's always the same
It's always the same

[Chorus]
Ooh, I strut like a cock
And Jack don't rock
It's all coming back to me
Oh, what a shame
If it's all the same
I'll get my coat and leave
No way you're going to work
No way you're going to work
No way you're going to work on me
I said it before
I'll open the door
Why is that so hard to believe?

[Verse 3]
Pick that guitar
Up in the air
Cut loose and then let down that hair
I know that you were born to shine
You gotta shine before you blow 'em away
You blow 'em away

[Chorus]
Ooh, I strut like a cock
And Jack don't rock
It's all coming back to me
Oh, what a shame
If it's all the same
I'll get my coat and leave
No way you're going to work
No way you're going to work
No way you're going to work on me
I said it before
I'll open the door
Why is that so hard to believe?

[Bridge]
Get on your way
Get on your way
Get on your way
Get on your way

[Outro]
I strut like a cock
And Jack don't rock
Get on your way
Oh, what a shame
If this is all the same
Get on your way
No way you're going to work
No way you're going to work
Get on your way
I told you before
I open the door
Get on your way
Get on your way
Take it back I never meant it
Never thought that it would come to pass
Baby know it's not forgotten
Baby know that this is gonna last

By large I had it coming
I recall the tremble in your eye
I just want to make it better
I just want to make it right

Tripping on the last mile home
Tripping on the last mile home
People are always better
When we're all together
I'm tripping on the last mile home

Tell me that the bar is drinking
And the lies are swinging in the smoke
I'm a fool for conversation
And I've got nowhere to go
Tripping on the last mile home
I'm tripping on the last mile home
Things are always better
When we're all together
I'm tripping on the last mile home

Tripping on the last mile home
Tripping on the last mile home
Things are always better
When we're all together
I'm tripping on the last mile home

Tripping on the last mile home
Tripping on the last mile home
Things are always better
When we're all together
I'm tripping on the last mile home

I'm tripping on the last mile home
Tripping on the last mile home
Things are always better
When we're all together
I'm tripping on the last mile home

Maybe I'm the one who's broken
Maybe I'm the breaker of the heart
Been so low since we've spoken
It's been lonely, baby it's been hard

[Verse: Mac Miller]
Yeah
Been waitin' all day for ya, honey
Stand up when you're talkin' to me
Been drinkin' whiskey, I don't know what I'm sayin'
But goddamn, I feel free
And I
Feel like I'm out my mind
I'm high
Don't pay attention to downsides
As these days go by, go by
While we praise, no lie, there's no lies
Never would have thought that life would end up like this
Designer clothes, seein' things the naked eye might miss, yeah
The mind, it wanders, I find that it's harder
To realize what the fuck it is we do on this earth, it's a curse

[Chorus: Mac Miller]
Excuse me, mister, can I get some info?
You look pretty wise and I'm just an ignorant mind
I heard that ignorance is bliss
So it is what it is
Excuse me, mister, can I get some info?
You look pretty wise and I'm just an ignorant mind
But ignorance is bliss
It is what it is

[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
Said you wouldn't be home late tonight
I gave up waiting at seventeen past midnight
Now my only company's a half full glass of wine

[Pre-Chorus]
Leave me no choice but to plot my revenge
Leave me no choice but to plot my revenge

[Chorus]
It's been so long
Since I've held your hand
You don't know how hard it can be

[Verse 2]
Thank God that I've been blessed with a patient mind
Cause' what I want to happen won't happen in a very long time
Now my only company's a half full glass of wine

[Pre-Chorus]
Leave me no choice but to plot my revenge
Leave me no choice but to plot my revenge
Leave me no choice but to plot my revenge

[Chorus]
It's been so long
Since I've held your hand
You don't know how hard it can be
You don't know how hard it can be

And that make me, wanna load up the choppers go crazy
And doors slide on every niggas that hatin' me
And stunt on every single bitch that ever played me back then
You don't wanna hear the Mac-10
No one hear the stories what you had then
Reason why I bought the Bentley and the Aston
To shit on niggas every time a nigga back in

[Hook]
And I ain't never care what a nigga had to say about me
And I ain't never care what a bitch had to say about me
It just make me, wanna shit on ya'll niggas
It just make me, wanna shit on ya'll bitches straight up

[Verse 2]
And it made me, wanna shit on ya'll niggas
Cause lately, I ain't been feelin' ya'll niggas
Try and play me, I drop a brick on ya'll niggas
And make 'em go crazy, on every single one of ya'll niggas straight up
And all these hoes wanna fuck with a nigga like me
But when I was locked down ain't none of these hoes write me
That's why I don't chase bitches cause the money only thing excite me
And I don't fuck with new niggas all day one niggas beside me
We got thirties, ridin' round tryna do a nigga dirty
Try and burn me, headshot bye bye for a birdie
And I ain't worried, about none of ya'll niggas tryna hurt me
I got all these killers on stand-by
And they kill any nigga tryna murk me word up

[Hook]
And I ain't never care what a nigga had to say about me
And I ain't never care what a bitch had to say about me
It just make me, wanna shit on ya'll niggas
It just make me, wanna shit on ya'll bitches straight up

[Verse 3]
We don't never hate we ain't rattin' on nobody
When I touch twenty mill I'm a go and get that Gatti'
It just make me, wanna stack this paper
It just make me, wanna wack these haters straight up
And I be in the city going hard like a nigga own that
And you be fucking with the nigga that be fucking with the niggas code rats
I can't control my dogs with them 30's they don't never hold back
Ask about me in my city they tell you that we really on that
I got the baddest bitch
I got the fliest whips
And god bless me I never ever gettin' tired of this
I ain't worried 'bout nothing
I ain't worried 'bout nothing
Cause if I was worried bout somethin'
All ya'll niggas gettin' murdered bout' somethin' straight up

[Hook]
And I ain't never care what a nigga had to say about me
And I ain't never care what a bitch had to say about me
It just make me, wanna shit on ya'll niggas
It just make me, wanna shit on ya'll bitches straight up

[Verse 1]
My lover's got humor
She's the giggle at a funeral
Knows everybody's disapproval
I should've worshipped her sooner
If the heavens ever did speak
She's the last true mouthpiece
Every Sunday's getting more bleak
A fresh poison each week
"We were born sick"
You heard them say it
My church offers no absolutes
She tells me "Worship in the bedroom"
The only Heaven I'll be sent to
Is when I'm alone with you
I was born sick, but I love it
Command me to be well

[Pre-Chorus]
Aaa, Amen, Amen, Amen

[Chorus]
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life

[Verse 2]
If I'm a pagan of the good times
My lover's the sunlight
To keep the goddess on my side
She demands a sacrifice
Drain the whole sea
Get something shiny
Something meaty for the main course
That's a fine looking high horse
What you got in the stable?
We've a lot of starving faithful
That looks tasty
That looks plenty
This is hungry work

[Chorus]
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me my deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me my deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life

[Bridge]
No masters or kings when the ritual begins
There is no sweeter innocence than our gentle sin
In the madness and soil of that sad earthly scene
Only then I am human
Only then I am clean

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, oh Amen, Amen, Amen

[Chorus]
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life

[Verse 1]
You're whiskey-wasted and beautiful dancing through the fire
You're such a vision to see
I used to think that the power of love was just a song
But now it's got hold of me

[Pre-Chorus]
S.O.S, is it me, or is this is dangerous?
Kill me with your touch
You're smoking through my blood
R.I.P, set me free, yeah, this is dangerous
I can't get enough

[Chorus]
When I fall into your super love
Yeah, my heart never wants it to stop, please save me
'Cause I never seem to get enough
You're the bullet and you're making me drop, please save me
So give me all of your super love
'Cause my body is a ghost for you, I'm waiting
Die here, in your arms, falling in love with you

[Verse 2]
Feels like I'm tripping, I'm falling hard from the highest heights
When I crash, where will you be?
I think your hair looks much better pushed over to one side
How do you feel about me?

[Pre-Chorus]
S.O.S, this is real, and this is dangerous
You're my favorite drug, I'll smoke you in the club
R.I.P., what a dream, you're so damn dangerous
I can't get enough

[Chorus]
When I fall into your super love
Yeah, my heart never wants it to stop, please save me
'Cause I never seem to get enough
You're the bullet and you're making me drop, please save me
So give me all of your super love
'Cause my body is a ghost for you, I'm waiting
Die here, in your arms, falling in love with you

[Bridge]
When I fall into your super love
'Cause I never seem to get enough
So give me all of your super love
I'm waiting
Die here, in your arms, falling in love with you

[Chorus]
When I fall into your super love
Yeah, my heart never wants it to stop, please save me
'Cause I never seem to get enough
You're the bullet and you're making me drop, please save me
So give me all of your super love
'Cause my body is a ghost for you, I'm waiting
Die here, in your arms, falling in love with you

[Outro]
When I fall into your super love
Yeah, my heart never wants it to stop, please save me
'Cause I never seem to get enough
You're the bullet and you're making me drop, please save me
So give me all of your super love
'Cause my body is a ghost for you, I'm waiting
Die here, in your arms, falling in love with you
Oh yeah

[Verse 1]
Baby girl, where you at?
Got no strings, got men attached
Can't stop their feenin' for long, no (ohh, no)
You makin' dogs wanna beg
Breakin' them off your fancy legs
But they make you feel right at home now

[Hook 1]
See, all these illusions just take us too long
And I want you bad
Because you walk pretty
Because you talk pretty
Because you make me sick
And I'm not leavin', 'til you're leavin'

Oh, I swear there's something when she's pumpin'
Askin' for a raise
Well, does she want me to carry her home now?
So, does she want me to buy her things?
On my house, on my job, on my loot, my shoes, my shirt
My crew, my mind, my father's last name?

[Chorus]
When I get you alone
When I get you, you'll know, baby
When I get you alone
When I get you alone now
(It's all mine)

Come on (oh yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2]
Baby girl, you the shit
That makes you my equivalent
Well, you can keep your toys in the drawer tonight (alright)
All my dawgs talkin' fast
"Ain't you got some photographs?"
Cause you shook that room like a star, now (Yes, you did, oh)

[Hook 2]
All these intrusions just take us too long
And I want you so bad
Because you walk city
Because you talk city
Cause you make me sick
And I'm not leavin', 'til you're leavin'

So I pray to something she ain't bluffin'
Rubbin' up on me now
Well, does she want me to make a vow? (Check it)
Well, does she want me to make it now?
On my house, on my job, on my loot, shoes, my voice
My crew, my mind, my father's last name?

[Chorus]
When I get you alone
When I get you, you'll know, baby
When I get you alone
When I get you alone now
(It's all mine)

Oh no, get you alone baby
Oh oh oh oh, thatta girl! You get some

[Hook 3]
All these intrusions just take us too long
And I want you so bad
Because you walk pretty
Because you talk pretty
Cause you make me sick
And I'm not leavin', 'til you're leavin'

But I pray to something when she's pumpin'
Rubbin' up on me now
Want me to break it down? (Check it)
Well, did you want me to make it now?
On my house, on my job, on my loot, shoes, my voice
My crew, my mind, my father's last name?

[Chorus]
When I get you alone
When I get you, you'll know, girl
When I get you alone
When I get you alone now
(It's all mine)
I get you alone
When I get you alone
I get you alone
When I get you alone
(It's all mine)

Yeah

[Verse 1]
You know I tried so hard
My feelings just can’t discard
The way in which I fell into
Your heart was never what I once knew
Lately my skull has kept
Dividing lines deep set and paved
Two paths too wander through to depart
And sever desires to pursue

[Chorus]
And the soul chokes
To cause the tide
To enforce divide
This whole ocean has morphed in time
I’ll escort her mind to solve my crimes
Reach slow motion to con the mind

[Verse 2]
See here I trace my steps
To where my senses left
And rain had turn my sense to mush
This slowly seeping straight through the crust
Now let these stains of gunk slip down
To where my head once sunk and drowned
Just await for a while to see
My body has merged to the deep cruel sea

[Chorus]
But my soul floats
Adrift thoughtless minds, distorted lines
The soul is broken down, borderlines
To cause the tide, to enforce divide
This whole ocean has morphed in time
I’ll escort her mind to solve my crimes
Reach slow motion and con the mind

[Outro]
So scorn divine and mourn the pride
The cold has spoken and drawn the line

[Verse 1]
Well see I never even stretched her faith
This storm would not allow it
As you observe it falls out of place
The time was born around it
I know it calls when you’re bare
Stripped from the mould
Well I stare sometimes and it tears away
With your soul
You may be foreign here, but I was foreign there
By suffering here in sovereign fear
You may be foreign here, but I was foreign there
But suffering here

[Chorus]
Isolated heritage
This path was never relative
I watch the way you meddle with
Exhibiting my pride

[Verse 2]
Now watch me burn alive as your thoughts deprive
All I know that’s inside
See I was torn by a skunks hand
And now they watch me crawl
See I was born by a young man
And now I’ve lost it all

[Chorus]
Isolated heritage
This path was never relative
I watch the way you meddle with
Exhibiting my pride
Isolated heritage
This path was never relative
I watch the way you meddle with
Exhibiting my pride

[Verse 1]
I endure stroking my head on the cranes
Well now they alone are all just one in the same
Demean and try to walk about
Among stolen signs that talk about
A passion that lies, well easy now
Maybe I was found
Just bathed in doubt

[Verse 2]
I’ll scan a different coast
Where my blame can lay and roast
In the heat of my own treason
Just as another pavement toasts
I remain aware of those
When consumed to paths of reason
Now do you stew your lovers croak to the glue of your own throat?
When the scenery starts peeling
And the scenery starts peeling
This is the final line I wrote
And applying the final coat
That would bring down the ceiling

[Outro]
This is the final line I wrote
And applying the final coat
That would bring down the ceiling
This is the final line I wrote
And applying the final coat
That would bring down the ceiling
This is the final line I wrote
And applying the final coat
That would bring down the ceiling
This is the final line I wrote
When applying a final coat
That would bring down the walls
Well easy now, easy now
Maybe I was found
Just bathed in doubt

[Verse 1]
Bittersweet thing, could this be a dream
Or just the same nightmare that keeps me awake?
Feel it in my brain, tall shot of pain
Pour a little out now for the love that we've made

[Pre-Chorus]
I feel it the morning, you're still here in the morning
I see you, but you're gone, telephone the doctor, I'm not okay
The bottom of the bottle to fill this empty heart up
A thousand proof don't change the truth, I dive in, but I can't

[Chorus]
I can't drink you away
I've tried Jack, I've tried Jim, I’ve tried all of their friends
But I can't drink you away
All of these rocks, I can't swim outta this skin, I'm livin' in

[Post-Chorus]
Say, now tell me baby, don't they make a medicine for heartbreak?
Tell me baby, now don't they make a medicine for heartbreak?

[Verse 2]
Got that poundin' on my brain, so I drowned it away
When the sun comes up tomorrow, you can find me doin' the same
'Cause I just can't forget, the way we turned out this bad
And now the only thing that sleeps here is a ghost of you instead

[Pre-Chorus]
I feel it the morning, you're still here in the morning
I see you, but you're gone, telephone the doctor, I'm not okay
The bottom of the bottle to fill this empty heart up
A thousand proof don't change the truth, I dive in, but I can't

[Chorus]
I can't drink you away
I've tried Jack, I've tried Jim, I’ve tried all of their friends
But I can't drink you away
All of these rocks, I can't swim outta this skin, I'm livin' in

[Post-Chorus]
Say, now tell me baby, don't they make a medicine for heartbreak?
Tell me baby, now don't they make a medicine for heartbreak?

[Bridge]
Break it down
I can't drink you
No, I can't drink you away, away
I can't drink you
I can't drink you away, away
I can't drink you
I can't drink you away, away
I can't drink you
No, I can't drink you away

[Chorus]
I can't drink you away
I've tried Jack, I've tried Jim, I’ve tried all of their friends
But I can't drink you away
All of these rocks, I can't swim outta this skin, I'm livin' in

[Post-Chorus]
Say, so tell me baby, don't they make a medicine for heartbreak?
Tell me baby, oh yeah, now don't they make a medicine for heartbreak?
Oh yeah, tell me baby, don't they make a medicine for my heartbreak?
Tell me baby, now don't they make a medicine for my heartbreak?

[Chorus]
I can't drink you away
I've tried Jack, I've tried Jim, I’ve tried all of their friends
But I can't drink you away
All of these rocks, I can't swim outta this skin, I'm livin' in
Why can’t I see you
Stuck in black and white
You’re in technicolor brightness
Why can’t I see you
I’ve been struck by blindness

I close my eyes cause you’ve been gone
Such a long time, I fantasize
You close so long fantasy
Began to see, it altered my mind
Am I crazy
When I open my eyes
The world was gone
Reached out when I heard you call my name
But all I felt was cold

Tell me why can’t I see you
I’m stuck in black and white
You’re in technicolor brightness
Why can’t I see you
I’ve been struck by blindness
If I close my eyes and concentrate
You illuminate your brightest slide
And I let you go the worst mistake
It’s clear as day
But I can’t wrap my mind around it baby
And when I open my eyes
The world is gone, long gone, long gone
Reached out when I heard you call my name
But all I felt was cold

Tell me why can’t I see you
I’m stuck in black and white
You’re in technicolor brightness
Why can’t I see you
I’ve been struck by blindness

Tell me why can’t I see you
It’s like I’m stuck in black and white
And you’re in technicolor brightness
Why can’t I see you
I’ve been struck by blindness

Why can’t I see you
In black and white
You’re in technicolor brightness
Why can’t I see you
I’ve been struck by blindness

[Verse 1]
Who’s more desperate?
You’re on your knees boo
But when you fuck up
I don’t leave you, uh, I can’t leave you, yeah
Guess you’re permanent
Can’t be removed
Each time my heart breaks
It’s like a new tattoo, don’t need a new tattoo, woah

[Pre-Chorus]
One touch always makes me
Too hard to escape
Three strikes, I’m still yours
What am I waiting for?

[Chorus]
I’m running out of room
Or your tattoos
How can I get over you, over you
When you're all over me?
So don’t tell me it’s cool
That I’m tattooed
How can
