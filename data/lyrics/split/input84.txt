[Chorus: Trey Songz]
If it isn't love, why I keep coming back?
I keep coming back, back home
And if it isn't love, why I keep coming back?
I keep coming back, back home

[Verse 2: Summer Walker]
Why are you so hard to leave?
Why are you so hard to believe?
Can't you make it easy for me?
I complicate in my brain
Swear to God you make me go insane
You love me then you make me feel a way
Or how you bring me happiness and pain
You get on my last damn nerves
Then I say that I'm done
Then I miss you in the middle of the club
By the end of the night I'm calling you drunk
So if this isn't love

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
If it isn't love (Tell me), why I keep coming back?
I keep coming back (Coming back), back home (Ooh, if it isn't love)
And if it isn't love (Why), why I keep coming back?
I keep coming back, back home (Oh)

[Verse 3: Trey Songz]
I should've seen it from the get go
Said if you love it you should let go
Always switch up like the season
Right back every time we say we're leaving (Uh)
I guess it's never really over
Just get them bags up out the trunk
Baby, I just need to hold ya
Unless this is what you want

[Pre-Chorus: Trey Songz]
Oh, I could cuss you out, hit my side bitch
You think she flewed out, I deny it
Nothing in my way, I decided
No, no

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
If it isn't love (If it isn't love), why do I keep coming back? (Keep coming back)
I keep coming back, back home (Oh-oh-oh)
And if it isn't love, why I keep coming back?
I keep coming back (Keep coming back), back home
Keep coming back home

[Verse 1]
Long black tulips, born in your blue tints
Lemongrass eyelids, smoke in your slick lips
Chocolate chapstick, backbeat strat flips
Swimming pool spaceships, light through the wave tips

[Pre-Chorus]
Hot sugar in the afternoon
I wish that we could be real too
Hot sugar in the afternoon
I wish that we could be real too

[Chorus]
So cool, but we don't talk
Hotels and alcohol
Pool paintings on the wall
Hot rubber on the tar
I don't wanna be around you
Just wanna be like you
I don't wanna be around you
Just wanna be like...

[Verse 2]
Bath time cool whip
Watermelon juice kiss
Esprit gold rims
Skin so sun-licked
Santal freshness
Hologram glasses
Put it on plastic
You never been desperate

[Pre-Chorus]
Hot sugar in the afternoon
I wish that we could be real too
Hot sugar in the afternoon
I wish that we could be real too

[Chorus]
So cool, but we don't talk
Hotels and alcohol
Pool paintings on the wall
Hot rubber on the tar
I don't wanna be around you
Just wanna be like you
I don't wanna be around you
Just wanna be like you

[Break]
Just wanna be like you
Just wanna be like you
Just wanna be like you

[Chorus]
So cool, but we don't talk
Hotels and alcohol
Pool paintings on the wall
Hot rubber on the tar
I don't wanna be around you
Just wanna be like you
I don't wanna be around you
Just wanna be like you

[Outro]
So cool
So cool
So cool

[Verse 1]
Melon and the coconut are sittin' on the floor
Coco said to Melly, "I can't do this anymore
Everything we're doin' just feels fuckin' cold
Everything we're shootin', that's just fake B-roll
B-sides, killing time, filler, that's all
How did things happen when we were so close?
How did this all go so Pete Tong?
When it all started, I thought we would grow old
Living in the city with a baby and a dog
Doing school runs in a four by four
I make pancakes and waffles
I could be a stay at home G.I. Joe"

[Interlude]

[Verse 2]
Melly said to Coco, "You can't do this anymore
One day, you'll see you're fuckin' wrong
Sometimes B-sides are the best songs
Sometimes killing time's very fruitful
I know I can't make you younger
I can't stop life movin' onwards
I can't hide you from life's horrors
I'm not makin' you like your father
Too much quinoa and online shopping
Off-White Air Force Ones in boxes
You're a fucking coconut, can't even put 'em on
Even if you could, you couldn't even pull 'em off"

[Chorus]
Drip, drop
Gimme what you got
Your talk is incredible
So, so, so unusual
You taste like surfing videos

[Verse 1]
I'm going to read your mind
Big dicks and big ol' titties on the sly
Say I got Aries eyes
Fuck no, I'm a bonafide Aquemini
Ooh, who are you hiding?
White Russians and dirty diamonds
You fake your shyness
I just wish that I could see through you

[Verse 2]
Cheap booze, Pepsi blue
You got bottles in from 2002
Hot glue, vape juice
Hit undo, how the hell are you so cool?

[Chorus]
Drip, drop
Gimme what you got
Your talk is incredible
So, so, so unusual
You taste like surfing videos

[Verse 3]
It's chemical warfare
Red lips and television eyewear
Raspberry soda hair
In the pool in a blow-up gummy bear

[Verse 4]
Fake youth, Scooby-Doo
Push Pops on the corner of the roof
Froot Loops, superfood
Chat shit but where's the real you?
Never seen The Price Is Right
I'm a liar, I've been on that shit since '99
You make me like a clown
Clap, clap, you're a clever-clever cookie now

[Refrain]
Waterfalls coming out your mouth
What the hell are we doing now?
Waterfalls tearing you apart
What the hell are we doing now?

[Intro]
Ooh

[Verse]
I break it, by God, your face
Awakened, two eyes, ballooning
Open sesame

[Pre-Chorus]
Super silence in the quiet, eye inside the storm
Water from your broken iris fell toward the floor
Everything waiting, shakin' as it drops
I tried for you and I, for too hard, for too long
Gave it all and everything for more time, but I lost

[Chorus]
Ooh, we're breakin' down
Whispers would deafen me now
You don't make a sound
Heartbreak was never so loud

[Break]
Ooh

[Chorus]
Ooh, I'm breakin' down
Whispers would deafen me now
You don't make a sound
Heartbreak was never so loud

[Bridge]
Two hearts foldin'
Pulling everything

[Chorus]
Ooh, I'm breakin' down
Whispers would deafen me now
You don't make a sound
Heartbreak was never so loud

[Outro]
Ooh, I'm breakin' down
Whispers would deafen me now
You don't make a sound
It's all so incredibly loud
It's all so incredibly loud

[Verse 1]
I see the bruise, I see the truth
I see what he been doin' to you
Blood on the shoes, what's his excuse?
He says he's doing some new kung fu
You always use his bullshit excuse
But I see what he been doin' to you

[Pre-Chorus]
Why'd you put up with that shit?
Why'd you go back for that kiss?
Maybe it tastes like him when you've got tears on your lips
Why'd you put up with that shit?
Why don't we pack and leave this?
Why do you smile when he cries?
Why do you cry when he wins?

[Chorus]
Fight for me
We can leave, I'm beggin', please
On my-on my knees, go to Hawaii
Fight for me, say, "We can leave," I'm beggin', please
On my-on my knees
Hawa-Hawaii

[Verse 2]
He got balloons, new flowers, too
Last one's dyin' in your bedroom
He squeezin' you, blame-blamin' you
Mama just usin' her red perfume
Domestic bliss
I know how bad you wanted it

[Pre-Chorus]
Why'd you put up with that shit?
Why'd you go back for that kiss?
Maybe it tastes like him when you've got tears on your lips
Why'd you put up with that shit?
Why don't we pack and leave this?
Why do you smile when he cries?
Why do you cry when he wins?

[Chorus]
Fight for me
We can leave, I'm beggin', please
On my-on my knees, go to Hawaii
Fight for me, say, "We can leave," I'm beggin', please
On my-on my knees
Hawa-Hawaii

[Bridge]
My God, I'll be right in, the trickle of lightnin'
I knew before I heard, I felt it in my skin
My God, I'll be right in, the trickle of lightnin'
I knew before I heard, I felt it in my skin

[Chorus]
Fight for me
We can leave, I'm beggin', please
On my-on my knees, go to Hawaii
Fight for me, say, "We can leave," I'm beggin', please
On my-on my knees
Hawa-Hawaii
You did that backwards, a little bit
Here, great, sweetheart, you're so-muah
(Time now?)
Wait a second
Here's my boy, alright, come on!

[Verse 1]
9:09
You gonna call it or am I?
One more time
This puppy love is out of line
One more slide
And then we're back to real life

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, and I'm falling now but it's so wrong
You talk like a man and taste like the sun
Ooh, and you lift your eyes up from the dust
I knew just then, I knew it was done

[Chorus]
I guess I want you more than I thought I did
Now that I know that part of you's at home with him
I guess I want you more than I thought I did
Now that I know that part of you's not part of this

[Verse 2]
Soft blue skies
Helium balloons float up away
Broad daylight
But we're sunflowers in the rain

[Verse 3]
My mama said they used to be white pyramids
They float above the sand, they're slowly sinking in
Are our foundations destined to keep crumbling
Just 'cause we started this with zero innocence?
I just can't build on something that begins like this
It's a blood diamond, flawless but for that one thing

[Bridge]
You just want backstreets, you don't want me
You just gonna hate it all the way
You just want backstreets, you don't want me
You just gonna hate it all the way

[Outro]
Hello, who is this? Hello?
Are you watching TV?
Say, "Bye-bye"
Bye-bye

[Chorus]
I can't even have the time for it
Had a mama, let a bride, fall
I got hunnids on my diamond
Add up all my, all my diamond

[Verse]
Yeah, ask my dad, I'll pull up in 

[?] seat
I don't own a Benz, okay well, I'm jumping out the bitch, ayy
Everybody know ayy, I'm in pussy why don't call her quit, ayy
I just stunt it all, oh baby, let me go to bitch

[?], call me I'm the shit
Got that Saint Laurent marble, shorty go and I'm the shit
Got a how to drop racks, a hunnid on my wrist
Got this how I even let you go

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't wanna stunt on you, don't make me
I don't wanna count no, please, don't make me
Don't wanna stunt on you, don't make me
Don't wanna do it, please don't make me, please don't make

[Chorus]
I can't even have the time for
Had a mama, let a bride, fall
I got hunnids on my diamond
Add up all my, all my diamond, yeah, yeah, yeah (Yeah)

[Instrumental Break]

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't wanna stunt on you, don't make me
I don't wanna count no, please, don't make me
Don't wanna stunt on you, don't make me
Don't wanna do it, please don't make me, please don't make

[Chorus]
I can't even have the time for
Had a mama, let a bride, fall
I got hunnids on my diamond
Add up all my, all my diamond, yeah, yeah (Yeah)

[Bridge]
Gon' let it pass on y'all, yeah
I gotta make sure it's on y'all, yeah
Don't say bands on y'all
I don't want to let down on y'all

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't wanna stunt on you, don't make me
I don't wanna count no, please, don't make me
Don't wanna stunt on you, don't make me
Don't wanna do it, please don't make me, please don't make

[Chorus]
I can't even have the time for
Had a mama, let a bride, fall
I got hunnids on my diamond
Add up all my, all my diamond

[Intro: Lil Wayne & Juelz Santana]
*Pfff...*
Now, this is what they've been waiting for
Yeah, yessir
Ya dig?

Weezy F!
Ayy!
Haha!
Ayy, Wayne
What up, man?
What you been working on, nigga?
Oh, you know

Oh, I'm ready to brush my shoulders off and drop my next album too, nigga
That's what it is!
But dig this
Hmm?
They wanna know what we been working on together
Yeah, yeah
That's that "I Can't Feel My Face Shit," they know that there
Yeah, you know
They know what it is
So if they ever thought the South and the North was gonna collide
That's what they thinking!
Guess what?We already did
Already
Go!

[Verse 1: Juelz Santana]
I'm feeling like a Black Republican, naw, I can't call it
More like a Black Democrat runnin' 'em out of office (Get out)
Young Barack-a Obama, I'm all for it
The Rock of Gibraltar has now fallen on you
I protect my land like a farmer
Pockets stay chubby like Toccara (Yup), huh
Or should I say fat like the Parkers
Tote big guns like I'm still playing Contra (Ha)
Y'all washed up like money that's laundered (Yeah)
Y'all funny, I'm bonkers
Honest, girls strapped to my dick like a harness
Rock star, I'm flyer than an ostrich (Ha)
And I cover east, west, north, south like a compass
I shall shine forever, never tarnish (Never)
Money buried behind my house like a garden (What?)
All green, my bank account's like a forest
I Can't Feel My Face is gettin' started (Yeah)
And Weezy is my accomplice (Ya dig?)
A black activist like Sonny Carson
Stripes of a sergeant, salute me
And chicks, I get 'em high, higher than turbulences
White Phantom, lookin' so Fergalicious (Haha)
I'm from the city of big drugs and murder victims
It's get rich, go to jail, or be a murder victim
Ayy! Now all y'all listen
If you can't take the heat, get out the kitchen

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
I feel like a Black Republican, tote the MAC in the public
AndAct so southern n' die for my brethren
Money, money-money, like Money Mackin' Publishing
One life to live, never ask for a mulligan
Streets cold but the heat make me feel covenant
Been had cake, you late like Ed Sullivan
Fly like an eagle, but no, I'm not Donovan
Boy, you better go eat some soup with your mama 'nem
And my mind is on another continent
I am real Cash Money, no counterfeit
I don't parking-lot pimp, I just politick
But I get all in her mouth like Polident
New Orleans representer to the inner
Come from the city where the glitter don't glimmer
The sun don't shine, and the guns don't sleep
Wake a nigga ass up like he got somewhere to be

[Verse 3: Juelz Santana]
I feel like a black Republican, drug money comin' in
I'm a volcano filled with lava 'bout to erupt again (Ehh)
I stay with the iron, don’t make me plug it in (Nope)
Stay outta rich kids' business, don’t be butting in (Ahh)
Stay with a chick that's ready to unbutton it
Forget a tongue, she put a lung on it (Ha), ha
My Listerine come out, she start guzzling (Gaaa)
I’m above you dudes, I’m hovering (Ffff)
"Juelz, why you ducking them?" Duckin' who? (Who?)
I’m in the hood like, “What it do?", comfortable
And believe me, it's nothing to...
Send my London boys to English-muffin you (Nope), huh
You poodles barking too much, they bringing muzzles through (Yeah)
You ain't gully, you gullible, man...
They need love, they need hugs
They need church! (Haha) Je-sus!
Could it be 'cause ('Cause) they them (Losers)
And we us (Winners), and we up
This is just a sample, yeah, a free drug (Yeah)
The shipment is in (Yep), we done re'd up
(But) I don’t trust dudes, like a prenup'
They cock-a-roaches, they gotta be bugged (Got to)
I’m balling for real, you gotta D up (Come on)
I don’t hear you boys, speak up (Up)
What are you guys saying?
I have the chauffeur hold the umbrella over my head
When it's not raining
Hahaha

[Outro: Lil Wayne & Juelz Santana]
Ya dig?
Ayy!
And we wanna let the world know
This is not a diss song either, people
Uh-uh, uh-uh
We don't diss them, we dismiss them
Ya dig? Haha
Recognize or step aside

Ya dig?
Hahaha
We let the music talk
Drought 3! Hahaha
And by the way

Assholes
DipSet for life
Cash Money
Cash Money, what up!
Young Money, Skull Gang

[Chorus: Drake]
First time in a long time
Hurtin' deeply inside
First time in a long time
Hurtin' deeply

[Verse 1: Drake, Chris Brown, Drake & Chris Brown]
Trust
Trust who?
Watchin' my back even when I'm in the booth
Oh, trust who?
Doin' my thing, but I'm down to come clean, not like you
I wanna make you feel the weight's off your shoulders too
I'll take it
Just tell me it can't be that crazy
And even if it is that crazy, baby
I'll take it
I want you, I know you're not an angel
Not you
Oh, just save it
Don't waste your time
'Cause I'm wavy and I'm sayin' things
That I don't mean, but I do mean
And I don't want you to miss me
'Cause there's no way that you're sorry
And you're crying and you're sayin' things
That I do believe, but I don't even
Want you to get in my mind
I'm supposed to be in your mind (Oh woah)
For the first time in a long time
For the first time in a long
For the first time in the longest time

[Chorus: Drake with Chris Brown]
First time in a long time
Hurtin' deeply inside
First time in a long time
Hurtin' deeply

[Bridge: Drake, Chris Brown, Chris Brown & Drake]
Yeah (Now, oh, baby)
Ayy
Hurtin' deeply inside
Trust
Trust
Trust
Trust who?

[Verse 2: Drake with Chris Brown]
Trust me and I can set you free
Left your man, came straight to me
You the real MVP, my love
Ride dirty like Pimp C
You a real ten-speed freak, shawty
You was everything a nigga need
You was everything to me, my love
Why you keep that little shit from me?
Left me down on bended knee
When I scooped you in the Maybach
The only time a nigga ever made you take a backseat
Why you do that little shit to me, shawty?
When you know that we was meant to be
Why'd you keep those things from me, my love? (Love)
I've given you enough time

[Chorus: Drake with Chris Brown]
Hurtin' deeply inside
Trust
Trust
Hurtin' deeply, deeply

[Outro: Drake]
Thought I knew the real, then they flipped
How many times did I ask about this, on God?
Why you let me find out like this, on God?
Houston, we got a problem, my dawg
All my niggas love you, got us all involved
Ain't no goin' back to how we started off
No, no, no, no

[Intro: Dennis Graham]
Hey, Instagram
This song I've been writing, oh, for a few months
I don't know, I, I started writing it about family
Just came up now, so
Anybody feel any way about it, I don't give a fuck
(Yeah, family)

[Verse 1: Drake]
Yeah
Yeah
Lost you to the game, I gotta hug that
I was here when you was asking where the love at
Dip your finger in the bag to get your buzz back
I was wishin' on a star when I was that
I've been fortunate enough to have it my way
I'm a fortune teller, listen to what I say
'Member when we used to park up in my driveway
I always told it how it was, I never shy away
This life is really something you get lost in
I know niggas that got famous and they bought friends
I had friends that only had half of they heart in
It's hard to accept now, and it was hard then
But I treated you like gold, I was all in
Spoiled rotten, they could smell you 'fore you walked in
Burnin' incense in your new apartment
But you got no sense when it come to
Lost you to the game, I gotta hold that
How you feelin' in your soul since you sold that?
I'll be better off without you, and we know that
You ain't lookin' at a nigga you could hold back
Like I'm tryna show the waves, this is no cap
You sold me up the river, but I rowed back
You put me on the road without a roadmap
I'm not tryna make no song, these are cold facts

[Interlude: Drake & Dennis Graham]
You got some liquor at the house?
Yeah
Go get a shot, let's do a shot together
I don't see it
Okay, hahaha

[Verse 2: Drake]
Ayy
Being here wasn't in the plans
I do it for the Grahams, not the 'Gram
I do it for the fam, but still fuckin' Uncle Sam
I tried to change for you, but that wasn't who I am
Even when being real is out of fashion
Niggas keep stealin' my style, now we out here matchin'
I did it by being myself with no dramatic acting
I couldn't sit around and wait, I had to have it happen
Lost you to the game, I gotta face that
Really think I lost you like a ways back
Always sayin' how a nigga never play fair
I took you up under my wing and you just stayed there
You was supposed to grow some wings, get your own pair
We started this from the bottom, now you alone there
Shit, you treat it like it's home there
Dependent on me, you was supposed to get your own share
I still love you to my last days
I never knew that shit would be this fast-paced
I never thought I'd see awards in a glass case
I could've ended up in your crib with a masked face
It could've went left on a couple bad days
When I visit my last place is the only time I'm in last place
See me these days, I never got on a sad face
See me these days, I
Lost you to the game, and I see why
It was always you and I without the T-Y
This is not one of them stories that got three sides
This is not one of them stories you could rewind
Like I'm tryna show the waves, this is no cap
You drove a nigga crazy, but I drove back
You wrote me off and then you never wrote back
I'm not tryna make no song, these are cold facts

[Outro: Drake & Dennis Graham]
Yes, sir
(Baby)
Hold on, hold on
(Let me tell you something about me)
(I really do know, I know who I wanna be)
Woo
Lord, I already passed on all that (Woo)
You go 'head on, haha

[Intro: Nicki Minaj]
Yeah, you know it
Mmm, this the remix
Doja, rrr

[Chorus: Doja Cat & Nicki Minaj]
Day to night to morning, keep with me in the moment
I'd let you had I known it, why don't you say so?
Didn't even notice, no punches left to roll with
You got to keep me focused; you want it? Say so (Uh)

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Every time I take a break, the game be so boring
Pretty like Naomi, Cassie, plus Lauren
Spittin' like Weezy, Foxy, plus Lauryn
Ball like the Rams, see, now that's Gordon
They don't understand the bag talk, I'm foreign
When they think they top the queen, they start fallin'
Word to my ass-shots, I'm so cheeky
Got 'em tryna palm my ass like young Keke
Yes, I'm ghetto, word to Geppetto
Plus I'm little, where's my stiletto?
Tell Mike Jordan send me my Retros
Used to be bi, but now I'm just hetero
Ain't talkin' medicine, but I made him more a fiend
Ever since I put the cookie on quarantine
He know this thing A1 like a felony
All he gotta do is say the word like a spelling bee

[Chorus: Doja Cat]
Day to night to morning, keep with me in the moment
I'd let you had I known it, why don't you say so?
Didn't even notice, no punches left to roll with
You got to keep me focused; you want it? Say so (Yeah)

[Verse 2: Doja Cat]
Let me check my chest, my breath right quick (Ha)
He ain't ever seen it in a dress like this (Ah)
He ain't ever even been impressed like this
Prolly why I got him quiet on the set like zip
Like it, love it, need it, bad
Take it, own it, steal it, fast
Boy, stop playing, grab my ass
Why you actin' like you shy? (Hot)
Shut it, save it, keep it pushin'
Why you beating 'round the bush?
Knowin' you want all this woman
Never knock it 'til you try (Yah, yah)
All of them bitches hating I have you with me
All of my niggas sayin' you mad committed
Realer than anybody you had, and pretty
All of the body-ody, the ass and titties

[Chorus: Doja Cat]
Day to night to morning, keep with me in the moment
I'd let you had I known it, why don't you say so?
Didn't even notice, no punches left to roll with
You got to keep me focused; you want it? Say so
Day to night to morning, keep with me in the moment
I'd let you had I known it, why don't you say so?
Didn't even notice, no punches left to roll with
You got to keep me focused; you want it? Say so

[Post-Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
Yeah, you know it
Yeah, you know it
Yeah, you know it
Yeah, you know it

[Outro: Nicki Minaj]
You coulda said so
Boy, you shoulda said so
Say so, say so
I got dressed just to sit in the house
People with the least always doin' the most
I'm countin' money while he suckin' my toes
Real nasty with them balls, all net, yeah, I'm gross
Why you talkin' 'bout who body fake?
With all them fillers in your face, you just full of hate
That real ass ain't keep your nigga home
Now you lookin' silly, that's word to silicone

[Intro: Drake & Booggz]

I'm back, baby, where the love?
(Bitch)
Ayy, yeah

[Verse]
Ayy, ayy (Plug)
Writin' this from Florida with love (Love)
Rest in peace to Static, yellin' "Shawty want a thug," ayy
Bottles in the club, ayy, know I love to touch (Ayy)
Weezy played that shit for me and Kobe on the bus
Bottles in the club, ayy, know I love to touch (Ayy)
Weezy played that shit for me and Kobe on the bus (Yeah)
Went and got a chain for me, I had to give it up (Yeah)
Niggas had they pistols loaded pointed at my truck, ayy
And you know that lesson stuck (Right)
From that day I never touched the road without a (Plug)
Ayy, from that day I never saw the point in talkin' tough (Nah)
Hasn't happened since, I guess you niggas know what's up (Yup)
Yeah, haven't seen the 6ix in like a month (6ix)
Fuck that, I'm back, baby, where the love? (Love)
Rappers that I threw an alley-oop are throwin' subs (Yeah)
But they gotta dap me when they see me, that's what's up (That's what's up)
I let that shit slide, I got everything
I can lose it all if I'm reactin' to the petty things
My bro named Casino, yeah, but he ain't into bettin' things
FBG the gang and they down to stain anything, mhm

Booted up, turned up, piped up (Plug)
I'm back, baby, where the love? (Where the love at?)
I'm back, baby, where the love? (Where the love at?)
I'm back, baby, where the love?
Booted up, turned up, piped up (Plug)
I'm back, baby, where the love? (Where the love at?)
I'm back, baby, where the love? (Where the love at?)
I'm back, baby, where the love?

[Outro: Drake]
(Might just have to go in on that)
Never fallin', why you makin' problems?
I've been silent, why you makin' problems?
I'm a problem, bein' rich is not my fault
You decide who you think the shit reside with
I been quiet, hard to miss me when I'm flyin'
Gone out to Caicos, she can stay in my room
She can stay in my room, and it ain't my
I was tryna play it right
I was tryna treat you nice
Funny how I had to stop
See me when I'm outside
We ain't have a problem
Then you went and found one
How you gonna get a bag?
She can't help but get attached
See me when you're outside
See me on the Southside
I could tell you're sick inside
'Cause she just wanna love me
She don't wanna leave me
She just wanna love me
She don't wanna leave me

[Intro: Pimp C]
Man, get the fuck away from us, we don't want nothin' but money
We some family men, we gettin' this paper
Know what I'm talkin' 'bout?
And I had to put that out there, Bun
Because a lot of niggas doin' lot of Fugazi shit out here, man

[Chorus]
Love me, save me, tell me, try me
All you do is lie to me
Takin' me for granted, I could tell
All you do is lie to me
Lies don't excite me, I'm lonely
Need more than a homie
Takin' me for granted, I could tell

[Verse]
All you do is lie to me
And dub me, you never love me
Any confidence I came with, you take it from me
I just wanna get beside you and make you love me
I just can not take the silence, you keep ignorin' me
See you makin' all this time for more important things
We was s'posed to catch a vibe the other night
Busy now, but you was down that other time
Why you always lead me on and give me signs?
I just wanna get beside and make you mine
I just wanna come inside and reunite
Got me waitin' outside (Hah)

[Chorus]
Love me, save me, tell me, try me
All you do is lie to me
Takin' me for granted, I could tell
All you do is lie to me
Lies don't excite me, I'm lonely
Need more than a homie
Takin' me for granted, I could tell

[Outro: Diddy]
Uhm, you was just so in your pocket, uhm
Cats used to tell me when they used to come to my house in Miami and shit
That, that, that they felt a feelin' of like
They felt a lil' fucked up in they stomach
But, they was inspired 'cause they knew they, they, they had somethin' to see the dream for, you know?
I done seen a lot of shit, I ain't never seen a, a young nigga as consistent as you that has affected the world in such a positive way since, you know, Michael Jackson
And then, when you've finally got the crib (All you do is lie to me)
You did it like, not even none of us did it, you feel me? Uhm
Nah, I mean I did it like that, I ain't gon' lie, I ain't gon' lie to you
I did it like that, but, I ain't never been affected by another nigga crib in the way that did it to inspire me
How cats told me that he'd been inspired (All you do is lie to me)
And felt that feelin' in they gut, like "I gotta work harder" (Need more than a homie)
Well I mean workin' harder just to compete, bro, for real, for real
It's either you fuckin' in the game or you're out the game
Nigga, I'm back in this motherfucker, let's get some money
It's over, nigga, you have arrived, top five, end of discussion
May God bless you, Inshallah, you know what I'm sayin'?
This your brother, Diddy, take that
And thank you for the inspiration, jheeze

[Verse 1]
I've paid my dues
Time after time
I've done my sentence
But committed no crime
And bad mistakes
I've made a few
I've had my share of sand kicked in my face
But I've come through

[Chorus 1]
We are the champions, my friends
And we'll keep on fighting till the end
We are the champions
We are the champions
No time for losers
'Cause we are the champions

[Chorus 2]
You are the champions, my friends
And you'll keep on fighting till the end
You are the champions
You  are the champions
No time for losers
'Cause you are the champions
Of the world, yeah-yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Why don't you go home?
Everyone can tell you’re in pain
All the make up you own
Couldn't hide that your eyes are inflamed

[Chorus 1]
You strategically waited till the end of the night
When decisions are made and the timing's right
All this time that you wasted
While you’re out here stalling
Your friends are calling your name
Your friends are calling your name

[Verse 2]
She kept checking her phone
The explicit text never came
Why don't you leave her alone?
You know that the girl is insane

[Chorus 2]
In this crowded kitchen, you feel alone
Just wait till you see how it feels when you get home
Maybe you thought it'd be different
Once your defenses had fallen
But your friends are calling your name
Your friends are calling your name
Your friends are calling your name

[Chorus 3]
And I saw how your eyes lit up
And you drank too fast
And you smoked too much
And now you're slurring your words
Like you were seventeen and ashamed
And wondering why you came
Your friends are calling your name
Your friends are calling your name

[Outro]
Your friends are calling your name
Your friends are calling your name
Your friends are calling your name

[Verse 1]
She walked into the room
Like people tend to do when they show up
She was only twenty-two
And sick of people telling her to grow up
It just gets worse the more you wait
And you could easily find a date if you only wanted to
You're such a pretty girl
From your lavender hair down to your combat boots

[Pre-Chorus 1]
She tried hard to get that feeling
That comes easy to you and I
Still, she thought it might be funny
To do one selfless deed before she died

[Chorus]
Valerie
She doesn't know how to be like every other girl
She's alone in her little world
And you can't come in
Valerie
Standing on the balcony
And if you look you could see into her mind
But you can't come in

[Verse 2]
And if you never knew nobody
Then how'd you ever know that you were lonely
She'd known someone who had
And if that's the case then what's the point in knowing

She stood there in the open
For everyone to see
Too proud to ask for anybody's help
She had this revelation
The sheer amount of work that it would take
To be like everybody else

But she didn't want them anyways
She's no damsel in distress
She just sipped her daiquiri
And wished she wasn't easily convinced

[Pre-Chorus 2]
But who were you fooling anyways?
You should have guessed
You should have known
It doesn't matter what they say
Some people like to be alone

[Chorus]
Valerie
She doesn't know how to be like every other girl
She's alone in her little world
And you can't come in
Valerie
Standing on the balcony
And if you look you could see into her mind
But you can't come in

[Outro]
You can't come in
You can't come in
No, You can't come in
You can't come in
You can't come in
You can't come in
No, You can't come in
You can't come in
You can't come in
You can't come in

[Verse 1]
I'll beg for mercy if you let me
It shouldn't take too long
You've got a lot of cases to get through
I'll try to keep it moving along

[Chorus 1]
And I know that the dice are loaded
If I were you, then I'd be on your side
Dreaming up all the accusations I won't deny
And I know that you got your reasons
Though you try so hard to conceal 'em
Whatever they are, well, I hope that they're better than mine

[Verse 2]
Don't try to change their opinion
Once they've got the taste of blood
I like the way you point your finger
I like the way you drag my name through the mud

[Chorus 2]
Every alibi a fabrication
Every sigh an admission of guilt
Every apology an invitation to a life of crime
Where were you on the night in question?
Make an example send them a message
You already signed the confession on the dotted line

[Verse 1]
Here's another ending
Static on a page
Foregone conclusions
Just the faces aren't the same
Back in the apartment
She isn't what she seems
Words got blurted out
And fell like spit into my drink

[Chorus 1]
But if that's how it's got to go down
Then I'm gonna stay till you kick me out
And I know what feels good and what's not allowed
And there's plenty of heartache to go around

[Verse 2]
The part that's so confusing
It could happen like you say it should
Right down to the phrasing
Still it wouldn't do you any good
Back in the apartment
Dressed up like a stage
Unfamiliar actors saying lines to a different play

[Chorus 2]
But if she didn't want me then
Why'd she climb into my bed?
And I know some things you sing
You'd never say out loud
And there's plenty of heartache to go around

[Spoken sample]
I've been holding back
I've been giving you a break
Just so you get the hang of it
But now it's time to teach you a little respect, right
But it'll have to be next time

[Verse 1]
Everyone looks the same in this town
You can hardly tell the difference
She stayed at home and figured out how
To will herself out of existence

[Chorus 1]
She gave it a try
She closed her eyes
She didn't know how it'd feel
She just hoped that it wouldn't hurt
It almost worked

[Verse 2]
They lie right to your face in this town
But what did you expect
She wishes that she could have seen what they saw
That left them so unimpressed

[Chorus 2]
So she gave it a try
She started to cry
She said to herself, "Well, at least it could have been worse"
And it almost worked

[Verse 1]
I remember when I saw her
Her skin was soft like water
And I remember when I met her
She was lighter than a feather
And I remember when I kissed her
She was living with her sister
Not a single word was spoke
I guess she did it as a joke

[Verse 2]
And I remember when she left me
The street was clean and empty
And I remember when she called me
And whispered to me softly
And I remember she was laughing
She never seemed so happy
But it could have been for show
I guess you never really know
Don't go sleeping with the enemy
I know we said we'd be true
I know you're stranded in the forest if you don't
Abandoned if you do

So don't go sleeping with the enemy
If my imagination is getting ahead of me
Then let it be known that I can't make it alone

So get down and stay perfectly still
Bite down on your cyanide pill
There's things that you swore you'd never do
But you will with the enemy

Don't go sleeping with the enemy
Then everybody gets to be a hero
Can ya hear me, are you alive?
Do you know that there's a war?

Don't go sleeping with the enemy
Don't forget that we were comrades till the end
They only wanna make love but this is war
And the good guys always win
So don't kick while we're dragging you home
Quietly reciting your loyalty oath
Knife at your throat
Uncomfortably close to the enemy

[Verse 1]
I should have known
By the way that you say nothing much at all
I could have guessed by the messages you send
But never call

But most of all
I could have seen it in the colors of your hair
Because they don't appear in nature
Except to warn you of the danger
And I know that you don't care

[Chorus]
But I want you to stay
I want you to stay (stay)
I want you to stay (stay)
Stay the hell away from me

I could have guessed
If I'd liked you a little less
I probably could have recognized the signs
But I don't mind when your roommate barges in
And lists off every single name but mine
But that's the way it goes
You'll always be the last to know
Till someone comes and slaps you on the face
But it's okay if you're at a loss for words
'Cause I know exactly what I'd say

[Chorus]
I'd tell you to stay (stay)
I'd tell you to stay (stay)
I'd tell you to stay (stay)
Stay the hell away from me

I want you to stay (stay)
I want you to stay (stay)
I want you to stay (stay)
Stay the hell away from me

[Bridge]
And despite all the silence
I heard about it anyway
Was it me or with Mike
Who stayed for the night?
But only Joe made it through to the day
And that was the summer
That's just life in LA
You're either screening your calls
Or begging for someone to stay

[Chorus]
Stay (stay)
Why don't you stay? (stay)
Why don't you stay? (stay)
Stay the hell away from me

I want you to stay (stay)
I want you to stay (stay)
I just wanted you to stay (stay)
Stay the hell away from me

[Outro]
Just stay the hell away from me
Stay the hell away from me
Just stay the hell away from me
Just stay the hell away from me

[Intro]
Yeah, yeah
Wow, wow, ayy

If we ain't sexin', what we in here for?

[Chorus]

There's a wall 

[?] out everything
Nobody thinks the system ever failed

So from away from you and what we share

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
So many promises I know girl, I know
I'll find a way to make it all up to you
So please don't cry, I know it's so hard to do
You're the reason why I make it through
So you when you get home, kiss the babies on the cheek for me
Let them know what they mean to me
Tell them what dad I used to be
Make sure they don't end up like me (Like me)
Make sure they don’t end up like me (Like me)

[Chorus]
PS, please remember me

Makes these later your memories
PS, please remember me

[Bridge]
And I fighten all these years, no possibilities (No possibilities)
And I numb all my fears, never been type to weep (Been the type to weep)
And I know I’m innocent and I'll pray one day that I’ll go free
A life of a man in the pain of

PS, please remember me
From your first steps to your anniversaries

[Intro: Laura Les, Dylan Brady & Both]
He said, "I love you," on the plane, I said, "I love you too"
He said, "Everything is different now, everything has changed
Always on a plane, always something new"
I said, "Nothing's new, nothing's changed, I still need you" (Let's go)
I'm 'bout to hit the boof
Ahh
Smokin' somethin' new
One, two, three, go

[Verse 1: Dylan Brady, Laura Les & Both]
Roll the boof, then I smoke, then it's all gone
Hit that G so hard that I fall off
Taking shots in the dark, that's a bad call
Going straight for your head, gotta saw it off
I got a bag on the way (Uh, uh)
Smokin' a zip in a day (Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh)
What were you trying to say? (Uh, oh, oh, oh)
Making it up on the way

[Bridge: Laura Les, Dylan Brady]
I never say what I need when I need you (Need you)
I never say what I need when I need you
I'm okay on the weed, but I need you
I might hit the weed, I might hit the boof (Go)

[Verse 2: Laura Les & Both]
I'm addicted to Monster, money, and weed, yeah
I'm blowin' clouds so loud, you can't fuckin' see, yeah
I'm addicted to everything that I see, yeah
I'm addicted to making money off me, yeah
I might go and throw my phone into the lake, yeah
It ain't hard to quit caring what you think, yeah
Burnt me one too many times like a tree, yeah
Now there's fire raining down on your screams, yeah

[Outro: Laura Les]
Oh
Oh, shut the fuck up, where's the weed at?
Oh, shut the fuck up, where's the weed?
I hit the big boof and the weed, yeah
I hit the big boof, then it's gone
Just shut the fuck up, where's the weed at?
Oh, shut the fuck up, where's the weed?
Oh, shut the fuck up, where's the weed at?
Ah

[Intro: Tony Allen]
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha

[Chorus: Skepta]
Yeah, wah gwan, brudda?
Time to hustle for the money, give a change to your mother
Change them sheets, you got stains on the cover
Better look sharp, now your face on the cover
Like a chameleon, see you change in your color
Crabs in the barrel, wanna hate on each other
Saw my life gets better, whatever the weather
I dance in the rain and I bathe in summer

[Verse 1: Skepta]
It's the black Corleone in a button-up shirt
Before we take off you better buckle up first
Fresher than the President, psychedelics got me in my element
All negativity, that's irrelevant
Amber Leaf or ganja leaf, I backstrap when I wrap the sheets
Now I feel to go for a drive, so I grab my keys
Shades on, roof down, tryna catch a breeze
Ride around the hood, got the devil in my ear
Can you smell that? Smells like jealousy in the air
Dunno who they're tryna scare
Looked at the man in the mirror, that's the only enemy that I fear
A zombie knows who to frighten
Just know I love the action, but I move in silence
And, right now I'm just takin' what's mine
Till Elizabeth returns the diamond

[Chorus: Skepta]
Wah gwan, brudda?
Time to hustle for the money, give a change to your mother
Change them sheets, you got stains on the cover
Better look sharp, now your face on the cover
Tryna be the boss of life, gets tougher
I hope you're ready for the truth that you're gonna discover
Always gonna be a Judas at the last supper
Stay woke, it's a rocky road on the come-up

[Verse 2: Skepta]
Take the shots like Scorsese
More money, more problems and more ladies
Everyday somebody dies, still, mothers give birth to more babies
The Earth spins, the world gets more crazy
You gotta have a suit for the christening
A suit for the wedding and a suit for the court case
Probably wear the same suit to the funeral
Tryna see the bigger picture, man, it's bigger than the portrait
Bigger than me, no, you can't fight off your demons with vitamin C
Have to open your mind, use your vision and see
Keep your eyes on the prize so vigilantly
Love how you live, remember the world full of expensive shit
Can't forget the poor 'cause you're friends with the rich
Stay true to the bone, I ain't ever gonna switch

[Chorus: Skepta]
Yeah, yeah-yeah, wah gwan, brudda?
Time to hustle for the money, give a change to your mother
Change them sheets, you got stains on the cover
Better look sharp, now your face on the cover
Hm, who's that pressing on the buzzer?
Better check the camera, you don't wanna get stuck up
You listen close, you can hear death around the corner
One wrong move and we're all gonna suffer

[Bridge: Tony Allen]
Ahh, oya
È dì dé, è róo òri, oya
È dì dé, è róo òri, oya
È dì dé, è róo òri, oya
È dì dé, è róo òri, è dì dé

[Chorus: Skepta]
How far, brudda?
Time to hustle for the money, give a change to your mother
Change them sheets, you got stains on the cover
Better look sharp, now your face on the cover
Love to see you shine in the night like the diamond you are
(Love to see you shine in the night like the diamond you are)
I'm good on the side, it's alright, just hold me in the dark
(I'm good on the side, it's alright, just hold me in the dark)
No one's gotta know what we do, hit me up when you're bored
(No one's gotta know what we do, hit me up when you're bored)
'Cause I live down the street
So we meet when you need and it's yours
All I hear is...

Nothing feels better than this
Nothing feels better
Nothing feels better than this
Nothing feels better, oh no
We don't gotta hide, this is what you like
I'll admit
Nothing feels better than this

You say we're just friends but I swear when nobody's around
(You say we're just friends but I swear when nobody's around)
You keep my hand around your neck, we connect, are you feeling it now?
(You keep my hand around your neck, we connect, are you feeling it now?)
'Cause I am
I got so high the other night, I swear to God, felt my feet lift the ground
(I got so high the other night, I swear to God I felt my feet lift the ground)
Ooh, yeah
Your back against the wall, this is all you've been talking about
In my ears
Nothing feels better than this
Nothing feels better
Nothing feels better than this
Nothing feels better, oh no
We don't gotta hide, this is what you like
I admit
Nothing feels better than this

Nothing feels better than this
Nothing feels better
Nothing feels better than this
Nothing feels better, oh no
We don't gotta hide, this is what you like
I admit
Nothing feels better than this

Late night cooking in the kitchen
Yeah-ayy-ayy, yeah-ayy-ayy
Dirty dancing in my room
Room, room
Sending my love all over you

[Refrain]
Because of the time we shared
Time we lost in love with one another
Days we had, pay the cost of losin'
Hearts desire, so soon
I'll be sending my love all over you

[Verse]
I still get so lost in the feeling (Feeling)
And I can't imagine losin' you (You)

I saw your name on a street sign
In the middle of nowhere
And that has to mean something

[Verse 2]
I know your zodiac sign
Me and Leos get along great
And that has to mean something

[Chorus]
But for some reason
You're not here
And I refuse to believe
That means something

[Break]
Oh, oh

[Verse 3]
I felt the way that you hugged me
When I was broken inside
And that has to mean something

[Verse 4]
I felt the way that you kissed me
When we got too drunk that night
And that had to mean something (Something, something)

[Chorus]
But for some reason
You're not here
And I refuse to believe
That means something

[Bridge]
Every time I think too much
It ends up crazy
I don't know how to not think about you
Every time I trust my gut
I think I'm crazy
'Cause I don't know how to put my trust in you

[Outro]
Do you think it means something
That I wrote another song about you?

[Verse 1]
Yeah, cocaine mountains until I overdose (Overdose)
It's me and this money, sittin' alone, I know (I know)
It's gettin' harder to get along with my dad
I been feelin' like he grew jealous of everything that I have, I swear (I swear)
They don't teach you 'bout reality (No)
With a super model on the penthouse balcony (Yeah)
Me and my homies got a death wish (A death wish)
So, God, can you direct me to the exit please? (Woo)
I been waitin' on a miracle, I give my life for that emblem
That say wealthy on my steerin' wheel
That pain is an illusion, but that fear is real
You either here to die or here to kill

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, best believe in envy
Look outside my window and the evil gon' tempt me, uh
A model bitch with double D's and she pretty
'Bout to cause a riot, who the fuck comin' with me? (Yeah)

[Chorus]
I got the key to the city, I got the key to the city
I got the key to the city, it's time to open the door
I got the key to the city, I got the key to the city
They was swearin' they my homies, they don't know me no more
I got the key to the city, I got the key to the city
I got the key to the city, time to open the door
I got the key to the city, I got the key to the city
They was swearin' they my homies, they don't know me no more

[Verse 2]
Yeah, yeah
Pittsburgh (Yeah,) live and die in my Pittsburgh (Yeah)
Everything became different when I gave my dad that Fisker (Skrr)
Young home owner, out of control, I don't know sober (No)
Feel alone again, grab my phone and call hoes over (Please)
The next day I just forget her (Just forget her)
Unless that pussy somethin' to remember (Keep it wetter)
I could live inside this chaos 'til forever ('Til forever)
But the sooner I reach clarity the better (Woo)
Live inside of this jungle, watch me crumble under the pressure (Pressure)
Everyday is like, "Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you," man, I'm fed up (Man, I'm fed up)
I pick my head up (Pick my head up,) and hold my feet down (Hold my feet down)
All my homies gon' eat now (It's time)

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, best believe in envy
Look outside my window and the evil gon' tempt me, uh

'Bout to cause a riot, who the fuck comin' with me? (Yeah)

[Outro]
Search for the solution to confusion that keep comin' on
You just trapped inside delusion, young man, run along, run along
It's so real, oh, it's so real
It's scary, terrifyin', yeah
What's my motherfuckin' name? What's my motherfuckin' name?
I don't know, either
But here I am
Next to you
The sky is more blue
In Malibu
Next to you
In Malibu
Next to you

We watch the Sun go down as we're walking
I'd spend the rest of my life just standing here talking
You would explain the current as I just smile
Hoping that you'll stay the same and nothing will change
And it'll be us just for a while

In Malibu
Next to you
In Malibu

But here I am
Next to you
The sky is more blue

I never would've believed you
If three years ago you told me
I'd be here writing this song
But here I am
Next to you
The sky is so blue
In Malibu
I never came to the beach or stood by the ocean
I never sat by the shore under the Sun with my feet in the
Sand
But you brought me here and I'm happy that you did
'Cause now I'm as free as birds catching the wind

But here I am
Next to you
The sky is more blue
In Malibu
Next to you
In Malibu
In Malibu
In Malibu

We watched the Sun go down as we were walking
I'd spend the rest of my life just standing here talking
You would explain the current, as I just smile
Hoping that you'll stay the same and nothing will change
And it'll be us
But here I am
Next to you
The sky is more blue
In Malibu
Next to you
In Malibu
In Malibu
In Malibu

In Malibu

It's been a long time since you found diamonds
You ain't comin' out your mine, you ain't really got the time
Tell me what must I do to make a book
'Cause luckily I'm good at crafting
I want a book because I need enchantments
Time to fight the Ender Dragon
If you grief, then I'll be bannin'
If you flaunt that diamond on me, babe
You better hit the mine

Lyrics from Snippet

[Intro: Foster Sylvers]
Take in stride, love and devotion
Don't confide, it's the tracks of lost emotion
Let it glide, it's gonna subside
She stole my
But if just she stole my heart

[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract]
I thought I loved her like Common did
I ain't going for the drama, kid
Niggas moved to the city seeking protection
Everything we do, word, shit got me stressin
Stressed out, let me get it squared away
My boy smoke a square a day, no stress, just lifestyle choices
Everyday I wake up, I get dressed, for who? For what?
The city shut down, a ghost town
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you a lot
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you a lot
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you a lot
Lot, lot, and that's all I got

[Verse 2: Ryan Betty]
I got everything, the summer came

[?] better day
But I still have dreams of you
I got good dreams of you
She stole my heart, before I landed
Stole my heart, hope I understand it
Stole my heart, but I still got dreams of you
I got good dreams of you

[Chorus: Foster Sylvers]
Stole my heart
But if just she stole my heart
Lyrics from Snippet

[Chorus: Drake & Future]

[...]
-girl, you know me
Still with the dawgs that I grew beside
All the niggas 'round me ride or they die
Gotta watch the time 'cause it's flyin' right by (Yeah)
I'm outside in an AMG (Oh)
Right outside-
Lyrics from Snippet

[Intro]
Tech-Techinical

[Verse: Kevin Abstract]
Get you immersed with and burst your bubble
The trouble that we be surfin' through
It hurts to choose, I gotta face the truth
My brother face the judge, I can't face the drugs
And corporates dogs, man, they lace the drugs
Just don't be a weirdo unless it's natural
Like my dreads and my bed, so lonely
Thank God for the homies
Thank God for the groceries that you brought through
'Cause we was gettin' hungry, niggas know that I'm a lot to
I got a lot to lose, when the pressure's on, the light's cool
The box is new, ain't nobody watchin' you
So how could we be robbin' you?
I make more thank you think, I think more than you think
If I keep goin' at this rate, I'll be your brain next week
I moved on in my sleep, I got it done in a week
Been possessed by my old self
Fuckin' with the Devil got me fuckin' hella old still
Money that I owed still, my father paid his phone bill
(That's his karma comin' back)
'Cause I ain't seen his crib still, I ain't met his kids still
I'm tryna have a kid still
Ayy, yo

[Break: Kevin Abstract & Ryan Beatty]
Need ya, need ya to get back
Need ya, need ya to get (I need you to)
Need ya, need ya to get back
Need ya, need ya to get, I need you to need me
Get back, finding to get physical
Want this to be easy, get back
'Cause you know that easy come and easy go
Need ya, need ya to get, I need you to need me
Get back, finding to get physical
Want this to be easy, get back
'Cause you know that easy come and easy go

[Outro: Kevin Abstract]
Get back
Get, get, get, get
Back, back, back, back
Get, get, get, get
Lyrics from Snippet

[Intro]
Pardon the, uh, technical difficulties

[Verse: Kevin Abstract]
If I told you where the dope was
You ain't supposed to be here, nigga, you don't know us
See, boy, I am focused
In my garage makin' magic, this is hocus
Goin' loco, voodoo, I sue ya
The Devil gon' get ya if it's not the ruler
My black skin made me wanna dress more cooler
Hidin' alcohol inside my family's cooler, I'm tired of life, boy
Last night I had a dream, I put that on my whiteboard
For too damn long my life was McDonald's and white boys
Now it's like white noise, I need me some nice noise
I need me some nice coin, I need me some new clout
The gang niggas turn on you, fame niggas run from you
Laughin', hold my hand, baby, when it's convenient
I need me some street shit, fuck this PC shit, ah

[Outro: Kevin Abstract]
Oh, oh
Yeah, I don't wanna ride
Quit wastin' my time
I don't wanna ride
Quit wastin' my time, quit wastin' my time
Quit wastin' my time, quit, quit
These are the worst of times and these are the best of times... Racism, bigotry, ego centrism, prejudice, hatred and violence are breaking the heart of our Planet and strangling it’s soul... And yet...We are coming alive, as never before! Nelson Mandela: a black man, a former symbol of subjugation and slavery dines South Africa... Democracy and freedom flourish as never before and a new consciousness proclaims the dawn of the Age of Enlightenment, where survival of the fittest is replaced by survival of the wisest...

Let us dream of the great and sudden splendor of a new tomorrow... Let us dream of the full flowering of a new collective consciousness... Let us dream of a tomorrow where we can hold our heads high and stretch our arms toward perfection... Let us dream of a tomorrow where we no longer fragment and fracture our global village with narrow domestic walls, where tribalism no longer services under the pretense of nationalism and patriotic favor and where we can truly live from the soul and know love as the ultimate truth at the heart of all creation...

Let us dream of a tomorrow where our children are nurtured and our elders revered and journeyed and venerated... Let us dream of peace and harmony and laughter... Let us dream of joy and ecstasy... Let us dream of dancing the cosmic dance. And, as we dream, let us remember those who dared to dream before us, sacrificed their yesterday, so we could have our tomorrow!

For the moment, I'm just gone and zonin' off, if I get it lit
Wait a minute, won't you take a moment
Know it's longer and we livin' in it
For the moment, I'm just gone and zonin' off

[Chorus]
Sunshine goodmornin', sunshine goodmornin'
Sunshine goodmornin', sunshine goodmornin'
I'm floatin' on again
Sit and close my eyes, sit and close my eyes
Feels like summer time again
Soarin' through the skies, take you for a ride

[Interlude]
Wait a minute, won't you take a moment
Know it's longer and we livin' in it
For the moment, I'm just gone and zonin' off, if I get it lit
Wait a minute, won't you take a moment
Know it's longer and we livin' in it
For the moment, I'm just gone and zonin' off

[Chorus]
Sunshine goodmornin', sunshine goodmornin'
Sunshine goodmornin', sunshine goodmornin'
I'm floatin' on again
Sit and close my eyes, sit and close my eyes
Feels like summer time again
Soarin' through the skies, take you for a ride

[Verse 1]
Had a lot of girls in my day
Wanted more from me
But there's only really one way
To start a family

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know you can't believe it's true
But I'm man enough to say to you

[Chorus]
I'm a virgin (Uh)
Never got close enough
Cell phone blowin' up, but I'm waiting
For the right person (Uh)
Tryna act super tough
But inside I'm a twelve-year-old boy

[Verse 2]
I see you lookin' in a strong way
But I won't give it up
Supermodels, they were all fake
'Cause I never humped
And I know you, I know you want to
But I'm man enough to say to you (Oh)
Underneath the lies and the big talk
I've been waiting for a wife
I never watched porn, never did drugs
'Cause I'm terrified

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know you, you can't believe it's true
But I'm man enough to say to you

[Chorus]
I'm a virgin (Uh)
Never got close enough
Cell phone blowin' up, but I'm waiting
For the right person (Uh)
You wanna hold hands then sign me up
But just know you're not gonna score

[Outro]
I'm a virgin (Uh)
Never got close enough
Pure as a dove, and I'm waiting
For the right person
Never once been touched
The power of God in my loins

I said, "Bitch"

[Intro: Travis McCoy]
Open up

[Verse 1: CeeLo Green]
Well hello, is this thing on?
Is anybody listening?
A brand new day has begun
The first thing that I wanna do
Make sure that you feel it too
So I'm not the only one

[Chorus: Brendon Urie & *Patrick Stump*]
Come on and lift me up, it's a brand new day
Open up a little happiness today
So I can be someone new (*So I can be someone new*)
Come on and lift me up to a better way
Open up a smile on another face
So I can feel something new

Open up, open up some happiness
Open up, open up some happiness
Open up, open up some happiness
Open up, open up some happiness

[Verse 2: Travis McCoy]
Aha-aha
Let me clear my throat
So you can hear clearly every word spoke
Today I woke up feeling lovely happiness
Overflowing, knowing somebody loves me
And just think yesterday, I was down and out
Now there's not a single thing for me to frown about
And the same thing could happen to you
Smilin' so hard my mouth feel like a capital U

[Verse 3: CeeLo Green]
I want the sun to shine
All the time
Is that too much to ask
Oh
I wanna have some fun
I want all my friends to come
'Cause it's now or never
Learn all the words and sing together

[Chorus]
Come on and lift me up, it's a brand new day
Open up a little happiness today
So I can be someone new (*So I can be someone new*)
Come on and lift me up to a better way
Open up a smile on another face
So I can feel something new
Open up, open up some happiness
Open up, open up some happiness
Open up, open up some happiness
Open up, open up some happiness

[Verse 4: Janelle Monae]
Your heart deserves your trust
A choice made by all of us
The sun will come back tomorrow
There's a message in the bottle
So come on, I'll meet you there
There's enough sunshine to share
As long as you know
The bridge between us is a rainbow

[Chorus]
Come on and lift me up, it's a brand new day
Open up a little happiness today
So I can be someone new (*So I can feel something new*)
Come on and lift me up to a better way
Open up a smile on another face
So I can feel something new

Open up, open up open happiness
Open up, open up some happiness
Open up, open up open happiness
Open up, open up some happiness
Open up, open up open happiness
Open up, open up some happiness
Open up, open up open happiness
Open up, open up some happiness
Open up, open up open happiness
Open up, open up open happiness
Open up, open up open happiness
Open up, open up open happiness

[Verse 1]
I cut my bangs with some rusty kitchen scissors
I screamed his name ‘til the neighbours called the cops
I numbed the pain at the expense of my liver
Don’t know what I did next, I just know I couldn’t stop

[Verse 2]
Word got around to the barflies and the baptists
My mama’s phone started ringing off the hook
I can hear her now saying she ain’t gonna have it
Don’t matter how you feel, it only matters how you look

[Chorus]
Go and fix your make up, girl, it’s just a break up
Run and hide your crazy and start actin’ like a lady
'Cause I raised you better, gotta keep it together
Even when you fall apart
But this ain’t my mama’s broken heart

[Verse 3]
Wish I could be just a little less dramatic
Like a Kennedy when Camelot went down in flames
Leave it to me to be holding the matches
When the fire trucks show up and there’s nobody else to blame

[Verse 4]
Can’t get revenge and keep a spotless reputation
Sometimes revenge is just a choice you gotta make
My mama came from a softer generation
Where you get a grip and bite your lip just to save a little face

[Chorus]
Go and fix your make up, girl, it’s just a break up
Run and hide your crazy and start actin’ like a lady
'Cause I raised you better, gotta keep it together
Even when you fall apart
But this ain’t my mama’s broken heart
(Hey, hey)

[Bridge]
Powder your nose, paint your toes
Line your lips and keep 'em closed
Cross your legs, dot your eyes
And never let 'em see you cry

[Chorus]
Go and fix your make up, girl, it’s just a break up
Run and hide your crazy and start actin’ like a lady
'Cause I raised you better, gotta keep it together
Even when you fall apart
But this ain’t my mama’s broken heart
Nothing left to say
Nothing to do
Nothing left to say
Nothing to do

From you
She let me out
Down
Secrets I can't keep
Lyrics from snippet

[Intro]
Throwback

[Chorus]
Oh, you that nigga that was snitchin', huh?

We won't sell to your company
We won't sell to your company

[Verse 1]
Destiny, destiny, protect me from the world
Destiny, hold my hand, protect me from the world

[Pre-Chorus]
Here we are, with our running and confusion
And I don't see no confusion anywhere

[Chorus]
And if the world does turn, and if London burns
I'll be standing on the beach with my guitar
I wanna be in a band when I get to heaven
Anyone can play guitar and they won't be a nothing anymore

[Verse 2]
Grow my hair
Grow my hair, I am Jim Morrison
If I grow my hair
So maybe I could become Jim Morrison
Fat, ugly, dead

[Pre-Chorus]
Here we are, with our running and confusion
And I don't see no confusion anywhere
ANYWHERE!
Ah!
Ah!
Ah!

[Chorus]
AND if the world does turn, and if London burns
I'll be standing on the beach with my guitar
I wanna be in a band when I get to heaven
Anyone can play guitar and they won't be a nothing anymore

[Thom Yorke then jumps into the pool and almost drowns]

[Verse 1]
Told them your dreams, and they all started laughing
I guess you're out of your mind 'til it actually happens

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm the small town
One in seven billion
Why can't it be me?

[Chorus]
They told me I was out there, tried to knock me down
Took those sticks and stones, showed 'em I could build a house
They tell me that I'm crazy, but I'll never let 'em change me
'Til they cover me in daisies, daisies, daisies
They said I'm going nowhere, tried to count me out
Took those sticks and stones, showed 'em I could build a house
They tell me that I'm crazy, but I'll never let 'em change me
'Til they cover me in daisies, daisies, daisies

[Verse 2]
When did we all stop believing in magic?
Why did we put all our hopes in a box in the attic?

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm the long shot
I'm the Hail Mary
Why can't it be me?

[Chorus]
They told me I was out there, tried to knock me down (Knock me down)
Took those sticks and stones, showed 'em I could build a house
They tell me that I'm crazy, but I'll never let 'em change me
'Til they cover me in daisies, daisies, daisies
They said I'm going nowhere, tried to count me out
Took those sticks and stones, showed 'em I could build a house
They tell me that I'm crazy, but I'll never let 'em change me
'Til they cover me in daisies, daisies, daisies

[Bridge]
Hey, hey
Oh, cover me in daisies
Hey, hey

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm the small town
One in seven billion
Why can't it be me?

[Chorus]
They told me I was out there, tried to knock me down
Took those sticks and stones, showed 'em I could build a house
They tell me that I'm crazy, but I'll never let 'em change me
'Til they cover me in daisies, daisies, daisies
They said I'm going nowhere, tried to count me out (Count me out)
Took those sticks and stones, showed 'em I could build a house
They tell me that I'm crazy, but I'll never let 'em change me
'Til they cover me in daisies, daisies, daisies

[Verse 1]
When I'm weary
And so worn out
Ooh, when my mind's clouded
And filled with doubt
That's when I feel the most alive
Masochistic kisses are how I thrive
(Thrive, thrive, thrive, thrive, thrive, thrive, thrive)

[Verse 2]
A stiffness inside my neck
And bangin' my head
Against the desk
If there's no pain
Is there any progress? (Ha)
That's when I feel the most alive
Endurance is the source of my pride

[Chorus]
Might not be healthy for me but seemingly I need
What cuts me, cuts me, cuts me, cut me, cut me, yeah

[Verse 3]
I guess I'm a true immigrant son
No vacancies, no vacations
Sure, I can do better than this
But I don't, I won't, don't
(Hey!)

[Bridge]
What cuts me, cuts me, cuts me, cut me, cut me, cut me
That's when I feel the most alive
Is when I think I won't survive
And you cut me, cut me, cut me
That's when I feel the most alive
Is when I think I won't survive
And you cut me
Swear I feel the most real
When you cut me, cut me, yeah

[Outro]
Ooh

[Verse 1]
Another day that don't end
Another ship goin' out
Another day of anger, bitterness, and doubt
I know how it happened
I saw it begin
I opened my heart to the world and the world came in

[Verse 2]
Hello, Mary Lou
Hello, Miss Pearl
My fleet-footed guides from the underworld
No stars in the sky shine brighter than you
You girls mean business and I do too

[Verse 3]
Well, I'm the enemy of treason
An enemy of strife
I'm the enemy of the unlived meaningless life
I ain't no false prophet
I just know what I know
I go where only the lonely can go

[Verse 4]
I'm first among equals
Second to none
The last of the best
You can bury the rest
Bury 'em naked with their silver and gold
Put 'em six feet under and I pray for their souls

[Verse 5]
What are you lookin' at?
There's nothing to see
Just a cool breeze that's encircling me
Let's go for a walk in the garden
So far and so wide
We can sit in the shade by the fountain-side

[Verse 6]
I search the world over
For the Holy Grail
I sing songs of love
I sing songs of betrayal
Don't care what I drink
I don't care what I eat
I climb the mountains with swords on my bare feet

[Verse 7]
You don't know me, darlin'
You never would guess
I'm nothing like my ghostly appearance would suggest
I ain't no false prophet
I just said what I said
I'm just here to bring vengeance on somebody's head

[Verse 8]
Put out your hand
There's nothing to hold
Open your mouth
I'll stuff it with gold
Oh, you poor devil, look up if you will
The city of God is there on the hill

[Verse 9]
Hello, stranger
Hello and goodbye
You ruled the land
But so do I
You lusty old mule
You got a poisoned brain
I'll marry you to a ball and chain

[Verse 10]
You know, darlin'
The kind of life that I live
When your smile meets my smile
Something's got to give
I ain't no false prophet
No, I'm nobody's bride
Can't remember when I was born
And I forgot when I died

[Intro]

And it glow up green at night
And when the sun hit it on the plane
You understand what I'm sayin'?
Yeah, I used to do this shit to maintain
'Til I started usin' 14% of my brain
And that left me with 5 stars worth of stains, you dig?
Thugger!

[Verse 1]
You've been on my mind
I grow fonder every day
Lose myself in time
Just thinking of your face
God only knows
Why it's taken me so long
To let my doubts go
You're the only one that I wanted

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't know why I'm scared
‘Cause I've been here before
With every feeling, every word
I've imagined it all
You'll never know if you never try
To forgive your past and simply be mine

[Chorus]
I dare you to let me be your
Your one and only
I promise I'm worthy
To hold in your arms
So come on and give me the chance
To prove I am the one who can
Walk that mile
Until the end starts

[Verse 2]
Have I been on your mind?
Do you hang on every word I say?
Lose yourself in time
At the mention of my name?
Will I ever know
How it feels to hold you close?
And have you tell me
Whichever road I choose, you'll go

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't know why I'm scared
'Cause we've been here before
With every feeling, every word
I've imagined it all
You'll never know if you never try
To forgive my past and simply be mine

[Chorus]
I dare you to let me be your
Your one and only
I promise I'm worthy, mmm
To hold in your arms
So come on and give me the chance
To prove I am the one who can
Walk that mile
Until the end starts

[Bridge]
I know it ain't easy giving up your heart
I know it ain't easy giving up your heart
(Nobody's perfect)
I know it ain't easy giving up your heart
(Trust me I've learned it)
(Nobody's perfect)
I know it ain't easy giving up your heart
(Trust me, I've learned it)

Nobody's perfect

[Chorus]
So, I dare you to let me be your
Your one and only
I promise I'm worthy
To hold in your arms
So come on and give me the chance
To prove I am the one who can
Walk that mile
Until the end starts

[Outro]
Come on and give me the chance
To prove I am the one who can, yeah
Walk that mile
Until the end starts
Now
Lyrics from Snippet:

[Verse]
Yeah, you must think you're funny calling him at ten o'clock
You think he thinks you're pretty, I can guarantee he does not
I know you see me, do you think that you can win this game?
Yeah, you must think you're so attractive when you're playing dumb
The only thing you're showing him is how desperate you've become
I hope you trip over the boundaries that you've stepped right over

[Pre-Chorus]
But go ahead and shoot your shot
Baby, let me know how it goes
Know him better than you thought
And I think you should know

[Chorus]
You're his apocalyptic crush
He'd like you only if there was
No one left on Earth
Babe, I'm sorry if that hurts
But he's mine until then
You're his apocalyptic crush
If we all died, you'd be the one
Who'd get to kiss him in the ashes
So hey, what are the chances of World War III?
'Cause he's never gonna like you like he likes me

[Verse 1]
Inclusion lives through us all, love binds us together so we won’t fall
No matter how big or small
For each other: We’ll break down walls

When it all falls apart and we’re a million miles away
We can still be together in many different ways

[Chorus]
We’re all alone together, talking with each other
We’ve learned to make new friends and love one another and even-though we’re apart
We’re together at heart
Looking into the future, there’s a better place to start


We’re all alone together while the world is standing still
Together forever , forever together (Together forever, forever together)

[Verse 2]
We need to be reaching out to those who  are down and out
Let’s come together in Friendship: it’s what it’s all about
In our darkest hour , let our voices be louder
Let our light shine  Cause’ there’s a higher power

[Chorus]
All alone together, talking with each other
We’ve learned to make new friends and love one another and even-though we’re apart
We’re together at heart
Looking into the future , there’s a better place to start


We’re all alone together while the world is standing still
Together forever, forever together (Together forever, forever together)

[Intro: Amnesty & DJ Bobbito Garcia]
It don't make no difference
What you say about it
Pardon the, uh, technical difficulties

[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract]
Summertime, I got my head out the window
Your car smell like weed, it's that good Texas Indo
Back when nobody believed in me except for you
They don't accept you, unless they get to dress you
Technically speaking; it's making me bitter
I'm too high to focus, and more weed got delivered
What could make our life simpler, send it straight to my liver
Send my name out in flames, and then it crash in the winter
I showed up boy and I checked out the same day
I signed in boy, and I logged out the same date
Oh, mmh, mmh, ayy
My OGs told me, "Do it my way"
Texas boys, everything is sideways
Might upload the whole tape to MySpace
I like the music blown out, that's just my taste
Keep the vinyl packed in some blue crates

[Interlude: Matt Champion]
(Look up at the stars if you start to get lonely
It's crazy this all started with just us wanting some money)
Yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah
Yeah-yeah-yeah
Yeah

[Verse 2: Matt Champion]
What do I want out of life, what do I bleed for?
So many shoulders, I can go and lean my head on
But I still smoke and crave respect from those that cheer on
Wish I could focus more on what I get my cheer from
Who really know you, who really love you? I wanna see
I gotta hit you for a mission and, yes, we outspeed
So many take the high road to let the pain seep
I need to learn a lot and life is a one-way-street
Yeah, the ghost where Waco is, only time for takeout
Not a lot of room in this world, so keep your gate up
I'll meet you at the driveway, call Matt out
With the lights on, bright for real, drive back out
Yeah, jet-lag for pilots, only flyin' to islands
All them taxes filed, money gettin' piled in
Green by the millions, turn to envy by the thousand
Love to bring me down in the depths you drown in

[Outro: Amnesty]
It don't make no difference
What you say about it
No, no, things can't stay the same

[Intro: Jabari Manwa & DJ Bobbito Garcia]
Pardon the, uh, technical difficulties
Niggas stay talkin', they ain't about shit
Pull off, fetti stay in my wallet
Mind gone, mind gone insane
Yo, if you got a problem then don't call to me
Mans keep talking like he a prophet (Woah-woah)
No time to learn that we ain't 'bout it (Woah-woah)
Mind gone, mind gone insane
Yo, if it ain't a problem then don't call to me
I said
Pardon the uh, technical difficulties

[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract]
And I ain't taking "no" no more
Them niggas grew up on Screw
What the fuck dawg, now we getting back to the beginning
The game a scrimmage, I play to finish
Remember them old days, I was fucking 'round with women
We was backin' up them drives like we was finished
Runnin' 'round Corpus, two-door, I explore
Hit the gas then he floor it
We just took off with some more shit—

[Verse 2: Matt Champion & DJ Bobbito Garcia]
Pray to God to keep my money straight
My four SUVs behind me like motorcade
Shot on that bitch at alarming rate
Chills in your body they glisten and shimmer like you just went out of the armory, uh-uh
Move he dippin and dive whenever you cry, I will arrive
Blood, sweat and tears will let you go fly
But how do you float, uh-uh, staying afloat, uh-uh
Shoutout Big Chuck, Conan, and Bert
Shoutout Chris, Chloe, and Kelly
I'm going fast, you ready?
I keep the celly on silent
I hope the future is vibrant
For all of my brothers, all of my kin, all of my fans
Pardon the, uh, technical difficulties

[Refrain: bearface]
Big tr–, big tr–, big tr–, big tr—
(The, the, the, the, the beginning!)
Big trauma, stone-cold stunner (Woo)
Shotgunner, hot like summer
My lover, ain't no sucker
She'll break your windows, that's no fun, uh
Big trauma, stone-cold stunner (Woo)
Shotgunner, hot like summer
My lover, ain't no sucker
She'll break your windows, that's no fun, uh

[Outro: Kevin Abstract & DJ Bobbito Garcia]
Close the door
Watch me go
I'm gettin' close to God
Pimpin' ain't easy, niggas all resent me
While you talking big I'll be still pimpin'
Pimpin' ain't easy, niggas all resent me
While you talking big I'll be—
Pimpin' ain't easy, niggas all resent me
While you talking big I'll be still pimpin'
Pimpin' ain't easy, niggas all resent me
While you talking big I'll be still pimpin'

She said, "I wanna find somebody by nightfall"
Ooh-na-na, could it be yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Joe Jonas]
Watching her move, I was lost in the rhythms
Then she pulled me close by the look in her eyes
Don't know her name, but I know that I need her
She said, "Boy, you won't be lonely tonight"

[Chorus: Joe Jonas & Nick Jonas]
She said, "Ooh-ooh-ooh"
Kiss me like your ex is in the room
Don't you be afraid of something new
If you play it right, you can be that someone
Yeah, that someone who
Won't leave me lonely tonight

[Post-Chorus: Joe Jonas]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah (Yeah)

[Verse 2: Nick Jonas & Joe Jonas]

Ooh-la-la, if it's cool, yeah, baby, I'd like to

[Pre-Chorus: Joe Jonas]
Watching her move I was lost in the rhythms
Then she pulled me close by the look in her eyes (huh!)
Don't know her name, but I know that I need her
She said, "Boy, you won't be lonely tonight"

[Chorus: Joe Jonas & Nick Jonas]
She said, "Ooh-ooh-ooh" (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Kiss me like your ex is in the room (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Don't you be afraid of something new
If you play it right, you can be that someone

Las ganas no se equivocan (-vocan; eh)
Pon tu lengua en mi boca (Boca; eh)

[Verse 1]
Visions in the past
Turbulence right from the start
Tearing up your heart
You and I, we really went dark

[Pre-Chorus]
Voices tell me hold on
Somethin' keeps on pullin' me close, so close
Grippin' to you so hard
Somethin' keeps on pullin' me close, so close, but

[Chorus]
I got pictures in my mind
I can see it so clearly, see it all so bright
I see you and I
I got pictures in my mind
I can see it so clearly, see it all the time
I see you
Visions comin' every night
You can call me so crazy, following that light
I see you and I
I got pictures in my mind
I can see it so clearly, and it looks so right
I see you

[Verse 2]
Can't change what I feel
Never seen the future so real
But maybe I'm just fantasizing
Finally think I'm realizing

[Pre-Chorus]
All these voices tell me hold on
Somethin' keeps on pullin' me close, so close
Grippin' to you so hard
Somethin' keeps on pullin' me close, so close, but

[Chorus]
I got pictures in my mind
I can see it so clearly, see it all so bright
I got pictures in my mind
I can see it so clearly, see it all the time
Visions comin' every night
You can call me so crazy, following that light
I see you and I
I got pictures in my mind

[Outro]
I got pictures in my mind
I got pictures in my mind
I got pictures in my mind

[Verse 1]
I left my home in Norfolk, Virginia
California on my mind
I straddled that Greyhound and rode him into Raleigh
And on across Caroline
We stopped in Charlotte and bypassed Rock Hill
We never was a minute late
We was ninety miles out of Atlanta by sundown
Rolling outta the Georgia state
We had motor trouble, it turned into a struggle
Halfway across Alabam'
And that 'hound broke down and left us all stranded
In downtown Birmingham

[Verse 2]
Right away, I bought me a through train ticket
Riding across Mississippi clean
And I was on that midnight flier out of Birmingham
Smoking into New Orleans
Somebody help me get out of Louisiana
Just help me get to Houston town
There's people there who care a little about me
And they won't let the poor boy down
Sure as you're born, they bought me a silk suit
Put luggage in my hands
And I woke up high over Albuquerque
On a jet to the promised land

[Verse 3]
Working on a T-bone steak a la carte
Flying over to the Golden State
Oh, when the pilot told me us in thirteen minutes
He would set us at the terminal gate
Swing low sweet chariot, come down easy
Taxi to the terminal zone
Cut your engines and cool your wings
And let me make it to the telephone
Los Angeles, give me Norfolk, Virginia
Tidewater four ten o nine
Tell the folks back home this is the promised land calling
And the poor boy's on the line

[Verse 1]
When they come to take you down
When they bring that wagon 'round
When they come to call on you
And drag your poor body down

[Pre-Chorus]
Just one thing I ask of you, is just one thing for me
Please forget you know my name, my darling Sugaree

[Chorus]
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me

[Verse 2]
You thought you was the cool fool
And never could do no wrong
You had everything sewed up tight
How come you lay awake all night long?

[Pre-Chorus]
Just one thing I ask of you, is just one thing for me
Please forget you know my name, my darling Sugaree

[Chorus]
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me

[Verse 3]
Well, in spite of all you gained
You still had to stand out in the pouring rain
One last voice is calling you
And I guess it's time you go

[Pre-Chorus]
Just one thing I ask of you, is just one thing for me
Please forget you know my name, my darling Sugaree

[Chorus]
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me

[Bridge]
Well shake it up now, Sugaree
I'll meet you at the Jubilee
If that Jubilee don't come
Maybe I'll meet you on the run

[Pre-Chorus]
Just one thing I ask of you, is just one thing for me
Please forget you know my name, my darling Sugaree

[Chorus]
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me

[Chorus]
Well I taught that weeping willow how to cry cry cry
Taught the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky
Tears I cried for that woman are going to flood you, big river
And I'm going to sit right here until I die

[Verse 1]
I met her accidentally in St. Paul, Minnesota
She tore me up every time I heard her drawl, that Southern drawl
Well I heard my dream went back downstream, cavorting in Davenport
And I follow you big river when you called

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Well I followed her down to St. Louie, later on down the river
Trader said she's been here, but she's gone, boy, she's gone
Well I followed her down to Memphis
But she just walked off the bus
She raised a few eyebrows and she went on down alone

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Well I've gotten on down to Baton Rouge, River Queen roll on
Take that woman down to New Orleans, New Orleans
I give up, I've had enough
Followed my blues on down to the gulf
She loves you big river more than me

[Chorus]

[Outro]
And I'm going to sit right here until I die

[x3]

[Verse]
Bringing me down
I'm running aground
Blind in the light of the interstate cars
Passing me by
The busses and semis
Plunging like stones from a slingshot on Mars
But I'm here by the road
Bound to the load
That I picked up in ten thousand cafes and bars
Alone with the rush of the drivers who won't pick me up
The highway, the moon, the clouds, and the stars
The black-throated wind keeps on pouring in
With its words of a life where nothing is new
Ah, Mother American Night, I'm lost from the light
Ohhh, I'm drowning in you
I left St. Louis, the City of Blues
In the midst of a storm I'd rather forget
I tried to pretend it came to an end
Because you weren't the woman I thought I once met
But I can't deny that times have gone by
When I never had doubts or thoughts of regret
And I was a man when all this began
Who wouldn't think twice about being there yet
The black-throated wind keeps on pouring in
And it speaks of a life that passes like dew
It's forced me to see that you've done better by me
Better by me than I've done by you
What's to be found, racing around
You carry your pain wherever you go
Full of the blues and trying to lose
You ain't gonna learn what you don't want to know
So I give you my eyes, and all of their lies
Please help them to learn as well as to see
Capture a glance and make it a dance
Of looking at you looking at me
The black-throated wind keeps on pouring in
With its words of a lie that could almost be true
Ah, Mother American Night, here comes the light
I'm turning around, that's what I'm going to do

[Outro]
Going back home that's what I'm going to do
Turning around
That's what I'm going to do
Because you've done better by me
Than I've done by you

[Verse 1]
I lit out from Reno, I was trailed by twenty hounds
Didn't get to sleep last night 'till the morning came around

[Chorus]
Set out runnin' but I take my time
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine
If I get home before daylight
Just might get some sleep tonight

[Verse 2]
Ran into the devil, babe, he loaned me twenty bills
Spent the night in Utah in a cave up in the hills

[Chorus]
Set out runnin' but I take my time
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine
If I get home before daylight
Just might get some sleep tonight

[Verse 3]
I ran down to the levee but the devil caught me there
He took my twenty dollar bill and vanished in the air

[Chorus]
Set out runnin' but I take my time
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine
If I get home before daylight
Just might get some sleep tonight

[Bridge]
Got two reasons why I cry away each lonely night:
The first one's named sweet Anne Marie, and she's my heart's delight
The second one is prison, babe, the sheriff's on my trail
And if he catches up with me, I'll spend my life in jail

[Verse 4]
Got a wife in Chino, babe, and one in Cherokee
The first one says she's got my child, but it don't look like me

[Chorus]
Set out runnin' but I take my time
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine
If I get home before daylight
Just might get some sleep tonight

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Bridge]

[Verse 1]
Some folks trust to reason
Others trust to might
I don't trust to nothing
But i know it come out right
Say it once again now
Oh i hope you understand
When it’s done and over
Lord, a man is just a man

[Chorus]
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on the land

[Verse 2]
Some folks look for answers
Others look for fights
Some folks up in treetops
Just look to see the sights
I can tell your future
Look what's in your hand
But i can't stop for nothing
I’m just playing in the band

[Chorus]
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on the land

[Verse 3]
Standing on a tower
World at my command
You just keep a turning
While i'm playing in the band
If a man among you
Got no sin upon his hand
Let him cast a stone at me
For playing in the band

[Outro]
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on the land
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak daybreak on the land

[Verse 1]
Out in the West Texas town of El Paso
I fell in love with a Mexican girl
Night time would find me in Rosa's Cantina
Music would play and Felina would whirl

Black as the night were the eyes of Felina
Wicked and evil while casting a spell
My love was strong for this Mexican maiden
I was in love, but in vain I could tell

One night a wild young cowboy came in
Wild as the West Texas wind
Dashing and daring, a drink he was sharing
With wicked Felina, the girl that I love
So in anger

I challenged his right for the love of this maiden
Down went his hand for the gun that he wore
My challenge was answered in less than a heartbeat
The handsome young stranger lay dead on the floor
Just for a moment I stood there in silence
Shocked by the foul evil deed I had done
Many thoughts ran through my mind as I stood there
I had but one chance and that was to run

Out through the back door of Rosa's I ran
Out where the horses were tied
I picked a good one, he looked like he could run
Up on his back and away I did ride
Just as fast as I

Could from the West Texas town of El Paso
Out through the badlands of New Mexico
Back in El Paso my life would be worthless
Everything's gone in life, nothing is left

But it's been so long since I've seen the young maiden
My love is stronger that my fear of death

I saddled up and away I did go, riding alone in the dark
Maybe tomorrow a bullet may find me
Tonight nothing's worse than this pain in my heart
And as last here I

Am on the hill overlooking El Paso
I can see Rosa's Cantina below
My love is strong and it pushes me onward
Down off the hill to Felina I go
Off to my right I see five mounted cowboys
Off to my left ride a dozen or more
Shouting and shooting, I can't let them catch me
I've got to make it to Rosa's back door

Something is dreadfully wrong, for I feel
A deep burning pain in my side
It's getting harder to stay in the saddle
I'm getting weary, unable to ride
But my love for

Felina is strong
And I writhe where I've fallen
Though I am weary, I can't stop to rest
I see the white puff of smoke from the rifle
I feel the bullet go deep in my chest

From out of nowhere, Felina has found me
Kissing my cheek as she kneels by my side
Cradled by two loving arms that I'll die for
One little kiss and Felina

Good-bye

[Verse]
All I know is something like a bird
Within her sang
All I know she sang a little while
And then flew on

Tell me all that you know
I'll show you
Snow and rain

If you hear that same sweet song again
Will you know why?
Anyone who sings a tune so sweet
Is passing by

Laugh in the sunshine
Sing
Cry in the dark
Fly
Through the night
Don't cry now
Don't you cry
Don't you cry
Anymore
La-la-la-la
Sleep
In the stars
Don't you cry
Dry your eyes on the wind
La-la-la-la
La...

[Verse 1]
Laid back in an old saloon, with a peso in my hand
Watching flies and children on the street
And I catch a glimpse of black-eyed girls who giggle when I smile
There's a little boy who wants to shine my feet
And it's three days ride from Bakersfield and I don't know why I came
I guess I came to keep from paying dues
So instead I've got a bottle and a girl who's just fourteen
And a damn good case of the Mexicali Blues. Yeh!

[Chorus]
Is there anything a man don't stand to lose
When the devil wants to take it all away?
Cherish well your thoughts, and keep a tight grip on your booze
Cause thinkin' and drinkin' are all I have today

[Verse 2]
She said her name was Billy Jean and she was fresh in town
I didn't know a stage line ran from Hell
She had raven hair, a ruffled dress, a necklace made of gold
All the French perfume you'd care to smell
She took me up into her room and whispered in my ear
"Go on, my friend, do anything you choose."
Now I'm payin' for those happy hours I spent there in her arms
With a lifetime's worth of the Mexicali Blues

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
And then a man rode into town, some thought he was the law
Billy Jean was waiting when he came
She told me he would take her, if I didn't use my gun
I'd have no one but myself to blame
I went down to those dusty streets, blood was on my mind
I guess that stranger hadn't heard the news
Cause I shot first and killed him, Lord, he didn't even draw
And he made me trade the gallows for the Mexicali Blues

[Chorus]

[Verse]
Look for a while at the china cat sunflower
Proud walking jingle in the midnight sun
Copperdome bodhi drip a silver kimono
Like a crazy quilt stargown through a dream night wind

Krazy Kat peeking through a lace bandanna
Like a one-eyed cheshire, like a diamond-eye jack
A leaf of all colors plays a golden-string fiddle
To a double-e waterfall over my back
Comic book colors on a violin river crying leonardo
Words from out a silk trombone

I rang a silent bell, beneath a shower of pearls
In the eagle-winged palace of the Queen Chinee

[Chorus]
I know you, rider, going to miss me when I'm gone
I know you, rider, going to miss me when I'm gone
Going to miss your baby, from rolling in your arms

[Verse 1]
Laid down last night, Lord, I could not take my rest
Laid down last night, Lord, I could not take my rest
My mind was wandering like the wild geese in the West

[Verse 2]
The sun will shine in my back door someday
The sun will shine in my back door someday
March winds will blow all my troubles away
I wish I was a headlight, on a northbound train
I wish I was a headlight, on a northbound train
I'd shine my light through cool Colorado rain

[Chorus]
I know you, rider, going to miss me when I'm gone
I know you, rider, going to miss me when I'm gone
Going to miss your baby, from rolling in your arms

[Outro]
I know you, rider, going to miss me when I'm gone
I know you, rider, going to miss me when I'm gone
Going to miss your baby, from rolling in your arms
Driving that train, high on cocaine
Casey Jones you better, watch your speed
Trouble ahead, trouble behind
And you know that notion just crossed my mind

This old engine
Makes it on time
Leaves Central Station
At a quarter to nine
Hits river junction
At seventeen to
At a quarter to ten
You know it's traveling again

Driving that train
High on cocaine
Casey Jones you better
Watch your speed
Trouble ahead
Trouble behind
And you know that notion
Just crossed my mind
Trouble ahead
A lady in red
Take my advice
You'd be better off dead
Switch-man sleeping
Train hundred and two
Is on the wrong track
And headed for you

Driving that train, high on cocaine
Casey Jones you better, watch your speed
Trouble ahead, trouble behind
And you know that notion just crossed my mind

Trouble with you is
The trouble with me
Got two good eyes
But we still don't see
Come round the bend
You know it's the end
The fireman screams and
The engine just gleams

Driving that train, high on cocaine
Casey Jones you better, watch your speed
Trouble ahead, trouble behind
And you know that notion just crossed my mind
Driving that train, high on cocaine
Casey Jones you better, watch your speed
Trouble ahead, trouble behind
And you know that notion just crossed my mind

And you know that notion
Just crossed my mind
Truckin', got my chips cashed in
Keep truckin', like the do-dah man
Together, more or less in line
Just keep truckin' on

Arrows of neon and flashing marquees out on Main Street
Chicago, New York, Detroit and it's all on the same street
Your typical city involved in a typical daydream
Hang it up and see what tomorrow brings

Dallas, got a soft machine;
Houston, too close to New Orleans;
New York's got the ways and means
But just won't let you be, oh no

Most of the cats that you meet on the streets speak of true love
Most of the time they're sittin' and cryin' at home
One of these days they know they gotta get goin'
Out of the door and down to the street all alone

Truckin', like the do-dah man
Once told me "You've got to play your hand"
Sometimes your cards ain't worth a dime
If you don't lay'em down
Sometimes the light's all shinin' on me
Other times I can barely see
Lately it occurs to me
What a long, strange trip it's been

What in the world ever became of sweet Jane?
She lost her sparkle, you know she isn't the same
Livin' on reds, vitamin C, and cocaine
All a friend can say is "Ain't it a shame"

Truckin', up to Buffalo
Been thinkin', you got to mellow slow
Takes time to pick a place to go
And just keep truckin' on

Sittin' and starin' out of the hotel window
Got a tip they're gonna kick the door in again
I'd like to get some sleep before I travel
But if you got a warrant, I guess you're gonna come in

Busted, down on Bourbon Street
Set up, like a bowlin' pin
Knocked down, it gets to wearin' thin
They just won't let you be, oh no

You're sick of hangin' around and you'd like to travel
Get tired of travelin' and you want to settle down
I guess they can't revoke your soul for tryin'
Get out of the door and light out and look all around
Sometimes the light's all shinin' on me;
Other times I can barely see
Lately it occurs to me
What a long, strange trip it's been


Truckin', I'm a goin' home
Whoa whoa baby, back where I belong
Back home, sit down and patch my bones
And get back truckin' on
Hey now get back truckin' home

[Verse 1]
If I had a gun for every ace I have drawn
I could arm a town the size of Abilene
Don't you push me, baby, because I'm moanin' low
And you know I'm only in it for the gold

[Verse 2]
All that I am asking for is ten gold dollars
And I could pay you back with one good hand
You can look around about the wide world over
And you'll never find another honest man

[Chorus]
Last fair deal in the country, Sweet Suzie
Last fair deal in the town
Put your gold money where your love is, baby
Before you let my deal go down

[Verse 3]
Don't you push me, baby, 'cause I'm moanin' low
And I know a little something you won't ever know
Don't you touch hard liquor, just a cup of cold coffee
Gotta get up in the morning and go

[Verse 4]
Everybody's braggin' and drinkin' that wine
I can tell the Queen of Diamonds by the way she shines
Come to daddy on an inside straight
Well I got no chance of losin' this time

[Chorus]
Last fair deal in the country
Last fair deal in the town
Put your gold money where your love is, baby
Before you let my deal go down

[Outro]
Everybody's braggin' and drinkin' that wine
I can tell the Queen of Diamonds by the way she shines
Come to daddy on an inside straight
Well I got no chance of losin' this time

[Verse 1: The Grateful Dead]
We can share the women, we can share the wine
We can share what we got of yours cause we done shared all of mine
Keep on rollin', just a mile to go;
Keep on rollin' my old buddy, you're movin' much too slow

[Verse 2: Jerry Garcia]
I just jumped the watchman, right outside the fence
Took his rings, four bucks in change, ain't that Heaven sent?

[Verse 2.5: Bob Weir]
Hurts my ears to listen, Shannon, burns my eyes to see;
Cut down a man in cold blood, Shannon, might as well've been me

[Verse 3: Bob Weir]
We used to play for silver, now we play for life;
And one's for sport and one's for blood at the point of a knife
And now the die is shaken, now the die must fall
There ain't a winner in the game, he don't go home with all
Not with all

[Verse 4: The Grateful Dead]
Leavin' Texas, fourth day of July
Sun so hot, the clouds so low, the eagles filled the sky
Catch the Detroit Lightnin' out of Santa Fe
The Great Northern out of Cheyenne, from sea to shining sea

[Verse 5: Jerry Garcia]
Gotta go to Tulsa, first train we can ride
Gotta settle one old score, one small point of pride

[Verse 5.5: Bob Weir]
There ain't a place a man can hide, Shannon, will keep him from the sun
Ain't a bed can give us rest now, you keep us on the run

[Verse 6: The Grateful Dead]
Jack Straw from Wichita
Cut his buddy down
Dug for him a shallow grave
And laid his body down

Half a mile from Tucson
By the morning light
One man gone and another to go
My old buddy, you're moving much
Too slow

[Outro: The Grateful Dead]
We can share the women, we can share the wine

[Verse 1]
Me and my uncle went riding down
South Colorado, West Texas bound
We stopped over in Santa Fe
That being the point just about half way
And you know it was the hottest part of the day

[Verse 2]
I took the horses up to the stall
Went to the barroom, ordered drinks for all
Three days in the saddle, you know my body hurt
It being summer, I took off my shirt
And I tried to wash off some of that dusty dirt

[Verse 3]
West Texas cowboys, they's all around
Weed, liquor and money, they load it down
So soon after payday, know it seemed a shame;
You know my uncle, he starts a friendly game
High-low jack and the winner take the hand

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 4]
My uncle starts winning; cowboys got sore
One of them called him, and then two more
Accused him of cheating; oh no, it couldn't be
I know my uncle, he's as honest as me
And I'm as honest as a Denver man can be

[Verse 5]
One of them cowboys, he starts to draw
And I shot him down, lord he never saw
Shot me another, oh damn he won't grow old
In the confusion, my uncle grabbed the gold
And we high-tailed it down to Mexico

[Verse 6]
I love those cowboys, I love their gold
I loved my uncle, god rest his soul
Taught me good, Lord, taught me all I know
Taught me so well, I grabbed that gold
And I left his dead ass there by the side of the road

[Chorus 1]
Rat in a drain ditch, caught on a limb
You know better but I know him
Like I told you, what I said
Steal your face right off your head

[Chorus 2]
Now, he's gone, now he's gone, Lord, he's gone
He's gone, like a steam locomotive
Rolling down the track, he's gone, he's gone
And nothin's going to bring him back, he's gone

[Verse 1]
Nine mile skid on a ten mile ride
Hot as a pistol but cool inside
Cat on a tin roof, dogs in a pile
Nothing left to do but smile, smile, smile

[Chorus 1]

[Verse 2]
Going where the wind don't blow so strange
Maybe off on some high cold mountain chain
Lost one round but the price wasn't anything
A knife in the back and more of the same

[Chorus 2]
Same old, rat in a drain ditch, caught on a limb
You know better but I know him
Like I told you, what I said
Steal your face right off your head

[Chorus 2]
Ne

[Outro]
Like a steam locomotive
Rolling down the track, he's gone, he's gone
And nothing's going to bring him back, he's gone
Ooh, nothing's going to bring him back

[2x]

[Intro]
1,2,3

[Verse 1]
I know I've had you troubled
And I know I've seared your mind
But you know that I love you
And that our love's not blind
And sure my dreams lie with you
But I've many more besides
And if I can't see them through
Our love will slowly die

[Pre-Chorus]
So if you doubt for the time that you're spending
And if you doubt for the love in your heart
Think of London and the girl you're returning
And the days you defend will turn to gold

[Chorus]
So love with your eyes
Love with your mind
Love with your (Whoo!) dare I say forever
Do it for yourself
Do it for the girl
Do it for your (Whoo!) dare I say forever

[Verse 2]
And I've known pious women
Who have led such secret lives
Shameless in the dark, so shameful in the light
And you may not be pious and I’m afraid that I’m not saved
But we could live quite happily and quietly unfazed

[Pre-Chorus]
So if you doubt for the time that you're spending
And if you doubt for the love in your heart
Think of London and the girl you're returning
And the days you defend will turn to gold

[Chorus]
So love with your eyes
Love with your mind
Love with your (Whoo!) dare I say forever
Do it for yourself
Do it for the girl
Do it for your (Whoo!) dare I say forever

[Break]
I was dreaming of the Liffey
I was thinking of the Thames
And now the East River flows by to the same end
And as they all roll past us they never stopped or cared
Are we too sentimental to not look back and stare?

[Pre-Chorus]
So when you doubt for the time that you're spending
And if you doubt for the love in your heart
Think of London and the girl you're returning
And the days you defend will turn to gold

[Chorus]
So love with your eyes
Love with your mind
Love with your (Whoo!) dare I say forever
Do it for yourself
Do it for the girl
Do it for your (Whoo!) dare I say forever

[Intro: Kanye West & John Legend]
I want everyone to put, put their two fingers in the air right now
This a joint with Mos Def and Freeway, it's called "Two Words"
We in the streets, playa, get ya mail (Hold your hands up high)
It's only two places you end up, either dead or in jail
Still nowhere to go (Ooh-ooh), still nowhere to go (Ooh-ooh)

[Chorus 1: Kanye West]
Now throw ya hands up, hustlers, busters, boosters, hoes
Everybody, fuck that
Say "Hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah, hell–"

[Verse: Kanye West]
Ay, yo, two words, Chi-town, South Side, worldwide
'Cause I, rep that, 'til I fuckin' die
One neck two chains, one waist two gats
One wall twenty plaques, dues paid, gimme that
I am limelight, Blueprint five mics
Go Getters rhyme like, should've been signed twice
Most imitated, Grammy nominated
Hotel accommodated, cheerleader prom-dated
Barbershop playa-hated, mom-and-pop bootlegged it
Felt like it rained 'til the roof caved in
Two words, Chi-town raised me crazy
So I live by two words: "fuck you, pay me"
Screamin', "Jesus, save me"
You know how the game be, I can't let 'em change me
Cause on judgment day, you gon' blame me
Look, God, it's the same me
And I basically know now, we get racially profiled
'Cuffed up and hosed down, pimped up and ho'd down
Plus I got a whole city to hold down
From the bottom so the top's the only place to go now

[Chorus 2: Kanye West]
Now throw ya hands up, hustlers, busters, boosters, hoes
Everybody, fuck that
Still no where to go
Still no where to go

[Outro: Kanye West]

I'd get it right, Oh-oh
If you're gonna hate on me forever, can I change
And get it right, Oh-oh
Look, you gotta do what you gotta do, ayy
Look, you gotta do what you gotta do, shut up
Look, you gotta do what you gotta do, ayy
Look, you gotta do what you gotta do, shut up

[Post-Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
If I gotta swear on that forever, I'm not tryna
I'd get it right, Oh-oh
If you're gonna hate on me forever, can I change
And get it right, Oh-oh
(I got my back tonight, I got me)
Look, you gotta do what you gotta do, ayy
Look, you gotta do what you gotta do, shut up
(I got your back tonight, I got you)
Look, you gotta do what you gotta do, ayy
(I got me, I got you)
Look, you gotta do what you gotta do, shut up

[Outro: Kevin Abstract]
And I've got your back tonight
I've got you

[Verse 1]
White sheets, you and me used to lay close
Blue summer, sittin' high in the window
Phone calls every night, had a new glow
My clique running through my mind like a rainbow
We were so in love, so we let go
Took it in our lungs, then we all choked
Long drive, so divine when the sun showed
My clique running through my mind like a rainbow

[Verse 2]
I miss them every night
I miss them by my side
Catch my tears when I cry
My clique on me for life
Driving 'round at dawn, look at you, lip bite
Something in my chest, feel the tension breaks
Want to stand still, won't forget this time
I miss them, I miss them, I miss them

[Verse 3]
White sheets, you and me used to lay close
Blue summer, sittin' high in the window
Phone calls every night, had a new glow

Long drive, so divine when the sun showed
My clique running through my mind like a rainbow (Yeah)

[Verse 1]
I know there's gotta be rain if I want the rainbows
And I know the higher I climb, the harder the wind blows
Yeah, I've gone to sleep night after night punching a pillow
But do you know the darker the night, the brighter the stars glow?

[Chorus]
'Cause I am resilient
A full flower moment
Won't let the concrete hold me back, oh no
I am resilient
Born to be brilliant
You'll see me grow right through the cracks, yeah
'Cause you're gonna watch this flower grow
Right through the cracks

[Verse 2]
I've got to shed all the skin if I want the distance
Let the sun in, pull out the weeds and focus my vision
'Cause there’s no mistakes, just bends and breaks and friction
But do you know the hotter the fire, the purer the gold is?

[Chorus]
'Cause I am resilient
A full flower moment
Won't let the concrete hold me back, oh yeah
I am resilient
Born to be brilliant
I'm gonna grow right through the cracks
Oh

[Bridge]
'Cause I died every winter
But survived all the weather
Look at me now, look at me now
I'm in full bloom, yeah
They tried to poison the water
But I was a little stronger
Look at me now, look at me now
I light up the room, oh yeah

[Chorus]
'Cause I am resilient (I am resilient)
A full flower moment
Won't let the concrete hold me back, no
Oh, I am resilient
Born to be brilliant
I'm gonna grow right through the cracks
Oh, you're gonna watch this flower grow
Right through the cracks

[Intro]
Yeah
Yeah, okay

[Verse 1]
We in a race car, she let me hit it like a space bar
Girl, your life is in your phone, needa take charge
Hopin' that the dealer gonna hit you with a face card
But don't panic, we the planets and we make stars
Day job wasn't workin' out, I been laid off, takin' loss
Everything is A1 steak sauce, drivin' with the breaks off
I'ma-I'ma-I'ma ride though, way beyond the boundary
Where the line go
Sippin' cyanide like it's fine wine
Shit is high tide, when it fall down that's when I rise
Feelin' that's inside, it'll blow your mind
I don't need to know what's yours just to know what's mine
Born in Babylon, droppin' like an atom bomb
Don't flinch, the flow so big it go to Macedon
Oh shit, don't fit inside, then stand out
Yeah, I was a kid, but I'm the motherfuckin' man now

[Pre-Chorus]
And how it feelin'? Well, it's feelin' good
I got my life together like I knew I should
I let 'em read me like an open book
But turn the page on these motherfuckers

[Chorus]
Said, are we there yet?
Are we there yet? Who gon' hold me down?
Are we there yet?
Are we there yet? Who gon' hold me down?

[Verse 2]
Okay, well
He is workin' on a thesis in a Prius, won him many masterpieces
Goddammit, they don't believe it, I'm Pittsburgh born and bred
Come inside, explore my head
Get you rattled, I can see you fragile, you an ornament
Just for show, all the negative, you needa let it go
So much work, it's stackin' up, I think I needa get a clone
Leave the nest, send me home, tell me when you ready
If I disappear awhile, promise that you won't forget me
I'm at the crib watchin' Ed, Edd, Eddy
My bitch naked in the kitchen and she whippin' up spaghetti
I got mo' problems, like Christopher
I'm walkin' with my headphones on, I been depressed so long
But now I'm back at it, like a bad habit to a crack addict
Light a match, 'bout to start shittin' on these motherfuckers
Don't know what it is and isn't with these motherfuckers
I got the juice, play some paper for these motherfuckers
Samurai sword, Kill Bill, Hattori Hanzō
Man in this world, will kill if I got to
It's no Biggie, who shot you?
It's my motherfuckin' city and I got a lock full

[Pre-Chorus]
And how it feelin'? Well, it's feelin' good
I got my life together like I knew I should
I let 'em read me like an open book
But turn the page on these motherfuckers

[Chorus]
Said, are we there yet?
Are we there yet? Who gon' hold me down?
Are we there yet?
Are we there yet? Who gon' hold me down?

[Intro]
Get the fuck outta my face
Byah (Heh)

[Verse 1]
I wake up, rub my eyes, dry vomit on my shirt
The light bulb goes off, my conscience is alert
My ex-girl hate me and the talkin' never work
My demons have no reason and that monster be the worst
Who lived this life well? I'm possibly the first
Got a saga, back by popular demand, I been a honest man
All my life, it's just the real, it ain't the wrong or right
You think the bitches wanna fuck you 'cause your songs is nice?
Blood stains on my shirt, musta had a awesome night
Reincarnate Ray Charles before he lost his sight
I'm on the mic like Jordan Nikes, try to sell my soul
But the devil broke, he can't afford the price
Shootin' pornos, havin' boogie nights
You a cookie-cutter motherfucker, pussy type
Sometimes I feel so blue, but I'm still lookin' white
Shit, I'm just like you, you said you just like who?
Well, I bust right through
Like a nut when you love life too much in a plush white suit
Shine, what the fuck lights do
And my wife just like her pussy 'cause she uptight too
Bro, this my crib, where I live, who the fuck invite you?
I'm a fat bitch addict, love my plus-sized boo
I told her roll over that roll over, that's fun time two
Don't get it twisted 'cause these bitches' bitches love dykes too
I pulled up, pulled out, soon as I cum, I'm through, shit

[Hook]
This, is, the hook
(Yeah) This, is, the hook
(Yeah) This, is (Yeah), the hook
(Yeah) This, is, the hook
(Yeah)

[Verse 2]
Nobody guardin' this, had it locked up before I started it
Retarded shit, kinda like my father but don't Mark a bit
You see, I make it then they market it
Parked the whip in San Diego, findin' out where Carmen lives
These are my hungover thoughts, I'm so ashamed in Notre Dame
With a hunched over walk, yeah
I like my bitches when they fuck more than talk
And have the halos of an angel hidden up in a box
This evil is the easel that we paint upon
And those divas ain't no divas with no make-up on
I'm in the bed, she give me head like, "What's takin' long?"
I'm like, "It's hard to finish when this fuckin' Drake is on"
But it's my favorite song, I'm concentrated on the chord change
My impure brain, take it all the way, ignore pain
"Why you suck my dick like it's a chore, babe?"
I'ma turn these kids into a short stain
I'm too nice, always givin' you what you like
You can trust me, I'm like Dudley, I always do right
Bitches love me, must be the money, I'm on it tonight
Get the action then send her packed on a JetBlue flight
And nobody wanna fuck with a legend, I be on my shit
On a trip twenty-four seven, if you scared, go to church
I'm the God, I'm the Reverend
Most Dope be the squad that I'm reppin', shit

[Hook]
This, is, the hook
(Yeah) This, is, the hook
(Yeah) This, is, the hook
This, is, the ****

[Pre-Bridge]
Well, get ready
(Here comes the bridge)
Ooh, I hope you're ready
(Here comes the bridge)
Ooh, I hope you're ready, ready

I hope you're ready
(Here comes the bridge)
Let's go

[Bridge]
I can sing a song if you want me to sing a song (Woo)
I can sing a song if you want me to sing a song (Say somethin' mean to 'em, baby)
I can sign a song if you want me to sing a song, ooh
I can sign a song if you want me to sing a song
I can sing a song for ya (Keep goin')
If you want me to sing a song, I can sign a song for ya, hey, hey (Woo)
If you want me to sing a song, I can sign a song for ya, hey, hey, hey (Woo)
If you want me to sing a song, I can sign a song for ya, hey, hey
If you want me to sing a song, I can sign a song, you can sign along

[Outro]
Yeah

Only givin' you that real shit
This that motherfuckin' real shit
Real shit, this that real shit
Real shit, this that real shit
Real shit, this that, this that real shit
Real shit, this that motherfuckin' real shit
That real shit, this that motherfuckin' real shit
That real shit that I told you 'bout
The real shit, real shit
This that motherfuckin' real shit, real shit
Are you ready for some real shit?
That real shit, this that motherfuckin' real shit, woo

[Intro] 0:00 - 0:18
Gonna be like that
Where you been lately
Gonna watch my back
Took out my heart just racing
Gonna be like that
The camera flash
Because not so bad
Remember what we had
At land I sing

[Pre-Chorus] 0:18 - 0:32
I-I-I, get very nice
The difference between different sides
Try-y-y-y, to subsidize again

[Chorus] 0:32 - 1:07
I don’t wanna be famous
I just wanna be known
Though I can’t quite explain it
But it’s all just so wrong
I’m not ashamed of all those things that I’ve done
Why can’t I entertain us
Got my eye on the phone
I don’t wanna be famous
I don’t wanna be famous anymore
I don’t wanna be famous
I don’t wanna be famous anymore

[Verse] 1:07 - 1:23
So I take it back
You can’t escape me
But I wish I had
Sick of all this betraying
All the friends I had miserate me
But I know that ends, when I sell that ?
But I can’t be paid

[Pre-Chorus] 1:23  - 1:37
I-I-I, get very nice
The difference between different sides
Try, to subsidize again

[Chorus] 1:37 - 2:10
I don’t wanna be famous
I just wanna be known
Though I can’t quite explain it
But it’s all just so wrong
I’m not ashamed of all those things that I’ve done
Why can’t I entertain us
Got my eye on the phone
I don’t wanna be famous
I don’t wanna be famous anymore
I don’t wanna be famous
I don’t wanna be famous anymore

[Bridge] 2:10 - 2:41
I'm sick of these steps
I’m sick of your mind
I’m sick of fake love
Sick of made up
Let it all die

Maybe it’ll be
A little more free
If you put it all down
Take a look ‘round
Let it all bleed

I don’t wanna be opening up my mouth
Neva gonna be talking up my crowd
Would you rather be over now, over right now
Rather we name this
More than some sanction
I just don’t see how that’s worth any mind

[Chorus] 2:42 - 3:22
I don’t wanna be famous
I just wanna be known
Though I can’t quite explain it
But it’s all just so wrong
I’m not ashamed of all those things that I’ve done
Why can’tI entertain us
Got my eye on the phone
I don’t wanna be famous
I don’t wanna be famous anymore
I don’t wanna be famous
I don’t wanna be famous anymore

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Can you hear the whispers of an innocent, ignorant child?
In the ocean, get to swimmin' or drown
How long has it been since you smiled?
Girl, I love the way your body fit inside that gown
Her Mama was a lady bug, her Papa was an atheist
Workin' on a novel set in Cold War Romania
Chasin' love, idolizin' Joan of Arcadia
Pray the landscapers don't wake her up
I'm a slave to the bass line
Conversation topic got us tangled in the grape vine
Still wide awake I'm, a stranger to the daytime
Vampire, higher than a hang glider
Look around and all I see is gray skies
There's help inside that medicine cabinet
Came in for the answers, but she left with a habit
There's no one on the other end of that telephone
Lets fall asleep to the metronome, yeah

[Chorus: Mac Miller, Mac Miller & SZA]
She's fallin' for her hallucinations
But what's love without imagination? Yeah
Baby, don't let them tell you what's real and what's not
There's a paradise waiting on the other side of the dock, woah
It's only real if it's real to you
(Does it feel?)
It's only real if it's real to you, it's only real if it's real to you
(Is it real? Said, what's it feel like?)

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Yeah
Tell me, is it real if you can't hold it in your arms
But it can touch you?
Feel its texture pressin' up against your chest
You say, "I love you" (You don't hear it back)
Fallin' victim to a world that's filled with satire
Mark Twain admired
Open Tom Sawyer, read a passage to the cab driver
She only in the back seat of a taxi 'cause her car is in the shop with a flat tire
Mom says she believe her, but she always been a bad liar
Had a plan to burn her past, but it backfired
Hold on and be strong, kneel before your king
The land you put your knees on
It won't be long 'til your path finds ya
And if love is just a fantasy
Then what's the problem if you fall in love with fantasy?
(They assume she's confused with delusions she's creatin')
In the waitin' room for psychiatric evaluation
She doesn't have the patience to be treated like a patient
It'll be okay, if she just swallow this pill

[Chorus: Mac Miller, Mac Miller & SZA]
Fallin' for her hallucinations
What's love without imagination? Yeah
Baby, don't let them tell you what's real and what's not
There's a paradise waiting on the other side of the dock, woah
It's only real if it's real to you
It's only real if it's real to you, it's only real if it's real to you
(Yes, yes, y'all)

[Bridge: Mac Miller, Mac Miller & SZA, SZA]
Havin' conversations, with friendly hallucinations
I'll be havin' conversations, with friendly hallucinations
They don't need no explanation, there is beauty in creation
My Lord
Havin' conversations, with friendly hallucinations
I'll be havin' conversations, with friendly hallucinations
They don't need no explanation, there is beauty in creation
My Lord
My Lord

[Outro: Mac Miller, Mac Miller & SZA]
Fallin' for her hallucinations
What's love without imagination? Yeah
Baby, don't let them tell you what's real and what's not
There's a paradise waiting on the other side of the dock, woah
It's only real if it's real to you
It's only real if it's real to you, it's only real if it's real to you

Ayy, say it to 'em, shake the rhythm up out of my fist
And ok, yuh

[Verse]
At school they takin' pictures like robberazzi
I know a lot of people tryna sabotage me
Ronda Rousey when I hit the game, bitch I lit the flame
That's what Tommy taught me (Bitch)
Five star, you used to be in the lobby
Now she call me papi out in Abu Dhabi
(Haha, nah I'm just playing, I've never been to Abu Dhabi)
Aye, aye, aye, aye
Fuck an imitator and a complicator
I've been rolling around in my own shit (Ayy)
If you talkin' down, suck my whole dick
And you 

[?] just like

...
And if you ever did me wrong you on some hoe ass shit (Ayy, ayy, ayy, yuh)

[Chorus]
Yeah, uh, ayy, I said it once and won't say it again (Hoe ass bitch, you a hoe ass bitch)
Yeah, uh, ayy, I said it once and won't say it again (Hoe ass bitch, you a hoe ass bitch)
Yeah, uh, ayy, I said it once and won't say it again (Hoe ass bitch, you a hoe ass bitch)
Yeah, uh, ayy, I said it once and won't say it again, say it again, ayy, I will, ayy (Hoe ass bitch, you a hoe ass bitch)
It's been 30 days since I last saw you
30 days since we had nothing to fear
It's been too long now
I'm scared that I'm forgetting how you feel
30 days is way too real

It's been 4 weeks since I last saw you
4 weeks since we made plans to go north
It's been too long now
I'm scared that I'm forgetting you
I feel all out of sorts
4 weeks and I'm not yours

I've been reading books
I've started puzzles
I've been listening to all the greats
I've been trying new foods
I've been buying new shoes
But I can't seem to forget that it's been 30 days

It's been a month since I last saw you
No matter how you say it, it still means the same
It's been too long now
I think that I've forgotten how long it takes
For me to fall, I'm afraid
This time it wasn't long at all
And why it wasn't, I can't say
In fact it just took
30 days

[Intro: Mac Miller]
Yeah, ya
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, uh

[Verse: Mac Miller & Delusional Thomas]
On Fourth Street, the orphan children play on the jungle gym
Little Timmy broke his arm again on the monkey bars
Johnny's dad got a nicer car than all the other kids
He becomes the alpha and picks on everybody else
Max protects Claire from all the bullies
Claire always wish she was as pretty as Julie
The boys always chase Julie around the sandbox
Claire just waits ’til she gets picked up by her grandpa
All of this before the brainwash starts
Before they get polluted, start thinkin' like adults
Life is fantasy and somersaults then
Before the world tear apart imagination
Before there were rules, before there were limits
Your only enemies were (Want some Brussels sprouts and spinach?)
Me, I used to want to be a wizard, when did life get so serious?
Whatever happened to apple juice and cartwheels?
Whatever happened to apple juice and cartwheels?

[Intro]
Did no one ever teach you how to dance?
Nobody ever taught you how to dance?
Well, well, everyone knows how to dance
There's only so much time

[Verse 1]
Yeah, somebody died today, I
I saw his picture in the funny papers
Didn't think anybody died on a Friday
Some angry banker, some kind of money trader
Recently divorced, was drunk drivin' down the highway
And drove off the bridge to his wedding song
Blew out the bass in his speakers, you can still hear the treble goin'
The hospital was useless, and everything was quiet but the music
Recently, I only meet peace when in deep sleep
Been the same dream: world safe, smile on her face
Waitin' on the other side, I wonder if He'll take me to the other side
Yeah, what your eyes see, too naive for war, and that'll screw ya
Still bet it all on the glory, hallelujah
I heard the answer in the gibberish of an old drunk
All he said was he's in no rush

[Chorus]
If I could just pay my rent by Tuesday
I bet I'd be rich by April Fools' day
The moon's wide awake, with a smile on his face
As he smuggle constellations in his suitcase
Don't you love silence?
Everything quiet but the music, everything quiet but the music
Do you love silence?
Everything quiet but the music

[Verse 2]
Somebody gave birth to a baby boy
I saw his picture in the funny papers
Eleven pounds, named after his uncle Gabriel
His mother cried with her lips against his soft face
Why’d she bring these bright eyes into this dark place?
Oh, sweet, sweet oblivion
Way before the information gets settled in
I swear to God I never wanna sin again
But I fear that (Trouble's on its way)
Yeah, the mind go with age, don't surrender
My mistake, I misplaced all of my remembers
Baby, there's a little vacation in the dresser
Take one for depression, and two for your temper

[Chorus]
If I could just pay my rent by Tuesday
I bet I'd be rich by April Fools' day
The moon's wide awake, with a smile on his face
As he smuggle constellations in his suitcase
Don't you love silence?

[Verse 3]
Oh shit, here come the icebreaker
It's danger when he's bringin' out the lightsaber
The words awesome but he's talkin' outta turn often
I blew the fuck up, then became the world's problem
Bad hygiene, all about that gross life
Hate to see somebody fuckin' up their own life
Just roll the dice, put a twenty on midnight
Have a feelin' we gon' win tonight
'Cause when the snakes start slitherin', you spot the chameleons
You realize you surrounded by reptilians
Shit, I ain't an innovator, just a motherfuckin' illustrator

[Outro]
Why does it matter, at all? Woah, woah

[Intro]
(Did somebody say) Sick of this
Get those Just Eat foods online for me
(Just Eat) We gon' do this Doggy style
Did somebody say Just Eat?

[Verse]
Me, get delivery like a G
See hungry Dogg's gotta eat
I get mine every day, every week
Chicken wings to the crib I'm sittin' in
Burger in the low-low
Hope they kept the pickle in
Wonton on a catamaran
Oodles of noodles, thank you, my man
Tacos to the chateau, please
Did somebody say Just Eat?
Private jet in the night sky
My man hand glide by with my fried rice, right
What could you not love
'Bout a slice on the side of the hot tub? (Ooh)
What you gonna do, boo?
Chocolate fondue right on cue
Even dipping in the sea
I see food, seafood sees me
J-U-S-T  E-A-T
Did somebody say Just Eat?
Chorus: Kevin Abstract
Know it’s hard to let go of me now

Yeah yeah yeah yeah

Verse 1: Kevin Abstract

And my niggas still don’t care about it

Verse: Dom McLennon
Probably thought that I forgot about it yeah
Probably thought that I was (?)

[Intro: Mac Miller]
Yeah

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Well, my good days are exactly like the bad ones
My bitch say that I defy the laws of attraction
I've always been terrified of endin' up normal
Things that we all search for end up findin' us
God is like the school bell, He won't tell you when your time is up
Shit just end up workin' out, why do we wonder why it does?
Yeah, so I asked God to take me on a perfect date
Swear I saw him cryin', don't know why everyone sure it’s rain
Education's shiftin', but I feel we only learn from change
Every time I think about it, shit just starts to hurt my brain
Problems we can't solve always seem to be my favorite ones
Life just gets so borin', playin' superhero makes it fun
So why is "heroism" so close to "heroin"? (Heroin)

[Chorus: Dylan Reynolds]
We are what we believe in
There is no such thing as freedom
But what can we do?
What can we do?
'Cause I see the light at the end of the tunnel
It feels like I’m dyin', dyin', dyin'
I'm dead

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Yeah, they tell you that you need to sleep and suddenly you do
Scared you gon' wake up as someone who isn't you
We've all been down that road before
Poured alcohol on open sores
Nobody can hurt me if I go inside and close the door
Not scared of growin' old and dyin'
Feel this where the answer lives
You wear the garments
Everybody needs to dress some manikins (Make some noise)

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus: Dylan Reynolds]
We are what we believe in
There is no such thing as dreamin'
But what can we do?
What can we do?
'Cause I see the light at the end of the tunnel
It feels like I'm dyin', dyin', dyin'
I'm dead

[Outro]
Make some noise

[Intro]

[Chorus: will.i.am and Fergie]
Your ass look nice when you dress like this
I figure we can go and have sex right quick
Uh uh
It ain't goin down like that
Uh uh
I don't get down like that
Your ice stay bright and you push a nice whip
I figure you can take me to the mall right quick
Uh uh
It ain't goin down like that
Uh uh
I don't get down like that

[Verse 1: T.I.]
As long as the record still spinnin', in the club I'm chillin'
Surrounded by pretty women, money fallin' from the ceilin'
All of a sudden I see a broad I'm feelin'
Grab her by the arm, tell her pause for a minute
Can we talk for a minute? Get lost for a minute?
I tell the DJ, “Cut the music off for a minute,”
I'm nothin' like them lames, If you thought for a minute
We ain't one and the same, maybe you oughta just forget it
Now on second thought, maybe you oughta let me hit it
I challenge you to find a better baller in the business
I know you prolly do your thang, ballin' independent
But I'm playin’ with some change, baby you ain't gotta spend it
Picture winters in Fiji, summers in Venice
Bet that dropped GT would work wonders for your image
Real talk, keep it clean, baby what is gonna hurt?
If you let a nigga see what is up under that skirt

[Chorus: will.i.am and Fergie]
Your ass look nice when you dress like this
I figure we can go and have sex right quick
Uh uh
It ain't goin down like that
Uh uh
I don't get down like that
Your ice stay bright and you push a nice whip
I figure you can take me to the mall right quick
Uh uh
It ain't goin down like that
Uh uh
I don't get down like that

[Post-Chorus: Fergie and will.i.am]
Just because you bought me a little drink in the club don't mean that you gon' be sleepin' with me
Just because me and you’s fuckin, girl it don't mean none, ‘cause you ain't getting money from me
And just because you work a little diamond in your grill don't mean that ya gon' be feeling on me
It ain't goin' down the way you think it's goin' down
It ain't goin' down the way you think it's goin' down

[Verse 2: T.I.]
It ain't no use of running from me, all your friends want me
Arguably, I could be the hottest nigga in the country
Honestly, I be with the hottest bitches in the country
Throw the money and come, but count a nigga out stuntin'
I'm good for popping’ tags, suga I don't do laundry
Catch me in the hood, club crucial on Monday
S65 on the 22” 

[?]
Cribs in Miami, Hollywood, and London
If you in the neighborhood, let a nigga know some
I'll bend you over, beat that pussy like it stole some
Make you feel like you got a hole in your stomach
Say the word, baby I can be as swoll as you want it
Give it to ya till ya feel it in ya toes if you want it
I ain't finished baby, you can get some mo' if you want it
Hey, you gotta know you lookin hot in that dress
Baby what is gon' take to get you outta that dress?

[Chorus: will.i.am and Fergie]
Your ass look nice when you dress like this
I figure we can go and have sex right quick
Uh uh
It ain't goin down like that
Uh uh
I don't get down like that
Your ice stay bright and you push a nice whip
I figure you can take me to the mall right quick
Uh uh
It ain't goin down like that
Uh uh
I don't get down like that

[Post-Chorus: Fergie and will.i.am]
Just because you bought me a little drink in the club don't mean that you gon' be sleepin' with me
Just because me and you’s fuckin, girl it don't mean none, ‘cause you ain't getting money from me
And just because you work a little diamond in your grill don't mean that ya gon' be feeling on me
It ain't goin down the way you think it's going down
It ain't goin down the way you think it's going down

The old kind is broke
With the new world we got
I drink alcohol
I got blaze for my throat
And I do rounds on road
And rewrite the code

One time I ran off with a man who's old
Young one called

Now want something that's solid gold
Two inch wide a million folds
One man for

Go ahead make a wish wave that wand

As the world turns can I take it on

Some days I just don't feel it (Don't feel it, yeah)
Some days I want my days to pass right by and change my spirits (Yeah)
Your hatin' made me fearless (Me fearless)
If it do not make me happy or bread
Then, dawg, well, I just can't deal with it (Deal with it, yeah)
Swear to God I'm 'bout my business (My business, yeah)

Man, the world ain't out to get ya
They just tryna dismiss ya, 'miss ya, 'miss ya

Tell 'em, "It ain't my concern"
You ain't gotta be in my world
Tal'm 'bout this what he say she say

Stay ridin' 'round with my team, we don't give a fuck
I keep my space serene, still don't give a fuck
They don't wanna see me gleam, I been knew wassup

[Verse 3: Christian Alexander]
(Yeah, okay, yeah)
My attention span is outrageous
So invested 'til you come faceless
Where's the finish line that I can work towards?
'Cause otherwise I'm on vacation
My location gone, my dick is long
I'm up and down 'til I make a song
Now tell me what I'm doin' wrong
So I can leave your ass and I make you feel neglected
Paranoid and uninvested
My money's gone but there's a bigger picture I got goin' on
"Who you signin' to? When the album come?
When your next shit drop?
Can you make a song
That goes on the lines of "Going Thru?"
'Cause your new shit's good, but I gotta say
When I heard those chords I was blown away"
Nah, fuck that
My family just wants their son back
Lucky me, I'm just a scumbag
I watch a little TV, then it's back to the lab again
Workin' nights 'cause I wanna compete with producers
Out do these brain-dead losers
Yeah, you hate me, that's excuses, and I hate you too
If we were in the same room I think I'd fuck you too
I'm done with playin' games, you lame excuse of a stoner boy
I'm tired of people weighin' me down
I'm about to drown in this empty void cause
Hey, I'm done with playin' games, shawty
Yeah, she wanna suck my dick, shawty

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract, bearface & Playa]

Shawty like (–day, ooh, yeah, ooh)
They keep twistin' up my words, shawty (–day, ooh, yeah)
Got me stuck right in the dirt, shawty (–day, ooh, ooh, fun)

Nobody sees it like we do
Nobody knows what we've been through
It's been a hell of a year, but I know you got me and I got you
Now look at the love, look at the love
Nobody sees it like we do
Nobody knows what we've been through
It's been a hell of a year, but I know you got me and I got you
Now look at the love, look at the love
Hey slim, how do you feel about getting married?
We don’t have to wait forever, and you don’t have to know the answer right now
		(but if you wanted to I could let u know what it is…)
We can alley-oop!
My boots are alligator
And you’re in pretty white gown

We could look Hollywood; honeymoon I wish u could see what I’m seeing
They’re throwing rice and they’re clapping for you!

Hey slim, how do you feel about moving to the city?
We don’t have to stay forever, and you don’t have to change for anybody else
And I would ride for you, if it’s now or later
I’m your little bloodhound

(Rhinestones on my jeans) don’t raise your voice to make a scene, he was just playin’
I don’t see him the way I see you

Well hey slim, I’m feeling lucky
Wouldn’t mind if you called me up
I promise it won’t take forever;
We don’t have to stay on the phone for a long time
I saw an alley-cat sleeping alone under your Pontiac
I miss you bad

I took my baby on a Saturday bang
Boy, is that girl with you?
Yes, we're one and the same
Now, I believe in miracles
And a miracle has happened tonight
Hee!

[Chorus]
But, if you're thinking about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white
Ooh!

[Verse 2]
They print my message in the Saturday sun
I had to tell them I ain't second to none
And I told 'em about equality
And it's true, either you're wrong or you're right
Hoo!

[Chorus]
But, if you're thinking about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white
Hoo!
Gone withca girl!
Hee-hee!

[Bridge]
I am tired of this devil
I am tired of this stuff
I am tired of this business
So when the going gets rough
I ain't scared of your brother
I ain't scared of no sheets
I ain't scared of nobody
Girl, when the going gets mean

[Rap: L.T.B.]
Protection for gangs, clubs and nations
Causing grief in human relations
It's a turf war on a global scale
I'd rather hear both sides of the tale
See, it's not about races
Just places, faces
Where your blood comes from is where your space is
I've seen the bright get duller
I'm not going to spend my life being a color

[Verse 3]
Don't tell me you agree with me
When I saw you kicking dirt in my eye
Hee-hee!

[Chorus]
But, if you're thinking about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white
I said if you're thinking of being my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white
I said if you're thinking of being my brother
It don't matter if you're black or white

It's black, it's white, hoo! (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
It's black, it's white
It's tough for you to get by (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
It's black, it's white, hoo! (Shamone, dah, ooh, ooh)

[lyrics from snippet]

It was quite a shameless summer for my lover

When the gloom was full of horrors
And the moons were filled with tears
When you had not touched me yet
Oh, take me back to the night we met
I miss our shameless summer sweat
We are here today, Mr. Secretary-General
Determined that no such fate shall befall the United Nations
We are determined that the UN
Should succeed and serve the cause of peace for humankind
So, Mr. Secretary-General, we realize that
(Too much monkey business)
Even in this time of hope
The chance of failure is real
(Too much monkey business)
But this knowledge does not discourage us
(Too much monkey business)
It spurs us on
For the stakes are high
(Too much monkey business)
Do we falter and fail now
And bring down upon ourselves the just anger
(Too much monkey business)
Of future generations?
Or do we continue the work of the founders of this institution?

...and that this place, this floor
Shall be truly the world's last battlefield?
I think it's devastating
Really, what's going on
Some people lack in caring
What's wrong or right

I think of homeless people
Who beg for food and money
I know the bottom line
Is something ain't right now

...the chance of failure is real
This knowledge does not discourage us
It spurs us on

Too much monkey business
One has work to do
Too much monkey business
Conquers part of you

...is enshrined and humanity knows war no longer

[Verse 1]
Let's, let's play pretend
Like you're my friend
And everything is O.K
Then we shall begin
To put an end
To all the games that we play

[Pre-Chorus]
My body's a temple
I'll choose who worships it
Let's keep it simple
No need for a big deal
So if you're ready
Just call me on the phone
I'll be here waiting
No need to be alone

[Chorus]
Ouch, your heart, you're burning me up
Please don't stop, you're making me blush
Ouch, my God, you hit my spot
I just can't get enough of you, of you, of you, of you

[Verse 2]
So, say how have you been
How's your girlfriend
It's funny you're here with me
When you're still with her
And I do prefer
That we don't feel guilty

[Pre-Chorus]
My body is a temple
I'll choose who worships it
Let's keep it simple
No need for a big deal
So if you are ready
Then this is what I'll do
I'll take my time to
You used to use me too

Oh, you do
Ooh, here we go

[Chorus]
Ouch, don't stop, you're burning me up
Please don't stop, you're making me blush
Ouch, don't stop, you hit my spot
I just can't get enough of you
Of you, of you, of you

[Outro]
Do you remember?
How we used to do
I was your girlfriend
We were so true
Let's play pretend
Darlin', the door is open
To my heart and I've been hopin'
That you won't be the one
To struggle with the key
We got lots of time
To get together if we try

The waitin' time is over
No man sees around the corner
Walkin' in the rain and comin' home dry
There's something missin' there
It's easier to care and try

And I try to wash my hands (Ooh, ooh)
And I try to make amends (Ooh, ooh)
And I try to count my friends (Ooh, ooh)

Ooh, ooh, ooh (Ooh, ooh)
Ooh, ooh, ooh (Ooh, ooh)
Ooh, ooh, ooh (Ooh, ooh)
I'd like to take a chance
But shit, Mary, I can't dance
So here's to lookin' up your old address
Golly what a mess
We gotta take the rest and try

We got lots of time
To get together if we try
We got lots of time
To get together if we try
(Ooh, ooh)

[Intro]
Ooh, baby, yeah
Oh, yeah
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Running through this hell, it's hard for me to tell
If you're with or against me
I'm still wishing well, oh
You stay on my conscience
I know that I'm wrong, but
I'll be this way 'till my comfort (Yeah, yeah, ayy)

[Pre-Chorus]
So light me a spliff and then pour me some more
I got some weed, I got some money
I'ma use them to replace your love
Why does it feel good when it's wrong?
I feel like I'm better off when I'm gone
Just another night on my own
This what happen when I'm left alone

[Chorus]
One day at a time, I'm fixing what you broke
Oh, nothing left inside, I, I'm losing my mind
I say that I'm fine but, to myself I'm lying
I'm trying to get by, oh
There's so much life in the ocean
Even life underground
We've a right to some happiness
When it's found
I'm not strong like I used to be
I'm often wrong
I'm often scared that you'll be gone
When you can see
That I'm not what I claim to be
I'm not anything that's good

This could be Paradise
This could be Paradise

There's so much life in the ocean
Living life without sound
Imagine life without music
To be found
If I was scared when you called to me
Right from the start
There was darkness in the sky and in my heart
But if the earth is pulled apart
I'm still yours for good
This could be Paradise
Yes this could be Paradise

It's just a moment
This life ain't never ending
The pages keep on turning themselves
The daylight turns to darkness
The darkness turns to nothing
And nothing turns in on itself

This could be Paradise
Yes this could be Paradise
Paradise
This could be Paradise

There's so much life in the ocean
Living life without sound
Imagine life without music
To be found

It's just a moment
This life ain't never ending
The pages keep on turning themselves
The daylight turns to darkness
The darkness turns to nothing
And nothing turns in on itself
Round and round
And round and round and
Round and round
And round and round and
Round and round
And round and round and
Round and round
And round and round and

[Intro: The Weeknd]
Oh, oh
Oh woah, woah

[Verse 1: Belly]
I'm, I'm destined sippin', purple flippin'
Disco biscus trippin'
You say we friends and shit but you don't ever come and visit
I'm double fistin', mixin' crystals in whatever liquid
I grew up in the murder district, you ain't heard of this shit
I had to ride my own wave, I was burnin' bridges
My brother Stick still whippin', make millions in the kitchen
These bitches keep on plottin' on me, takin' shots and missin'
I see the evil in your eye, got me superstitious, three wishes

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
Uh, yeah
But you're old news, hmm
I'm just tryna show you, yeah
You are only old news, yeah
I'm just tryna show you

Turn that girl into a bad bitch
Turn that bitch into a savage
And you might think she's outstanding
Make that bitch go through practice
Fuck these bitches like a hat trick
Take a couple pills for that magic
These models 'bout to get ratchet
These models 'bout to get ratchet
Give a fuck about what a source say
Don't attach me to your name
All you wanted was more fame
All they wanted was more fame
And you were always a distraction
It was never gonna last, and
You will always be the past, and
You're just tryna get reactions from me

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
But you're old news, hmm
I'm just tryna show you, yeah
You are only old news, yeah
I'm just tryna show you

[Verse 3: Belly]
Come live the high life with a low life
If the pussy right, might go twice
Only smoke blunts if they rolled right
She down enough for the whole night
I'm thinkin' it's really on
Like what type of shit are you really on?
'Cause all we been drinkin' is De Leon
I'm gone but I feel like I'm really home
As long as you still feel the chemistry
The high got you numb but you feelin' me
I live for this shit but it's killin' me
As long as we don't kill the energy
I been mixin' pain with liquor, man
This ain't revenge, it's such a wicked game
That's what karma, what's your stripper name?
That's what karma, what's your stripper name?
Damn, ayy

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
But you're old news, hmm
I'm just tryna show you, yeah
You are only old news, yeah
I'm just tryna show you

You've been a lover and a friend of mine
And I'm still glad to meet you
Though we've known each other all this time, yeah

And of course we're gonna go through some things

Chicks tryna catch, I throw a couple dreams on 'em
It's the weatherman and I'm about rain on 'em
Drop hits on 'em, magic like tricks on 'em
And they can never be me 'cause I throw a hex on 'em
I gotta Benz truck, a Maybach
Yellow two seater Bentley like a lemon drop
Wrist a hundred grand, chest about three hundred grand
Identify me when you see me pop that rubber band
Used to look at chicks sideways since a young boy
Gotta crush on dat dollar ever since a young boy
Now life's a candy store as if I was a young boy
Living life fast lane, rolling in them big toys

In that coupe switching lanes like I'm speed racing
Speeding like a drunk on the weekend
Crash the club like whoosh, what we drinking?
I just blew one and man I'm feeling so right
Look in the rear view my lining looking so tight
I gotta hood chick but all she wanna do is fight
I gotta model chick but she stay higher than a kite
I walk up in the club, you would think I froze time
Been a playa mayne ever since the street sign
Jacob, got a million, face on it, watermelon
Contracts up, Kel's about to make a killing
I ain't only in the game, pimp, I'm from running it
Fourth quarter, give me the ball, bitch

[Pre-Chorus]
To the white mall in them suburbs
'Bout to buy it all and take some numbers

Old man river
That old man river
He must know (say) somethin'
But he don't say nothin'

That old man river
He just keeps rolling along

He don't plant taters
He don't plant cotton
And them that plants 'em
Are soon forgotten

That old man river
He just keeps rolling along

Dark and weary
I'm sick of tryin'
I'm tired of livin'
And scared of dyin'
That old man river
He just keeps rolling along

He don't plant taters
He don't plant cotton
And them that plants 'em
Are soon forgotten

That old man river
He just keeps rolling along
Have you ever been in an airplane?
Up above the clouds, there's no rain
Everything’s clear and it's a brand new beautiful day

Take her down on the ocean
Taste the wind and the spray in your face
Put a mask on your head and dive a while

Lift her up off of the ocean
And if you get the notion
Cut the engine and sail right into the sun
A time to live in dreams
A time to lay beside the hour
We go to the gentle place within

A gentle hand to touch
Your smile's so beautiful
Becomes a part of me

Wonder
Beauty

The child's joyous tear
Within, since he has no fear
Now, where no love really is

The evening swiftly found
Before the new day begins
In this new day, change your heart
Forgive your brother, for life is precious

The child's joyous tear
Within, since he has no fear
Now, where no love really is
Love is
Love is

[Verse 1]
Ms. Nike
Where did your head go?
Can you tell me
Where you think you came from?

I'm not too different, right?
Swear I'm made of stone too
Why would I leave at all?
It's so convenient here with you

[Chorus]
Don't feel like the one for you
Don't feel like the one at all
What's the catch? Whatcha want from me?
Just convenience after all
After all
After all
After all

[Verse 2]
Nike, where did your head go?
Do you love me or just hate being alone?
I might too
I might too
I might (Yeah)

[Chorus]
Don't feel like the one for you
Don't feel like the one at all
What's the catch? Whatcha want from me?
Just convenience after all
What you mean you believe in me?
Never saw you at my show
All this youth is just wasted away
You're just here ‘cause we live kinda close
After all
After all
After all
Let's all snap first
Okay

I got the spirit
(Oh yeah)
I know you want it
(Oh yeah)
But you can't have it
(Oh yeah)
Cause I got it
(Oh yeah)

It's in my hands
(Oh yeah)
I can't write
(Oh yeah)
It's in my eyes
(Oh yeah)
I can't see
(Oh yeah)
It's in my mouth
(Oh yeah)
I can't talk
(Oh yeah)
It's in my nose
(Oh yeah)
I can't breathe
(Oh yeah)
It's in my legs
(Oh yeah)
I can't walk
(Oh yeah)
It's in my uh
(Oh yeah)
I can't uh
(Oh yeah)
Oh yeah
(Oh yeah)
Oh yeah

[Verse 1]
I won't apologize
The light shone from in your eyes
It isn't gone
And it will soon come back again

[Verse 2]
Now we go our separate ways
Lookin' for better days
Sharin' our little boy
Who grew from joy back then

[Chorus]
And it's all because of that love we knew, babe
That makes the world go 'round
Yes, it do, yes, it do
Oh
Well, it's all because of that love we knew, babe
That makes the world go 'round
Separate ways

[Verse 3]
Me for me, you for you
Happiness is never through
It's only a change of ways
And that is nothing new

[Verse 4]
I'm feelin' better now
I live more alive somehow
My eyes are opened
And my heart is pourin' through

[Chorus]
And it's all because of that love we knew, babe
That makes the world go 'round
Yes, it do, yes, it do
Oh yes, it do
It's all because of that love for you, babe
Made the world go separate ways
Separate ways
Means that we'll go separate ways
Oh, the feeling's gone
Why is it so hard
To hang on to your love?
Oh, the things we do
To live beyond the fears
And move on through the years

Think I'll go to Mexico
Gonna take my time and go down slow
Making love in Mexico
Think I'll go to Mexico

Oh, those sandy beaches
Daddy is a travelin' man

[Intro]
Let's go to Florida
Palm trees and shit, man (Okay, here we go)
Palm trees and humid weather

[Interlude]
It was like a town in Florida in the, in the fifties, you know?
I don't know, there was a lot of white buildings and
They were really white, I could see them
They were about seven or eight stories tall
All the, all the people were walking around and
Just looked so good, you know
They all had their, uh, blue dresses and nice pants on
You know, and they're, all of 'em are drinking pop
From, you know, with straws in the bottles
Things were lookin', you know, sun was shinin' so bright
The downtown looked incredible, I couldn't believe it
There were gliders flyin' around in the sky
This guy is flying around in gliders, you know, and they
They'd swoop between the buildings and they
They'd go down the alleyways, you know
And they make a sharp left and a sharp right
And, uh, it's like I—
I couldn't believe that it was really happening, you know?
So I said, you know, "I don't believe this, this isn't real"
And just as I said that, this guy in the glider
Was coming right through the center of town
And he ran into the building in the middle of town
Fifteen-story high building, right in the center of town
He started tumbling through the air, you know, and, uh
His glider crashed in the alley and, uh
I noticed this couple on the, uh, on the parking lot
And, uh, they, they were just walking together in conversation, you know?
Like, uh, nothing else was happening
And, uh, looking up, they noticed the tumbling man coming through the air
And, uh, he, he came right down and landed right on them
And made an awful sound and, uh—
I ran over there, I could see that they were
They were really gone, you know
But on the ground beside them was this little baby, uh, dressed in
It just had a red blanket wrapped around it
So I picked it up and took it to my car
You know, over on the corner, which wasn't too far away
And I put it in the back seat
I don't know whether it was a boy or a girl
I, I didn't look, you know, I just put it down
It was sleeping and I looked and a crowd had gathered on the parking lot
This beautiful lady was coming down the street
And I, I looked at her, and she looked right at me and I—
She said, "That's my baby in the back of your car there"
I said, "Oh, no, no
No, that baby belongs to that, to that dead couple on the parking lot"
And, uh, she said, "No, no, you're wrong, you're wrong
What happened to them?"

[Verse 1]
I feel like I just woke up from a bad dream
And it's so good to have you sleepin' by my side

[Chorus]
Although I'm not so sure
If I even know your name
Hold on, baby, hold on
We can go gliding through the air
Far from the tears you've cried

[Verse 2]
Yes, you're the one I'm talkin' to this mornin'
With your mind so kind and your friendly body lying

[Chorus]
In my bungalow of stucco
That the glory and success spawned
Hold on, baby, hold on
It doesn't matter if you're the one
We'll know before we're done

[Verse 1]
Who are you? Where are you goin' to?
What's your name? Why aren't you showin' through?
I look in your eyes and I don't know what's there
You poison me with that long, vacant stare
You dress like her and she walks in your words
You frown at me and then you smile at her

[Verse 2]
Are you my friend? Are you my enemy?
Can we pretend to live in harmony?
You come through in the weirdest way
You copy her with the words that you say
I need that girl like the night needs the day
I don't need you getting in my way

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
Vacancy, vacancy
Vacancy, vacancy
Vacancy, vacancy
Vacancy, vacancy

[Refrain]
Who are you? Where are you goin' to?
What's your name? Why aren't you showin' through?

[Verse 1]
Overtime, are we hittin' overtime?
Kiss me like I’m gonna die
Yeah, I might tell you over wine
That something's in the way this time
Maybe your worth is more than mine

[Verse 2]
Maybe it's ‘cause I missed my flight
Yeah, what’s the score? Tell me, where's the line?
Goin' overtime
Tell me what you had in mind, yes
Oh-oh

[Chorus]
Yeah, yeah, ooh
Tell me if you wanna go
Ooh
Tell me if you wanna go
Ooh
(Okay)

[Verse 3]
My God
My boo is so fuckin' fine
Walking like the ground is fire
Pick you up and burn my tire
In the city, got a couple fines
In the glove box, eight or nine
You say someday I'll be rich, it's fine
Overtime

[Chorus]
Ooh, ooh
Tell me if you wanna go
Tell me if you wanna—
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Tell me if you wanna go
Ooh
Tell me if you wanna go

[Outro]
(Yes sir)

[Verse 1]
Have I told you yet that I'm so lonely I could die?
I wear it like a watch, can you tell me why I wear it all the time?

[Verse 2]
Sixteen again, no one ever answers my calls
Is this how it's gonna be for my whole life?

[Chorus]
I wanna know (Ooh)
I wanna know (Ooh)

[Verse 3]
All this longing only hits when I'm stalling
At the red light on Western Avenue
Tell me, what's the time?
One more light and I might die

[Verse 4]
I'm scared of working too hard
I'm scared of working not enough
How soon is two weeks when it already has been two months?
Are you still having fun? (With me)

[Chorus]
I wanna know (Ooh)
I wanna know (Ooh)
Ain’t Saying I’m perfect

Holdin my dogs down to the right and I got my baby to the left
Both of 'em been on high alert for any sign of disrespect
So where your head at player?
You in the mud or you in the clouds
You with your plug when the shit went down
Now you both got blood that you can’t get out
Hope we don't drown, niggas is clowns
But it ain't no ringleader in that circus
Rollin' up dreams, smoke away my purpose
How a nigga hollow with a bulletproof surface, damn

[Bridge: bearface]
Push start, baby, like she drive a Benz truck (Woo)
You ain't got no money, she don't wanna link up (Grr)
And if he fuck up, it's one call to the mob (Grr)
Pull up 'round the corner and we make the block hot

[Verse 3: Matt Champion]
No reassurance, this here, I burn it
I got insurance for the way I'm 'bout to shock the systems

I think I'll leave (I think I'll leave)
Leave 'em all together, means everything to me

Have you ever left, left yourself behind?
Have you ever lied and just replied "I'm fine"?
'Cause I can see you've lost, lost the light in your life

[Pre-Chorus]
Wanna run like your mascara
Wine-stained lips talkin' to the mirror
If the sun comes up, don't even care at all

Promise one day, baby, they're gonna dry
Just keep on dancin' with those teary eyes

If love has left you with, with a question mark

[Verse 1: Lil LA]
It's late night and I'm thinkin' of some thick thighs to get in
Sittin' by the phone for a call for the weekend
Phone rings maybe it's some cut on the late tip
Tryna get my jimmy wet from her tongue and her lips
So I picked up (hello) What's up who could this be
(Baby it's Monique a real freak out of zone 3)
What's really good in the hood with your fine ass
I'm tryin grip ass and pull hair from the back fast
Won't you come over so we can get this thing poppin'

So fuck with ya boy cause I'm right down in trill town

[Verse 2: Don P]
When I stepped up to her hey I knew it was on
She said she had a man but he was at home
But she still put her number yep in my phone
Told me to give her a call when I got home
When I called her I told her like this
I don't want to be your man but we can be cut friends
So come on over I got it all laid out
We can have a couple of drinks and freak all over the house
When she came to the door I already knew it was her
Knock knock come on in I'm just?
I like your outfit baby but lose that shirt
Lose that shirt toss that bra throw those draws
Before you knew it we were freakin' in the hall
Nice round ass I was grippin' it all
I like the way she threw me up against the wall
Then went down on me start lickin' my balls
I'm like this is how life should be, it's goin' down
She got her legs wide I'm inside
She's screamin' out while I suck them thick thighs
I'm about to skeet baby turn around
Let Don P take you to trill town

[Chorus: T-Pain]
You can be my cutty cutty buddy
Fo' sho' you can ride with me
Girl don't act like you don't already know

Lookin' at you got me wantin' to do somethin' freaky to ya
Say you need a nigga in ya life to keep it kinky for ya
Cause all you gotta do is keep it G and I'll give it to ya
Come through in the middle of the night and I'll be here for ya
Just relax let me free your mind and take you out of space
And if we got on clothes then after that then we out of place

Million dollar wardrobe

[Verse 1: J. Herd]
Uh, we the best in the area
Lookin' at the monsters to the right, they scary, huh?
That's right, I'm with my dogs like a terrier
Put you on your back like James Ferrier, girl, I wanna marry ya
Stay at ya crib like a Marriott
You dudes just fruity like a apricot
My monkey business is what I'm about, but a ape I'm not
I twist my story up, escape the plot, jot on the page is hot
Twist my laces up in double knots
Watch me run from cops, dip out like dippin' dots
Posted in the parking lot, her word against his
J. Herd murdered this shit, you ain't heard of it, bitch, uh
I'm always runnin' like Ralph 

[?]
Get off my cheese, I'm on the grind like the grater
Malcolm and Jon, ain't nobody greater

Hey girl
What is your name?

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Yeah, it's Easy Mac, homie
Easy Mac almost rolls off your tongue
I wear the crown round town, I'm too old to be young
I roll up a blunt, hip-hop has moulded a son
You desire a messiah, man? I told you I've come
Pullin' rhymes out my mind, you can call me an exorcist
I'm next to spit, take notes, I'm the best at this
I'm on top of shit, people please get off my dick
I'm workin' like an 

[?], acknowledge it, I slaughter shit
Me and Herd were about to murder this, my turn to spit
Learned it quick, up on the corner like I'm workin' it
I'm servin' hits, cursin' verses, what my purposes is
If you ain't feel my shit then your ass'll get converted quick
I'm the Jewish Lennox Lewis, yeah, I like to fight
A cut for 50, Bob Barker, yeah, the price is right
I spit that gas, if you bring the light, I might ignite
That's why I keep a bucket of water next to the mic

[Intro: 

[?] & George W. Bush]
In Nashville, the president tried to keep up the pressure
There's an old saying in Tennessee—I know it's in Texas, probably in Tennessee—that says, fool me once... shame on... shame on you. Fool me—can't get fooled again

[Verse 1]
What's the matter, all your guns have a cold?
'Cause y'all be lettin' bullets run out like you blowin' your nose
You just a 

[?]
Family of four hits the floor with the 

[?]
I ain't hatin' on your duty, y'all some soldiers of war
Kids dyin' in the street, don't even know 

[?]
You've heard it before, victims hidden by the president
Invadin' countries for some weapons, missin' all the evidence
Imprison the prisoners, listen to 

[?]
Look at yourself, takin' orders from your minister

[?], you's a P.O.W
Ain't a real man if every death doesn't trouble you
George W., you just not learnin'
Brainwashed by the sermon, you thought you heard certain
One in a dozen, a cousin didn't have a choice
Wanted to go home, but they didn't let him have a voice
Say it was right, wanted to make him a wife
But the evil 

[?] people already takin' his life
So if ya takin' a stand, make sure that you can
And don't ever speak if you not raisin' your hand

[?] savin' his funds
Dreamin' 'bout the doctor, lawyer that one day he'd become
'Bout to be playin' with guns, they'd say it was dumb
How you supposed to hide when you got nowhere to run
It's a shame 'cause 

[?] would've been a great father
Why bother to 

[?] praise Allah
I oughta celebrate my cousin's memory
But who deserves a penalty in a fight without an enemy?

[Chorus]
We brothers in arms, we can't give a hand
I can't sit back and let it happen, livin' to stand
Takin' it on as my personal mission
Cry out for help, but ain't nobody listen

[Verse 2]
Kids dream about just bein' some thugs
But they just shrug when you ask them if they busted a slug
And now you dropped out of school 'cause you thought it was cool
Forgot that your crew never even shot at a dude
When you cocked up the Uzi, now you locked into juvie
Tryna imitate the gangsters that you saw in the movies

[?] and you still just a goonie
Tryna pull that if I don't move, you're gonna shoot me
Go ahead, do me in if that's how it has to happen
'Cause I'ma keep rappin' when the people stop clappin'
Stop askin' 'cause I'm hatin' not lovin'
You're nothin' if you're willin' to shoot down your own brother

[Verse 3]
I ain't tryna act like a modern prophet
I don't even give charity money out my pocket
The Glock? Nah, never cocked it
So drop it, haters need to stop it
Words seek your brain like a heat-seekin' rocket
I talk the talk as well as rock it
I speak from the heart, haters just mock it
Tryna reunite people like Pac did
God, is there a chance that you're there?
If you're listenin', will you please answer my prayers?
I know it's been a while since our last conversation
I think Satan's been givin' me temptation
It's your vocation to give me salvation
So please, can you help me with my current situation?
Since creation, my orientation
I've had the information, given aspiration
When can I expect the next resurrection?
I'm lookin' in the mirror, not seein' a reflection
So if you see Easy Mac, bless him
'Cause he's in need of protection

[Chorus]
We brothers in arms, but we can't give a hand
I can't sit back, let it happen, livin' to stand
Takin' it on as my personal mission
Cry out for help, but ain't nobody listen
We brothers in arms, but we can't give a hand
I can't sit back, let it happen, livin' to stand
Takin' it on as my personal mission
Cry out for help, but ain't nobody listen

[Outro]
Nobody listens, 

[?] affection
Comin' from both sides, changin' direction
I'm watchin' you other rappers like inspection
And then I'll trash you like garbage collection

[Verse 1: D-Wreck]
Listen closely, I'll introduce my boys
Too green scene, I’m playin' lose the toys
And in the game, we collect the most coins
Respect the fact 

[?] sit back, seize my points
Watch out, of the members in the crew
D-Wreck will get plays while Mac do what they do
We dubbed on the haze when 

[?]
Trigger ready to pull through
Where blunts are always coned and hell has been well
The city is only the four-hundred and twelve
Easy Mac is notorious, got a story to tell
Posted up in the Breeze, 

[?] trees to sell

[Interlude: Mac Miller]
Yeah
That's D-Wreck, baby
Spittin’ that fire
But I gotta come back real quick
Yeah
Hahaha, I'm back (Yeah, yo, yo, yo)

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Anybody on the galaxy can battle me
Reality is that your voice higher than the mountain's peak
Malcolm's scheme, MySpace, blaze and bizarre
Crave haze, gettin' high so I can play with the stars and faded on Mars
Ha, I'm out of this world
Yeah, 

[?] see me out with your girl
Head goes on my neck, I can't hear the soundtrack
Hit me, bounce back, what you know about that? 

[?] (Yes)
Malcolm is not an alchemist, mind hard to read like some calculus
About to spit, kick a bit, that's the shit
I spit, y’all think y’all havin' acid trips
Words attached to lips, I get cash and chicks
Open up my closest, then you’ll see that stash of bricks
Dog is barkin', so I'ma start saggin' dick
The kid that goes harder than the average

[Intro]
Yo, check it, yo
Uh, yo
Aight, look (It's that good shit)
Let me just rap somethin' to how we do this on the East Coast
'Cause I ain't fuckin' with the other shit
Look, look

[Verse 1]
On the east side, we ride on the weed high
Jackin' cats packin' fat stacks in their Levi's
Rap for scraps at crack shacks that we be by
Fee-fi, hear me comin' down where ya reside, creepin'
Runnin' through ya house while ya sleepin'
No reason, hoes at Four Seasons
I'ma keep rhymin' 'til I die and stop breathin'
I'ma keep grindin' 'til my mind hits the ceilin'
How ya not feelin', we stay dangerous
Major is to plagiarists gettin' paid for shit
This ain't a game to us, so don't play with us
Watch us combust while we kick it spontaneous
Judges favor us, they know we came to bust
Takin' candies from babies just like a stranger does
Parades in they names, ain't gon' rain for us
We real and rap while you lames stay changin' up
Guns aimed at us, we keep on keepin' on
Flee when the heat is on, fiend when the weed is gone
Dream 'bout bein' gone, the easel that we bleed upon see the wrong
Ya hungry? We need to feed ya songs
Mac is nice with the appetite, I'm the cook
Ya shook, one too many pages taken from the book
Looked at crook, I stayed with the steel
And if I'm bein' ill, it's just the way that I feel
I say what is real
So you better hear it, fool
I'm a lyrical miracle, rap imperial (Yeah)
Turn shit around like a steerin' wheel
I knocked you other rappers out, now I'm here to kill
Everything you hear is real, haters fuckin' fear the deal

[Chorus 1]
Have you prepared for your last meal?
(I don't think you have, I don't think you have, I don't think you have)
Have you prepared for your last meal?
(I don't think you have, I don't think you have, I don't think you have, homie)
(What?) Prepared for your last meal? (Yeah)
Prepared for your last meal? (Easy Mac, homie)
Prepared for your last meal? (Straight killin' cats, yo)
Prepared for your last meal? (Haha, lyrically)
Have you prepared for your last meal? (Aight, look, look)

[Verse 2]
Around here, all we know is, "Please clutch"
Please teachers and preachers, I need Jesus
I ain't a Christian, religion is a prison of superstitions
So listen when I'm spittin' sharp like circumcision (Ha)
Yeah, hear me on the mic, be like, "He's rough"
Get off my dick, you can suck on deez nuts
Ya need us, like mothers need to cook
Ya skeed and shook from the weed I took, so read a book
Maybe that will help you to relax, ya passive, I'm massive
Like NASA and that bastard
But the only thing fat about me is my cash
I smash tracks on you, ass, so you should probably...

[Chorus 2]
Prepare for your last meal, prepare for your last meal
Easy Mac is killin' cats, so you should
Prepare for last meal

[Outro]
Yeah, that's how it go down, homie
Have you prepared for your last meal?

[Intro: Mac Miller & B.DuBB]
Ayo, Crooklyn Dodgers, dirtier than Brooklyn water, haha
Yeah, let me get that hit again
Yo, I'm faded now, dog
Let me get into this shit (Listen)

[Verse 1: Mac Miller & B.DuBB]
Ayo, I spit shit from the tip of my tongue (Yeah)
And hit spliffs as if they was hit from my lungs
Gettin' skeed, throwin' more trees than fit in the blunt
But I keep movin' 'cause there's shit to get done (Done, yeah)
I'm philosophical, but logical, kid is so phenomenal
Been blazed, turn the page to my chronicle
So 

[?] chronic 

[?] just like a burden (Yeah)
Step to my cypher and I'm certain that it's curtains
Rolled a Dutchie and sparked a tree (Yup)
It ain't hard for me (Yup,) flow is an art for me
So I'ma keep goin' 'til it's hard to breathe
I'm always blazin' arrows like it's archery
That's why I know it's 

[?] is off for me (Yeah)
I play my nemesis like Sega Genesis
And I never gave a fuck like syllabus (Nah)
The fifth elements, you can never measure what my presence is (Nope)

[Verse 2: B.DuBB]
And my presence is with precedence
So you can go and question up the evidence, 'cause we the effin' presidents (Haha, yup)
It's definite we blessin' it, cheffin' up the testament (Woo)
Bitch, I got a chest with an S in it
And what's up with that lil' ding in the background? (What is that 

[?]?)
Come around my squad and get your niggas smacked down
I clap clowns, need they face painted with frowns (Yeah)
Ran the whole circus out of the towns, this my city
Spit it quick, got blink, velocity
And while my eyes chink I think while I'm sittin' (Well)
Musically, 

[?] speakers, hear the frequency (Yup)
With for water for your well, I'm the deepest sea
Speak to me, I got weed that leave you sleepily

[?] you ain't chiefin' what you need to be

[Verse 3: Mac Miller]
And we puffin' many flavors
Stackin' up strawberry purple like a pack of Life Savers

[Verse 4: B.DuBB]
Yo, I blaze piff 'til I stay lifted
'Til you know my whole day twisted (Oh, yeah?)
Them kids way gifted

[Verse 5: Mac Miller & B.DuBB]
Let me play with 'em, shots rain, strays hit 'em
Y'all bitches can't Play-Doh, I'm shape-shiftin'
And in the battle, you'll feel real threatened

[?] rhymes in my mind, I call 'em concealed weapons
I've been in first, y'all are still second
Finna kick some shit, call me the real Tekken (Yo, yo)

[Verse 6: B.DuBB]
And real recognize real when we step in
We deafenin' your ears, you can hear clear reception (Yeah)
I'm kickin' up numbers, why you tryna hate it?
'Cause we be stayin' in the mind, stay high and sedated
('Cause I'm faded)
We livin' in the Steel City
The pits of the 'Burgh where the shit is still pretty (412)
And I ain't claimin' 

[?]
When shit ain't all cool, but I feel a chill with me (Yeah)

[Verse 7: Mac Miller & B.DuBB]
I aim for the 

[?], stay flustered
Bring pain to the game, I make your brain suffer
I'm Dave, y'all busters, this ain't a game, ho (No)
I slang Dro, get more pussy than 

[?]

[Verse 8: B.DuBB]
And there it goes, somethin' you can bump on a CD
But you don't know about the king, you just wonder like Stevie
You can't see me, I appear like a magical genie
It's B.DuBB and Easy Mac, but the Mackin' Ain't Easy (No it ain't)

[Outro: Mac Miller & B.DuBB]
Yeah
'Cause it's Easy Mac, Mackin' Ain't Easy, dog
(Haha) Easy and Beedie, what you know 'bout that, yo?

[Intro]
Ha, yo, I just gotta laugh at this shit right here, yo, haha
It's Easy Mac
So blunt (Yeah), lemme just take a hit of that shit real quick (Oh, yeah)
Yeah, 

[?] you feel me right now
(Hahaha) Why don't you turn your speakers up in your car
And pay real close attention to what I'm sayin'
Aight, look, look, look

[Verse]
Lookin' fresh in a new pair of sneakers
More colors than Easter, finest of the reefer
Never on the vistas, I'm stickin' to the 

[?]
Celebration weed, you can call that shit confetti
Tastes like candy, call it Good & Plenty
Fuck with my crowd, I'ma spray your hood with semi's
Try and stop rappin', but God wouldn't let me
My name stains your brain just so you won't forget me

[?] fifties and a hundreds
So much dough that I giggle every time you poke my stomach
Yeah, so high, so blunted, and I'ma run it, ayy (Fuck it)
In a bitch's mouth like a canker sore
Get my nuts and I bounce, don't thank the whore
I ain't from the south but I'm good with the ladies
So much nut in her mouth, look like she got rabies
Bitch crazy, wants to have my baby
I ain't with that, fuck you, pay me
I slang tree, and I blaze weed
I stay skeed, eyes permanently lazy
Yeah, you ain't half as cool, bitch
Give me brains like you back at school, bitch
Hat twisted back so you can see my name
And you ain't know who I am but you can read my chain, yeah
That's P.I.T., the flames
And then I put my stick down like I beat the game
I ain't see the lames, the lames is invisible
And I am too invincible, it's all about that principle
I shit on you like a pigeon do, gettin' rid of you
Watch me flow if you wanna see what the kid can do
Yeah, it's the king of the freestyle, crazy, I'm senile
Money long, three miles, makes me smile, homie, we wild
Sit back, relax, and just let it be, child
Travel like a murderer, killer moves
Ya mad at me just 'cause my skin's vanilla 

[?]
I'm still the news, chill, I will improve
Drugs, I will abuse
I laugh at your ass, I'm way too cut-up
On the coffee shop, way too fucked up
Too high, I can touch the sky
My mom knows her rap but she still wonder why
I bring thunder, the 

[?] from down under
Ha, like a video game, but really, you lame
The Gat held, steady the aim, I'm ready as rain
You mad 'cause they picked me instead of you lames
Get some lead straight fed to your brain
And then I'm sendin' ya chains, it is the end of the game

[Intro: B.DuBB]
Yeah, we in this
This goes out to everybody in the east end of Pittsburgh city (412)
Yeah, I thought we already told 'em, man (Haha)
Well, let’s show 'em how we do (Somebody's 

[?])
Yo, yo, yo

[Verse 1: B.DuBB]
Everybody get in line, see what’s safe in my jeans
I'm on a nonstop grind like I'm chasin' my cheese
'Cause I got places to be and faces to see
If your boy got a order, need to place it to me
You wanna fight me, you can bite me, punks
Rob ya for your ice cream and your Nike Dunks
I ain't chillin' in the club, but I might be crunk
'Cause I be sippin’ malt liquor ’til my sight be fucked (Sight be fucked)
Lost day, cross-fade into reality
Feel the sauce, hate a boss breathin' new formality
Haters: y’all save it all and paid 'em all salary
Your fate is just to fade and fall once you hear the sound of me
I'm grimy with the flow, you can try me
My eyelids is low, stayin' high from the ivory
Killin’ tracks with Lil' Mac beside me
N. Rossi on the beat, east side 'til we die, B

[Chorus: B.DuBB & Mac Miller]
Yo, we be laxed with the hoes on our laps, sippin' Cognac
When we on, this is how we—this is how we—
Matter fact, we some macs where we at with my pack
Chillin' back in the 412
Yo, dude wanna know how we do it (How we do it)
We be flowin', keep our rhymes movin' fluid (Movin' fluid)
And I really can't explain it, it's the way the Lord made it
If you haters wanna hate it, you'll get ruined (You'll get ruined)

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
And listen clearly, I'll pronunciate
Beat the pussy up, so the cunts'll hate
Gots too orderly 

[?], the nuns are fake
I kill a forty no matter how many guns it take
I'm havin' fun with Jake, I run this state
I can't leave now, bitch, I got more blunts to bake
I gotta wake and bake, ain't gon' take a break
Heavy stacks of cash, call that shit a paperweight
Beedie, Nick and Easy Mac, you know where to find us
Pittsburgh's finest, whole city behind us
I flow mindless, God you can't rhyme with
I rip it first, then I leave your ass rhyme-less
Cop nine, Rick's turn it into pound cake
Duck the law, fuck 'em all, I ain't about Jake
Your whole crowd's fake
I hate fake shit, in hockey, I'm Crosby
The dudes you can't skate with

[Chorus: B.DuBB & Mac Miller]
Ha, we be laxed with the hoes on our laps, sippin' Cognac
When we on, this is how we—this is how we—
Matter fact, we some macs where we at with my pack
Chillin' back in the 412
Yo, dude wanna know how we do it (How we do it)
We be flowin', keep our rhymes movin' fluid (Movin' fluid)
And I really can't explain it, it's the way the Lord made it
If you haters wanna hate it, you'll get ruined (You'll get ruined)

[Outro: Mac Miller]
Bitch

[Intro]
Yeah
Yeah
Look, yo

[Verse]
Have you ever felt like no one understand what you loved?
Demanding a hug, can't reach you when you standin' above
I got dreams which I need to accomplish, I promise
I'm honest, clean my conscience, see the nonsense
Good days are gone, they used to be here
Life is but a dream doesn't seem to be clear
Been meanin' to write my thoughts down, jot down my mind
Take the words I can't say and put 'em into rhymes
So I'm up all night on this beat up mic
Convincing myself that I can't cheat on life
So papa don't preach, and mama don't worry
Nothing's gonna hurt me, growin' up in a hurry
I'm still learnin', waitin' for your teachin'
In this game of life that I seem to be beatin'
What the right thing to do isn't always understood
And some evil in the world is hidin' under good
Life ain't easy, don't put it past the name
Runnin' in the coins throwin' sacks of change
Tryna save up money for the microphone
And while everybody's out I just write at home
'Cause to achieve you need to leave things behind
Wear the rhyme book out 'til you can see the spine
Read between the lines, more than appears to be
Wonder who I'm here to be so I clearly speak
Sit back with my feet up on the chair
I relax, 'cause when the worlds gone rap will be there
Don't have to be scared, just sit back and chill
I attack these wack cats with the rappin' ill
Pass the Phil 'cause I'm tryna get faded
It's sacred passin' round the blunt, it's the greatest
I wasted payments just to get the tree
Now I'ma stop talking, so y'all can check the beat

[Intro: Pete Rock & Mac Miller]
It's yours
Whose world is this?
The world is ours (Easy Mac)
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine—whose world is this?
The world is yours
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine—whose world is this?
The world is yours (Yo, yeah)
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine—whose world is this?

[Verse 1]
Please, things ain't always what they seem to be
'Cause, me, I got dreams to be the greatest MC
Muhammad Ali with punchlines that sting like a bee
But I float like a butterfly, prove this nation I'm the god
What am I? A coward, only if I 

[?] (Yeah)
From the bottom I came, to the top of my game
Rippin', and spittin' licks off the top of the brain (Uh)
I spit heat, fireman, why you stoppin' my flames?
Nothin' makes sense, so you can find me shoppin' for change
Comin' from Nas, he told us that the world is ours
I spit SARS, can't talk, gotta lock my jaws
I got the Earth in my paws, and the stars in my eyes

[Pre-Chorus: Mac Miller & Nas]
The sky seems lonely, why don't we get high? (Say what?)
The sky seems lonely, why don't we get high? (Say what?)
The sky seems lonely 'cause the world is mine

[Chorus: Pete Rock & Mac Miller]
Whose world is this?
The world is yours (It's yours)
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine—whose world is this?
The world is yours
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine—whose world is this?
The world is yours (It's yours)
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine—whose world is this?
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine—whose world is this?

[Verse 2]
See, in the Steel City, we don't feel pity on you itsy bitsy
Gypsies feel pretty chill and heal quickly
And we deal midi's, and anything to get the cheese
We also got the haze if you tryna get skeed
But if you want the weed, needa talk to me
'Cause I be on hot grind like some coffee beans (Yeah)
We hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil, streets is lethal
Fiends with needles, lead the people, Nas came first, now read the sequel
Should be illegal, but a legendary 

[?] secondary
More vocabulary than a dictionary (Yeah)
I'm a visionary, in time, the world will be mine
Until then, I fill it with rhymes and leave it behind
Way behind 'til my state of mind is clearer
Lookin' at the cards hangin' on your rear-view mirror
'Cause mankind actin' pure and divine
So I proceed to MC 'til the world is mine

[Chorus: Pete Rock & Mac Miller]
Yeah, it's mine (It's yours)
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine—whose world is this?
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine—whose world is this?
The world is yours
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine—whose world is this?
The world is yours
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine—whose world is this?
It's yours

[Intro]
Aight
Aight, yeah
Yeah
Uh, yo
Uh, yo, yo

[Verse 1]
Easy Mac, but my Mackin' Ain't Easy
The other rappers 

[?] is so cheesy
You wanna get up to me, the game needs me
I be ya bitch like a beat says, "Please me"
So I don't even know, but I keep on teasing
I just keep on doin' it, it's a Point Breeze thing
I'ma about to do it, it's the trees bring brought
And you's about to get shot
'Cause my shit is lyrical, hit gets sent to you like spiritual
If you wanna do it, I'm a kid in school
Just tryna 

[?] this shit is so typical, it's pitiful
Shittin' on this chick 'cause I'm hittin' you
I'ma hit you back with some shit, as a matter of fact
Nobody can say what I say, nobody can do that
So I can do that, baby, screw cats
And I'm about to do it, baby, yeah, I knew that
And if you wanna come and get into the room back
I'ma come to you dressed in black, that is how I act
So if you wanna come, you can't even see me or be me
Malcolm McCormick is on the CD, it's so easy
And matter fact, it's Easy Mac
Got some good tree or weed, give me four G's of that
Maybe a little more, get maybe a quarter
And I'm about to do it, lyrical slaughter
I'm about to do it 'cause this shit's like water
I make it rain, I make it pour on you haters

[Interlude]
I make it rain like the Lakers
Yo
Uh
Yo
Easy Mac

[Verse 2]
Yo, it is the war game, playin' you like board games
And I'm just 

[?], grabbin' more fame
I'm killin' more lames, I'm gettin' more chains
You think you 

[?], I'm makin' 

[?]
And if you wanna do it clean like the cocaine or propane
When I explode, you know I know things
'Cause I have wisdom, it's a lyrical prisdom
And if you wanna know 'cause I hate him, I ain't with him
If he did that on Saturday night
I can't tell you shit, you ain't fuckin' askin' me right
You is just investigatin', debatin' if I was doin' shit
Screw you, bitch, I'm about to 

[?] 'cause you knew the shit
I was right here, that's my fuckin' alibi
You can't do it 'cause you know I'll make the battle-cry
When I come back, I gotta battle rap
Askin' me questions, homie, I'ma battle grap—battle back
That's what I meant to say
But if you think I was serious, I meant to play
So if you wanna make me confuse you or use you
Like a drug, I abuse you, it's what the Jews do
I don't really care, true, boo, word
I don't know 'cause it's the same shit ya heard
Before the shit was word, before the shit float
I do this shit, keep it warm like a coat
I don't even know, the shit's ain't wrote
It's written, that shit is not written
It's just lyrical, free-style spittin'
I ain't kiddin', I'm serious
Make sure ya ears are open so you can be hearin' this

[Outro]
A free-style genius right there, I mean, come on

[Intro]
Yo
Yeah
This one right here
To the haters
Mac is like, "Hi!" (Tell 'em)

[Verse 1]
Guns drawn, stay on, say it's smart to kill
Beyond the response to my 

[?]
Butts of reefer, believe I'm the leader
A different creature, more respect than Aretha
I see ya, wouldn't want to be ya
Look at you, I'm cookin' you enough paper for a book or two (Damn)
I warned ya, I'm the truth, Like Sojourner
Up on the former, kickin' flows on the corner
I appreciate applause and enthusiasm
But you're an actor to the public, throwin' movies at 'em
Mac is like, "You ain't half as tight" (Nope)
So please, cast a light
Let me jog a mic and you can get sacrificed
'Cause I'ma rap for life, or leave you hypnotized
Or get high, spittin' knives that'll switch ya eyes
I can write some shit down or kill it improvised
You wanna fill my shoes, boy, they ain't in ya size

[Chorus]
'Cause Mac is like, 'cause Mac is like
And let the beat drop (Come back)

[Verse 2]
I'm comin' back like a recap
Stay strapped with a Gat to your kneecap
Runnin' ya city, askin', "Where the weed at?"
Turn the mic down, it's givin' feedback
Hand it to me, I'ma grab that like a half-back
Take the cash back, man, I'll jack your backpack
I smack tracks, y'all cast rap whack
Y'all pussy rappers might as well tuck ya sack back
I have 

[?], givin' you some flashbacks
But you can have that blunt, you needa pass that
Where ya stash at, the code to your safe 

[?]
I take my dick in your bitch and blow in her face
Yes, I will, I do talk shit and I rap it
Cross me, I'ma introduce you to your casket
I'm a savage, stealin' cabbage from you faggots
Right out your jacket, it's like you never had it
I bust shots in your mouth, three slugs
We thugs, this is what the tree does
One time for your mind, Point Breeze love
This is Lil' Mac, shout out to B.DuBB's

[Outro]
Yeah, it's Mac, baby

[Verse 1]
I'm asinine, cat can rhyme with the acid lines
And if you haven't seen me spit then ya ass is blind
I'm a mastermind, far more intelligent, I'm elegant
Good penmanship and so excellent
Exercise my mind, now I'm set to rise
Elevatin', levitatin' 'cause we mesmerized
Simon said to rhyme, so I follow the leader
And if you got a problem, you can swallow my sneakers
If you think I won't, you should know that I will
My words is hard to swallow like an oversized pill
You overdose, spit fire and now the microphone is toast
I'ma spit 'til every MC's bones are broke
An overlord of Post-It notes filled with quotes you spoke
You spit a line you wrote, I flip it back, okie-doke
Acknowledge it, words hit you like a hollow-tip
Haters mad when they see me spit, they gotta follow it
What the problem is, homie? We can solve it quick
I spit that acid, know your flows dissolve in it
You'll get forgotten quick, another lost memory
You might be remembered as Easy Mac's enemy
But ain't no one gon' remember your name
I make it snow in April; in December, it rain
Mac's ferocious, and y'all is just atrocious
I'm supercalifragilisticexpialidocious
A funeral is at your back, so get your ass some roses
I'm spittin' cancer at you cats and that's a diagnosis
My flow sick, leave you speechless like hypnosis
And lead your ass to the Promised Land like Moses

[Chorus]
Easy Mac, faster rapper, master of the craft
It's disaster, passin' rappers, man, I had to laugh
I'm jabbin' cats, they gon' feel my punch
Attackin' tracks, watch ya back or I'ma steal ya lunch

[Post-Chorus]
I'm leavin' competitors pissed
To tell the truth, it gets no better than this
(Nope, Easy Mac)
I'm leavin' competitors pissed
To tell the truth, it gets no better than this

[Verse 2]
Yeah, yeah
The prophecy set onto me, I'm the prodigy
My mob is deep, and when you pray, then you talk to me
I spit logically, words like Socrates
Automatic with the flow like Bird when he shot a three
My rap profession and I'm pressin' for progression
Why you stressin'? Explosive aggressive
Messages I send, then I'ma bomb ya

[?] it's karma
You imposters, beatin' me to 

[?]
I ain't in school from eight to three, hooky like vacancy
My legacy holds more power than the paper, see
I'm hot like the place Satan be, cops hatin' me
The federal agency got all they guns aimed at me
And since the age of three, puffin' on the dankest tree
I'm makin' cheese, tell the hoes to get naked please
We in the world that's surrounded by water
Founded by fathers, surrounded by talkers
I'm the godfather on this mic: Corleone
The king of Pittsburgh, so why don't you hop up out my throne?
Or I'll promise, family in black like they gothic
When I spit, your eyeballs pop right up out they sockets
I don't fuck with the justice, it doesn't exist
You talkin' shit just because you got nothin' to spit
I'm runnin' this shit
And in about twenty seconds you clowns will be steppin' from my presence

[Chorus]
Easy Mac, faster rapper, master of the craft
It's disaster, passin' rappers, man, I had to laugh
I'm jabbin' cats, you gon' feel my punch
Attackin' tracks, watch ya back or I'ma steal ya lunch

[Post-Chorus]
It gets no better than this

[Intro]
Yeah, we some masters in this man!

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Yeah, the rap master, back as your pastor
Rap faster and crack tracks like they plaster
Lyrically gas ya, I'm leavin’ mics shattered
Past is 

[?], onto the last chapter
Yeah, I lay back and chill
My day's wack but still save rap and ill
You think it's wack, then why ain’t you battlin' it?
I spit people like am I imaginin' this?

[Verse 2: B.DuBB]
Yo, it seems you always on some average spit
Just some average kids, this is hazardous wit'
And as a matter of fact, you'll be mad at this shit
Quick hits, roll them blunts that be fat as ya chick
Yeah, me and Mac, we was born to win it
Sendin' y'all the raps, leave you torn and finished
Your whole frame fucked up and your form diminished
Passin' raps back and forth, like a ball in tennis

[Verse 3: Mac Miller]
Yeah, call me a chemist ’cause I stay in the lab
The only tool in the school is a pen and a ’pad
And Chemistry class, whoa, that's a lil’ bit irrelevant
Writin' rhymes through the class, boostin' my intelligence

[Verse 4: B.DuBB]
Yo, I got a fetish for the fettuccine, the relish
Embellishin' 

[?] is hellish
Elders are gettin’ jealous, they 

[?] fellow man

[Verse 5: Mac Miller]
My kingdom is the limit, and my prison and I'm sick of it
It's Malcolm, not in the Middle kid, and yes, I'm sizzlin'
The kid that gets you the Dro, purp, but get him the dough first
Sit back, relax, and do my homework

[Verse 6: B.DuBB]
Yo, and you ain't better than the test of teachers
We the best, and we dressed in the freshest sneakers
Ill kids, yeah, we still rip the best of pieces
And kill these haters for they aters 'cause the stress will eat us
'Cause they be bitin' us, excitin' and repeat us
Tryna wear the same pair of Nikes and Adidas

[Verse 7: Mac Miller]
It's a fact, copy-cats can't copy me
I play these cats, fill they cash like the lottery
This rap shit, that's a part of me
Why you tryna come up in my sight but tryna fight the kid that's 

[?]
If Easy Mac's who you wanna be, then why you wanna crawl up all on top of me?

[Verse 8: B.DuBB]
Yo, I fill 'em up in a tight space like sodomy
Peoples be usin' their brothers like a commodity
The world's a lot colder than I thought it be
Held my ground as a child, but now I'm a prodigy
And you can blame it on the rap music probably
I been wanting to make tapes since I was eight
Now I hustle and I make paper off of eights
I want everyone crumb of the cake that's on the plate, ayy

[Verse 9: Mac Miller]
Kick Push as I set sail
Those aren't clouds in the sky, that's my exhale
Save the hate for the fakes and the bathin' apes
'Cause we gon' roll by high at the shady skates

[Verse 10: B.DuBB]
Yo, Easy Mac gettin' back on some skate shit
Every time we rappin' on a track, we gettin' Ape shit
Face it, simple and plain, you gain basic
High up in the sky like a spaceship, spacious

[Verse 11: Mac Miller]
Gimme couple words I can play wit'
Guarantee you wanna replay it, stay sit
You can't hate it, damn, we stay famous
Smoke a blunt to myself and I call it a facelift

[Verse 12: B.DuBB]
Yeah, these haters hatin' so strong, I can taste it
Makin' many claims but the game so basic
Y'all lames wanna hang on the same shit
Grow the fuck up, I won't pay no patience
So time better spent, my mind's on my money
Been on grind ever since 

[?]
If cops come around, they gon' find evidence
They start tappin' phones, I'ma lie in the trench
Lay the fuck low, lay the fuck low
Stay the fuck home
A hundred Gs 

[?]
They runnin' up in cribs, tryna take the cash
See, I would've thought a home be the safest stash (Uh)
The bacon hates with they racist ass
White boy, drivin' through, while he makes it past

[Verse 13: Mac Miller]
Yeah, we ride by as I chug up the juice
Corrupt cops, tellin' lies, fuckin' up the truth
Scratchin' the surface, cops askin' what the purpose is
Well, officer, we ain't in need of your services
I got the weed, no seeds, yeah, the purple shit
Clown and fools like a circuses, you heard of it
I battle wack ass with the weapons of war
Sharp flows, and they hit you like you stabbin' the swords
I'm the mega, the lord, the legend still livin'
Reachin' heavin' still sinnin' the ill-written is still hittin'

[Verse 14: B.DuBB]
Still sittin' on chickens, we here, ho
Bumpin' through your eardrums, fuck up your earlow (Ow)
Yeah yo, plus I have to be rich
So I'm takin' everything you got, I ain't askin' for shit

[Verse 15: Mac Miller]
Yeah, me and B-D in the castle, we sit
We just kick back, relax and battlin' kids
Grab your seat belt and please start fastenin' it
Takin' you on some rides, we 

[?] than this
I propose a toast to those who came close
And those who oppose, floatin' the same boat
Gooder than good, and better than most
We just chill, hit kush, kick push and then we coast

[Outro: Mac Miller]
We kick, push, kick push, kick push, kick push and coast
And that's the way we roll so if you rollin' up the blunt I can pack up a bowl
Then we can hit kush, hit kush, hit kush, hit kush and float
And the way we go, yo, y'all hoes couldn't fame me though
So we kick, push, kick push, kick push, kick push and coast
And that's the way we roll so if you rollin' up the blunt I can pack up a bowl
Then we can hit kush, hit kush, hit kush, hit kush and float
And the way we go, yo, y'all hoes couldn't fame me though
And we kick, push, kick push, kick push, kick push and coast
And that's the way we roll so if you rollin' up the blunt I can pack up a bowl

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Oh, you don't compare, don't fit in with 'em, do you get me?
Judgin' by the way you open up, you get me
Ooh, out of this world, hands-on, baby, now you send me
Lookin' at the way we're blendin' in, you get me

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Ha-ha-ha, you get me
Ha-ha-ha, you get me

[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
See, you're lookin' beyond the surface
Can tell by the questions you're asking
You got me low-key nervous
It feels like we're on the same wave, yeah
Never intended to relate, I mean, what are the chances?
Never thought I'd connect with you, not in these circumstances

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Oh, you don't compare, don't fit in with 'em, do you get me?
Judgin' by the way you open up, you get me
Ooh, out of this world, hands-on, baby, now you send me
Lookin' at the way we're blendin' in, you get me

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Ha-ha-ha, you get me
Ha-ha-ha, you get me

[Verse 2: Kehlani]
Ooh, there's so much chemistry
Like a chemist, how you finishin' my sentences
In the center, no, we can't deny this energy
How 'bout reapin' all the benefits? Yeah
Never intended to relate, I mean, what are the chances?
Never thought I'd connect with you, not in these circumstances, no

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Oh, you don't compare, don't fit in with 'em, do you get me?
Judgin' by the way you open up, you get me
Ooh, out of this world, hands-on, baby, now you send me
Lookin' at the way we're blendin' in, you get me

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Ha-ha-ha, you get me
Ha-ha-ha, you get me

[Pre-Chorus]
I know that you mad at me, givin' attitude
Can I make you feel comfortable?
You got a lot to say, who you lyin' to?
Tell me, baby, what I'm supposed to do
I don't ask for much, just all of you
You're bad for me, and, baby, I'm bad for you
Now you're all on me and I'm all on you

[Chorus]
I just keep on running back to you, you, you, you
I just keep on running back to you, you, you, you
I just keep on running back to you, you, you, you
I just keep on running back to you, you, you, you
(Baby, I'm sorry)

[Verse]
And I can't ever be the man you want
But I know how it feel to be alone
That's why you callin' my phone
Tellin' me, "Baby, you need to come over"
Girl, I know you
Talkin' to all of your friends, tell 'em you don't fuck with me
Now you fuckin' me, 2AM, you tellin' me you lovin' me
No trust in me, everything you do now because of me
Girl, I really gave you it all

[Pre-Chorus]
I know that you mad at me, givin' attitude
Can I make you feel comfortable?
You got a lot to say, who you lyin' to?
Tell me, baby, what I'm supposed to do
I don't ask for much, just all of you
You're bad for me, and, baby, I'm bad for you
Now you're all on me and I'm all on you

[Chorus]
I just keep on running back to you, you, you, you
I just keep on running back to you, you, you, you
I just keep on running back to you, you, you, you
I just keep on running back to you, you, you, you

[Verse 1 - 6ixGig willi]
Ahhh, it's a wicked world
When the words are mean
And those friends are wrong
If I cry, some laugh
When those wicked strike
I have to hide my face
I loose my way
Gained weight about thinking

[Chorus - Elton John]
Cold, cold heart
Hardened by you
Some things look better, baby
Just passin' through
And it's no sacrifice
Just a simple word
It's two hearts livin'
In two separate worlds
But it's no sacrifice
No sacrifice
It's no sacrifice at all

[Verse 2 - 6ixGig willi]
Now those smiles are fake
Came a time I weep
Wish I had you
Sweet smells of you
All around my room
Now am looking those frames
And am looking by
At the misery of life, Baby

[Chorus - Elton John]
Cold, cold heart
Hardened by you
Some things look better, baby
Just passin' through
And it's no sacrifice
Just a simple word
It's two hearts livin'
In two separate worlds
But it's no sacrifice
No sacrifice
It's no sacrifice at all

[Chorus - Elton John & 6ixGig willi]
Cold, cold heart
Hardened by you
Some things look better, baby
Just passin' through
And it's no sacrifice
Just a simple word
It's two hearts livin'
In two separate worlds
But it's no sacrifice
No sacrifice
It's no sacrifice at all

[Outro - Elton John & 6ixGig willi]
No sacrifice at all
No sacrifice at all
No sacrifice at all
And it's no sacrifice
It's two hearts livin'
In two separate worlds
(In two separate worlds.)

[Intro: 3rd Eye]
We in this motherfucker for real

[Chorus: 3rd Eye]
Big up, big up, it's a stick up, stick up

Big up, big up, it's a stick up, stick up
Big up, big up, it's a stick up, nigga

[Verse 1: 3rd Eye]
I pack gats, best to back up off me
Get that ass open like a body part melting
I make up and I break, make a snake stab a snake
I rock techniques, y'all freak the funky fly shit, 3rd Eye shit
When I get ill, my skill's simply amazing
A schizo, I flip like I forgot to take my pills
Sinking deep up in your bed, then y'all bring all 2 of them
Sick motherfucker from the projects I grew up in
And do incredible, unforgettable shit, you know?
Them niggas from the ghetto, no, they don't be bullshitting
1993, we coming harder

[?]

[Chorus: 3rd Eye]
Big up, big up, it's a stick up, stick up
Big up, big up, it's a stick up, nigga
Big up, big up, it's a stick up, stick up
Big up, big up, it's a stick up, nigga

[Verse 2: TROO-KULA]
Ayo, here yee, have you heard of me, '93
Take a look-sie, you don't even know me
Well, I flip that shit like them racist niggas up in California
See me, prolly counting, yo enough of that
Fuck that,  having that
Yo, I'm on a ill track, big raps, you want facts, black
Is it time to get ill? Yo, I feel sicker than a junkie cold turkey
Man, I need a bitch, how you wanna lick
Hold me hostage, me in bondage, imagine
I may burn your priest yo
My nigga West is kinda Schizo, I'm psycho (Yeah)
Leave us alone, we can hold our own
Jimmy Crack Corn, word is bond
I be wettin' niggas mortuaries up, they wouldn't know it
When the funeral, burial I'm coming strapped
It's that nigga wanted throwing that nigga on his back
I'm the gat

[Chorus: 3rd Eye]
Big up, big up, it's a stick up, stick up
Big up, big up, it's a stick up, nigga
Big up, big up, it's a stick up, stick up

Big up, big up, it's a stick up, nigga
Big up, big up, it's a stick up, stick up
Big up, big up, it's a stick up, nigga

[Verse: The Notorious B.I.G.]
Yes, love, I love your fuckin' attitude
When a nigga play pussy, that's the nigga that's gettin' screwed
And bruised up from the pistol whippin'
Welts on the neck from the necklace strippin'
Then I'm dippin' up the block and I'm robbin' bitches, too
Up the herringbones and bamboos
I wouldn't give a fuck if you're pregnant
Give me the baby rings and the #1 Mom pendant, huh
I'm slammin' niggas like Shaquille, shit is real
When it's time to eat a meal, I rob and steal
Mom duke ain't givin' me shit
So for the bread and butter, I leave niggas in the gutter
Huh, word to mother, I'm dangerous
Crazier than a bag of fuckin' angel dust
When I bust my gat, motherfuckers take dirt naps
I'm all that and a dime sack, where the paper at?

[Chorus: The Notorious B.I.G. & Diddy]
Big up, big up, it's a stickup, stickup
Big up, big up, it's a stickup, nigga
Big up, big up, it's a stickup, stickup
Big up, big up, it's a stickup, nigga
Big up, big up, it's a stick up, stick up
Big up, big up, it's a stick up, nigga
Big up, big up, it's a stick up, stick up
Big up, big up, it's a stick up, nigga
OKAY, I RELOADED! (The League Crew!)

Yeah
It's (a million)

[Hook]
I freestyle battle niggas for (a million)
How many niggas bit the soul, bout (a million)
How many hoes did I bone, bout (a million)
Uh-uh, uh-uh, it's (a million), uh-uh
There's (a million) ways to die, choose one
(A million...)

[Verse One]
Lot of people ask about the money I made, even Just Blaze
How are they for real, is them niggas really paid?
Rappers I met, or, delt with direct
Is it true he won't send a beat tape until he get a check?
What's the position you hold?
Could you really master Neptunes, check my check, and "H to the Izzo", the only single that went gold?
If Roc-a-fella shit, fold, and you move back to the "Go"
Is it back to Ghost producer for D-dot on the low?
For the million time asking me
Questions like Toni Braxton, harassing me
Like you don't care about my son's feelings?
Can I get a minute, you wack bitch? I ain't gotta jack shit
You heard "Takeover", who running this rap shit?
Uggh, fake tits, shut up and make hits
Can't we all just get along, spread love, like "take six"?
What, you doing beats in LA for Eminem and Dr Dre?
Them niggas sold ten mil, I'm trying to get paid
We do this shit for entertainment, bring guns to the arraignment
While the judge in the chamber, let one up out the chamber, BLAOW!

[Hook]
How many years did I wait, about (a million)
How many niggas tryna hate, about (a million)
But when a nigga count his cake, it's like (a million)

[Verse Two]
All for the College Dropout, I make the game different
I don't know what the hell y'all niggas been sniffing
'Ye still flicking, hoes is my addiction
Five days out the week, you'll find me in the kitchen
Snatching the game, nigga, unlike you
Cause these beats change the game, and the hook's right too
I'm unquick like you
Cats back in the Chi was buying tracks for dirt cheap, man, what could I do?
Knowing I s'posed to style, I'm the fly boy poster child
Bout to beat on Oprah, now
It's ironic and whatnot
How I put no ice on the Bulgari watch, just to make it hot
Now you see me on stages, my hit resumes is
Two pages for them niggas who played us
Features, raise us, booming like Master Aces
Stand up, number one, and there's more to come
All I got for hoes is hard dick and bubble gum
While y'all brick like Fred, Barney, Rubble and them
Chi-town in this bitch, what's fucking with them?
Not a damn thing, nigga, we doing our damn thing, BLAOW!
(A million)

[Verse 1: Michael Jackson]
My life has taken me beyond the planets and the stars
And you're the only one that could take me this far
I'll be forever searching for your love

[Chorus: Michael Jackson & Lenny Kravitz]
I walked away but I was wrong
I can't make it another day
You're the one that makes me strong
I can't make it another day
You're the fire that keeps me warm
I can't make it another day
How will I get through this storm?
I can't live another day without your love
(C'mon now!)
(Hee-hee!)

[Verse 2: Michael Jackson]
At night I pray before I sleep in hope of finding you
I've opened up my heart, I want you to come through
I close my eyes, I'm searching for your love

[Chorus: Michael Jackson & Lenny Kravitz]
I walked away but I was wrong
I can't make it another day
You're the one that makes me strong
I can't make it another day
You're the fire that keeps me warm
I can't make it another day
How will I get through this storm?
I can't make another day without your love
I walked away but I was wrong
I can't make it another day
You're the one that makes me strong
I can't make it another day
You're the fire that keeps me warm
I can't make it another day
How will I get through this storm?
I can't live another day without your love

[Guitar Solo]
Hoo-hoo!
Go, babe!
Hoo-hoo!
Hoo!
Doo-dee-da-da, da-doo-dee
C'mon now (Hoo-hoo-hoo!)

[Chorus: Michael Jackson & Lenny Kravitz]
I walked away but I was wrong
I can't make it another day
You're the one that makes me strong
I can't make it another day
You're the fire that keeps me warm
I can't make it another day
How will I get through this storm?
I can't make another day without your love (It's just too much for me)

[Outro: Michael Jackson & Lenny Kravitz]
I walked away but I was wrong (It's just too much for me)
I can't make it another day (It's too much for me)
You're the one that makes me strong (It's just too much for me)
I can't make it another day (Hoo-hoo!) (I can't make it, baby)
You're the fire that keeps me warm (I can't make it, baby)
I can't make it another day (It's just too much for me)
How will I get through this storm? (It's just too much for me)
I can't make another day without your love (Hoo-hoo!) (Yeah!)
I walked away but I was wrong
I can't make it another day
You're the one that makes me strong
I can't make it another day

[Verse 1]
That neon sign
Hangin' outside that bar
Should've said, "Go home
If you know what's good for your heart"
When she sat down
In that ADPi t-shirt
Should've said, "Watch out
Or boy you're gonna wind up hurt"
And that label on that whiskey on that shelf
Should've said, "Don't buy no shots for no one else"

[Chorus]
Should've come with a warnin' (Ooh)
Don't sit right there, don't sip on what they're pourin' (You)
Her kiss is gonna kill you in the mornin'
Nah, it ain't gonna end too good
Everythin' about that night I thought I wanted
Should've come with a warnin' (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh)
Should've come with a warnin'

[Verse 2]
Phone just lit up
And it's damn near 2 AM
Oughta be blue lights, or some kind of loud sirens
Sayin', "Don't pick it up, she'll let you down"
It's the deep end and you're gonna drown
And this "You up?" text that she sent me right now

[Chorus]
Should've come with a warnin' (Ooh)
Don't sit right there, don't sip on what they're pourin' (You)
Her kiss is gonna kill you in the mornin'
Nah, it ain't gonna end too good
Everything about that night I thought I wanted
Should've come with a warnin' (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh)
Should've come with a warnin'

[Bridge]
Don't fire it up, and hit the headlights
Turn on around at the next red light
I wish somebody would've gave me some damn signs
Yeah, I wish that night

[Outro]
Would've come with a warnin' (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh)
Would've come with a warnin'
Would've come with a warnin' (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh)
Would've come with a warnin'

[Verse 1]
We were in the backseat
Drunk on something stronger than the drinks in the bar
"I rent a place on Cornelia Street"
I say casually in the car
We were a fresh page on the desk
Filling in the blanks as we go
As if the street lights pointed in an arrow head
Leading us home

[Chorus]
And I hope I never lose you, hope it never ends
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
That's the kinda heartbreak time could never mend
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
And baby, I get mystified by how this city screams your name
And baby, I'm so terrified of if you ever walk away
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again

[Verse 2]
Windows flung right open, autumn air
Jacket 'round my shoulders is yours
We bless the rains on Cornelia Street
Memorize the creaks in the floor
Back when we were card sharks, playing games
I thought you were leading me on
I packed my bags, left Cornelia Street
Before you even knew I was gone

[Pre-Chorus]
But then you called, showed your hand
I turned around before I hit the tunnel
Sat on the roof, you and I

[Chorus]
I hope I never lose you, hope it never ends
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
That's the kinda heartbreak time could never mend
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
And baby, I get mystified by how this city screams your name
And baby, I'm so terrified of if you ever walk away
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
I'll never walk Cornelia Street again

[Bridge]
You hold my hand on the street
Walk me back to that apartment
Years ago, we were just inside
Barefoot in the kitchen
Sacred new beginnings
That became my religion, listen

[Chorus]
I hope I never lose you
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
Oh, never again
‘Cause baby, I get mystified by how this city screams your name
And baby, I'm so terrified of if you ever walk away
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again

[Post-Chorus]
I don't wanna lose you
I don't wanna lose you

[Outro]
"I rent a place on Cornelia Street"
I say casually in the car

[Chorus]
Saying goodbye is death by a thousand cuts
Flashbacks waking me up
Get drunk, but it's not enough
'Cause the morning comes and you're not my baby
I look through the windows of this love
Even though we boarded them up
Chandelier's still flickering here
'Cause I can't pretend it's okay when it's not
It's death by a thousand cuts

[Verse 1]
I dress to kill my time, I take the long way home
I ask the traffic lights if it'll be alright
They say, "I don't know"
And what once was ours is no one's now
I see you everywhere, the only thing we share
Is this small town
You said it was a great love, one for the ages
So  if the story's over, why am I still writing pages?

[Chorus]
'Cause saying goodbye is death by a thousand cuts
Flashbacks waking me up
Get drunk, but it's not enough
'Cause the morning comes and you're not my baby
I look through the windows of this love
Even though we boarded them up
Chandelier's still flickering here
'Cause I can't pretend it's okay when it's not
It's death by a thousand cuts

[Verse 2]
My heart, my hips, my body, my love
Tryna find a part of me that you didn't touch
Gave up on me like I was a bad drug
Now I'm searching for signs in a haunted club
Our songs, our films, united we stand
Our country, guess it was a lawless land
Quiet my fears with the touch of your hand
Paper cut stings from our paper-thin plans
My time, my wine, my spirit, my trust
Tryna find a part of me you didn't take up
Gave you too much, but it wasn't enough
But I'll be alright, it's just a thousand cuts

[Chorus]
Get drunk, but it's not enough
'Cause you're not my baby
I look through the windows of this love
Even though we boarded them up
Chandelier's still flickering here
'Cause I can't pretend it's okay when it's not
No, it's not
It's death by a thousand cuts

[Post-Chorus]
Part of me that you didn't touch
My body, my love, my trust
But it wasn't enough, it wasn't enough, no, no

[Outro]
I take the long way home
I ask the traffic lights if it'll be alright
They say, "I don't know"

[Verse 1]
We could leave the Christmas lights up 'til January
This is our place, we make the rules
And there's a dazzling haze, a mysterious way about you, dear
Have I known you 20 seconds or 20 years?

[Chorus]
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah
Take me out, take me home
You're my, my, my, my lover

[Verse 2]
We could let our friends crash in the living room
This is our place, we make the call
And I'm highly suspicious that everyone who sees you wants you
I've loved you three summers now, honey, but I want 'em all

[Chorus]
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah
Take me out, take me home (Forever and ever)
You're my, my, my, my lover

[Bridge]
Ladies and gentlemen, will you please stand?
With every guitar string scar on my hand
I take this magnetic force of a man to be my lover
My heart's been borrowed and yours has been blue
All's well that ends well to end up with you
Swear to be overdramatic and true to my lover
And you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me
And at every table, I'll save you a seat, lover

[Chorus]
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah
Take me out, and take me home (Forever and ever)
You're my, my, my, my
Oh, you're my, my, my, my
Darling, you're my, my, my, my lover

[Verse 1]
Combat, I'm ready for combat
I say I don't want that, but what if I do?
'Cause cruelty wins in the movies
I've got a hundred thrown-out speeches I almost said to you

[Pre-Chorus]
Easy they come, easy they go
I jump from the train, I ride off alone
I never grew up, it's getting so old
Help me hold on to you

[Chorus]
I've been the archer
I've been the prey
Who could ever leave me, darling
But who could stay?

[Verse 2]
Dark side, I search for your dark side
But what if I'm alright, right, right, right here?
And I cut off my nose just to spite my face
Then I hate my reflection for years and years

[Pre-Chorus]
I wake in the night, I pace like a ghost
The room is on fire, invisible smoke
And all of my heroes die all alone
Help me hold on to you

[Chorus]
I've been the archer
I've been the prey
Screaming, who could ever leave me, darling
But who could stay?
(I see right through me, I see right through me)

[Bridge]
'Cause they see right through me
They see right through me
They see right through
Can you see right through me?
They see right through
They see right through me
I see right through me
I see right through me

[Pre-Chorus]
All the king's horses, all the king's men
Couldn't put me together again
'Cause all of my enemies started out friends
Help me hold on to you

[Chorus]
I've been the archer
I've been the prey
Who could ever leave me, darling
But who could stay?
(I see right through me, I see right through me)
But who could stay?
Who could stay?
Who could stay?
Who could stay?
Who could stay?
You could stay
You

[Outro]
Combat, I'm ready for combat

[Verse 1]
My love was as cruel as the cities I lived in
Everyone looked worse in the light
There are so many lines that I've crossed unforgiven
I'll tell you the truth, but never goodbye

[Chorus]
I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
Been sleeping so long in a twenty-year dark night
But now I see daylight
I only see daylight

[Verse 2]
Luck of the draw only draws the unlucky
So I became the butt of the joke
I wounded the good and I trusted the wicked
Clearing the air, I breathed in the smoke
Maybe you ran with the wolves and refused to settle down
Maybe I've stormed out of every single room in this town
Threw out our cloaks and our daggers because it's morning now
It's brighter now, now

[Chorus]
I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
(I can never look away)
I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
(Things I'm never gonna say)
Been sleeping so long in a twenty-year dark night
(Now I'm wide awake)
But now I see daylight
I only see daylight
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight

[Bridge]
And I can still see it all in my mind
All of you, all of me intertwined
I once believed love would be black and white
But it's golden golden
And I can still see it all in my head
Back and forth from New York, sneaking in your bed
I once believed love would be burning red
But it's golden
Like daylight, like daylight
Like daylight, like daylight

[Chorus]
I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
(I can never look away)
I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
(Things I'm never gonna say)
Been sleeping so long in a twenty-year dark night
(Now I'm wide awake)
But now I see daylight
I only see daylight
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight

[Outro]
You gotta step into the daylight and let it go
Just let it go, let it go

[Verse 1]
You are somebody that I don't know
But you're takin' shots at me like it's Patrón
And I'm just like, damn, it's 7 AM
Say it in the street, that's a knock-out
But you say it in a Tweet, that's a cop-out
And I'm just like, "Hey, are you okay?"

[Pre-Chorus]
And I ain't tryna mess with your self-expression
But I've learned a lesson that stressin' and obsessin' 'bout somebody else is no fun
And snakes and stones never broke my bones

[Chorus]
So oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
You need to calm down
You're being too loud
And I'm just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (Oh)
You need to just stop
Like can you just not step on my gown?
You need to calm down

[Verse 2]
You are somebody that we don't know
But you're comin' at my friends like a missile
Why are you mad when you could be GLAAD? (You could be GLAAD)
Sunshine on the street at the parade
But you would rather be in the dark ages
Makin' that sign must've taken all night

[Pre-Chorus]
You just need to take several seats and then try to restore the peace
And control your urges to scream about all the people you hate
'Cause shade never made anybody less gay

[Chorus]
So oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
You need to calm down
You're being too loud
And I'm just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (Oh)
You need to just stop
Like can you just not step on his gown?
You need to calm down

[Bridge]
And we see you over there on the internet
Comparin' all the girls who are killing it
But we figured you out
We all know now we all got crowns
You need to calm down

[Chorus]
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
You need to calm down
You're being too loud (You're being too loud)
And I'm just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (Oh)
You need to just stop
Like can you just not step on our gowns?
You need to calm down

[Outro]
You need to just stop
Like can you just not step on our gowns?
You need to calm down

[Intro]
I promise that you'll never find another like me

[Verse 1]
I know that I'm a handful, baby, uh
I know I never think before I jump
You're the kind of guy the ladies want
(And there's a lot of cool chicks out there)
I know that I'm a psycho on the phone
Never leave well enough alone
And trouble's gonna follow where I go
(And there's a lot of cool chicks out there)

[Pre-Chorus]
But one of these things is not like the others
Like a rainbow with all of the colors
Baby doll, when it comes to a lover
I promise that you'll never find another like

[Chorus]
Me-e-e, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I'm the only one of me
Baby, that's the fun of me
Eeh-eeh-eeh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You're the only one of you
Baby, that's the fun of you
And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me-e-e

[Verse 2]
I know I tend to make it about me
I know you never get just what you see
But I will never bore you, baby
(And there's a lot of lame guys out there)
And when we had that fight out in the rain
You ran after me and called my name
Never wanna see you walk away
(And there's a lot of lame guys out there)

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause one of these things is not like the others
Livin' in winter, I am your summer
Baby doll, when it comes to a lover
I promise that you'll never find another like

[Chorus]
Me-e-e, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I'm the only one of me
Let me keep you company
Eeh-eeh-eeh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You're the only one of you
Baby, that's the fun of you
And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me-e-e

[Bridge]
Hey kids (Spelling is fun)
Girl, there ain't no I in "team"
But you know there is a "me"
Strike the band up, 1, 2, 3
I promise that you'll never find another like me
Girl, there ain't no I in "team"
But you know there is a "me"
And you can't spell "awesome" without "me"
I promise that you'll never find another like

[Chorus]
Me-e-e (Yeah), ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I'm the only one of me
Baby, that's the fun of me
Eeh-eeh-eeh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You're the only one of you
Baby, that's the fun of you
And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me-e-e

[Outro]
Girl, there ain't no I in "team" (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
But you know there is a "me"
I'm the only one of me
Baby, that's the fun of me (Eeh-eeh-eeh)
Strike the band up, 1, 2, 3 (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
You can't spell "awesome" without "me"
You're the only one of you
Baby, that's the fun of you
And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me-e-e

[Intro]
Whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa
Hope I got enough oxygen for this
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Let's uh, let's see
Whoa

[Verse 1]
How do it feel when you make it?
Is every day just another vacation?
Livin' needs no reason, just like seasons, they keep changin'
Have you seen the people's faces when you take away their pain?
That shit is prettier than any picture Monet could've painted
I, swear to God I never could've saw this happenin'
You was, you was rappin' and your mind started unravellin'
You back again with complications, that was then, this is now
You was on your way out, you stayed up and turned that shit around
Pittsburgh is a little town, you made it out of (Yeah)
Look at all these things you did, are you not proud of
What you accomplished?
Was success everything that you wanted?
Are you bein' honest with yourself? (Yeah)
How you doin'? How's your health? (Yeah)
Well, I'm fine (Fine)
I left the past behind (Behind)
I'm only an architect, the world is just design
I don't mind all of the rumors, I'm just fine bein' a loser
Sit behind my own computer
It's divine, it's Hallelujah on my mind (Whoa, whoa, whoa)
You need to let it all play out
The world is tryna hold you back, you found another way out
See the signs (Signs)
'Cause they're right in front your face
You got the light inside you, please don't let it go to waste (Whoa)

[Chorus 1]
Don't waste your time here
You don't got time to lose
Walk along the chosen road
On your own
Please free your mind here
You got a mind to lose
Will you make love to my dirty soul? (Make love)
Whoa (Will you make love, girl?)
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Whoa, whoa
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Whoa, whoa-oh-oh

[Verse 2]
Yeah
Everybody got opinions when you make millions
All God's children, let me keep livin'
I've been keepin' it real (Real)
I can't sleep without pills (Pills)
Will it all go wrong? (Will it all go wrong?)
What'd you visualize every single time that you made them songs? (You made them songs)
Can you just hold on? (Hold on)
Yeah
Havin' nightmares from the bottom (Bottom)
Heaven is for legends, Hell is Hell for the forgotten (Whoa, whoa)
I've been dealin' with some problems, I've been longin' for your love (Love)
Crazy, selfish, doin' drugs (Drugs)
Check off all of the above, yeah (Whoa)
They told me, "Get it together, 'cause God is waitin' for you" (Waitin')
Your life will never be normal, I got some paper for you (Money)
Just respect who you are, or they gonna take that from you (They gon' take it)
Everybody gotta die, that shit just make you mortal

[Chorus 2]
Don't waste your time here (Whoa, whoa)
Walk along the chosen road
Walk along the chosen road, yeah
Please free your mind here
Go ahead and free your mind
Will you make love to my dirty soul? (Said, will you make love?)
Oh (Will, will, will you make love?)
Ooh (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
I've been a fool, take me home
Take me back home
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh (Fuck the rules, make your own)
Make your own
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Carry me home to my daddy
Carry me home to my mom
Carry me home to my love
Carry me home to my home

The rain's fallin' down on me
The wind is blowin' cold
My eyes gettin' tired
I guess I won't grow old

Don't wanna die
Carry me home
Sweet, sweet home
Don't want to die this way
In this cold
Carry me home
Oh, sweet, sweet home

Don't wanna die
Can this feeling ever go
I wanna live
Life
Is meant to live
And I'm afraid
I'm afraid to die
Please God, please God
Don't take my life
Please, please help me

Carry me
Carry me home
Carry me home
I'm afraid to die
Please, please
Carry me home
Carry me home

Angel nights
Naw, so... so, just listen. All right so, so what you do is, right. You take Lupe Fiasco, right, okay? You take Lupe Fiasco, you know and then you take the Gorillaz, right. You take the Fiasco on Lupe Fiasco, you take the Fiasco off, right. And then you take
The z off, off the Gorillaz—you take, you take that off, and you drop that, and then, like, you put it together. You know, put it together. You got—you made a Gorrila. You know what I'm saying? You got me doing my thing, you know what I'm saying? With the rappin' and stuff I know how to do. Then you got, you got the Gorillaz doin' they thing over here with the beats, you know what I'm saying? You know—you know I rhyme over that, do that; do that. 

[?] Lupe the Gorilla. I - I thought it was cool. I was thinkin' it was dope (You are now entering the 

[?]), you know what I'm sayin'? And then I was thinkin', like, you could call it, ya know, A Rhyming Ape.
If it's what you truly want
I can wear her skin over mine, her hair over mine
Her hands as gloves, her teeth as confetti
Her scalp, a cap
Her sternum, my bedazzled cane
We can pose for a photograph, all three of us
Immortalized
You and your perfect girl

[Verse 1]
It's hard to look into your eyes
Knowing it might be the last time
The spaces in between our breaths
They're singing to the infinite

[Pre-Chorus]
Sudden changes make the air uncomfortable
I'll hold you so you're not alone

[Chorus]
When I'm quiet on the other side
Know that I'm loving you, that's all I do
Is keep loving you
You're fine, my love, never mind 'cause I'm here
I keep laughing to myself
I'm so in love with loving you, that's all I do
Is keep loving you
Where things will change, but I'll always be the same

[Verse 2]
The silence is a lonely thing
Waiting for a sound to fall
A lullaby to calm our sleep
The promise of another world

[Pre-Chorus]
Sudden changes make the air uncomfortable
Oh, hold me so I'm not alone, no

[Chorus]
When I'm quiet on the other side
Know that I'm loving you, that's all I do
Is keep loving you
You're fine, my love, never mind 'cause I'm here
I keep laughing to myself
I'm so in love with loving you, that's all I do
Is keep loving you
Where things will change, but I'll always be the same

[Bridge]
Float into the endless night
Dust cradles our names
And all the things we ever cared for
To run again without the pain
To love you without being afraid
To fall into the flowers bloom, of the other side

[Chorus]
When I'm quiet on the other side
Know that I'm loving you, that's all I do
Is keep loving you
You're fine, my love, never mind 'cause I'm here
I keep laughing to myself
I'm so in love with loving you, that's all I do
Is keep loving you
Where things will change, but I'll always be the same

[Outro]
Oh, when I'm quiet on the other side
Yeah, I am loving you, that's all I do
And things will change, but you'll be alright

[Intro: Ludacris]
Here we go, Luda!

[Verse 1: Ludacris]
The world's screwed and niggas pourin’ drinks like Bill Huxtable (Ha)
I love R. Kelly but around my daughters, I'm not comfortable (Uh)
Stand for what you believe in like Kaepernick
You either in control or you gettin' fucked, no abstinence
Huh, it’s not enough blacks in the drivin' seat like a Nascar
Why? Cause most racist people still drinkin' what's at Roseanne's bar
Hah, Gandhi told me to be the change that I wanna see
But Mayweather told me blow my change on the shopping spree
What the world needs now (What's that?)
Is love sweet love (Is love sweet love)
But while the world takes its time
Can I get some drug sweet drugs? (Drug sweet drugs)
'Cause when you rich too rich, all you get is mug, mean mugs
And I'm gettin’ to that age, sweet age
I shouldn’t be up in the club, sweet club
Damn, grown shit, oldest daughter 'bout to go to college, nigga
Least I can do is leave her with a little knowledge, nigga
Yeah the clock’s tickin' but just know that all my music timeless, nigga
Ha, rap brought me back to restore a little bit of balance, nigga

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Uh, goin' brazy in the Lamb
I don't give a damn, bitch fuck the ’Gram
Uh, pay these niggas no mind
Tried to pay attention, gotta underpay 'em
Damn, shit 'bout to get ugly
Like Shabba Ranks, Mr. Lover Man
Damn, anytime the GOAT speak
All the GOAT need is silence of the lambs, bitch
Any questions, any problems
We could talk about it or we could shoot shots, swish
If the message in the bottle too hard to swallow
We could do shots, bitch
Goin' brazy in the Lamb
I don't give a damn, bitch fuck the 'Gram
Uh, anytime the GOAT speak
All the GOAT need is silence of the lambs, bitch

[Verse 2: Ludacris]
Yeah, life's a test that X's all the losers from winners (Yeah)
Oh, watch me pass on that ass like Kendall Jenner (Woah)
Woah, they say between love and hate there's a thin line (Yeah)
I say love or hate, still no snitchin', that's a 6ix9ine (No)
.45 tucked away in the gut (Uh) ain't a killer but don't test me
'Cause if any nigga try to come at me or my family
Then the cops is gonna have to arrest me, catch me, fetch me
Niggas is wearin' a bulletproof vest just to go outside (Brr)
Innocent people are bystanders
Some are recordin' murders on they cameras or they on Live (Live)
Social media got kids wantin' to commit suicide (Damn)
'Cause everybody's gettin' scrutinized (Damn)
'Gram stuntin', those the truest lies
Now the parents need to be supervised
That's ass backwards
Bombs blowin' from the terrorist attackers (Woah)
Natural disasters, computer crashes (Woah)
World leaders clashin' (Ooh)
Separatin' us into different classes
Protect the elite and destroy the masses
So all up in the hood, it's pistols blastin'
No wonder why the hood gets not compassion
We don't have no shape, form or fashion
Feelin' like Mother Earth is mismatchin'
So we gotta hurry up and take some action
Or close your eyes and just imagine, damn

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Uh, goin' brazy in the Lamb
I don't give a damn, bitch fuck the 'Gram
Uh, pay these niggas no mind
Tried to pay attention, gotta underpay 'em
Damn, shit 'bout to get ugly
Like Shabba Ranks, Mr. Lover Man
Damn, anytime the GOAT speak
All the GOAT need is silence of the lambs, bitch
Any questions, any problems
We could talk about it or we could shoot shots, swish
If the message in the bottle too hard to swallow
We could do shots, bitch
Goin' brazy in the Lamb
I don't give a damn, bitch fuck the 'Gram
Uh, anytime the GOAT speak
All the GOAT need is silence of the lambs, bitch
...Kick a hyper lyric every time I run up on a
Track, you know I'm not wack, you have to step back
'Cause if you don't I'll prove that I'm the mack
Every time I kick a lyric two-and-a-two to ninety-five
Yo, do you find me live?
If you don't, then that's alright, 'cause I'll just grab the microphone
And I just gotta get to the height to speak in the hyper tone
In so many styles, I might get thrown
And here's a place where I like to roam
And all the girls that I like to bone
Have the big butts, no they don't
'Cause I don't like that nigga shit
I'm just here to make a bigger hit
When I be kickin' the hypest, dopest rhymes
They'll say that Eminem is the best MC in off and all times
Yeah...

[Verse 1]
Laying down on the lawn
I'm tired of trying to get in the house
I'm thinking out loud
I've been playing dead
My whole life
And I get this feeling whenever I feel good
It'll be the last time

[Refrain]
But I feel something when I see you now
I feel something when I see you

[Verse 2]
If you're a work of art
I'm standing too close
I can see the brush strokes
I hate your mom
I hate it when she opens her mouth
It's amazing to me how much you can say
When you don't know what you're talking about

[Refrain]
But I feel something when I see you now
I feel something when I see you

[Verse 3]
I used to light you up
Now I can't even get you to play the drums
'Cause I don't know what I want
Until I fuck it up

[Refrain]
But I feel something when I see you now
I feel something

[Outro]
I'll climb through the window again
But right now, it feels good not to stand
Then I'll leave it wide open
Let the dystopian morning light pour in

[Intro]
So real, so real, so real, so real

[Verse 1]
Remember when I told you, baby
I can't stop thinking ‘bout ya
It's so real, it's so real
The way I feel about ya, mmm

[Pre-Chorus]
You can look up towards the sky
Forever yours, forever mine
Don't stop 'til we get it right
If they ask, I'll tell no lies

[Chorus]
We are the truth
Baby, that's what we are
We are the truth
Baby, that's what we are
We are the truth
Baby, that's what we are
‘Cause we are the truth, yeah
Baby, that's what we are

[Verse 2]
Even when the weather's crazy (Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah)
It won't last forever (Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah)
As long as we're together (Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah)
We always make it better (Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah)
Just take my hand and let's go (Ooh, baby, ooh, baby, ooh)
Don't need an explanation (Ooh, baby, ooh, baby, ooh)
You know the destination (Ooh, baby, ooh, baby, ooh)
No hesitation, let's go (Ooh, baby, ooh, baby, ooh)

[Pre-Chorus]
You can look up towards the sky
Forever yours, forever mine
Don't stop 'til we get it right
If they ask, I'll tell no lies

[Chorus]
We are the truth
Baby, that's what we are
We are the truth
Baby, that's what we are
We are the truth
Baby, that's what we are
‘Cause we are the truth, yeah
Baby, that's what we are
We are the truth
Baby, that's what we are
We are the truth
Baby, that's what we are
We are the truth
Baby, that's what we are

So real, so real, so real, so real

[Intro: Willie Dynamite & Snoop Dogg]
Yes and we're back here at the jack-off hour
187.4 on your FM dial, I am Willie Dynamite and we're getting ready for another quarantine kick-off hour
We got the D-O-double-G here, yeah that's right, we got Snoop Dogg in the house (Ha-ha)
Speakin' of house, streetlights on, nigga get yo' ass in, and stay there
I wanna go outside, but I'm stuck in the house (In the house)
I wanna take a ride, but I'm sittin' right on the couch (Woah-ooh)

[Chorus]
You can't tell me this is how we supposed to be livin' (No, no)
I'm just waitin' for the day I can have some fun (Fun)
Too much time on my hands, my whole world is spinnin' (Turn around)
I just want to have a good time in the sky

[Post-Chorus]
I'd rather be out there in the streets
In my hood, in the beach, feelin' good
Reppin' that Eastside LBC (That's what I'm talkin' 'bout)
Usually, I would be out there in the club
VIP, bangin' the dub, fresh and clean
Reppin' that Eastside LBC (That's what I'm talkin' 'bout)

[Verse 1]
I got the rhythm it takes to dance through what we have to live through (They say don't go outside, it ain't safe to play, baby)
I'm in my house just chillin'
Here's my chance to dance my way, out of my constriction

[Verse 2]
Movin' in the mirror, while listenin' to some oldies
Cookin' in the kitchen, Madden with the homies
Release a little tension, dinner with the family (I'm in my house just chillin')
And you know it ain't nothin' wrong with spendin' a little quality time, baby (Ooh-ooh)

[Chorus]
You can't tell me this is how we supposed to be livin' (No, no)
I'm just waitin' for the day I can have some fun (Fun)
Too much time on my hands, my whole world is spinnin' (Turn around)
I just want to have a good time in the sky

[Post-Chorus]
I'd rather be out there in the streets
In my hood, in the beach, feelin' good
Reppin' that Eastside LBC (That's what I'm talkin' 'bout)
Usually, I would be out there in the club
VIP, bangin' the dub, fresh and clean
Reppin' that Eastside LBC

[Bridge]
I wanna go outside, but I'm stuck in the house (In the house)
I wanna take a ride, but I'm sittin' right on the couch (It's better to be safe than sorry)

[Verse 3]
Yeah, you got that right
Choose my battles wisely, ain't gon' fight that fight
All my family and friends, I just want 'em to live
Happy times and good health, old to the young
Times gon' get better, I know it's slow to come
I couldn't hold my tongue (I got a little message for you)
We gon' take our time, ain't no need to rush, we'll be back in the sun (Wanna get out in the sunshine, ooh-woah)

[Chorus]
You can't tell me this is how we supposed to be livin' (No, no)
I'm just waitin' for the day I can have some fun (I just wanna have a little fun, baby)
Too much time on my hands, my whole world is spinnin' (Turn around)
I just want to have a good time in the sky

[Post-Chorus]
I'd rather be out there in the streets
In my hood, in the beach, feelin' good

Reppin' that Eastside LBC

[Outro]
You got that right, baby
Wanna get out in the sunshine (Uh, Snoop D-O-double-G, baby)
Sunshine

[Verse 1: Jack Steadman & Rae Morris]
You promised the world and I fell for it
I put you first and you adored it
Set fire to my forest
And you let it burn
Sang off-key in my chorus
'Cause it wasn't yours, yeah
I saw the signs and I ignored it
Rose-colored glasses all distorted
Set fire to my purpose
And I let it burn
You got off on the hurtin'
When it wasn't yours, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Jack Steadman & Rae Morris]
We'd always go into it blindly
I needed to lose you to find me
This dancing was killing me softly
I needed to hate you to love me, yeah

[Chorus: Jack Steadman & Rae Morris, Rae Morris]
To love, love
To love, love
To love, yeah
I needed to lose you to love me, yeah
To love, love
To love, love
To love, yeah
I needed to lose you to love me, yeah

[Verse 2: Rae Morris]
I gave my all and they all know it
Then you tore me down and now it's showing
In two months, you replaced us
Like it was easy
Made me think I deserved it
In the thick of healing, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Jack Steadman & Rae Morris]
We'd always go into it blindly
I needed to lose you to find me
This dancing was killing me softly
I needed to hate you to love me, yeah

[Refrain]
To love, love
To love, love, yeah
To love, love
To love, love, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Jack Steadman & Rae Morris]
We'd always go into it blindly
I needed to lose you to find me
This dancing was killing me softly
I needed to hate you to love me, yeah

[Chorus: Jack Steadman & Rae Morris, Rae Morris]
To love, love
To love, love
To love, yeah
I needed to lose you to love me, yeah
To love, love

I needed to lose you to love me, yeah

[Refrain]
To love, love
To love, love, yeah
To love, love
To love, love, yeah

[Verse 1]
When I turn out, not a word out
It's my reality
Then I curl up, it won't take much
To stand in front and see

[Chorus]
I got that ego, what do I know?
When I can hardly see
Fall away now, on my way down
It's all I know and I can hardly speak

[Verse 2]
There's a lighthouse, I can hide out
Staring out to sea
Shine a word through, did it reach you?
Or echo back to me?

[Chorus]
I got that ego, what do I know?
When I can hardly see
Fall away now, on my way down
It's all I know and I can hardly speak

[Post-Chorus]
A picture on the wall looking back at me
And I can't even talk
I'm floating in a dream

[Bridge]
You say I've a bent tooth
Well, I don't even like you
Want me to leave my cocoon
Where does that leave you?
You say you can see my bones
Well I can see right through you
Too many faces to please
I can't see a place for me

[Bridge]
And I come home to write it all
And I come home to write it all
And I come home to write it all
And I come home, And I come home

[Verse 2]
There's a lighthouse, I can hide out
Staring out to sea
Shine a word through, did it reach you?
Or echo back to me?

[Chorus]
I got that ego, what do I know?
When I can hardly see
Fall away now, on my way down
It's all I know and I can hardly speak

[Intro]
Da-ba-da-da-di-da
Oh, oh, oh, oh
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?
What you, what you gon' do

Falling, fallin'

[Pre-Chorus]
Centre of attention
You know you can get whatever you want, want me
Whenever you want it, baby
It's you in my reflection
I'm afraid of all the things it could do, do me
If I would've known it, baby

[Chorus]
Oh no, I was doing better alone
But when you said, "Hello"
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?

[Verse]
I wonder, when you go, if I stay on your mind
Two can play that game, but you win me every time
Everyone before you was a waste of time
Yeah, you got me

[Pre-Chorus]
Centre of attention
You know you can get whatever you want, want me
Whenever you want it, baby
It's you in my reflection
I'm afraid of all the things it could do to me
If I would've known it, baby

[Chorus]
Break my heart
Break my heart
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?
One that could break my heart?
Oh no, I was doing better alone
But when you said, "Hello"
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?

[Build]
Whaddup, whaddup, whaddup, whaddup?
Alright, look, look, look, look, look
Just in case you ain't got it by now
Listen to me, bring it in
If you are alive
I know you ain't reach your best yet
You got more, you could do more
You could see more, you could be more, alright?
Right now, you should feel invincible
Powerful, strong, look
Where your focus goes, your energy flows
Are you hearin' me?

[Drop]
A-ha
Now we goin' take it to another level
Right now, you should feel invincible
Powerful, strong, look
A-ha

[Build]
A  lot of you, you're not where you wanna be
You thinkin' of that negative stuff
You talkin' negativity
You in that negative zone
I need you to do me a favor
I need you to know that
In order for you to get on that next level
The one thing you need to do
To go where you've never gone before
Is to change the way you think
Where your focus goes, your energy flows
Are you hearin' me?

[Drop]
Right now, you should feel invincible
Powerful, strong, look
A-ha

DJ Technique
Go, Biggie

[Verse 1: The Notorious B.I.G. & Cheri Dennis]
Why not blow up the spot with Sadat?
Release the brainstorm
To make your motherfucking brain warm (Go, Biggie)
A strange form, something kind of lyrical
Biggie the bastard, Sadat's kind of spiritual
Well, in God we trust, guns I bust
Got that disgusting, sewer-style dumping
And, uh, do you know where you're going to?
Do you like the things that I bring?
Make an MC wanna sing for a living
Take the beatdown we fucking giving

[Verse 2: Cheri Dennis]
Throw your Glock in the air and wave it
I'm going crazy steady contemplating
Wonderin' if they finally caught up with ya
Confident myself looking at your picture
Try not to mention, just to leave it alone
Stay off the streets and just come on home
Got enough to move out the hood
To be sitting on something nice and living good, oh no

[Chorus: Cheri Dennis]
Oh no, you just can't let it go
It's all you know
Is this life so on the road
Until the end (Until the end)
Right here hustling
'Cause I can't lie
I wonder why
You just don't give somethin' else a try

[Post-Chorus: Akon]
You wonder why I'm still on the block
'Cause I just can't leave it baby, 'cause that's all I know
Throw the gat away when you see the cops
Come back and retrieve it baby, 'cause that's all I know
'Cause that's how we roll
From the gutter straight to your front door
That's all I know
A bunch of thug niggas with an appetite
And you know we gon' feed it, baby
'Cause that's all I know

[Verse 2: Keith Murray]
Put the guns down and leave the beef alone (Uh huh)
But Kira, one thing, I can't leave the streets alone
Slinging that yay' bomb, getting my cake on
Flows Cajun like Biggie and Akon
Hold heat like a radiator
Beneath the Avi', hit the azy
Stash box in the aviator (Yeah)
Flash knots, push rocks like an 88'er (Yeah)
Cash dots, don't play yourself like a masturbater

[Chorus: Cheri Dennis]
Oh no, you just can't let it go
It's all you know
Is this life so on the road
Until the end (Until the end)
Right here hustling
'Cause I can't lie
I wonder why
You just don't give somethin' else a try

[Post-Chorus: Akon]
You wonder why I'm still on the block
'Cause I just can't leave it baby, 'cause that's all I know
Throw the gat away when you see the cops
Come back and retrieve it baby, 'cause that's all I know
'Cause that's how we roll
From the gutter straight to your front door
That's all I know
A bunch of thug niggas with an appetite
And you know we gon' feed it, baby
'Cause that's all I know

[Verse 3: G-Dep]
Get involved, if you ain't down with them bats, get a job
You scared? Get a dog, rub it in like a massage
We them Harlem World stars and we all charge like credit cards
Man, look on me, see a crook all clean
Bend gals and ain't talkin' bout football team
Hits like can't get right
Catch me in the hood like head lice
It still got nice with red price like

[Chorus: Cheri Dennis]
Oh no, you just can't let it go
It's all you know
Is this life so on the road
Until the end (Until the end)
Right here hustling
'Cause I can't lie
I wonder why
You just don't give somethin' else a try

[Post-Chorus: Akon]
You wonder why I'm still on the block
'Cause I just can't leave it baby, 'cause that's all I know
Throw the gat away when you see the cops
Come back and retrieve it baby, 'cause that's all I know

From the gutter straight to your front door

'Cause that's all I know

[Intro: Doja Cat & The Weeknd]
Oh
Ooh, yeah

[Verse 1: The Weeknd]
I just pretend that I'm in the dark, and
I don't regret 'cause my heart can't take a loss
I'd rather be so oblivious
I'd rather be with you

[Pre-Chorus: The Weeknd]
When it's said, when it's done, yeah
I don't ever wanna know
I can tell what you done, yeah
When I look at you

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
In your eyes
I see there's something burning inside you
Oh, inside you
In your eyes
I know it hurts to smile, but you try to
Oh, you try to
You always try to hide the pain
You always know just what to say
I always look the other way
I'm blind, I'm blind
In your eyes
You lie, but I don't let it define you
Oh, define you

[Verse 2: Doja Cat & The Weeknd]
I never lied when I cried for you
And I know you cry too (Know you cry too)
You're reading minds, just couldn't deny you do
Always hard to say bye to you (And I taught myself to say)
Love the way you're talkin', love your style, but, ooh, babe
We know that you got it from me
And it's haunting you deep, too hard not to see it
Hate the way I feel love, only hurts with real love
And it's taking every part of me, when you look, I could see love
One day, I'm giving you space
And the next day, you're giving me faces
And I like parties, not this place
It's comin' out of my bag for you to get wasted
I (Can't stop staring at you)
It's like I forgot that staring is rude
And that's what five shots could turn me into (Oh yeah)
But you've done most things that gentlemens do, so (Oh)

[Pre-Chorus: The Weeknd]
When it's said, when it's done, yeah
I would never let you know (Let you know)
I'm ashamed of what I've done, yeah
When I look at you

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
In your eyes (Your eyes)
I see there's something burning inside you (Inside you)
Oh, inside you (Oh, inside you)
In your eyes
I know it hurts to smile, but you try to (Try to)
Oh, you try to (I try to, babe)
You always try to hide the pain (Oh, oh)
You always know just what to say (Oh yeah)
I always look the other way
I'm blind, I'm blind
In your eyes
You lie, but I don't let it define you (Oh)
Oh, define you

[Outro: Doja Cat]
Oh

[Verse 1: Matt Champion]
Yeah, go sit out
Cold soul through, black know 'em, don't got no tools for now
They both sit out
A-T-L, we grab him 'fore the dawgs come out, bouncin' out
What am I supposed to do when we feel down and out?
Wonderful, hate that a bitch stare'll make me feel so magical, like
You would sit back, hit that three now, got a three and O
Got four and then my Deage come out, weavin' out
Nothing really ever come easy now
Grind it down 'til the world feel unbelievable
Leave you now, I can't even—now, now, now, now

[Chorus: Ryan Beatty]
Yeah, that's the downside (Downside) of keeping it in
That's the downside (Downside) of playing pretend
I'm not shining for somebody for a love in the dark
I'm working too hard
And that's the downside (Downside) of keeping it in
That's the downside (Downside) of playing pretend
I'm not shining for somebody for a love in the dark
I'm working too hard
That's the downside

[Verse 2: Matt Champion]
First couple racks, just spend it on some new Chanel (Ayy)
Caught a whiff and now, ooh, got that new smell
Pushing in that G-Wagen, I wonder how that coupe feel
How is you feel? Uh, grinding too, still

[Chorus: Ryan Beatty]
Yeah, that's the downside (Downside) of keeping it in
That's the downside (Downside) of playing pretend
I'm not shining for somebody for a love in the dark
I'm working too hard
That's the downside (Downside) of keeping it in
That's the downside (Downside) of playing pretend
I'm not shinin' for somebody for a love in the dark
I'm working too hard
That's the downside

[Outro: Ryan Beatty]
That's the downside
That's the downside
Shinin' for somebody for a love in the dark
I'm workin' too hard

I remember when my life was torn apart
Things I would do to be happy would always break my heart
But then one day decided to give all my troubles to the Lord
He loosed the shackles that were holding me
And Satan had to flee and now

I am free, no more chains are binding me
I am free, I got a brand new walk, a brand new talk
I am free, no more chains are binding me
I am free, I got a brand new way of living, no more time for slippin'

Now that I can see above water
I only have heaven in my view
Lord, I want to thank you for the love you gave
’Cause it was your love that brought me through

No, I can't turn around and I won't look back
For Lord, you set my spirit free and now I am happy

I am free, no more chains are binding me
I am free, I got a brand new walk, a brand new talk
I am free, no more chains are binding me
I am free, I got a brand new way of living, no more time for slippin’
I am free, places I used to go, I don't go no more
Because I am free, things I used to do, I don't wanna do no more
Because I am free, Satan no longer has authority over me
Because he set me free, Jesus set me free
I love the name of Jesus because he set me free
I wanna walk in newness of life
I wanna walk upright because I'm free
So much talk is going on about
How Jesus loves us
Everyone is quick to say with joy
That they will see His face

No one ever gives account
Of what it really requires
To give ourselves just as
He gave and this is why I pray

Let thy will be done, Oh Lord
Hear my cry Oh Lord as I called out to thee
To serve you everyday is my earnest plea
Lord have your way

Your Way
So much talk is going on
About how Jesus Love us
Everyone is quick to say yes

I'm saved I'm going to see
His face but no one ever give
Account of what it really requires
To give ourselves just as he gave
This is why I pray lord
Let your will be oh done oh lord
Down in me hear my cry oh lord
As I cal out to thee I want to serve

You everyday that is my earnest plea
I want to walk as you walked
In the will of the father from on high
As you gave your life you knew

The son would sometimes be denied
But still you loved me in spite of all
My sinful ways that is why I can say
Let Thy Will Be Done

Hear my cry oh Lord
As I call out to thee
I want to serve you everyday
That is my earnest plea

I wanna walk as you walked
I wanna live as only you lived hear my cry oh Lord
I'm calling out to thee I want to serve
I want to serve you everyday to walk in your holy way

Help me
Lord to serve you everyday
That's my earnest plea
Yeah!
Yeah yeah hhehheheh!
Yeah yeah uh heee yeah!

Gotta have love
Gotta have love
Gotta have love
Real love

When I was just a girl
My mama said to me
You can't fight hate with hate
You gotta love unselfishly
Love is not just a word
But a way of life you keep
You need to know
You're not here just to receive

Now that I'm older
Her advice I still take heed
For the power of his love
Lives in me
Ya gotta have love
Ya gotta have love on your mind
Ya gotta have love
Real love
Let your heart be your guide
It's gotta be real love
Feel so good in love
Gotta be real love
Or there's no sense in wasting your time

Didn't have to go far
To find myself
Cause he knows the real me
More than anyone else
I found a higher place
Who's voice I must obey
When I was a child
I heard the Word that say
Now abide in these
Hope and charity
And the greatest of these three
Has set me free

Ya gotta have love
Ya gotta have love on your mind
Ya gotta have love
Real love
Let your heart be your guide
It's gotta be real love
Feel so good in love
Gotta be real love
Or there's no sense in wasting your time
Gotta be unconditional love
Ya gotta be an example
Gotta have love
Love feels so good inside
It's gotta be a type of love
Or there's no sense in wasting your time
Yeah sing it girl
Ya gotta have love
Y.A
Check it out check it out check it out
We got to have love
Because we're gettin' beat on the street
And others meet defeat with no heat
And nothin' to eat
And when you're walking down the street
You gotta step with pep
Cause fools are mad enough to rob you
Just to get a rep
Is it me G
Or is it society
But I can't see why
We kill for notoriety
That's whack
We lack love for the black
In fact
Let's end the attack
So we can get the love

Gotta have love
Gotta have love on your mind
The man on the street with nothing to eat
Wants love
The daughter who doesn't know her father
Wants love
Gotta have love
Mothers and fathers
Sisters and brothers
Want love
Real love
Let your heart be your guide
Everybody I know
Even they want love
They want a love that's real
One they can feel
One that's deep inside
That they can no longer hide
It's gotta be real love
Gotta be love
Or there's no sense in wastin' yo time
It starts out with a kiss
Even though you're only friends
Now there's nothing wrong with this
But this is where his act begins

He'll hold you and tell you
That's what love is for
Oh but don't give in to him
No, no don't give in to him
Cause he will only ask for more

You don't want to lose him
So you let him have his way
You don't dare refuse him
Because you know the price you'll pay
He's braggin' that he's never lost before
So don't give in to him
No, no don't give in to him
Cause he will only ask for more

Baby, don't give in to him
No, no don't give in to him
Cause I'm the one who loves you more
Be not dismayed whate'er betide
God will take care of you
Beneath his wings of love abide
God will take care of you

God will take care of you
Through every day, o'er all the way
He will take care of you
God will take care of you

Through days of toil when heart doth fail
God will take care of you
When dangers fierce your path assail
God will take care of you

God will take care of you
Through every day, o'er all the way
He will take care of you
God will take care of you

All you may need he will provide
God will take care of you
Nothing you ask will be denied
God will take care of you
God will take care of you
Through every day, o'er all the way
He will take care of you
God will take care of you

No matter what may be the test
God will take care of you
Lean, weary one, upon his breast
God will take care of you

God will take care of you
Through every day, o'er all the way
He will take care of you
God will take care of you
When we were together, I held you down
I gave you all of me, but look at us now
Thinking of all your excuses, but they don't add up
Now it's so easy to see you don't deserve my love

You pushed me far you brought me to this
You had my heart but then you blew it
And I'm so over you, go get lost
Boy who do you think that you are

Trust and believe me, you're gonna need me
Trust and believe me, she'll never be me
And I'm so over you, go get lost
Boy I don't know, who do you think that you are?

You look so foolish
With my best friend
And she ain't no better than you, she's a three
I'm a ten
So why are you calling my phone
You ain't got nothing I want
Thought we were really in love
But that was all up front
You pushed me far you brought me to it
You had my heart but then you blew it, oh
And I'm so over you, go get lost
Boy who do you think that you are

Trust and believe me, you're gonna need me
Trust and believe me, she'll never be me
And I'm so over you, go get lost
Boy I don't know, who do you think you are?

How did you try to clean it up
Boy please just stop it now (Stop it now)
Don't make a sound

'Coz you pushed me far
You brought me to this
You had my heart but then you blew it, ohh
And I'm so over you, so get lost (Go get lost)
Boy who do, who do you think you are?

Believe me, you're gonna need me (You're gonna need me)
Trust and believe me, (Believe me) She'll never be me
And I'm so over you (Over you)
Go get lost (Go get lost)

If you call, I will answer
The cares of this life
Have drained you dry
It's gotten serious almost disastrous
Deceptions and lies
You've overcome by despair
Trying to find the answer everywhere
Running to and fro asking everyone you know

No impossibility if you come to me

Running to and fro asking everyone you know

[Chorus]

Was out there by my lone
You helped me get to know me
You know me well, I owe you
I know I won't hold back
Oh no, I can't hold back, babe

Who knew what you'd do?
I just can't time waste

I'm in my bag
Way back when a nigga didn't no have sense
You was a Fabergé egg then
Much too delicate
I could not fathom breaking bread then
Now I'm breaking bad habits
Had to face the backtracking
Had to face and ask
(Who knew?)
(Who knew?)

I could grow like the trees
I could show you I could change
(If you wanna go, won't make a stand)
(I already showed my hand)
If you don't, we could roll
Light the smoke, let it in
(And we'll be gone off that in ten)
(That's when the vibe starts setting in)
I could grow like the trees
I could show you I could change
(If you wanna go, won't make a stand)
(I already showed my hand)
If you don't, we could roll
Light the smoke, let it in
(And we'll be gone off that in ten)

I could grow like the trees
I could show you I could change
(If you wanna go, won't make a stand)
(I already showed my hand)
If you don't, we could roll
Light the smoke, let it in
(And we'll be gone off that in ten)
(That's when the vibe starts setting in)
I could grow like the trees
I could show you I could change
(If you wanna go, won't make a stand)
(I already showed my hand)
If you don't, we could roll
Light the smoke, let it in

I could grow like the trees
I could show you I could change
(If you wanna go, won't make a stand)
(I already showed my hand)
If you don't, we could roll
Light the smoke, let it in
Let it in, let it in

I could grow like the trees
I could show you I could change
If you wanna go, won't make a stand
I already showed my hand
If you don't, we could roll
Light the smoke, let it in
And we'll be gone off that in ten

If you wanna go, won't make a stand
I already showed my hand

Light the smoke, let it in
And we'll be gone off that in ten
That's when the vibe starts setting in
That's when the vibe starts setting in
(That's when the vibe starts setting in)
(Thinkin' 'bout you, baby)
(Thinkin' 'bout you, baby)

(Where do I go) When you're away?
(What do I do?) Think of you
(Thinkin' 'bout you, baby)

(Thinkin' 'bout you, baby)
(Thinkin' 'bout you, baby)

Thinkin' of you (Thinkin')
Here by my side
Wanting just to touch your face and hands
(Thinkin' 'bout you, ba-)

(Thinkin' 'bout you, baby)
(Thinkin' 'bout you, baby)

[Verse 1]
I'm not tryna have another conversation
Probably not gon' wanna play me on your station
Pourin' out a bottle full of my frustration
Here to tell you somethin' that you don't know
I'm the type to drive a pickup through your mansion
I'm completely naked, but I'm makin' it fashion
Maybe gettin' married just to cause a distraction
Here to tell you somethin' that you don't know

[Pre-Chorus]
Am I wrong that I moved on and I
And I don't even miss you?
Thought that it'd be you until I die
But I let go

[Chorus]
What the fuck do I know? I'm alone
'Cause I couldn't be somebody's hero
You want an apology? Not from me
Had to leave you in your own misery
So tell me, baby, am I wrong that I moved on?
And I, and I don't even miss you
Thought that it'd be you until I die
But I let go, what the fuck do I know? (Oh)

[Verse 2]
Tryin' to see the stars through the new pollution
Think that I'm the problem? Honey, I'm the solution
Maybe all the chaos is for your amusement
Here to tell you somethin' that you don't know
Put you on a pedestal, you're cravin' the spotlight
Desperate for attention, nose is bloody, it's daylight
Wakin' up with people that we met for the first time
Loved it, then I hated it, and I let you go

[Chorus]
What the fuck do I know? I'm alone
'Cause I couldn't be somebody's hero
You want an apology? Not from me
I had to leave you in your own misery
So tell me, baby, am I wrong that I moved on?
And I, and I don't even miss you
Thought that it'd be you until I die
But I let go, what the fuck do I know?

[Post-Chorus]
What?

[Chorus]
What the fuck do I know? (Do I know) I'm alone (I'm alone)
'Cause I couldn't be somebody's hero
You want an apology? (Apology) Not from me (Not from me)
I had to leave you in your own misery
So tell me, baby, am I wrong that I moved on?
And I, and I don't even miss you
Thought that it'd be you until I die
But I let go, what the fuck do I know?

[DJ Dr. Cuess]
One, two
Dr. Cuess is in the house
Along with the Swing Mob
DMX the Great
And here we go to set things straight
For '92

(Chorus) (scratching)
"Catching the same hell" 3x

[DMX]
Straight out the dark, DMX-X-X is
Coming through like a drop-top Lexus
Just know that I'm gonna be on every corner
Waiting for ya, just might make you wanna
Watch for shadows cause I be lurking, working
Bagging up, another dick jerking MC that wants to be like me
D-M-X T-H-E G-R-E-A-T
Back the fuck up, because I don't burn I singe
And even if you murder me, I'm getting revenge
And coming back to hawk you, stalk you
Everywhere you walk you chump, from LA to New York to
Where ever you go, I'll be there like a shadow
Shoving a mic in your face 'cause it's a battle
You know my M-O, my name rings bells
And emcees are catching the same hell
(Chorus) (scratching)
"Catching the same hell" 3x

[DMX]
They say D rock longer, so long is what I D
They say faster, so I multiply my speed by two
They say D get more aggressive, so I rock harder
And when they say "Fuck that nigga", then I'm a start a
War, it just might turn out to be
A six month motherfuckin' wrecking spree
Whatever happens happens and it don't get no hotter
Sleep on me kid, but I'm a do what I gotta
I strike at random, creep like a phantom
Next year, this song will be the National Anthem
The intensity of respect for me
That emcees have, is everything it's meant to be
I'm not the type to hype and start frontin
Niggas talk a good one but ain't doin' nothing
No need to double check cause I kick game well
And emcees are catching the same hell

(Chorus) (scratching)
"Catching the same hell" 3x

[DMX]
Get loose, I get cold like Juice
To cook that goose, produced by Dr. Cuess
And I'm the Grim Reaper, putting rappers in the sleeper
Like Barry White I'm getting "Deeper and Deeper"
Try to put me out for the count first crack
But like the Night of the Living Dead, X is coming back
For more war, for sure, I'll be the vic-tor
Skedaddle cause in a battle I'll break your jaw
Didn't you know that, the X man is a pro at
Tearing up the microphone doing a show at
Where ever there's a set up, I go head up
Since you're strong *spitting noise*, pick that up
I thought you learned a lesson, that Smith and Wesson
Not the one to be messing with, cause I'm the best in
The industry, the Dark Man is no joke
I'll make ya choke from the microphone smoke
You get hurt messing around with the X
Cause straight up and down I disrespects
In any context, whoever is next
I'm like a pair of Air Jordans, you're nothing but DEX
Sex, the X will make you beg for mercy
Barreled over that ass like Jackie Joyner-Kersee
Yeah, it ain't hard to tell
And emcees are catching the same hell

(Chorus) (scratching)
"Catching the same hell" 3x

[Intro: Biggie Smalls]
Check it out, check it out
A'ight, all the true players here
Y'all throw your hands up, y'all know how we do it
Check it out, uh
Turn the mics up
Turn the mics up, uh
Check it out, uh, check it

[Verse 1: Biggie Smalls]
To all the ladies in the place with style and grace
Allow me to lace these lyrical douches in your bushes
Who rock grooves and make moves with all the mamis?
The back of the club, sippin' Moët is where you'll find me
The back of the club, mackin' hoes, my crew's behind me
Mad question askin', blunt passin'
Music blastin', but I just can't quit
Because one of these honeys Biggie got to creep with
Sleep with, keep the ep a secret, why not?
Why blow up my spot 'cause we both got hot?
Now check it: I got more mack than Craig, and in the bed
Believe me, sweetie, I got enough to feed the needy
No need to be greedy, I got mad friends with Benzes
C-notes by the layers, true-to-heart players
Jump in the Rover and come over
Tell your friends jump in the GS3, I got the chronic by the tree

[Chorus: Crowd & Biggie Smalls]
I love it when you call me Big Poppa
Uh, uh
Throw your hands in the air if you's a true player
I love it when you call me Big Poppa
Ladies
To the honies getting money
Playing fellas like dummies, uh
I love it when you call me Big Poppa
If you got a gun up in your waist (Why)
Please don't shoot up the place!
‘Cause I see some ladies tonight
That should be having what? what? baby, baby

[Verse 2: Biggie Smalls]
Uh, straight up, honey, really I'm askin'
Most of these fellas think they be mackin', but they be actin'
Who they attractin' with that line
"What's your name? What's your sign?"
Soon as he buy that wine, I just creep up from behind
And ask you what your interests are, who you be with
Things that make you smile, what numbers to dial
You gon' be here for a while?
I'm gon' go call my crew, you go call your crew
We can rendezvous at the bar around 2
At 3 o'clock, Lil Cease pull the truck up the parking lot
Roll a blunt, because he likes to spark a lot
Steam on the way to the telly, go fill my belly
A T-bone steak, cheese eggs and Welch's grape
Conversate for a few, ‘cause in a few we gon' do
What we came to do, ain't that right, boo? (true)
Forget the telly, we just go to the crib
And watch a movie in the jacuzzi, baby

[Chorus: Crowd & Biggie Smalls]
I love it when you call me Big Poppa
Where ya at?
Throw your hands in the air if you's a true player
I love it when you call me Big Poppa Uh
To the honies getting money
Playing fellas like dummies, uh
I love it when you call me Big Poppa
If you got a gun up in your waist
Please don't shoot up the place!
‘Cause I see some ladies tonight
That should be having my (What? What?) baby, baby, uh

[Verse 3: Crowd & Biggie Smalls]
How you living, Biggie Smalls? In mansions and Benzes
Givin' ends to my friends, and it feels stupendous
Tremendous cream: forget a dollar and a dream
Still tote gats strapped with infrared beams
Choppin' Os, smokin' la in Optimos
Money, hoes and clothes: all a fella knows
A foolish pleasure? Whatever
I had to find the buried treasure, so grams I had to measure
However, living better now, Coogi sweater now
Drop top BM's, I'm the man, girlfriend

[Interlude: Puff Daddy & Biggie Smalls]
Yeah, honey, check it—
Tell your friends to get with my friends
And we can be friends
Shit, we can do this every weekend, aight?
Is that aight with you?
Yeah… keep bangin'
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Crowd & Biggie Smalls]
I love it when they call me Big Poppa
Throw your hands in the air if you's a true player, uh
I love it when you call me Big Poppa
To the honies getting money
Playing fellas like dummies, uh, uh
I love it when you call me Big Poppa
If you got a gun up in your waist
Please don't shoot up the place!
‘Cause I see some ladies tonight
That should be having (What? What?) baby, baby

[Outro: Biggie Smalls]
Yeah yeah, check it out
Nine-five, what?
Money L, Little Caesar, Biggie Smalls
Represent—baby, baby
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Who shot ya?
Who shot ya?

[Verse 1]
I found a guy, told me I was a star
He held the door, held my hand in the dark
And he's perfect on paper, but he's lying to my face
Does he think that I'm the kinda girl who needs to be saved?

[Verse 2]
And there's one more boy, he's from my past
We fell in love, but it didn't last
'Cause the second I figure it out, he pushes me away
And I won't fight for love if you won't meet me halfway
And I say that I'm through, but this song's still for you

[Chorus]
All I want is love that lasts
Is all I want too much to ask?
Is it something wrong with me?
All I want is a good guy
Are my expectations far too high?
Try my best, but what can I say?
All I have is myself at the end of the day
But shouldn't that be enough for me?

[Bridge]
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
And I miss the days when I was young and naive
I thought the perfect guy would come and find me
Now happy ever after, it don't come so easily

[Chorus]
All I want is love that lasts
Is all I want too much to ask?
Is it something wrong with me? Oh, ooh
All I want is a good guy
Are my expectations far too high?
Try my best but what can I say?
All I have is myself at the end of the day
And all I want is for that to be okay

[Verse 1]
When I wake up in the morning
I'll make you some coffee
We'll lay about and let the day pass
I'll wipe your blood off the concrete
Take you to the party
We'll drink until our brains black out
And god, you're so pretty
Your smile's unforgiving
I'll place it where nobody can find
I'll play all your favorite songs
And shake when the lights go off
I'll hide us in the warm night

[Chorus]
Oh, I think you're alright
Oh, I think you're al—

[Verse 2]
I'll be your old broken TV
Your stuttering baby
Your puppy when nobody's home
I'll be your cigarette ash tray
Come back when it's too late
Worship you 'til morning comes

[Chorus]
Oh, I think you're alright
Oh, I think you're al—

[Intro]
Critical Condition

[Verse 1]
S-P-E-L-L B-O-U-N-D belongs to me
But it was bitten by another MC
Thought he knew me and could do me
But that would never be, wanna see me, wannabe me
Couldn't see me or catch me
You're just a tiny-weeny Pee-wee, that couldn't match me
X-terminator, terminator X
And in reverse I'm the top that'll rock the first
Hype rhyme, of my time, every time is rhyme time
And even on the radio, rhyme time is prime time
Nickel and dime rhyme, committing a crime rhyme
An emcee would want to be like my rhyme
A rapper that's smart is the one that learns
Dumb ones die from third degree burns
Lit em up, torch em, scorch the Bentley
I'm killing them softly, but doing it sadly
It would've been all right if he just walked past
But the brother wanted wreck so I wrecked that ass
I'm doing demo, not demonstration but demolition
Leaving competition in critical condition
Whether a jam in-doors or parties outdoors
Hangin' emcees like western outlaws
Next time you hear the X rhyme won't you
Mind your own business, I know you won't do
The same that he did, you get what he got
Blindfold, cigarette, one-two-three shot
To the head, left you dead and stinkin
But at least it'll keep the next man thinkin
About what will happen to him while I'm rappin
Snatching up by the neck and bitch slap him
So next time you're feelin bold
Keep on Movin' like Soul II Soul

[Scratch]
"Critical Condition
You're in critical condition" 4x

[Verse 2]
Your condition is critical, competition is pitiful
Oughta put it in the words of Daffy Duck, you're despcicable
Dope, if I was a drug I'd be a Kilo
Trips of 4,5,6 if I was playing Cee-lo
A roulette, a black jack like in a casino
And I still kick a slow jam better than Lillo
Rhymes is what I'm dope with, you better get hope with
Soap with rope with if you think you can cope with
Me, the D, cause that's who I am
Got more bodies than the Son of Sam
Love to eat a sandwich, peanut butter and jam
But I do not like Green Eggs and Ham
Won't slip, trip or stutter
Easily cut a, rapper like butter, make you say what a
Hell of an emcee, drink Coke not Pepsi
Knock ya out like the late Jack Dempsey
You're weak and lack style no need to act wild
Slay another rapper worse than a crack vile
I caught ya choking, no smokin' coke and
No time for jokin, cause I'm provokin'
It's just a token, chump rappers I'm yokin'
And I'll break ya down and leave ya broken
Catch a like Batman, eat ya like Pac-Man
Stopping crime like Jack and the Fatman
I'm more aggressive than Lawrence Taylor
But I'ma good guy like Popeye the Sailor
So next time you think of battling quit
You got the nerve to call yourself an emcee? Bullshit

[Scratch]
"Critical Condition
You're in critical condition" 4x

[Verse 3]
I'm in the limelight, you're wrong and I'm right
And if you plan to bite a rhyme of mine bite the rhyme right
I'll stop you like a stop sign or better yet a stop light
And then bag you like groceries in ShopRite
Oh, boy ya, I don't eat Goya
My name is DMX but I didn't make "Latoya"
It's me the great one, rappin Pitbull
I already eat one so I'm kinda full
But I can always make room for another
Father, mother, sister, brother or whatever other
That wants to try me, they're grimy, slimey
Looking like BuckWheat or better yet Stymie
Can't deny me, take me or buy me
Wet me or dry me, bake me or fry me
I start to switch up and change the pitch up
Back smack the wack crap, you start to bitch up
No need for beefin, so keep your teeth in
Your mouth out the rhyme I caught you thievin'
Your rhymes are stolen, and you won't be holdin
A mic for much longer cause I be rollin'
Just like a bowling ball, knock ya down
Find yourself swollen and on the ground
There's no way to describe the rhymes I've written
So cold, I could leave a rapper frostbitten
So hot, I burn him beyond recognition
When I'm on a mission you're in critical condition

[Scratch]
Critical Condition
You're in critical condition
Critical Condition
You're in critical condition
Critical Condition
You're in critical condition
Critical Condition
You're in critical condition
Critical Condition
You're in critical condition
Critical Condition
You're in critical condition
Critical Condition
You're in critical condition

[DMX]
I'm the D-M-X, an unstoppable force
The only way I'll ever stop is if my voice goes hoarse
But then again that wouldn't stop me, because nothing can
I lose my voice, I switch the style and make a rhyme with my hands
I'll make you leaf/leave like a wreath, step on you like a peddle
If rap was the Olympics, I would have a Gold Medal
Rhymes I kick it like Kato, mold you like Play-doh
Squash you like a tomato, peel you like a potato
I'ma wildcat, style that, puts me on top of the pile
For a while, I'll smile cause on the drop of a dime
I'm just about to rhyme
Fuck doing a crime cause I don't have the time
Or the effort, I left it alone when I was younger
Went from a 

[?] into a fearless hunger
Now I wonder, how I, ever made the transformation
From an unknown, to my music being played more over, told ya
I'm a Casanova, fucking every girl that doesn't mind bending over
I'm a player, layer, dope rhyme sayer
A-B-C-D-E-F-G-H-I-J ya, L-M-N-O-P ya
Q-R-S-T ya, you'll be a W-X-Y-Z ya
Every time I see ya, another wannabe ya
Just like me a, the capital D to the M to the X is
No I'm not a sexist, nationally known from New York to Texas
Sail (sell) it like a river, can't stand liver
So cold I make you shiver, cry then quiver
I'ma pimp with a limp that's far from a wimp
And even though I'm not supposed to, I love to eat shrimp
And Lobster
No I'm not a mobster or gangster or criminal
That the women'll call a prankster
The boss going out at all cost
I'm DMX, an unstoppable force

(Chorus)
"Unstoppable Force
DMX an unstoppable force"

[DMX]
I'm the unstoppable force of, rhymin', I'm the boss of
Crime and the same time, I'm in the course of
Saying what I like with a jet black mic
Without a cord, never bored because I fight
With my mic, steadily, battles I win em
Deadly as a snake with rattles and venom
Hmmm, now think again
Do you still think you can step to me, and win?
No I didn't think so, I ran out of ink so
A pencil will make it so funky it stinks
So dope, I'll get a crackhead high
And then again, he'll OD and die
So may I, say I, been labeled as a bully
Am I semi, no because I'm fully
Automatically loaded, dramatically exploded
Exploit it, avoid it, why, because I wrote it
The mic is like a weapon when I'm steppin through
I'm getting wreck like a demolition crew
And I'll bet, your girlfriend sweats, I know who
But I'm a threat, there ain't a damn thing you can do
When I press up, cause I fess up
Mess up and fuck up
Flash a little too much cash and you getting stuck up
Diss the X, you won't get far
Do it, and I'ma smack you like the bitch you are
Because you're a sucker butt, PooPutt
There's nothing you could do but shut up
Cause I'm fed up with you but, I'ma let you slide
Cause I'm in a nice mood
But on the other hand, I don't mind being rude
Extremely quick to flip, or take no junk
Better than Dominique on the reverse slam dunk
Five foot eleven which is not that tall
But I can handle a rapper just like a basketball
So before you fill your oats and start thinkin you're fly
You better act like Sybil and "Walk on By"
(Chorus)
"Unstoppable force
DMX, an unstoppable force" 8x

[DMX]
An unstoppable force, not to be reckoned with
Clear my throat, get to one two checkin with
A mic, I'll beat up, slow down and speed up
Mixed the batter, serve you on a platter and eat up
I know you wanna do me, you would if you could
But you can't, so when I'm hungry, you're finger lickin' good
Better than a three course, you feel the remorse
Of the U-N S-T-O-P-P-A-B-L-E force

(Chorus)
"Unstoppable force
DMX, an unstoppable force" 8x

[Verse 1]
I got more than any one woman should, I'm blessed
Have been given more than I needed, I don't deserve it
'Cause when I'm lying in a coffin and I can't take one thing
All that really matters to be living don't mean a thing, yeah

[Chorus]
There's got to be more to life than this
This can't be life, no, this can't be real
There's got to be more to life than this
This can't be life, no, this can't be real

[Verse 2]
I've been torn down like a worn-down crumbling building
But I'm up now, well I'm up now and I'm still living
I was chained to the pain and I couldn't feel nothing
I was waiting on somebody to come fill me with something, yeah

[Chorus]
There's got to be more to life than this
This can't be life, no, this can't be real
There's got to be more to life than this
This can't be life, no, this can't be real

[Bridge]
Think I reached the ceiling in my current state of being
Oh, but tryna go higher, I'm tryna go higher
Think I reached the ceiling in my current state of being
But I'm tryna go higher, I'm tryna go higher

[Chorus]
There's got to be more to life than this
This can't be life, no, this can't be real
There's got to be more to life than this
This can't be life, no, this can't be real
There's got to be more to life than this
This can't be life, no, this can't be real
There's got to be more to life than this
This can't be life, no, this can't be real

[Intro]
Oh

[Verse 1]
I didn't ask for a free ride
I only asked you to show me a real good time
I didn't ask for the rainfall
At least I showed up, you showed me nothing at all

[Pre-Chorus]
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh) It's coming down on me
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh) Water like misery
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh) It's coming down on me
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh) I'm ready, rain on me

[Chorus]
I'd rather be dry, but at least I'm alive
Rain on me, rain, rain
Rain on me, rain, rain
I'd rather be dry, but at least I'm alive
Rain on me, rain, rain
Rain on me, rain, rain, rain

[Post-Chorus]
Rain on me, rain, rain
Rain on me, rain, rain
Rain on me, rain, rain
Rain on me, rain, rain
Rain on me, rain, rain
Rain on me, rain, rain
Rain on me, rain, rain
Rain on me, rain, rain

[Verse 2]
I didn't ask for the daylight
'Cause I was born for the night, and it changed my life
I knew the hurt wouldn't be small
You said you'd love me forever, but you don't call

[Pre-Chorus]
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh) It's coming down on me
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh) Water like misery
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh) It's coming down on me
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh) I'm ready, rain on me

[Chorus]
I'd rather be dry, but at least I'm alive
Rain on me, rain, rain
Rain on me, rain, rain
I'd rather be dry, but at least I'm alive
Rain on me, rain, rain
Rain on me, rain, rain

[Post-Chorus]
Rain on me, rain, rain
Rain on me, rain, rain
Rain on me, rain, rain
Rain on me, rain, rain
Rain on me, rain, rain
Rain on me, rain, rain
Rain on me, rain, rain
Rain on me, rain, rain
I'd rather be dry, but at least I'm alive
Rain on me, rain, rain
Rain on me, rain, rain
Rain on me, rain, rain
Rain on me, rain, rain
I'd rather be dry, but at least I'm alive
Rain on me, rain, rain
Rain on me, rain, rain
Rain on me, rain, rain
Rain on me, rain, rain
Rain on me

Rain
Rain on me, rain, rain
Rain on me, rain, rain

Question for the culture:

Now that Doja Cat, Ariana, Camila, Cardi B, Kehlani and Nicki Minaj and Beyoncé have had number ones with songs about being sexy, wearing no clothes, fucking, cheating etc - can I please go back to singing about being embodied, feeling beautiful by being in love even if the relationship is not perfect, or dancing for money - or whatever I want - without being crucified or saying I'm glamorizing abuse??????

I'm fed up with female writers and alt singers saying that I glamorize abuse when in reality I'm just a glamorous person singing about the realities of what we are all now seeing are very prevalent emotionally abusive relationships all around the world.
With all of the topics women are finally allowed to explore I just want to say over the last ten years I think it’s pathetic that my minor lyrical exploration detailing my sometimes submissive or passive roles in my relationships has often made people say I’ve set women back hundreds of years.
Let this be clear, I’m not not a feminist -but there has to be a place in feminism for women who look and act like me - the kind of woman who says no but men hear yes - the kind of women who are slated mercilessly for being authentic, delicate selves, the kind of women who get their own stories and voices taken away from them by stronger women or by men who hate women.

I’ve been honest and optimistic about the challenging relationships I’ve had.
News flash!	That’s just how it is for many women.
And that was sadly my experience up until the point that those records were made. So I just want to say it’s been a long 10 years of bullshit reviews up until recently and I’ve learned a lot from them.
but I also feel it really paved the way for other women to stop ‘ putting on a happy face’ and just be able to say whatever the hell they wanted to in their music-
unlike my experience where if I even expressed a not of sadness in my first two records I was deemed literally hysterical as though it was literally the 1920s
Anyways none of this has anything to do about much but I’ll be dealing some of my feelings in my next two books of poetry (mostly the second one) with Simon and Schuster. Yes I’m still making personal reparations with the proceeds of the books to my choice of Native American foundations which I’me very happy about. And I’m sure there will be tinges of what I’ve been pondering in my new album that comes out September 5th.

Thanks for reading
Happy quarantining

[Verse 1]
Its my, survival instinct that keeps my head above the water
Everyday I show another how I love the slaughter
Plug your daughter, full of more holes than sponges
Taxin businessmen for stocks over lunches
Wit these, I shoot the breeze, and extort
Enough kis from the Cubans, to build a fuckin fort
I'm caught up in somethin that I can't control
Tryna get a hold of a bankroll, that's swole
Catching bodies like a cold, and I stay sick, so face it
You make me chase it, I take your life and erase it
Waste it, in the fuckin streets cause it ain't worth shit
The undertaker take your ass under the earth quick
I love money, but the scramblings hot
So I snatch up my man and hit gambling spot
Twenty grand is got, one nigga shot, that's one nigga less
What used to be his chest is now a mess under his fuckin vest

[Chorus]
I holla at my peeps as I creeps through the hood
Aiyyyo, niggas is up to no good!
I holla at my peeps as I creeps through the hood
Aiyyyo, niggas is up to no good!

[Verse 2]
I'm fed up with the bullshit, so now I'm giving
Slugs to other thugs who don't know how the fuck I'm livin'
I'm wondering, what the fuck you eye-in me for
When you know that D for, blowing shit up like C4
B-More to New York, I stalk, left an assailant
Under stress cause ATF keeps me under surveillance
I got a lot of hatred up in me and I've wanted
Send me to the penitentiary, to knock out a 10 to 20
For the many lives I've destroyed and such
Ways that'll make the days of Freddy seem like a touch
Is it much asking to be left alone not to be bothered
Got bitches on my dick like I'm their baby's father
Bring back to Pearl Harbor, blowing up shit
And big fat shoutout to all the bitches that suck dick
I must get, my dirt done, before the daylight
Make sure my flow stays tight, you fucking A-right

[Chorus]
I holla at my peeps as I creeps through the hood
Aiyyyo, niggas is up to no good!
I holla at my peeps as I creeps through the hood
Aiyyyo, niggas is up to no good!

[Verse 3]
Niggas be like "Ill" when I wreck, cause I don't go fair
Bitches be like "Man he ain't even have to go there"
Whether I get your ass with the body blows
Or hit you with the shotty holes
Your fuckin' crew is running like a snotty nose
I ain't a killer but I'll kill something
And if a nigga holding something, I'm a steal something
I'll peel something back like a nigga's cap, leave him stinking
Put a hole in his head, and find out what he was thinking
Niggas who don't know the half
I show the wrath of a savage and do bodily damage
To a motherfucker's cabbage
Money had a lot of mouth but as soon as he seen me
His bitchass copped out to a mister-I-didn't-mean-it
Niggas fiend it cause they want it, but don't get it
Cause they sweat it, to fucking hard and let it
Take over shit, dead it now set it
Full breaded like a pit that scratches first, hittin fast
How many motherfucking times must I put foot up in your ass

[Chorus]
I holla at my peeps as I creeps through the hood
Aiyyyo, niggas is up to no good!
I holla at my peeps as I creeps through the hood
Aiyyyo, niggas is up to no good!

It's Technical Difficulties

[Verse 1: Matt Champion & Merlyn Wood]
Pair with me when the sun go down
Everybody lately wanna hunt shit down

Back and forth, you gotta cut it out

What if they come up and throw you out?
Ain't tryna scrap right now
But I got your back right now
Small problems is all you involved with so don't be petty, shit, yeah

We can talk it out, but it's hard when you are not near
Need you near, I need you near

[Chorus: bearface]
All that you wanted, oh, I'ma give it all night
All night, all night, all night, all night
And it's you that I wanted, I'ma take it all night

[Verse 2: Merlyn Wood]
Don't trust nobody, don't want nobody else
Love nobody else, no-nobody else
This is how the party start, real players enter
Lover, you don't love me yet, what you doin' later?
Floor filled with girls, pretty liquor on my sneaker
Shawty so full of sugar, I'm so glad I met ya
I wanna risk that for you
You can spend my time and my money too
There isn't one thing that I wouldn't do
If you was in danger, to get to you

[Chorus: bearface]
All that you wanted, oh, I'ma give it all night
All night, all night, all night, all night
And it's you that I wanted, I'ma take it all night

And tell me, you want it some more, tell me, you want it some more

[Verse 3: Joba]
Somethin' like fine wine, gotta sip it slow
Takin' my damn time, 'cause it taste right
Tow the fine line, white-knuckled and ready
Wide-eyed, so worth it and perfect
Guess I deserve it, quench my thirst in a drought
Savour every sip, all it takes is a call
I'll be there for anything at all
Prepare, you know I hold it down

[Chorus: bearface]
All that you wanted, I'ma give it all night
All night, all night, all night, all night

For a long while, I know you need it some more

Pardon the, uh, Technical Difficulties

[Verse: Matt Champion, Joba & Kevin Abstract]
Call me Cupid 'cause my birthday be up on V-Day
I don't like talkin' much 'cause I don't like saying "Like, like"
Like I got a knife to my throat or the wind blowin' a tightrope
Or someone repeatin' what I'm saying, like, I know (I know)
If I was never wrong I would've been right, right?
Wrong, bitch, if I was right, I wouldn't be here with this long face
Plenty of red flags, I'da skipped and thrown away
Might have made me better or I'm just stupid, who's to say?
Are there some angels in my area?
If I don't like the function, can I post up on the barrier?
Ass so fat, I put my cup up on the derriere
Fashion shit is shakin', I'll be honest, I am very scared
And if I ever die young (Die young)
Have Larry David do the eulogy (Eulogy)
And film it on one of those little camcorders where you can barely see
And hire someone to throw up all of my jewelry

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract, Kevin Abstract & Matt Champion]
I feel like ain't nobody around me got my back
I feel like there's some niggas gon' turn on me, ayy, ayy, ayy
I do this shit on my own and that's a fact
Go ahead and go where you belong on me, ayy, ayy
I feel like ain't nobody around me got my back
I feel like there's some niggas gon' turn on me, ayy, ayy, ayy
I do this shit on my own and that's a fact
Go ahead and go where you belong on me, ayy, ayy

[Bridge: Matt Champion]
Six feet deep, I ain't never gon' die
(Ladies and gentlemen, la-ladies and gentlemen)
Four, eight, eight in the passenger side
(Ladies and gentlemen, la-ladies and gentlemen)
Tyin' up my shoes, I'm just tryna get by

Ayy, ayy, ayy, I'm just tryna get by

Now, the story that might never have surfaced if someone hadn't picked up his home video camera. We've all seen the pictures of Los Angeles police officers beating a man that had just pulled over. The city's police chief said today that he would support criminal charges against some of the men

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
Yo, yo
Childhood hostile, ostrich, top down
Rodney, cop, kick, chopstick, wok, cow
Beef fried rice like, seaside sight night
Speak rhyme, peak, prime, three times white knights
They gon' beat him in the streets
Light wrist, nightstick, demon's in the deets
Swingin' at the King with every piece of their police
Seethin' at the seam, bleedin' on the scene
Leave him like Lehman brothers, need an intervene
Rodney dropped an 

[?] quickly, trading slave-laid cotton
Alabama manners, then moved up to New York
To move the hot commodities even better than before
Civil war saw change, envies of crackers
To reinvent the death in the railroad with wackness
Capitalising off blackness like nocturnal hunters
Creeping in the jungles, numbers

[Refrain: Lupe Fiasco]
Beat him in the head
Kick him in the neck, beat him on the leg
Beat him on the head
Kick him in the neck, beat him on the leg
Is he alright?
These two Hebrew Israelites
We came from the end
We ain't start the revolution just to make friends
Came from the end
We ain't start the revolution just to make friends

Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Ayy, ayy
What he say?
He say, he say, he say
Last club, left the bathtub like a flash flood, baptismal
Cats sizzle packs in the van, that's thizzle as Mac Dizzle
Deal is half-pickled, jammed as bad pistols, the poorly dressed
The correlated, the laureats
No relation 'less he coronated the coronets as well
Oswald Cobblepot, out-cold household
Pepper pot lover, heartless man in a letter
That's penned to Gwyneth Paltrow, ends justify the outro
Black hue, Hugh Hefner to the heifers
A boy cow, give out your L'Oreal story tales
Brush blush on the rough cuts of the Maury fails
You are not the cannon fodder, relax
Catch me outside, how 'bout that?

[Refrain: Lupe Fiasco]
Beat him on the head
Kick him in the neck, beat him on the leg
Kick him in the head
Beat him in the neck, kick him on the leg
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

He said, make it art
Resurrect souls like Jason

Life is never sacred but it's snipers out in Vegas
Vincent wiping out the stages
Background check for a chopper
Watch as I pull out the pages, hope I don't hit watchlist
CCW, subterfuge cops, oh no I got this
Isabella's looking out the optics

[Refrain: Lupe Fiasco]
Like "shoot him in the head
Shoot him in the neck, shoot him in the leg"

[Verse 4: Lupe Fiasco]
Said, said zombie, I need brains
Right on time like high-speed trains
Pull up real slow like tai chi cranes
That's an excellent Karate Kid reference
But I'ma leave it there like negligence
Focus on the dead that I said in my very first testament
Re-animate it, roll-out minds, Frankenstein times Optimus Prime
Zorro bombing on cars how I write these names
Rail spike, snail life, I need change

[Refrain: Lupe Fiasco]
What they say, what they say
Beat him in the head

Kick him in the neck, beat him on the leg
Beat him til he dead

Coming from the end
We ain't start the revolution just to make friends
Nah, nah
Nah, nah

[Verse 5: Lupe Fiasco]
Sunset, Los Angeles
Undressed like the sky put on a skirt to hurt the slum sets
Then hit Hollywood Boulevard like spars
Light taps that fight back, high heels covered in stars
Lounge gowns standing downtown up in W. Dubois'
Rolls Royce, Choice, the Hoist, and other comfortable cars
Shooting club doormans, speaking love of the warfare
What we're doing is ordering Ubers to Soho
JoJo, everything is bizarre
Malibu Member's Only sitting lonely in the Rolex, 

[?] Denny's mirage
In-N-Out bagels, katsu your crab rolls
East LA food truck, bossa nova maestros
Half-glued eyes on the night time wide search
Chanel purse gone down on the I-5 side
Mulholland hilltop, house party chill spot
Valley versus hills when there's a South Central wheel shop
Saudis versus Persians, Hasidic temples 

[?]
Santa Monica helicopters and Compton KJazz

[Refrain: Lupe Fiasco]
Kick him in the head
Beat him on the back, beat him on the leg
Is he alright?
These two Hebrew Israelites were like
Take him to the end
We ain't start the revolution just to make friends
Yeah yeah yeah yeah, yeah

[Interlude: Lupe Fiasco]
He said, rarify Earth
Clarify the terrified turf, climate change, climate change
Climate change, crying shames, client claims science names
For phenomenon, the common looks like ComicCon
The narrative is your momma's mom, grand
Planned it out in Stanford, all while doing a Rubik's cube one-handed
Even with a 

[?] in the ear, you wouldn't understand it
Do it all, leave the tuba tomes and tuna homes and future bombs

[Refrain: Lupe Fiasco]
What he said?
Kick him in the head
Beat him on the back, beat him on the leg

I asked these two Hebrew Israelites

Turkish, surface of the 

[?]
On top like well known 

[?] spray
On sight like L-O-O-K
Lupe is the future, also look like Future if I put the dreads in a pony
And wear the hat on, you wouldn't even know me
Little question: What type of boat do vampires like? Blood vessels
Couple pots and kettles, orchestral world record
"Rickety rickety, rah rah" to the rescue
Like the Ceaușescu death crew
Dreams of more or less playing chess with his nephew
No time for 

[?] making checks with his next move
Might break a deck like WWF rules

[Refrain: Lupe Fiasco]
Beat him in the head
Beat him on the neck, beat him on the legs

Julia
Out in the garden, grown to the wall
Somewhere when you're feeling small
Tired and undone

Look at the mounds up high in the road
Hanging up your winter clothes
Never took so long
On the same floor
Can I want more

Well, looks like we met again
Under the same circumstances now as back then
When you wanted to battle and you got defeated
Now you want a rematch, history repeated
What are you stupid, have you lost all your senses?
A mind for beef, behind barbed wire fences
You know what I’m talking about, remember?
You told me you was there since the middle of December
Where was this, well if your memory’s stale
Let me refresh it, Suffolk County Jail
Believe me, I know you, and I could never fear you
They call you Solo, cause you speak So-Low we couldn’t hear you
Church mouse, choir boy turned rapper
Bitch ass faggot, I oughta slap ya
For taking what is mine and claiming it to be yours
Committing a rhyme crime behind closed doors
Before this is over, the truth will be found
That I’m the original author of SpellBound

"Shouldn't did that" - Scratch 4x

(DMX: Verse 2)
You know and I know, that we know, that they know
My rhymes are like a vintage wine and I will so no
Rhyme before it’s time, that’s why I waited
But I waited too long, you didn’t bite it, you ate it
Now it’s time to pay the piper, I’m a little hyper
Hiper, about to rip a, cause I’m the viper type of
Rap warrior, flipping psycho
To me you like a toy, made by Tyko
A joke, a jester, clown like fester
Nothing but a pest a, Chester the Molester
Ha-ha-ha little boy don’t make me laugh
Fuck snapping necks I’m cracking backs in half
Your partners Erick and Parish, need to quit
I’ll diss your whole crew cause all of y’all ain’t shit
I’m a do your crew of two or three or four
I’m a score it more than there are sea shells over seashore
You talk a good one but can you back it?
Throw out a rhyme and I’ll attack it
Stick out your face, I’m about to smack it
This is all out war with of full-metal jacket
There was a time I would’ve called you a friend
But now K-ummm, what was your name again?
K-sucker, K-silly, K-sloppy, K-sorry
K-slip a chip, cause I’mma play you like Atari
I’m the aggressor, more fresher and bolder
Yonkers style is wild, rock it like a boulder
You are older but I’m a little colder
Rip out your neck and call you Head and Shoulders
You gonna wish you never met me clown
I’m the original author of Spellbound

Tha Blue Carpet Tre-
Sylvia - I knew what you meant when you talked about swimming in the ocean and leaving your patent leather black shoes pointing towards it, while you swam

It tickled you to leave them there
It was the thought of a young child or of a lost fairy
That reminded me of who I am
That's why I am now at this facility by the ocean
And why I go barefoot and why I go calmly
Why I leave my shoes up by the stairway
I do it for you and I do it for me
Because having learned from others and from you
I learned there was a missing piece to finding existential calmness
And domestic bliss to lead to peace

You see, you can't fall in love with a man like Ted -
Or a musician who sings about being free
A woodworker doesn't a good man make, if he wants his work to be on TV
You have to separate the wheat from the chaff
You have to be discerning
It takes diligence, consequence and other things
To keep that sea from churning
And to keep yourself from longing to let those painted waves take you under
It isn't just the water black that makes the body plunder from high sea cliffs
I know my dear, I wish that I had been here or there
I wish that you were here now, if you're not now -
Because who knows how these things work?
Sylvia, Marilyn, Violet, Diana
All of my kind women who came before me, blonde
I dyed my hair black for you
I turned my back on that black pond
I swear I won't stop 'til I'm dead
And here I am at 34 - And what for?

To bring my pair of baby patent leather shoes to turn them the other way - towards the sea cliffs stairs not at the ocean
To bring them back up safe to the facility instead
And I think of you as I walk the 280 wooden steps -
Dynamited into the cliffs a hundred years before
I let myself into room 2 and got undressed

I was sunburnt, contemplative and sore
And as I fell asleep by Gabapentin
I lay my head on the pillow and streched my hand out on the cool white linen - and sing you lemon melody
I kept the shoes on the sill by the window seat -
In case you got restless and wanted to leave
And I hugged you with my baby's breath
And sang your spirit to bed
The way I would have if you were my child or if I had children
My Queen Anne's lace heart weightless on your little head

[Verse 1]
Said, it ain't about money
I could show you the world, girl
What can you do for me?
We can take a vacation, go somewhere in the country
Turn the radio on, hear my song sayin' (Whoa-oh-oh)
My favorite song say (Whoa-oh-oh)
(She don't know) She slept through the future
Missed it, it was yesterday
So we (We), right (Right), back where we started
She still tryna get away (Get away)
Girl, you wastin' my time (Time), and I am wastin' your time
But that's okay (Whoa-oh-oh)
Said, it's okay (Whoa-oh-oh)

[Chorus]
Let me give you what you want, ooh
And maybe later, what you need, yeah
I remember, girl, you used to have fun, yeah
Though I ain't seen a smile in a while
Heard you feelin' pretty lonely, yeah
Your daddy shoulda got you that pony
Let me give you what you want

[Verse 2]
Killin' yourself like this, goin' crazy, keepin' all of these secrets
How is that livin'? (Livin')
Every time I reminisce, I keep thinkin' it was better then
I remember when we made (Made), out (Out), underneath the rain clouds
Stay (Stay), out (Out), late, I wanna lay down
Break (Break), ground (Ground)
And you tell me (Whoa-oh-oh) (Whoa-oh, whoa-oh)
(Oh-oh-oh) And we could be okay
Don't know for sure (We, we, we don't know)
Just familiar numbers glimmer through your door
You left home right away (Right away)
'Cause your life is like night and day (Night and day)
You keep goin', goin', goin' back and forth

[Chorus]
Let me give you what you want, ooh
And maybe later, what you need, yeah
I remember, girl, you used to have fun, yeah
Though I ain't seen a smile in a while
Heard you feelin' pretty lonely, yeah
Your daddy shoulda got you that pony
Let me give you what you want

[Outro]
Can I, can I, can I, can I, can I, can I, can I
Give you what you need?
Can I, can I, can I, can I, can I
Give you what you want?
Can I, can I, can I, can I, can I, can I, can I, can I
Can I give you what you need, what you need?
What do you need, girl? Yeah
Said, can I give you what you want?
Whoa, whoa, whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa
Can I give you what you need?
Whoa, whoa, whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa
Said, can I give you what you want?
Whoa, whoa, whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa
Can I give you what you need, what you need?
What do you need, girl?

[Spoken Intro]
I don’t think you should wait, you speak now
Drop everything now

[Verse 1]
The way you move is like a full on rainstorm
And I'm a house of cards
You're the kind of reckless
That should send me running
But I kinda know that I won't get far
And you stood there in front of me
Just close enough to touch
Close enough to hope you couldn't see
What I was thinking of

[Chorus]
Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
I see sparks fly whenever you smile

[Verse 2]
My mind forgets to remind me
You're a bad idea
You touch me once and it's really something
You find I'm even better than you imagined I would be
I'm on my guard for the rest of the world
But with you I know it's no good
Well I could wait patiently but I really wish you would

[Chorus]
Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
I see sparks fly whenever you smile

[Bridge]
I run my fingers through your hair and watch the lights go wild
Just keep on keeping your eyes on me, it's just wrong enough to make it feel right
And lead me up the staircase
Won't you whisper soft and slow?
I'm captivated by you, baby, like a firework show

[Interlude]
Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Drop everything now
Take away (take away) the pain
Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Drop everything now
(Take away, take away the pain)
Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
I see sparks fly whenever you smile

[Outro]
And the sparks fly

[Verse 1]
You were in college, working part-time, waiting tables
Left a small town and never looked back
I was a flight risk, with a fear of falling
Wondering why we bother with love, if it never lasts

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I say, "Can you believe it?"
As we're lying on the couch
The moment, I could see it
Yes, yes, I can see it now

[Chorus]
Do you remember, we were sitting there, by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

[Verse 2]
Flash forward, and we're taking on the world together
And there's a drawer of my things at your place
You learn my secrets and you figure out why I'm guarded
You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes

[Pre-Chorus 2]
But we got bills to pay
We got nothing figured out
When it was hard to take
Yes, yes
This is what I thought about:

[Chorus]
Do you remember, we were sitting there, by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

Do you remember all the city lights on the water?
You saw me start to believe for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine oh-woah

[Bridge]
And I remember that fight, 2:30 AM
As everything was slipping right out of our hands
I ran out, crying, and you followed me out into the street
Braced myself for the goodbye
'Cause that's all I've ever known
Then, you took me by surprise
You said, "I'll never leave you alone."

[Chorus 2]
You said, "I remember how we felt, sitting by the water
And every time I look at you, it's like the first time
I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter
She is the best thing that's ever been mine
"Hold on, make it last"
Hold on, never turn back
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

[Outro]
Do you believe it?
We're gonna make it now
And I can see it
Yeah, yeah
I can see it now (See it now, see it now)

[Spoken Intro]
Go!

[Verse 1]
I used to think one day, we'd tell the story of us
How we met, and the sparks flew instantly
And people would say, they're the lucky ones
I used to know my place was a spot next to you
Now I'm searching the room for an empty seat
Lately, I don't even know what page you're on

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Oh, a simple complication
Miscommunications lead to fallout
So many things that I wish you knew
So many walls up, I can't break through

[Chorus]
Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room
And we're not speaking
And I'm dying to know
Is it killing you like it's killing me?
Yeah, I don't know what to say
Since the twist of fate when it all broke down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now
Next chapter

[Verse 2]
How'd we end up this way?
See me nervously pulling at my clothes and trying to look busy
And you're doing your best to avoid me
I'm starting to think one day, I'll tell the story of us
Of how I was losing my mind when I saw you here
But you held your pride like you should've held me

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Oh, I'm scared to see the ending
Why are we pretending this is nothing?
I'd tell you I miss you, but I don't know how
I've never heard silence quite this loud

[Chorus]
Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room
And we're not speaking
And I'm dying to know
Is it killing you like it's killing me?
Yeah, and I don't know what to say
Since the twist of fate, when it all broke down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now

[Spoken Interlude]
Can I please see you jump?

[Bridge]
This is looking like a contest
Of who can act like they care less
But I liked it better when you were on my side
The battle's in your hands now
But I would lay my armor down
If you say you'd rather love than fight
So many things that you wish I knew
But the story of us might be ending soon

[Chorus]
Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room
And we're not speaking
And I'm dying to know
Is it killing you like it's killing me?
Yeah,  I don't know what to say
Since the twist of fate, when it all broke down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now, now, now (now, now, now)
Oh (Now, now, now)

[Outro]
And we're not speaking
And I'm dying to know
Is it killing you like it's killing me, yeah?
I don't know what to say since the twist of fate
'Cause we're going down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now
The End

[Verse 1]
You, with your words like knives
And swords and weapons that you use against me
You have knocked me off my feet again
Got me feeling like I'm nothing
You, with your voice like nails on a chalkboard
Calling me out when I'm wounded
You, picking on the weaker man

[Pre-Chorus]
You can take me down
With just one single blow
But you don't know what you don't know

[Chorus]
Someday, I'll be living in a big old city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?

[Verse 2]
You, with your switching sides
And your wildfire lies and your humiliation
You have pointed out my flaws again
As if I don't already see them
I walk with my head down, trying to block you out
'Cause I'll never impress you
I just wanna feel okay again

[Pre-Chorus]
I bet you got pushed around
Somebody made you cold
But the cycle ends right now
'Cause you can't lead me down that road
And you don't know what you don't know

[Chorus]
Someday, I'll be living in a big old city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?

[Bridge]
And I can see you years from now in a bar
Talking over a football game
With that same big loud opinion
But nobody's listening
Washed up and ranting about the same old bitter things
Drunk and grumbling on about how I can't sing
All you are is mean
All you are is mean
And a liar, and pathetic, and alone in life And mean, and mean, and mean, and mean

[Breakdown]
But someday, I'll be living in a big old city And all you're ever gonna be is mean, yeah

[Chorus]
Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so-?
Someday, I'll be living in a big old city
(Why you gotta be so-?)
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
(Why you gotta be so-?)
Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
(Why you gotta be so-?)
And all you're ever gonna be is mean Why you gotta be so mean?

[Verse 1]
Elevator buttons and morning air
Strangers' silence makes me want to take the stairs
If you were here, we'd laugh about their vacant stares
But right now, my time is theirs
Seems like there's always someone who disapproves
They'll judge it like they know about me and you
And the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do
The jury's out, but my choice is you

[Chorus]
So don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
The stakes are high, the water's rough
But this love is ours

[Verse 2]
You never know what people have up their sleeves
Ghosts from your past gonna jump out at me
Lurking in the shadows with their lip gloss smiles
But I don't care, 'cause right now, you're mine

[Chorus]
And you'll say
Don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
The stakes are high, the water's rough
But this love is ours

[Bridge]
And it's not theirs to speculate if it's wrong
And your hands are tough, but they are where mine belong
And I'll fight their doubt and give you faith
With this song for you

[Breakdown]
'Cause I love the gap between your teeth
And I love the riddles that you speak
And any snide remarks from my father about your tattoos
Will be ignored
'Cause my heart is yours

[Chorus]
So don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
So Don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
But they can't take what's ours
They can't take what's ours

[Outro]
The stakes are high, the water's rough
But this love is ours

[Intro]
I am not the kind of girl
Who should be rudely barging in
On a white veil occasion
But you are not the kind of boy
Who should be marrying the wrong girl

[Verse 1]
I sneak in and see your friends
And her snotty little family
All dressed in pastel
And she is yelling at a bridesmaid
Somewhere back inside a room
Wearing a gown shaped like a pastry

[Pre-Chorus]
This is surely not
What you thought it would be
I lose myself in a daydream
Where I stand and say

[Chorus]
Don't say yes, run away now
I'll meet you when you're out
Of the church at the back door
Don't wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
And they said "speak now"

[Verse 2]
Fond gestures are exchanged
And the organ starts to play
A song that sounds like a death march
And I am hiding in the curtains
It seems that I was uninvited
By your lovely bride-to-be

[Pre-Chorus]
She floats down the aisle
Like a pageant queen
But I know you wish it was me
You wish it was me (Don't you?)

[Chorus]
Don't say yes, run away now
I'll meet you when you're out
Of the church at the back door
Don't wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
And they said "speak now"

[Chorus]
Don't say yes, run away now
I'll meet you when you're out
Of the church at the back door
Don't wait or say a single vow
Your time is running out
And they said "speak now"

[Interlude]
Ooh, la-da-da-da, oh
Ooh, ooh
(Say a single vow)

[Bridge]
I hear the preacher say
"Speak now or forever hold your peace"
There's the silence, there's my last chance
I stand up with shaking hands, all eyes on me
Horrified looks from everyone in the room
But I'm only looking at you

[Verse 3]
I am not the kind of girl
Who should be rudely barging in
On a white veil occasion
But you are not the kind of boy
Who should be marrying the wrong girl

[Chorus]
Don't say yes, run away now
I'll meet you when you're out
Of the church at the back door
Don't wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
And they said "speak now"

[Chorus - Variation]
And you’ll say
"Let's run away now
I'll meet you when
I'm out of my tux at the back door"
Baby, I didn't say my vows
So glad you were around when they said
"Speak now"

[Intro]
”Hey it’s me, leave a message: make it hot”
Now go stand in the corner and think about what you did

[Verse 1]
The story starts when it was hot and it was summer and
I had it all, I had him right there, where I wanted him
She came along, got him alone, and let's hear the applause
She took him faster than you can say sabotage

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I never saw it coming, wouldn't have suspected it
I underestimated just who I was dealing with
She had to know the pain was beating on me like a drum
She underestimated just who she was stealing from

[Chorus]
She's not a saint and she's not what you think
She's an actress, whoa
She's better known for the things that she does
On the mattress, whoa
Soon she's gonna find stealing other people's toys
On the playground won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge, ha!

[Verse 2]
She looks at life like it's a party and she's on the list
She looks at me like I'm a trend and she's so over it
I think her ever-present frown is a little troubling
And she thinks I'm psycho 'cause I like to rhyme her name with things

[Pre-Chorus 2]
But sophistication isn't what you wear or who you know
Or pushing people down to get you where you wanna go
But they didn't teach you that in prep school, so it's up to me
No amount of vintage dresses gives you dignity
(Think about what you did)

[Chorus]
She's not a saint and she's not what you think
She's an actress, whoa
She's better known for the things that she does
On the mattress, whoa
Soon she's gonna find stealing other people's toys
On the playground won't make him any friends
She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge, HA!

[Bridge]
I'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at, honey
You might have him, but haven't you heard?
I'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at, honey
You might have him, but I always get the last word
Whoa, whoa-ah-oh
Come on, come on

[Chorus]
She's not a saint and she's not what you think
She's an actress, whoa (She deserved it)
She's better known for the things that she does
On the mattress, whoa
Soon she's gonna find stealing other people's toys
On the playground won't make him any friends
She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge

[Outro]
Do you still feel like you know what you're doing?
'Cause I don't think you do, oh
Do you still feel like you know what you're doing?
I don't think you do, I don't think you do
Let's hear the applause
See you deserve some applause
'Cause you're so much better
She took him faster than you could say sabotage

[Verse 1]
I still remember the look on your face
Lit through the darkness at 1:58
The words that you whispered
For just us to know
You told me you loved me
So why did you go away? Away

I do recall now the smell of the rain Fresh on the pavement
I ran off the plane
That July 9th
The beat of your heart
It jumps through your shirt
I can still feel your arms

[Chorus]
But now I'll go sit on the floor
Wearing your clothes
All that I know is
I don't know how to be something you miss
I never thought we'd have a last kiss
I Never imagined we'd end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips

[Verse 2]
I still remember the swing of your step
The life of the party, you're showing off again
And I roll my eyes and then
You pull me in
I'm not much for dancing
But for you I did

Because I love your handshake, meeting my father
I love how you walk with your hands in your pockets
How you kissed me when I was in the middle of saying something
There's not a day I don't miss those rude interruptions

[Chorus]
And I'll go sit on the floor
Wearing your clothes
All that I know is
I don't know how to be something you miss
I never thought we'd have a last kiss
I never imagined we'd end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips, ooh

[Bridge]
So I'll watch your life in pictures like I used to watch you sleep
And I feel you forget me like I used to feel you breathe
And I keep up with our old friends just to ask them how you are
Hope it's nice where you are
And I hope the sun shines
And it's a beautiful day
And something reminds you
You wish you had stayed
You can plan for a change in weather and time
But I never planned on you changing your mind

[Chorus]
And I'll go sit on the floor
Wearing your clothes
All that I know is
I don't know how to be something you miss
I never thought we'd have a last kiss
I never imagined we'd end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips, ooh
Just like our last kiss
Forever the name on my lips

[Outro]
Just like our last

[Verse 1]
Long were the nights when
My days once revolved around you
Counting my footsteps
Praying the floor won't fall through... again
And my mother accused me of losing my mind
But I swore I was fine
You paint me a blue sky
Then go back and turn it to rain
And I lived in your chess game
But you changed your rules everyday
Wonderin' which version of you I might get on the phone, tonight
Well I stopped pickin' up and this song is to let you know why

[Chorus]
Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
I shoulda' known

[Verse 2]
Well maybe it's me
And my blind optimism to blame
Or maybe it's you and your sick need
To give love and take it away
And you'll add my name to your long list of traitors
Who don't understand
And I look back in regret how I ignored when they said
"Run as fast as you can"

[Chorus]
Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
Dear John, I see it all now, it was wrong
Don't you think nineteen's too young
To be played by your dark, twisted games
When I loved you so?
I shoulda' known

[Bridge]
You are an expert at sorry
And keeping the lines blurry
Never impressed by me acing your tests
All the girls that you've run dry have tired lifeless eyes
'Cause you burned them out
But I took your matches
Before fire could catch me
So don't look now
I'm shining like fireworks
Over your sad empty town, yeah-yeah
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home

[Outro]
I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress
Wrote you a song, you shoulda' known
Don't you think I was too young?
You shoulda' known

[Verse 1]
There I was again tonight
Forcing laughter, faking smiles
Same old tired, lonely place
Walls of insincerity, shifting eyes and vacancy
Vanished when I saw your face
All I can say is, it was enchanting to meet you

[Verse 2]
Your eyes whispered, "Have we met?"
Across the room your silhouette
Starts to make it’s way to me
The playful conversation starts
Counter all your quick remarks
Like passing notes in secrecy
And it was enchanting to meet you
All I can say is, I was enchanted to meet you

[Chorus]
This night is sparkling
Don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck
Blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever
Wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you

[Verse 3]
The lingering question kept me up
2AM, who do you love?
I wonder 'til I'm wide awake
And now I'm pacing back and forth
Wishing you were at my door
I'd open up and you would say, "Hey"
It was enchanting to meet you
All I know is I was enchanted to meet you (Ooh-ooh)

[Chorus 2]
This night is sparkling
Don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck
Blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever
Wondering if you knew
This night is flawless
Don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck
Dancing around all alone
I'll spend forever
Wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you

[Bridge]
This is me praying that
This was the very first page
Not where the storyline ends
My thoughts will echo your name
Until I see you again
These are the words I held back
As I was leaving too soon
I was enchanted to meet you

[Breakdown]
Please don't be in love
With someone else
Please don't have somebody waiting on you
Please don't be in love with someone else
Please don't have somebody waiting on you
Please don’t be in love with someone else
Please don’t have somebody waiting on you
(Oh)
Please don’t be in love with someone else (Oh-oh)

[Chorus 2]
This night is sparkling
Don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck
Blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever
Wondering if you knew
This night is flawless
Don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck
Dancing around all alone
I'll spend forever
Wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you

[Outro]
Please don't be in love with someone else
Please don't have somebody
Waiting on you

[Verse 1]
You and I walk a fragile line
I have known it all this time
But I never thought I'd live to see it break
It's getting dark and it's all too quiet
And I can't trust anything now
It's coming over you like it's all a big mistake

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh-Whoa, holding my breath
Won't lose you again
Something's made your eyes go cold

[Chorus]
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Something's gone terribly wrong
You're all I wanted
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Can't breathe whenever you're gone
Can't turn back now, I'm haunted

[Verse 2]
Stood there and watched you walk away
From everything we had
But I still mean every word I said to you
He will try to take away my pain
And he just might make me smile
But the whole time, I'm wishing it was you instead

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh-whoa, holding my breath
Whoa Won't see you again
Something keeps me holding onto nothing

[Chorus]
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Something's gone terribly wrong
You are all I wanted
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Can't breathe whenever you're gone
Can't turn back now, I'm haunted

[Bridge]
I know
I know
I just know
You're not gone, you can't be gone, no

[Chorus]
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Something's gone terribly wrong
Won't finish what you started
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Can't breathe whenever you're gone
I Can't go back, I'm haunted
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh- woah  oh, oh)

[Outro]
You and I walk a fragile line
I have known it all this time
Never ever thought I'd see it break
Never thought I'd see it

[Verse 1]
I said, remember this moment, in the back of my mind
The time we stood with our shaking hands
The crowds in stands went wild
We were the kings and the queens
And they read off our names
The night you danced like you knew our lives
Would never be the same
You held your head like a hero
On a history book page
It was the end of a decade
But the start of an age

[Chorus]
Long live the walls we crashed through
All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming, long live all the magic we made
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered

[Verse 2]
I said, remember this feeling
I passed the pictures around
Of all the years that we stood there
On the side-lines wishing for right now
We are the kings and the queens
You traded your baseball cap for a crown
When they gave us our trophies
And we held them up for our town
And the cynics were outraged
Screaming, "This is absurd"
'Cause for a moment, a band of thieves
In ripped up jeans got to rule the world

[Chorus]
Long live the walls we crashed through
All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming, long live all the magic we made
And bring on all the pretenders
I'm not afraid
Long live all the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
I was screaming, long live that look on your face
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered

[Bridge]
Hold on to spinning around
Confetti falls to the ground
May these memories break our fall

[Spoken Interlude]
We have absolutely loved spending time in your town , and you have been so amazing to us
I mean, you guys know every single word and you’ve danced this entire night and it means the world to me and every single person you see on stage
Thank you

[Breakdown]
Will you take a moment?
And Promise me this
That you'll stand by me forever
But if, God forbid, fate should step in
And force us into a goodbye
If you have children some day
When they point to the pictures
Please tell ‘em my name
Tell them how the crowds went wild
Tell them how I hope they shine
Long live the walls we crashed through
I had the time of my life, with you

[Chorus]
Long, long live the walls we crashed through
All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming, long live all the magic we made
And bring on all the pretenders
I'm not afraid
Singing, long live all the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
Long, long live that look on your face
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered

Greasy slicked down
Groovy leather trim

And I see them in the streets
And I see them in the field
And I hear them shouting under my feet
And I know it's got to be real
Oh Lord, deliver me
All the wrong I've done
Oh, you can deliver me, Lord

Come on baby, just rock, rock, yeah

[Verse 1]
Oh, let the sun beat down upon my face
With stars to fill my dreams
I am a traveler of both time and space
To be where I have been
Sit with elders of the gentle race
This world has seldom seen
Talk of days for which they sit and wait
All will be revealed

[Verse 2]
Talk and song from tongues of lilting grace
Whose sounds caress my ear
But not a word I heard could I relate
The story was quite clear
Oh, oh
Oh, oh

[Verse 3]
Ooh, baby, I been flying
No yeah, mama, there ain't no denying
Oh, oooh,  yeah, I've been flying
Mama, mama, ain't no denying, no denying

[Verse 4]
All I see turns to brown
As the sun burns the ground
And my eyes fill with sand
As I scan this wasted land
Trying to find, trying to find where I've been

[Verse 5]
Oh, pilot of the storm who leaves no trace
Like thoughts inside a dream
Here is the path that led me to that place
Yellow desert stream
My Shangri-La beneath the summer moon
I will return again
Sure as the dust that floats high in June
When movin' through Kashmir

[Verse 6]
Oh, father of the four winds, fill my sails
Across the sea of years
With no provision but an open face
Along the straits of fear
Oh, oh
Oh, oh

[Bridge]
Oh

[Verse 7/Outro]
Oh, when I'm on, when I'm on my way, yeah
When I see, when I see the way, you stay-yeah
Ooh, yeah-yeah, ooh, yeah-yeah, when I'm down, yeah
Ooh, yeah-yeah, oh, yeah-yeah, but I'm down, so down
Ooh, my baby, ooh, my baby, let me take you there
Oh oh, come on, let me take you there...let me take you there
Ooh, yeah-yeah, oh, yeah-yeah....
Due to a massive amount of bootlegging and constant downloading, people are not buying CDs so that we can get paid for our fucking work. they are just continuing to get songs for free. see, what they do is they buy a computer, strictly pick songs that they like, and burn them onto CDs or put them on iPods. causing major decreases in sound scan, putting music retail into a tremendous slump, causing artists such as myself to make no money for record sale, and be forced to tour, causing more stress, arguments with my wife, not being able to see my kids, drink more, take more pills, punch more people in the face, hate the world, and end up in rehab. This has been a public service announcement and an excuse to vent by Marshall Mathers. Not that I would do the same thing if i could get free music when i was a kid, but now that i rap for a living.

Fear or respect, how you act around me
If I'm real, respect how you act around me

Chains so big, make me tuck your shit

My president ain't black but my Presidential black face, white bezel that I call that mixed race
Battle exploitation from the blacks like the slave's days, yeah
Can't believe everything I read

But my shoes the latest season
Now that you're distracted

Say, "Goodbye," but it never ends
And you end up in my bed again
In public, you don't say nothin'
In private, you scream my name

We know it's not right (It's not right)
But she wants one more time, oh, no

Lipstick in hand, Tahitian tanned in her painted on jeans
She dreams of fame, she changed her name
To one that fits the movie screen
She's headed for the big time, that means

[Chorus]
She's going Hollywood, she's going Hollywood tonight
She's going Hollywood, she's going Hollywood tonight
She's going Hollywood, she's going Hollywood tonight
It's true that you may never ever have that chance again
That chance again, babe

[Verse 2]
Westbound Greyhound to Tinseltown to pursue her movie star dreams
And she's giving hot tricks to men just to get in
She was taught that that's not clean
Because she's only fifteen

[Chorus]
She's going Hollywood, she's going Hollywood tonight
She's going Hollywood, she's going Hollywood tonight
She's going Hollywood, she's going Hollywood tonight
It's true that you may never ever have that chance again
That chance again, babe

[Chorus: Merlyn Wood, Matt Champion, & Dom McLennon]
Give it to me, give it to me
Give it to me now, give it to me now
Give it to me now, now
Give it to me, give it to me
Give it to me now, give it to me now, now, now
Give it to me now, give it to me now, now, now

I-I need it, I-I, need it, need it
I-I need it, I-I, need it, need it

[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract & Merlyn Wood]
Sometimes I be mad that I ain't sexy
Sometimes I be shy to show my blessings
Poppin' like a carbonated beverage
The cops poppin' niggas Orville Redenbacher (Ian, you sexy!)

[Verse 2: Dom McLennon]
Most times I give friends more time than family
You remember when I used to feel like I don't understand me
Now we speakin' the same language
I don't listen like I can be
But I'm learnin'
But I'm learnin'
But I'm learnin'

[Verse 3: Matt Champion]
Sometimes I feel like I'm way too sexy
Most the singers found me in the desert
Minimi-, minimi-
Handle my business, don't talk to me directly
No one above me actin' like they all so lovely
Recogni-, Recogni-
They try to pin me down, they try to bind me
And they try to kill me like Anna Nicole
Heels switchin', finger clicking
Kick on me like I’m James Bond on a role
They want the boot of my car
Pussy boy like booty call
Money quick like auctioneer
You need a neutral career
Look what we did in a year
Yeah! Yeah!

[Verse 4: Joba]
Oh, I'm lonesome, and hopeless
But hopeful, but hopeful
What's a boy to do lost in the world trying to find a balance
Sippin' out his chalice with its jewels dancing
Fluid like the potion
That pours when I get down some
Just trying to find a port in the sky where
The sun can shine down some
Jesus is lord, I put that on god
What more do you want from me?
He's in the dark, he's just a child
They turned their backs on me
Nevermind what it was
I see enemies
Don't want what's best for me
Best believe

[Bridge: Joba]
I'm lonesome
But hopeful, but hopeful
I'm lonesome
But hopeful, but hopeful

[Verse 5: Kevin Abstract]
'Times, it be so spot on it hurts
Like when auntie couldn't decide between going to work or church
I been in my feelings on that island in the dirt
I feel like brothers lie just so my feelings don't get hurt
I said I tried vacation, I tried to run away
I deleted Facebook, I'd trade fame any day
For a quiet Texas place, and a BBQ plate
I'll switch my place if that's good for ya

[Bridge: Kevin Abstract]
Is that good for ya?
Good for ya
Is that good for ya?
Good for ya
Is that good for ya?

[Chorus: Merlyn Wood]
Give it to me, give it to me
Give it to me now, give it to me now
Give it to me now, now
Give it to me now, give it to me now, now, now

I'm on the run with you, my sweet love
There's nothing wrong contemplating God
Under the chemtrails over the country club
We're in our jewels in the swimming pool
Me and my sister just playin' it cool
Under the chemtrails over the country club

[Verse 1]
Take out your turquoise and all of your jewels
Go to the market, the kids' swimming pools
Baby, what's your sign?
My moon's in Leo, my Cancer is sun
You won't play, you're no fun
Well, I don't care what they think
Drag racing my little red sports car
I'm not unhinged or unhappy, I'm just wild

[Chorus]
I'm on the run with you, my sweet love
There's nothing wrong contemplating God
Under the chemtrails over the country club
We're in our jewels in the swimming pool
Me and my sister just playin' it cool
Under the chemtrails over the country club

[Verse 2]
Meet you for coffee at the elementary schools
We laugh about nothing as the summer gets cool
It's beautiful how this deep normality settles down over me
I'm not bored or unhappy, I'm still so strange and wild

[Chorus]
I'm in the wind, I'm in the water
Nobody's son, nobody's daughter
Watching the chemtrails over the country club
Suburbia, The Brentwood Market
What to do next? Baby, what of it?
White picket chemtrails over the country club

[Bridge]
My love, my love

[Chorus]
Washing my hair, doing the laundry
Late night TV, I want you only
Like when we were kids under chemtrails and country clubs
It's never too late, baby, so don't give up
It's never too late, baby, so don't give up
Under the chemtrails over the country club, yeah (You're born in December and I'm born in June)
Under the chemtrails, over the country club, yeah (You're born in December and I'm born in June)

My Cancer is sun and my Leo is moon

[Verse 1: Wayne Hector]
Woo
I've been fighting too many wars
Lady Luck please take me, I'm yours
I've been losing, who's keeping score?
'Cause I know we've all been here before, yeah
Give me good times 'fore they're all gone
Love me, fool me, don't leave me alone
All this time I've been rolling my stone
And I still haven't found my way home
But I know I'll be free, yeah, I know I'll be me again

[Verse 2: Unknown female artist]
Now the tides will carry you away from me
But they can't last forever
All the time that I been feeling lost at sea
I still haven't found my way home
But you're a star that I will follow where you lead
'Cause we belong together
When the tides take me back where I used to be
But I know I'll be free and I know I'll be me again

[Chorus: Wayne Hector]
Free again
I keep this fire burning my soul
Leave it running out of control
'Til you're broken you don't know when you're whole
Still tryna find my way home
But I know I'll be free, yeah, I know I'll be me again

[Post-Chorus: Wayne Hector & Unknown female artist]
And now the tides will carry you away from me
But they can't last forever
All the time that I've been feeling lost at sea
I still haven't found my way home
But you're a star that I will follow where you lead
'Cause we belong together
When the tides take me back where I used to be
But I know I'll be free and I know I'll be me again

[Lyrics from Songland]

[Verse 1]
What if sleeping here alone
Is the way our story goes?
Always looking at the phone in the dark
And what if I was so naive?
Saying we would never be
Just another casualty, but here we are

[Pre-Chorus]
Should I reach across the bed and pull you closer?
I'll do anything to keep this thing from being over

[Chorus]
What if we never get past this hurt?
If forever was just a word
And we came this far just to find out
That it wasn't enough

[Post-Chorus]
But what if it's love? (Love, love, love)
What if it's love? (Love, love, love)
Say, what if it's love (Love) doing what it does?

[Outro]
What if we never get past this hurt?
If forever (If forever) was just a word
And I know it's a long way to go
But I'll never give up
'Cause what if it's love?

[Lyrics from Songland]

[Verse 1]
We used to roll out
Icing on her neck, she make it cold out
Always in the mood, she never slow down
I can still remember how it was
Had me going
Crazy for her body, addicted to her curves
I knew she, knew she got me, it only made it worse
Was the best love up until it ended
Now when I think about her, I just

[Chorus]
Try to remember the bad, try to remember the bad
Try to remember the bad things (Bad things)
Try to remember the bad, try to remember the bad
Try to remember the bad things (Bad things)

[Post-Chorus]
Like how she drive me crazy
Drop me to my knees
Let me start to think she's the only thing I need
Try to remember the bad, try to remember the bad
Try to remember the bad things (Bad things)

[Verse 2]
I still got your notes
Still got your clothes
Still got your lipstick on my pillow
It was the best love up until it ended
Now when I think about her, I just

[Chorus]
Try to remember the bad, try to remember the bad
Try to remember the bad things (Bad things)
Try to remember the bad, try to remember the bad
Try to remember the bad things (Bad things)

[Post-Chorus]
Like how she drive me crazy
Drop me to my knees
Let me start to think she's the only thing I need
Try to remember the bad, try to remember the bad
Try to remember the bad things (Bad things)

[Verse 1]
And I can't stand you
Must everything you do make me wanna smile
Can I not like you for awhile? (No)
But you won't let me
You upset me, boy
And then you kiss my lips
All of a sudden I forget (That I was upset)
Can't remember what you did
But I hate it...
You know exactly what to do
So that I can't stay mad at you
For too long, that's wrong
But I hate it
You know exactly how to touch
So that I don't wanna fuss and fight no more
I despise, yet I adore you

[Chorus]
And I hate how much I love you, boy
I can't stand how much I need you
And I hate how much I love you, boy
But I just can't let you go
And I hate that I love you so

[Verse 2]
You completely know the power that you have (Power that you have)
The only one makes me laugh (Makes me laugh)
Said it's not fair
How you take advantage of the fact
That I... (I)
Love you beyond the reason why (Why)
And it just ain't right, oh

[Chorus]
And I hate how much I love you, boy
I can't stand how much I need you
And I hate how much I love you, boy
But I just can't let you go
And I hate that I love you so

[Bridge]
One of these days, maybe your magic won't affect me
And your kiss won't make me weak
But no one in this world knows me the way you know me
So you'll probably always have a spell on me
Yeah
Ooh, oh, oh
Oh

[Chorus]
And I hate how much I love you, boy
I can't stand how much I need you
And I hate how much I love you, boy
But I just can't let you go
And I hate that I love you so

[Outro]
And I hate that I love you so, so

[Chorus: Dido]
My tea's gone cold
I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad
My tea's gone cold
I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
Dear Pat, I've must've missed you in the chat
There be a lot of people that come to Super Facts
It's hard to keep track and you know
When I be talking I don't even be looking at the comments like that
There be a lot of action, a whole lot of distractions
And I can't really keep track of every interaction
So you might have hit me, I just wanna say I didn't see it
And I know you DM'd me, and that was supposed to be our little secret
But I felt your language came a little strong
Cut me some slack, I can't keep track of everything that's going on
I ain't mean to put you on blast just to hurt you
But understand that life is like a circle
And what you asked for, I felt that I really would just give you
You want acknowledgement, and I apologizin'
But I think it opens up a bigger issue that we need to shed some light on
Right or wrong, instead in the comments, I write a song

[Chorus: Dido]
My tea's gone cold
I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
I mean Pat, I think you gotta understand
I'm just a regular person, I'm just a man
I know you like a fan you felt you did a lot for me
But I had something to do with writin' them raps? Right? Possibly?
I mean I did a lot to get to where I am
A lot of sacrifices to have someone like you as a fan
And this ain't easy man, the record labels are greazy and
Even with all that I don't wanna downplay your role, believe me
I think you playin' an important part in the arts
But it's more than puttin' records on them charts
We take a lot of pain, a lot of strain, a lot of frustration
If you don't like what I do today, you just replace 'em
With another artist, another rapper, who's more kind
And the fear of losing stans will lose our minds
I'm talkin', really going crazy
And the last thing you wanna hear is some fans saying that you make me
You know? But that keep paying my bills
I mean you pay like 10 dollars to keep it real
If you bought every album that'd probably be like 50 or 60
If you did a show that's another 35
That's less than a 100 dollars, that's not enough to keep us alive
And I don't wanna downplay your input or your financial transactions to get us where we are but
There's more to our job than just pretendin' to be a star

[Chorus: Dido]
My tea's gone cold
I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad

[Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco]
And in conclusion, to clear up the confusion
Hope this would teach us all like a lesson
That getting what we want, always is a blessing
Sometimes it might be a curse, sometimes it might really hurt
But that's the way life works
So I just wanna say Pat Rooney, I think you're cool
And this whole experience really gave me some jewels
A real opportunity to set up some rules
Not to be a jerk and not to be cruel
But that goes both ways, so let's not make assumptions
Or find a giant pool of conclusions to jump in
So next time on the live, I hope to see you
Signing off, I'm truly yours, this is Lu

[Chorus: Dido]
My tea's gone cold
I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad

[Intro: Mac Miller]
Ayo, Phresh Muney
Y'all my dudes for this one

[Chorus: Phresh Muney & Mac Miller]
I don't wear the big chains, though
'Cause I'm a regular guy (You know me, just a regular-ass boy)
And I ain't finna make it rain, girl
'Cause I'm a regular guy (Yeah)
My hat big dub (Uh)
I still wear Chucks (Chucks)
I ran outta weed, man, that shit sucks (Sucks)
But I don't give a fuck (Nuh-uh)
'Cause I'm a regular guy

[Verse: Mac Miller]
Hey, hey
I'm just a regular guy
Never said I was fly
But I'm higher than Willie Nelson was in '75
I spit ultra-violet rays, fans be gettin' a tan
The boy louder than some thunder, call him Kevin Durant
Hold your tongue, swallow both your hands
My people stick together like a colony of ants
No college plan, tryna get more dollars than a doctor can
My whip be full of kids like a soccer van
Maybe be in LA like a Dodger fan
Or in Miami with all the sand
I ain't worry 'bout poppin' tags, shoppin' bags
Cleaner than a laundromat
But regular enough that people walkin' past, him
No need to hide my face like a hockey mask
'Cause I be in the open with my cocky ass
Went to school but can't remember what the lessons were
I'm just high as hell, I'm so regular

[Chorus 2: Phresh Muney]
I don't wear the big chains, though
'Cause I'm a regular guy
And I ain't finna make it rain, girl
'Cause I'm a regular guy
My hat big dub
I still wear Chucks
I ran outta weed, man, that shit sucks
But I don't give a fuck
'Cause I'm a regular guy
Lyrics from Snippet

[Intro]
(You say...)

[Verse 1]
Now you say I must be out my mind
But I can't help but see love is blind
Open your eyes, take good advice
Still got time left to walk away
In hindsight, I realize
But if you ask me today wouldn't make me stay
I say that

[Chorus]
I wanted to believe
I wanted us to make it, baby
I wanted to believe
I was looking forward, baby
To everything you said in every way
But fuck what people say
Is this real?
Can you make me believe in love?

[Verse 2]
I was in love with her, yeah
You was in love with him, huh
I thought I wasn't
'Til we fucked up and cheated on both of them
The beginning of the end of love for us, listen, huh
I've been trying, I've been dying
I've been buying ever since
Nothing ever come with ease, this feeling inside of me
Got a nigga on his knees, all because he wanted to believe it

[Chorus]
I wanted to believe, oh
I wanted us to make it, baby
I wanted to believe (yeah yeah)
I was looking forward, baby
To everything you said in every way, yeah
But fuck what people say (say)
Is this real?

[Intro: Mac Miller]
You see I spent a lot of time thinkin'
This my life and shit

[Chorus 1: Palermo Stone & Mac Miller]
Momma always told me I was gonna be a superstar (Yeah)
Dream large, and it'll go so far (What?), so far (What?), so far, so far (Haha)
I'm on my way, I'm on my way (What?), I'm on my way (What?)
I'm on my way, I'm on my way (What?), I'm on my way (Aha)
I'm on my way

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
(Let's go)
I'm hands-down the illest to do it my age (Age)
I can see the words conversate on my page (My page)
The sentences stay jumpin' off the can'bis
All these metaphors and my pretzels starts to panic
Writin' so much the margin seem to vanish
Beatin' up a track gotta get a song a bandage (Haha)
Pictures all candid, feature presentation
Gonna make a movie out of every occasion
They can't stand it, that's why I got 'em hatin'
Blood pressure risin', heart start raisin'
Work hard, fuck a calory, I burn bars (Burn bars)
Pedal to the metal they'll earn hard
Everywhere I go, all the girls say I'm sexy
Tell 'em I can change they whole world if they let me (Wassup baby)
Get me, a million people to speak to
I'm on my way right now
But I see you (Peace)

[Chorus 2: Palermo Stone & Mac Miller]
Momma always told me I was gonna be a superstar
Dream large, and it'll go so far, so far (So far), so far (So far), so far (So far)
I'm on my way, I'm on my way (What?) (Ho), I'm on my way (Ho)
I'm on my way (Haha), I'm on my way, I'm on my way (You already know) (Verse two)
I'm on my way

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Uh, I'm on my way to the top of the world
But first I gotta get up off the top of your girl
A lot of distractions, no relaxin'
Money, music, promo, tourin', imagin', and ya fashion (Ching!)
All gotta be right
Then you get your cream right (Cream right)
But it's work, I ain't left the lab in three nights
My girl and me fight, sayin' I don't care
I got a lot of time and she sayin' I don't share (Gimme that)
When you on your way up to royalty
You gotta check all your people's loyalty (Haha)
See the Murray hot today
So I gotta keep it pushin', 'cause I'm on my way!

[Chorus 3: Palermo Stone & Mac Miller]
Momma always told me I was gonna be a superstar
Dream large, and it'll go so far, so far (So far), so far (So far), so far (So far)
I'm on my way, I'm on my way (Where you goin'?), I'm on my way
I'm on my way (Where you headin'), I'm on my way, I'm on my way
I'm on my way (Break it down now)

[Bridge: Mac Miller]
I got a ways to go (Uh-oh!)
But homie you don't know my name (Yessir)
People say that I change, but it's so hard to stay the same (Bring it back like)
So relax, relax, there's no need to worry (Nah)
Time is on my side now
There's no need to hurry (Haha)

[Chorus 4: Palermo Stone & Mac Miller]
Momma always told me I was gonna be a superstar (Yeah)
Dream large, and it'll go so far, so far (So far), so far (So far), so far (So far)
I'm on my way, I'm on my way, I'm on my way
I'm on my way (Where you goin'?), I'm on my way, I'm on my way (Where you headin'?)
I'm on my way

[Outro: Mac Miller]
So like I said
You on a way right now
I'll tweet you later
Aha!
So I see you ma
Peace
Q
Doin' the work and shit
Ay, we grindin' out here, bruh (Haha)

[Verse 1]
Still can't seem to figure out
What happens in my head
Thought alone is gonna kill me
Sick of livin’ with this doubt
This pistol in my hand
I could end it all before the mornin'
Summertime always gon' come around
I’ll be waitin' for another smile
Devil, lift my feet off the ground
Tryna hold on, but gravity won't let me go
This gravity won't let me go
Whoa, whoa
This gravity won't let me go

[Verse 2]
The devil always smile when you need a friend
I'm layin' on this cloud
It's a long drive back to earth
Wonder when my happy days will fade away
Don’t rain on my parade
If it’s only for this moment
So gravity let me go
So can you please let me go?
Let me go, oh (Whoa)
Will you let me get higher, higher?
I just wanna get higher, higher
Wanna get higher
Said I wanna get higher
Said I wanna get higher
Let me get higher
I wanna get high
Said I wanna get high
(Yeah, yeah-eh-eh)
(Yeah, eh-eh)
(Yeah, eh-eh)
Gravity, can you let me go?
Capitol city, skyline photo
Skyscrapers shine, the sun's so
Low in the sky
Secretaries at the hot dog vendors
Cabs honk at the bicycle messengers
On the fly
I can't call with a subway token
Anyway, the phones are all broken
I wish you were here, but I should probably tell you, dear

You wouldn't like it here
You should stay right there
Breathing that country air
You wouldn't like it here

I don't know, can it get much colder?
My resume hasn't even left my folder
All Summer long

[?] back alley solo
Swinging low to the sidewalk saxophone
All summer long
Can't call with a subway token
Anyway, the phones are all broken
I wish you were here, better yet I wish I was there with you

[Pre-Chorus 1: Charli XCX]
Hold on, I'm about to roll for a minute

After two or three days I text right back (Oh Yeah)

[Intro]
So a lot of time
We have fun and hit with this rap shit, right?
But sometimes we just be sittin' there
You just gotta write something that, that mean something to you
More than just havin' fun, you feel me?
So this is that

[Verse 1]
Aha, look, uh, yeah
Recently life hasn't seem complete
Tryna speak the truth on each and every beat
I ain't in the streets or strugglin' to eat
I'm just stuck in a battle with defeat
I gotta go to school, get a good education
That's just society's expectations
What do I do when I'm feelin' so down?
No more friends so I sit up in my house
Think about the cause, glory, and success
Momma just hopin' that I try my best
But she scared to let me fly from the nest
Wanna leave a legacy before I reach death
I got my whole, life ahead of me
To figure out my destiny
Accomplish something 'fore I rest in peace
The troubles that I reach seem to mess with me
Can't keep me up, can't rest, can't sleep
Breath go weak, heart go cold
Body feel numb, think I lost my soul
I don't know what the fuck I can do, right?
Tryna live life but attached to this mic
Light in the tunnel start to shine so bright
Wanna change the world with the rhymes I write
Uh, feelin' worthless, guzzlin' this gin
Wonder what's my purpose, something I pretend
I'm just in search for a brother or a friend
Growin' up well 'cause the color of my skin?
What can I say to that, I can't take it back
It's just the love that made me rap
Feelin' like a QB tryna take a snap
Start my life, just feel great, relax
'Cause happiness, you can't pay for that
Mind lost, lookin' for a place to crash
Now I'm back on my own, still rappin' these poems
And my eyes stay attached to the phone
But she ain't callin', she forgot
Some irony been added to the plot
They told me not to love, but I ain't listen
So now I'm missin' her and dissin' other women
My best friends is some 40s and Ls
I keep forgetting all these little-bitty stories to tell
They think 'cause I rhyme I'm like the other kind
Trapped in the times, don't even got a mind
But I'm so blind and so wise
We grind to climb, please rise
And pay respect to the dead
Go 'head let 'em rest in they bed
We still gotta live, 'cause that's life
It just don't feel right

[Outro]
You know what I'm sayin'?
One take that, just come in the booth
And just speak, you know what I'm sayin'?
A'ight, Mac Miller
CRYSTALLIZED ENVIRONMENTSSubculture, distinct subcultures have disintegrated to the point where it's a more individual— that each person is their own individual subculture. It wants to ask like, it's a part of this desire for, the defini— the search for the definitive self, you know. Like, we're all on this, this kind of journey or this, what it all— what life feels like is the search for the definitive self, and when you have like, Instagrams and have these kinds of things, that become like compartmentalized, like crystallized environments for you to create. I don't know, micro-versions of yourself, or subversions of yourself, or curated versions of yourself. It's like this idea for the search of the definitive self. It's kind of ever-present and we're so conflicted, cause we're like, 'Well if I'm like this, why am I these contradictions, and if I believe this, then why am I that?' So I think that... the fact that the search for the self is so Sisphyean and so kind of like... yes Sisphyian, pointless, like never-ending, you know. I think the comfort that comes from that, materializes in this self-worship and this kind of separation of individual, let you sear— you know, making subcultures and individual thing, like there's no more, it— it's— I feel like it's all tied in and to its kind of sense of purpose.PROXIMITYThere's this, the nice— the utopian idea would be that it reaches towards the original utopian idea of the Internet, which was, yes, about freedom of information. But it was also about... extending pre-existing relationships. So, extending the relationships you already have, so being able to talk to your grand-dad who lives in China, or being able to speak to your friend at work, when he's in Bangkok or wherever it may be and it was about kind of the extension of pre-existing communication. And I think that the Internet has a tool for that, as the Internet, more recently, has been used as a tool to kind of fuel anger, to kind of divide the world, to kind of like, yes, to have meetings and stuff like that. but we've gotten to a place where people have really been using it as a tool to extend this idea of proximity. And I think that it's gonna expand in very, very real, therefore very, very surreal ways, you know what I mean like? I think that it's also like, brings up the question of like, you know, reality in regards to like... how like, for example, if you look at social media and I started talking about this on like the second record, we're getting — well you know, we're on the fourth now — but there was a line where I talk about like... Your eyes were full of diseases... You said I'm full of diseases, your eyes were full of regret. And then you took a picture of your salad and put it on the Internet. And I think that that record, that song is talking about how it's obviously an argument in real-time, in real life, but there's a part in one of the sides of the argument, a part of one of the people that wants to check on the Internet, wants to check on the Internet world.AN AVATAR FOR REALITYMy perspective in that is, well that's not real and this is real, so you're conflicted, like why are you putting value on that? That's obviously my perspective. But now, I question that. I'm like, 'Well, what is real? Where is self-worth? Where are these things coming from?' Like if we created this kind of like— the Internet itself is like an avatar for reality. It has its own, like, economy, and like, through attention, and it's like we all live in it, it's like a little city, like we— it's in itself, its own kind of avatar. So ... I, I don't know what the digital self is going to mean because I think that it's a bit like... by the time it arises, it will be normal, I feel. Like you look at like Westworld and people are saying, 'Ah, wouldn't it be crazy?' Because people would just go around raping robots, and beating them up, and shooting them. it's like yeah, psychopaths will always be psychopaths, but for example, people like grow up with machines! Like people grow up— in order to make like real life robots, we're going to have to like grow up with them. If you're like 13, and you've grown up with robots and stuff like that, and somebody like goes to hurt it, why are you going to say... yeah, maybe not. Like you apply... ah, you know, like feelings come from intent, like we were talking about before. So like a Roomba, people will feel sorry for their Roomba, because it'll like get stuck in the corner, and it's a frisbee on wheels, but because it looks like it's got an intention because it looks like it's trying to go somewhere, people will be like, 'Oh Roomba, you're caught in the corner, cute little Roomba.' And it's because it has this— just, if you apply intent to anything, we'll empathize with it. so like what I'm saying, is like all of these ideas like, 'Oh, it's going to be so strange, when avatars...' No no no, it's going to be a slow build, we'll build an emotional relationship with it. By the time we look back, we'll be like, 'Aha, look how weird it was when we didn't have virtual Auntie Pam.' D'you know what I mean? I think it's just going to be like this... thing that is going to be massively embraced... slowly.

[Refrain: One Republic]
I'm holdin' on a rope Got me ten feet off the ground And I'm hearin' what you're saying But I just can't make a sound You tell me that you need me Then
You go and cut me down, but wait Tell me that you're sorry Didn't think I'd turn around, I say hey

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Okay, I'm talking 'bout a good girl gone bad
Crooked world, wrong path; right Mom, wrong Dad
I sing this song mad but not mad enough to shoot you
But it just eats me up, like some barbecue from Luther's
In the morning with the roosters
On the corner with the boosters
And she's the fresh-cut and they're on her, like sutures
And I wanna talk to her, but her momma has to school her
I wanna see her better, she's the weather of my future
I don't wanna see another hurricane
Baby, you can kill the pain
If you just let me explain, trust me, I know what I'm sayin'
You will end up on the track of an on-comin' train
Stuck in the passenger seat, travelin' through the fast lane

[Verse 2: Bun B]
Well, once upon a time there was a mom and a dad
Who on the outside, had everything people wished they had
A beautiful daughter, two-story house, two-car garage
And a white picket-fence wrapped around the front yard
See, Daddy was a doctor and Mommy was a banker
Mommy's job got outsourced, so now Mommy's a dranker
Daddy had a malpractice suit, now he's a snorter
And all this shit is takin' place right in front of the daughter
She says, "Daddy, what's wrong?", but he's just too high
"Mommy, what we gon' do?", she just get drunk and cry
Caught in the middle of two wrongs, tryin' to do right
Looking for answers all alone in the darkness of night
Shit ain't right

[Refrain: One Republic]
I'm holding on a rope
Got me ten feet off the ground
And I'm hearing what you're saying
But I just can't make a sound
You tell me that you need me
Then you go and cut me down, but wait
Tell me that you're sorry
Didn't think I'd turn around, I say hey

[Hook: One Republic]
You say that it's too late to apologize
It's too late
I said it's too late to apologize
It's too late

[Intro]
Woo
Yeah
How y'all doing out there?

[?] my story
You dig?
That's right
Everybody in the crowd put your 3s up
There, 3s up, let's go

[Verse 1]
Yeah
3 in the morning, I ain't home yet
Shorty blowing up my phone like a bomb treat
What's going on baby? Why you moan that?
Knowing when I make it home I'll get your thong wet
Okay I'm on my way, speed and windows up
So have my food warm, and have my pillars fluffed
She been through the water, shorty pillow tuff
Shorty took all of the shots like the little cough
I wanna give her all, and never give her up
I told her when it die down, we can live it up
Where would you be? Be without me
Don't doubt me be about me baby, I'm like

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I'm like
As soon as I come home, I was working long
She wanna know what I was working on
So I played the song, and I make her feel wrong
But stealing all in my eyes 

[?], she pass right
I can't trip, cause no one loves the fast life when sitting in the passenger sit

[?] tight, and she 

[?] a whole 

[?] to me, a whole 

[?]
But for me that's too much to eat, in one bite, but
Imma chew and just do what I gotta, other bitches get the 

[?] like a hot top prada
Where would you be? Be without me
Don't doubt me be about me baby, I'm like

[Interlude]
Can I talk to her?
Yeah
Um

[Verse 3]
Be the drama on day town television
What is this, detention? It feel like elementary
I wish I never end you, or I scar you
When I think bout my future, baby that all you
I mean that is you, part of my vision though
Part of my mental, see what I'm into?
See how I'm in-to deep in the shit too?
It ain't just you, it is us too
I trust you, you gotta trust me
Cause in them other bitches eyes, I'm a "must-see"
Now where would you be? Be without me
Don't doubt me be about me girl

Told her, "Don't wait for me"
Your time is up, better save it, please
I just ran up me a eighty piece (Ayy)
She on her knees suckin' dick like she pray to me
Doggin' that bitch 'til her face full of Maybelline
In my cup, maybe it's lean, we don't do no green
Left wrist on Billie Jean, Billie Jean, Billie Jean
Draft Day, he poppin', no, Sante ain't stoppin'
He need all his profits, some say that he cocky
I know that he got it, he flew a bitch out from the tropics
Exotic, I'm smokin', Supreme, had to box it
458 'Rari take off like rockets
Wide body kit like Buffie the Body

[Verse 2: Lil Yachty]
All-white Maybach, I nicknamed it Scotty 2 Hotty (Woo)
My Mexican bitch treat me like Liberace (Yeah)
I threw twenty thousand on twenty-five strangers
Being raised by QC prepared me for the danger (Hey)
My stick got a scope like a Texas park ranger
I look up to Mom and Mom only
I ran up a sack in some orange grey Saucony's
My bitches give love, but I'm still feelin' lonely
My heart got a space the same size as a condo
No money can fill it, I'm hot as a skillet (Hot)
These rappers two-faced so bad, I could peel it
And see they true colors, I cut every finger for all of my brothers
I'll hop off the plane backwards wrapped in some Louis V covers
Head first in the gutter (Yeah)
If it's for the guap, fettucine
Might cop a new truck, cream like alfredo linguini
These new niggas weenies
The year is '06 with my black Bapesta beanie
She rub on my gold like there might be a genie
I can't take a bad dressin' bitch to my mama
I might take the bitch from the hood to Bahamas
Show her 'bout the world, this bitch here ain't even my girl (Yeah)

[Verse 3: Draft Day & Lil Yachty]
I pass the bitch off, let the homie go handle it (Yeah)
Big pointer stones 'round my neck light the room like a candle lit (Boom)
Don't get too close, 7.62's knock off your shoulder, dismantle it
Masked up, no Rip Hamilton (Yeah, brrt), you niggas squares like Carlton
I'm in Bel-Air (Yeah) posted at Nobu, inside the whip, orange like Goku
Lil' boy, I done told you, I been hit the ho, that's old news
These niggas be cappin', no Pro Tools
Twenty-two, bitch, and I look like a mogul (Yeah)
Got more money than your whole family tree (Yeah, yeah)
Double that shit, and you still won't reach me (Bitch)
You in the nosebleeds, I sit in floor seats
Right where the coach at, but you can't coach me
Draft Day been on that, sound like Kobe
Please name a nigga who really can stop me (On God)

[Verse 4: Lil Yachty]
Can't no one stop you, you next like the runner-up
Niggas big flexin', they bitch, I'ma look her up
Hook her up, dick her down
Got a new stick, nine-mil' bullets, send thirty rounds
Ready to hunt a clown (Brrt)
I been that nigga since, uh, I can't remember
Since when? Wintertime and I remembered December
Wore a dress, now they tryna slander my gender
My bitch was on set lookin' mighty tender (Woo)
So fuck what they talkin' 'bout, tell 'em to watch they mouth
'Fore I get outta body (Yeah), and I knock 'em out
I bought twelve different whips like it's nothin' new
I keep blicks on the hip like they stuck with glue
I drop bombs on a bitch, I'm not DJ Clue (Boom)
My niggas bangin' red, it's the way of life (Brrt)
We buyin' guns like it's illegal owning knifes
Fuckin' my Asian, she makin' me jasmine rice (Go)
I took a whole lotta slander from fuck niggas, broke niggas
Fuck all of that, I'm the prototype
Grabbin' the wheel, I give a fuck (Skrrt)
Nigga want smoke, I hope that it's up
Aimin' the stick at the square like the game with the duck
Nigga gon' knuck if you buck (Brr)
I got like ten different watches I never wear
My Louis mono, not no Damier (Yeah)
At the penthouse with three different concierge (Yeah)
I know all of my haters cannot compare (Yeah, 'pare, 'pare)

[Intro]
(Oh Lord, Jetson made another one)

[Verse 1]
Pull out them racks on a nigga, he's so funny
He talk the most shit, but got no money
Tough on the 'net, but in person, a new Gandhi
Stand on my racks and I'm Mo Bambi
I mean Mo Bamba, anklets a new Honda
I need threes with TiTi and with La'Shonda
I get right, it's on sight for you newcomers
I got two solid fists for you mouth-runners
With the gang out in public, we ho hunters
Kick that bitch out the spot like a team punter
Think it's time I run up me a Bugatti
Got this bitch ridin' dick like a Ducati
Bought an AP plain jane out in Dubai
Actin' out for attention, the new guy
Got another lawsuit, need a new tie
Know some niggas switched up, turned Ifá
Know some niggas out West bangin' treetop
Made that bitch give me head 'til her knees pop
Switchin' sides on the gang, tryna ease out
Catch you slippin', we knockin' your teeth out
Tryna come down my block, need to reroute
Tryna see all that shit that you talk 'bout
Know it's cap in your rap, you ain't gotta lie
In LA with Zack Bia at Nice Guy
In LA with Zack Bia at Papis
I'm in Houston ho huntin' with Tati
I just had me a smooth little ten piece
Run it up
Stick on my back like I'm huntin' up
Yeah, if I let my dogs loose, they gon' run amuck
Quick to pull up with them 30s tucked

[Chorus]
Run up, flatbread, lay low, stackin' tall
Hit his head once, body dropped, rest his soul
I got big guap, big killers, big pieces
She wan' fuck the gang, told that bitch to write a thesis
Pull up all white, lookin' like I'm black Jesus
And my new crib fancy like the Saint Regis
Niggas sweet as shit, turn 'em to a Reese's Pieces
Diamonds shinin' so damn bright, give a nigga seizures

[Verse 2]
Nothin' make me more happy than backends
I'm straight to no signal, them racks in
These new niggas' music is trashcan
He can't feed his fans, so they fastin'
He told 'em, "Let's all go Muslim"
That bitch nigga ain't out hustlin'
I said take a sip, why you guzzlin'?
Give me my damn cup back, nigga
I'm too rich to be out here tusslin'
Buddy just paid a rack for some 'Tussin
Hope he sick, 'cause that's all that it's good for
I wish that my big brother did more
I pray that my lil' sister live long
Paint the 'Rari all yellow like Armstrong
Got a stock with a stick, it's an arm long
Wow
Heard they said I went broke, boy, was they wrong
I just cashed in a check, it's a phone number
Bitch, your ass on the porch like the door number
We gon' track your ass down like LoJack
Why they playin' with me? I need more racks
To the money, I'm runnin' up four flat
This shit right here gon' need four plaques

[Chorus]
Run up, flatbread, lay low, stackin' tall
Hit his head once, body dropped, rest his soul
I got big guap, big killers, big pieces
She wan' fuck the gang, told that bitch to write a thesis
Pull up all white, lookin' like I'm black Jesus
And my new crib fancy like the Saint Regis
Niggas sweet as shit, turn 'em to a Reese's Pieces
Diamonds shinin' so damn bright, give a nigga seizures

These niggas act like the CIA
Too calm being broke, must be off the CBD (Yeah)
Earrings like DVDs

[Verse 1]
Whole time I knew niggas been fake
Two Chanel bags for my sidepiece
I feel like I'm Gandhi, but that besides me
Snakes on his head, I ain't talkin' Don C
Gave my bitch a hundred racks, told her not to mind me
Me and Draft in that Lam', Concrete's first signee
I'll plead the Fifth if them coppers try me
I'm slime, I'm swift, I'm too damn sneaky
I'm a young hot boy, gold teeth like B.G.
Fuck what them niggas sayin', I know they need me
Backyard too much land, might build a teepee
Tripod hold a stick, pierce you like a CD
My bitch can't get my phone, she know not to ask me
Only Brandon Mitchell, know where the cash be
That's my blooda for life, feel like mama had him
Someone play with her wrong, trust me, I'ma bag him
Mouth platinum, wrist random

[Chorus]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Lemon-head shawty give me mouth and it's so exquisite
Fuck her one time, she want her whip pimped, I'm not Xzibit
Talkin' 'bout she want a Birkin, now she talkin' gibberish
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Apple-head bitch give me dome, it's ten out of ten
Think that I won't fuck on her friends, bitch, go think again
Concrete boy, been outside, bet she let me in

Shouldn't have to say this shit, but who we better than?
Told my bitch to go eat Mediterranean
Finna walk over this beat like a pedestrian (Pedestrian)
I just bought a brand-new whip, it is obsidian
This bitch wanna fuck, I just want mouth, so she upset again

Double down on my numbers, I need all my ends
Pussy play with me wrong, go up in his chin
Call my young nigga Beyblade, he can't wait to spin (Spin)

Everybody’s looking for you
But it hurts when he finally finds you
Still we hold on
I know you are no good for me
Try to believe in something, holding on to nothing

[Pre-Chorus]
The clothes on a mannequin, they have no meaning
So quick to lead me on and let me down
Tell me why you gotta be deceiving
In my opinion, that’s the reason

You’re overrated, overrated, overrated
You’re overrated, overrated
In my opinion, that’s the reason
You’re overrated

Tryna move on, forget that you’re broken-hearted
Lying to yourself, holding on to nothing

The clothes on a mannequin, they have no meaning
So quick to lead me on and let me down
Tell me why you gotta be deceiving
In my opinion, that‘s the reason

You‘re overrated, overrated
In my opinion, that‘s the reason
You‘re overrated

Ready (Ready)
Go (C'mon)
Ready
Pardon the, uh, technical difficulties

[Verse: Kevin Abstract]
How you read my mind better than me?
Yeah, you know I need you when I'm asleep (Ready)
I used to dream of a dream, you know I'm dreamin' that dream
Now my pockets too deep, I don't struggle these days
Yeah, I'm on TLC
Yeah, I'm stuck in my ways, I'm like a broken LP
Yeah it's most of the ways so we could all be free (Ready)
I'm a slave to these ways, dawg
I'm a passer go and wait to hear my plays, dawg
Used to run around the block, with the homies
Ding dong ditchin', takin' rich niggas' money (Ready)
Ain't a damn thing funny, used to dream of bein' Puppy
Bein' ugly ain't made me no money yet (Go, c'mon)
My music was soundin' crazier than 100 gecs
In the tavern, I be dreamin' 'bout gettin' back (Ready)
I was a loser, baby, so why didn't you kill me?
The record's dishonest, boy, so that's why they feel me
I'm still in this building 'til we on this motherfucker
Just a lonely motherfucker, I don't trust you motherfuckers (Ready)
On the speedboat, lookin' like a cozy motherfucker
So show off all your bodies, I ain't no phony motherfucker now
What's the real? (Yeah) Why you still here? (Yeah)
How you still hear? (Yeah) You boys shoulda been gone (Ready)
You thought I'd stop at fifteen, just the fall off
Freshman, BH, aight, nigga, that's all I got (Ayy)

[Verse 1]
The rain is pouring down
And I’m looking at the window
Thinking I’ma chang my ways
Somehow I do this to myself
But I’m blaming you again
And hold a grudge for days
I learnt from my mamma how to never let it go
But that's not who I really am

[Pre-Chorus]
There’s a little part of me
With a lot of history
I wanna help you understand

[Chorus]
That one day tears flooded
So I decided to be cold-blooded
So I'll never get hurt again
There was someone I loved
Who decided to be cold-blooded
So I'm just gonna blame it on them

[Post-Chorus]
I lie and say I'm better on my own
When we're laying here close
It's like laying in the snow
'Cause there's no love
I got cold, cold-blooded

[Verse 2]
It's getting uncomfortable
It hurts me any time you say I'm pretty
So I try to keep it moving
And I pick a fight to bring up something petty
It’s just that my daddy didn't always know how to say
That he's proud of who I am

[Pre-Chorus]
There's a little part of me
Holding on history
And I wanna help you understand

[Chorus]
That one day the tears flooded
So I decided to be cold-blooded
So I'll never get hurt again
There was someone I loved
Who decided to be cold-blooded
So I'm just gonna blame it on them

[Post-Chorus]
I lie and say I'm better on my own
When we're laying here close, it's like laying in the snow, 'cause there's no love
I got, cold, cold-

[Verse 3]
It's not you, you're perfect
I feel like I don't deserve it
When I can't see my own world
I can't see why you put me first

[Post-Chorus]
I lie and say I'm better on my own
When we're laying here close
It's like laying in the snow
'Cause there's no love

[Outro]
I got cold, I got cold
I got cold, I got coldblood
Mmm, mmm, mmm
Coldblood

[Verse 2: Ed Sheeran]
And all my walls stood tall, painted blue
Well I'll take 'em down, take 'em down
And open up the door for you
And all I feel in my stomach is butterflies
The beautiful kind, makin' up for lost time
Takin' flight, makin' me feel right-like

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift & Ed Sheeran]
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Ed Sheeran]
'Cause all I know is we said, "Hello"
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name
And everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday
Is everything has changed

[Bridge: Taylor Swift & Ed Sheeran]
Come back and tell me why
I'm feeling like I've missed you all this time
And meet me there tonight
And let me know that it's not all in my mind

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift]
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you, know you, know you

[Chorus: Taylor Swift &  Ed Sheeran]
'Cause all I know is we said, "Hello"
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name
And everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday
Is everything has changed

[Outro: Taylor Swift & Ed Sheeran]
All I know is we said, "Hello"
So dust off your highest hopes
All I know is pouring rain
And everything has changed
All I know is a new found grace
All my days, I'll know your face
All I know since yesterday
Is everything has changed

[Intro: Gucci Mane]
(Rio)
Burr gang, leave a nigga cold
(What's happenin', Chi Chi?)

[Chorus: Lil Baby & Gucci Mane]
It ain't my business, it ain't my beef, I ain't on no side
Y'all got guns and we got guns, but we don't post ours
Lil' Q poppin' like a giant, he just 4'5''
Told him hit 'em in the leg and make them niggas your size
These niggas gon' end up dead, they keep on playin' both sides
These niggas gon' end up dead, they keep on playin' both sides
They gon' need a lot of black suits, a bunch of bowties
They gon' need a lot of black suits, a bunch of bowties

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
I made it from the streets, it ain't no mercy on these streets (Nah)
It's hot as mercury, these boys'll murk you on these streets
These bitches double dutch, so quick to jump a nigga sheets
Got niggas slick competin' with niggas I ain't even competin' (Facts)
If you talk behind my back, no need to dap me when you see me (No)
'Cause I ain't gon' shed no tear when they pick you up off the cement
A real dope boy, I make it flood in any season
While rappers goin' broke and blame corona as the reason
I showed some niggas kindness , they mistook that I was weak (Weak)
I told them I was stackin', they just thought that I was cheap (Cheap)
If I took it, I was mad, I still ain't finna give it back
No, "Oops, sorry, my bad," consider that shit as a tax (Sorry)
So buy some Stacy Adams and a couple ties to match (Damn)
This MAC came with a shoulder strap, the only thing retract (Yup)
4PF and 1-0-1-7, four tires, we flat
And we ain't with that pitty-pat shit, we rat-ta-ta-tat (Tat)

[Chorus: Lil Baby & Gucci Mane]
It ain't my business, it ain't my beef, I ain't on no side
Y'all got guns and we got guns, but we don't post ours
Lil' Q poppin' like a giant, he just 4'5''
Told him hit 'em in the leg and make them niggas your size
These niggas gon' end up dead, they keep on playin' both sides
These niggas gon' end up dead, they keep on playin' both sides
They gon' need a lot of black suits, a bunch of bowties
They gon' need a lot of black suits, a bunch of bowties

[Verse 2: Lil Baby]
Doin' songs for Gucci Mane, now I done ran them stupid bands up
Make Lil Stupid shoot your mans up, it's a robbery, put your hands up
They see me, they switch the channel, I'm the real deal Atlanta
Ain't no monkeys in the middle, play both sides, you get dismantled
Talk my shit, I got my hammer
Fuck that bitch, I ain't got no manners
Can't hit that shit, that's not my standard
She caught my drift, she like my grammar
I keep me a dirty Fanta, I'm ridin' 'round in this dirty Phantom
I'm 'bout gettin' business handled, I ain't sendin' no worries at 'em
I ain't with no chitter-chatter, keep a bad one
Her ass fatter than the last one
We be takin' shit, no askin', we be breakin' bricks out plastic
Everybody lit, go ask 'em, I be in the 'Vette, the fast one
And I got the C8, you don't wanna see Baby

[Chorus: Lil Baby & Gucci Mane]
It ain't my business, it ain't my beef, I ain't on no side
Y'all got guns and we got guns, but we don't post ours
Lil' Q poppin' like a giant, he just 4'5''
Told him hit 'em in the leg and make them niggas your size
These niggas gon' end up dead, they keep on playin' both sides
These niggas gon' end up dead, they keep on playin' both sides
They gon' need a lot of black suits, a bunch of bowties
They gon' need a lot of black suits, a bunch of bowties
(Open up and breathe it in)x4

[Verse 1]
Told them your dreams, and they all started laughing
I guess you're out of your mind 'til it actually happens

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm the small town
One in seven billion
Why can't it be me?

[Chorus]
They told me I was out there, tried to knock me down
Took those sticks and stones, showed 'em I could build a house
They tell me that I'm crazy, but I'll never let 'em change me
'Til they cover me in daisies, daisies, daisies
They said I'm going nowhere, tried to count me out
Took those sticks and stones, showed 'em I could build a house
They tell me that I'm crazy, but I'll never let 'em change me
'Til they cover me in daisies, daisies, daisies

(Open up and breathe it in)x8

[Verse 2]
When did we all stop believing in magic? (magic magic)
Why did we put all our hopes in a box in the attic? (attic, attic)

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm the long shot
I'm the Hail Mary
Why can't it be me?

[Chorus]
They told me I was out there, tried to knock me down (Knock me down)
Took those sticks and stones, showed 'em I could build a house
They tell me that I'm crazy, but I'll never let 'em change me
'Til they cover me in daisies, daisies, daisies
They said I'm going nowhere, tried to count me out
Took those sticks and stones, showed 'em I could build a house
They tell me that I'm crazy, but I'll never let 'em change me
'Til they cover me in daisies, daisies, daisies

Breathe it in
(Open up and breathe it in)x8

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm the small town
One in seven billion
Why can't it be me?

[Chorus]
They told me I was out there, tried to knock me down
Took those sticks and stones, showed 'em I could build a house
They tell me that I'm crazy, but I'll never let 'em change me
'Til they cover me in daisies, daisies, daisies
They said I'm going nowhere, tried to count me out (Count me out)
Took those sticks and stones, showed 'em I could build a house
They tell me that I'm crazy, but I'll never let 'em change me
'Til they cover me in daisies, daisies, daisies

(Open up and breathe it in)x8

[Intro: Nick]
Oh-no, oh

[Verse 1: Nick with Brian]
Take what you need
'Cause I can't hold my breath
Say what you feel
'Cause I got nothing left, oh
I made a promise to myself last night
I'm gonna keep it if it's wrong or right

[Chorus: All]
And if I lose it all
There'll be nothing left to lose
And I would take the fall
'Cause knowing you are out there breathing
And it's so wonderful
It's a chance I take even if I break it
I lose it all, if I lose it all
Wouldn't matter anyway

[Verse 2: Brian with Howie, Nick with Brian]
Don't change a thing
You're perfect as you are
Time has a way, time is all I got
If my heart should shatter watching you
That'd be one less thing I'd have to prove

[Chorus: All & AJ]
And if I lose it all
There'll be nothing left to lose
And I would take the fall
'Cause knowing you are out there breathing
And it's so wonderful
It's a chance I take even if I break it
I lose it all (lose it all)
If I lose it all (lose it all, oh!)

[Bridge: AJ with Howie]
Heaven will be waiting
When I fall into your open arms
I'll believe you'll find me there
You'll find me there

[Chorus: All, AJ & Nick]
And if I lose it all
There'll be nothing left to lose
And I would take the fall (take the fall)
'Cause knowing you are out there breathing
And it's so wonderful (yeah-yeah)
It's a chance I take even if I break it
I lose it all, (lose it all) if I lose it all
And if I lose it all (hey, yeah-yeah!)
There'll be nothing left to lose (no-no!)
And I would take the fall
'Cause knowing you are out there breathing

Wouldn't matter anyway

[Verse 1]
Hey girl, it's the first time
I've looked at somebody like this
And hey girl, I'm so nervous
You look so fine
You make me shiver like crazy

[Chorus]
Say you want me now
I am scared as hell
I don't even know if you are nervous
I can't tell
Say you love me now
Please, I'm scared as hell
I've never been in love before
I don't know what to do

[Verse 2]
Hey girl, do you like me?
I guess that's a stupid-ass question (Question)
I'm asking cause I'm nervous
You look so fine
You make me shiver
Oh!

[Chorus]
Say you want me now
'Cause I am scared as hell
I don't even know if you are nervous

[Bridge]
Pablo!

Say you want me now
'Cause I am scared as hell
I don't even know if you are nervous
I can't tell
Say you love me now
Please, I'm scared as hell
I've never been in love before
I don't know what to do

[Verse 1]
I've waited for moments of clarity
Sleepwalkin' through life like a daydream
Time's not on our side and you are out my mind
I'm free falling through my heart's vacancy

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't give up on what we've got

[Chorus]
Even though fate never goes our way
I'm gonna, gonna get to you anyway
(Don't give up on what we've got)
When the signs say that we're insane
I'm gonna, gonna love you anyway
(Don't give up on what we've got)

[Post-Chorus]
I'm gonna love, I'm gonna love
I'm gonna love you anyway
I'm gonna love, I'm gonna love
I'm gonna love you anyway

[Verse 2]
I'm callin' out, can you hear me?
'Cause this  silence is deafening
No matter how we try
We're in a different place and time
'Cause what we have is too good to release

[Pre-Chorus]
I won't give up on what we've got (even though fate never goes our way)

[Chorus]
Even though fate never goes our way
I'm gonna, gonna get to you anyway

[Spoken Outro]
Thanks so much

[Verse 1]
I need some recovery
Don't wanna make this messy
Push and pull again as you untie the ends
Baby, I need some recovery

[Verse 2]
Harder and harder to sleep
You're weighing heavy on me
Try and I try, can't push it aside
It's harder and harder to sleep

[Pre-Chorus]
Do you, do you know the things you do to me?
Do you, do you know the way that you sit on my couch
Staring silently, burning a hole in the wall

[Chorus]
Really got me
Where you want me
With my head just
Above the deep
Hear the sirens
Silent crying
Hard to be here
When you don't see me

[Verse 3]
Stuck in that weird in-between
Running through old memories
Felt it for ages, on different pages
Stuck in that weird in-between

[Pre-Chorus]
Do you, do you know the things you do to me?
Do you, do you know the way that you sit on my couch
Staring silently, burning a hole in the wall
While I'm trying to fix this, do you even care?

[Chorus]
Really got me
Where you want me
With my head just
Above the deep
Hear the sirens
Silent crying
Hard to be here
When you don't see me

[Outro]
I need some recovery
Don't wanna make this messy
Push and pull again as you untie the ends
Baby, I need some recovery

[Intro]
La la, la la la la la la
La la, la la la la la la
La la, la la la la la la

[Verse 1]
Do you wanna know a secret unknown?
But you'll never keep your promise
Try to keep it simple for you
High up in the clouds like you're so special
Like you never heard that before
Gotta break it to you gentle
But maybe I thought, maybe
Maybe I won't be the nice guy for once
(You past the point of my graces)

[Pre-Chorus]
You think you're so cool
Acting like a fucking dude
Words spilling out like a fool

[Chorus]
Don't call me your sweetheart
Actually, don't call me at all
Buried that girl in the backyard
Bet you didn't think I'd take it  that far
Don't call me a sweetheart
Shit like that makes my skin crawl
Buried that girl in the backyard
Bet you didn't think I'd take it that far

[Post-Chorus]
La la, la la la la la la
La la, la la la la la la
La la, la la la la la la

[Bridge]
I'm so much happier without you
Sucking up all of my energy, now I can finally breathe

[Chorus]
Don't call me your sweetheart
Actually, don't call me at all
Buried that girl in the backyard
Bet you  didn't think I'd take it that far
Don't call me a sweetheart
Shit like that makes my skin crawl
Buried that girl in the backyard
Bet you  didn't think I'd take it that far

[Post-Chorus]
La la, la la la la la la
La la, la la la la la la
La la, la la la la la la
La la, la la la la la la

[Pre-Chorus]
You think you're so cool
Acting like a fucking dude
Words spilling out like a fool

[Chorus]
Don't call me your sweetheart
Actually, don't call me at all
Buried that girl in the backyard
Bet you  didn't think I'd take it that far
Don't call me a sweetheart
Buried that girl in the backyard
Bet you didn't think I'd take it  that far

[Post-Chorus]
La la, la la la la la la
La la, la la la la la la
La la, la la la la la la
La la, la la la la la la

[Verse 1]
It was cold, we were laying by the lake
And oh, that's when I made my first mistake
I was sold, yeah, I thought that it was fate
Oh no, that’s when I first felt my heart break

[Pre-Chorus]
Lust, it made us hungry like the wolves
We chose to act like fools
We were young, but  we were wildly in love

[Chorus]
But I wasted all my youth on you
Wasted all my youth on you
Oh, wasted youth
Oh, wasted youth

[Verse 2]
You stole the better parts of me
Cruel, you took my good and left no peace
Soon, there'll be no beauty left to see
Truth, wish I could erase memories

[Pre-Chorus]
Lust, it made us hungry like the wolves
We chose to act like fools
We were young, thought we were wildly in love

[Chorus]
But I wasted all my youth on you
Wasted all my youth on you
Oh, wasted youth
Oh, wasted youth

[Bridge]
If I had the chance to take it back
I'd waste it again, waste it again

[Chorus]
Wasted all my youth on you
Wasted all my youth on you
Oh, wasted youth
Oh, wasted youth

[Verse 1: andrea]
I should just stop thinking
My worries, they feel like ink
It doesn't wear off even though you want it to
Wish I could go back in time
When everything was just fine
Back to the time when I was just a kid

[Chorus: boy pablo & andrea]
Wanna go back again
Things don't make any sense
I just wanna go back again

[Verse 2: boy pablo]
Stop it, I need a break
I'm tired of being fake
'Cause really, I'm just insecure and lonely
Wish I could go back in time
When everything was alright
Back to the time when I was just a kid

[Chorus: boy pablo & andrea]
Wanna go back again
I don't want to pretend
I just wanna go home again

[Verse 1]
Have the same thing on, about a week-long
Black shoes, black jeans, white tee on
Caught the last flight home, you're working too long
No rest, no stress, no phone call

[Pre-Chorus]
You wouldn't believe me if I told you myself
See if believing I can show you myself
But I already remember where I woke up yesterday
15 cigarettes in my ashtray I am using
That's what happens when you

[Chorus]
Sleep all day, play all night
That's my life, that's the life
New York days, L.A. nights
That's my life, that's the life
A-all night, up all night
All night, up all night
New York days, L.A. nights
That's my life, all day all night

[Verse 2]
Up till sunshine, watching the sunrise
Pull it in, sending chills up my spine
Can't find no time to rest my tired eyes
Can't see, can't see a straight line

[Pre-Chorus]
You wouldn't believe me if I told you myself
See if believing I can show you myself
But I already remember where I woke up yesterday
15 cigarettes in my ashtray I am using
That's what happens when you

[Chorus]
Sleep all day, play all night
That's my life, that's the life
New York days, L.A. nights
That's my life, that's the life
A-all night, up all night
All night, up all night
New York days, L.A. nights
That's my life, all day all night

Hey, hey, hey
Oh, oh!

[Chorus]
Sleep all day, play all night (oh, all night)
That's my life, that's the life (that's my life)
New York days, L.A. nights (oh, oh)

A-all night, up all night (oh yeah, all right)
All night, up all night (all night, up all night)
A-all night, up all night (oh)
All night, up all night (up all night)

[Verse 1]
You're the one that I've been waiting for
Gotta quit this cryin', nobody's gonna
Heal me if I don't open the door
Kinda hard to believe, gotta have faith in me

[Refrain]
Freak out, freak out, freak out, freak out (Look at me)
Get down, get down, get down, get down (Look at me)
Freak out, freak out, freak out, freak out
Look at me now

'Cause all I ever wanted was love

Your stupid love, love, love (Higher)
I want your stupid love, love, love
I want your stupid love, love, love

[Verse 2]
Now, it's time to free me from the shame
I gotta find that peace, is it too late or
Could this love protect me from the pain?
I would battle for you (Even if we break in two)

[Refrain]
Freak out, freak out, freak out, freak out (Look at me)
Get down, get down, get down, get down (Look at me)
Freak out, freak out, freak out, freak out

[Intro: Lil Wayne]
Yeah, Mula, uh

[Chorus: Leah Marie & Lil Wayne]
I pray so hard for my enemies
I wish them well with no other intent (Amen)
Life is not promised, no guarantee
No guarantee, but you get what you get
It's like Russian roulette (Yeah)
It's like Russian roulette (Baow)
It's like Russian roulette (Yeah, baow)
No guarantees, but you get what you get

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Yeah nigga, pistol to your ear nigga
Have my big homie kill your lil' nigga
We heard the bricks comin' on the boat
We at the dock, we at the pier nigga
You won't even spot or hear niggas
But when they get here nigga, we gon' pop up and appear nigga
On some DMX shit, we gon' be like, "We right here, nigga"
Even though we right here, we far away, we light years nigga
And my AK got diarrhea nigga
I'm promethazine, mixed with gasoline, mixed with antifreeze
And you just some light beer nigga
Sig Sauer spit a wig for ya, sip oil better than an oil rig, dig?
All your bust downs sparklin' like foil
And the coke got me sweatin', keep a towel on my shoulder
Like I used to coach the Georgetown Hoyas
I would walk down and draw down on you
Tell your woadies pray for you
And your shooters better be some fuckin' Golden State Warriors
I'm gettin' older, other day I told my soldiers
Spare nothin' except the strollers, but my heart used to be colder
Never sober so a nigga prolly higher when he sober
I be higher than the Solar System, get rich and control the system
I was servin' it like, Anna Kournikova
From a Nissan Pathfinder, now I have to find a chauffer
I got alphabet bitches, I do numbers, I do digits
I hear gunshots at my door, hold on, who is it?

[Chorus: Leah Marie & Conway the Machine]
I pray so hard for my enemies
I wish them well with no other intent
Life is not promised, no guarantee
No guarantee, but you get what you get
It's like Russian roulette
It's like Russian roulette
It's like Russian roulette (Hold on, right)
No guarantees, but you get what you get (Uh, look)

[Verse 2: Conway the Machine]
You niggas do anything for fame and clout
What would you do for your freedom? Might give a statement out
I'm from a city nobody think they'd make it out
Got a key and a Glock, I took the paper route
Gave my people the block, straightened out
And I'll be back by mornin'
Whip the bricks until your back side's soarin'
I just bust the AP, that's a fact, mind's water for my bracelet
Dropped twenty like Jordan on a bad night, scorin'
'Gnac pourin', I just pulled up in a matte white foreign
Stick got a drum in the beam and the flashlight on it, yikes
Yeah, my shit's bad like Lauryn, I ran into her
On my last night tourin', I'm a mack, like, hol' up

[Chorus: Leah Marie & Benny The Butcher]
I pray so hard for my enemies
I wish them well with no other intent
Life is not promised, no guarantee
No guarantee, but you get what you get
It's like Russian roulette
It's like Russian roulette
It's like Russian roulette (Butcher comin', nigga)
No guarantees, but you get what you get

[Verse 3: Benny The Butcher]
Bust it down 'til the scale break, did a buck thirty on the beltway
Caught a bomb, Travis Kelce, 'fore we touch down, it's a tailgate
Piece lookin' like a milkshake, had to back up, give myself space
Fake statements and my health straight
I can't give a fuck what no one else say
So deep, it's like a jailbreak when the coupe slide down MLK
That's a bulletproof CLK, fire lands on the shelf case
Turned felons into executives, made a half a mil' and it felt great
Y'all niggas just a lil' late, got a big house on a lil' lake
And we both know how the smoke go
Shots peel straight through a steel plate
Never throw stones when you know
You livin' in a glass house like you Bill Gates
Good on both coasts like I'm LJ, Bape store out in LA
Bougie nigga even when I'm dead
Cause I'ma die and get to hell late, ugh

[Outro: Leah Marie]
I pray so hard for my enemies
I wish them well with no other intent
Life is not promised, no guarantee
No guarantees, but you get what you get

[Intro: Lil Wayne]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
She got a thick-ass ass with fake-ass titties
She like a straight-ass man and gay-ass women
I like a bald-head cat, so shave your kitten
She leave my tommy gun slimin' slime, my Draco drippin'
Fuckin' right, bust it open for a bust-down
Yeah, up, down, up, down, up, down
Cut down on the syrup, now I'm up now
Sike, I could hit it without putting the cup down
I'ma go brazy in there, shoot babies in there
But she ate 'em for dinner, she a baby killer
I'ma make her run laps like track (Run track)
Put my face up in her lap like a MAC, ooh

[Chorus: Doja Cat]
Yeah, shimmy shimmy ya, shimmy yay, come and give it to me

Can he catch it if I throw it back? That's a fifty-fifty
I'ma make it clap, clap, clap, ain't no itty bitty

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Ooh, close your eyes 'cause they rollin' back
I'ma close my eyes and imagine you is Doja Cat
Make that ass clap until it do the Nolia Clap
I got on the twenty four karat gold Trojan hats
Sit up on my lap, 'til we overlap
You got on the camouflage thong, got a soldier rag
If these wall could talk, I got your pussy walls talkin' back
Made you leave them bug-a-boos alone like the Orkin Man

[Bridge: Lil Wayne]
Girl, yeah, make you oh, na-na-na-na-na-na

Shimmy shimmy ya, shimmy yay, come and give it to me
You could drink it straight from the tap, lick the kitty, kitty

[Chorus]
Strut it out, walk a mile
Serve it, ancient-city style
Talk it out, babble on
Battle for your life, Babylon
That's gossip, what you on?
Money don't talk, rip that song
Gossip, babble on
Battle for your life, Babylon

[Verse 1]
We only have the weekend
You can serve it to me, ancient-city style
We can party like it's B.C
With a pretty sixteenth-century smile

[Pre-Chorus]
It's the thing that you bring
That you bring, that you bring
Him, you, and me
That's gossip

[Chorus]
Strut it out, walk a mile
Serve it, ancient-city style

Battle for your life, Babylon

Body's moving like a sculpture
On the top of Tower of Babel tonight
We are climbing up to Heaven
Speaking languages in a BloodPop® moonlight

[Pre-Chorus]
It's the thing that you bring
That you bring, that you bring
Him, you, and me
That's gossip

[Chorus]
Strut it out, walk a mile
Serve it, ancient-city style
Talk it out, babble on
Battle for your life, Babylon
That's gossip, what you on?

Uh, jealousy towards me happens so often
Far from egotistic, I done told you that I need you, yeah
Too many fake ones out there, ain't hard for me to see through them

Use me for your band-aid, I'll put your scars away
Too picky, I cannot just fall for any person
Too picky, gotta be for me and promise not to turn, yeah
Gotta build a bridge from you to me and promise not to burn it
Although jealousy towards me happens so often
You know they gon' be focusing on everything that we do, yeah
Far from egotistic, I done told you that I need you, yeah
Too many fake ones out there, ain't hard for me to read through that
I don't wanna stand if you ain't standing by my side, no oh

She keep her spliff on Deebo and I keep my blunt on Big Worm, yeah
You know they gon' be focusing on everything that we do, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't ever think that it can't happen to you, you
You gotta stand on your own two, win or lose
And if it gets too hard to face the truth
You got to grow through what you go through, yeah

[Chorus]
I need a bandage for the damage I've been through
I've been knocked down but I managed to improve
Only real competition is myself

[Verse 1]
She's stuck in my brain storm, trying not to get rained on
I put all these rings on and it look like I'm flame throwing
And I put all my chains on and it look like I snakecharm
I was down on my dick, everybody was hissing
Now I'm trying to keep them snakes up out my garden
Put your ear up to my safe, the money snoring
Carolina blue sorta look like Jordan's
Let's get high for Nipsey and pop a blue dolphin
And yes I gotta keep them snakes up out my garden
But keep that Mamba Mentality regardless
'Cause I know harder times are waiting for me in the future
All I can do is stay in my lane and put my gear in neutral

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't ever think that it can't happen to you, to you
You gotta stand on your own two, win or lose
And if it gets too hard to face the truth
You got to grow through what you go through, yeah

[Chorus]
I need a bandage for the damage I've been through
I've been knocked down but I managed to improve
Only real competition is myself, myself
Yeah you need a bandage for the damage you've been through
You've been knocked down but you managed to improve
Only real competition is in you

[Verse 2]
I'm caught in a thunderstorm
I look up and it's fuckin' pouring
I'ma need me a lucky charm
I need it easy as Sunday morning
I keep me a firearm 'cause I always think I'm at harm
But it ain't no smokin' over here without ringing my fire alarm
On gang, on God, on moms
This life will break you down to crumbs
I was floating on the cloud, I jumped
And when I hit the ground I sunk
Yeah they thought I was down, I'm up
I was lost now I'm found, what's up
I came too far around to give up
When I was down on my dick
Everybody was missing, they thought I would miss them
But I got in that kitchen and cooked up this wisdom
I started a system
If you really love your niggas you'd never risk them, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't ever think that it can't happen to you, yeah
You gotta stand on your own two, win or lose, yeah
And if it gets too hard to face the truth
You got to grow through what you go through, yeah

[Chorus]
I need a bandage for the damage I've been through
I've been knocked down but I managed to improve
Only real competition is myself, myself
You need a bandage for the damage
I've been knocked down, knocked down but I manage yeah
Only real competition is myself
Only real competition is myself

[Intro: Lil Wayne]
I love you, I hate you and that's why I love her
Nasty by nature, a natural woman
Graphic but graceful, but sassy, but humble
That cat and that face and that ass and them bubbles
She rattle my snake but I bury my shovel
I carry my weight and went tatted my muscle
She act like she’s brazy, I act like I'm dumbo
It's all rice and gravy, it’s all bread and butter (MonstaBeatz)

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
And sometimes you remind me of my ex
And sometimes you remind me why I left
And sometimes I call you my queen and I watch the throne
Sometimes you call and I just watch the phone, I don't know
That's why I wonder, I wonder how many stars you done seen
While we fucking, while we fucking, yeah
I wonder how many calls you done screened
While we fucking and didn't say nothing
I don't know whether to love you or fuck you
Love you or fuck you, love you or fuck you
Girl, I don't know whether to love you or fuck you
Kiss you or cuss you, trick you or trust you
Girl, I don't know, I don't know, look
I’ve been here, I’ve been waiting on you, yeah
Waiting on you,  on you yeah
See what time it is, time to make your move, ooh

[Verse: Jessie Reyez]
You should have your phone unlocked if you really love me
Throw that bitch a block if she was really nothing
Would I go through your phone locked?
So now I'm deep in my emotions
’Cause I saw her shoot her shot, and you replied with some emojis
I don't need a friendly motherfucker for a boyfriend
Who forget about me when he's drinking with the broskis
I just want a family man, RIP Kobe
Someone I can bend with, someone that'll hold me and love me
OD, OD, OD
Nine games, we can go to OT
KO if I fuck your homies
Careful if you really love me
Better block those shots like you’re a goalie

[Chorus: Lil Wayne, Jessie Reyez & Both]
I wonder how many stars you done seen
While we fucking, while we fucking, yeah
I wonder how many calls you done screened
While we fucking and didn't say nothing
Yeah, and sometimes you remind me of my ex
Sometimes you remind me why I left
Sometimes I call you my queen and I watch the throne
Sometimes you call and I just watch the phone
I don't know whether to love you or fuck you
Love you or fuck you, love you or fuck you
Girl, I don't know whether to love you or fuck you
Rub you or touch you, hug you or cuddle
Girl, I don't know, I don't know, look
I've been here, I've been waiting on you, yeah
Waiting on you, on you, yeah
See what time it is, time to make your move, ooh
No cap

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
I love you, I hate you and that's why I love you
Nasty by nature, a natural woman
Graphic but graceful, but sassy, but humble
That cat and that face and that ass and them bubbles
She rattle my snake but I bury my shovel
I carry my weight and went tatted my muscle
She act like she's brazy, I act like I'm dumbo
It's all rice and gravy, it's all bread and butter

[Pre-Chorus]
They drowning in the water, we can't save 'em
Blood all on the leaves and on the pavement
Weighs heavy on our brains and on our conscience
We know that tomorrow isn't promised

[Chorus]
Living life on the edge, pray the sunrise there and
Put a price on his head, all the dogs get fed

From straight out of class to business, yeah
And I went from cash to digits, yeah
She stripping like that's religion, yeah
So I give her a cash baptism, yeah
I ain't into plastic bitches
But that bitch need some ass and titties
I can't smell that shit that's too skinny
I like my blunt fat and pretty
I'm smoking that Cali strong
I call that shit Calisthenics
You look like you got bad intentions
She look like she been paying attention
You look like you in bad condition
I look like I'm an air condition
Yeah, pressure busts pipes and I'm so piped up
Look at your wife and she gets mind fucked
I'm in the crowd, I make her eyes cum
Love is blind, so it can't find us
MDMA go MIA, MDMA and MIA
My little bitch naked like Kim K
I ain't got nothing on but some Kanyes
You got blood all on your sidewalk, on your sidewalk leave you sideways
I'ma blood walk on your sidewalk
I'ma slime walk in yo slime face
I'ma B walk on your sidewalk, on your front porch and your driveway
I put 10K on your head, my nigga said you ain't worth 5K, uh

[Pre-Chorus]
They drowning in the water, we can't save 'em
Blood all on the leaves and on the pavement
Weighs heavy on our brains and on our conscience
We know that tomorrow isn't promised

[Chorus]
Living life on the edge, pray the sunrise there and
Put a price on his head, all the dogs get fed
All the dogs get fed, all the dogs get fed
All the dogs get...

[Verse 2]
Then my diamonds start dancing
My houses is so killer, bitches call me Charles Mansion
Codeine, Adderal, Xanax, cars crashing
G3, G4, G5, I tarmac it
Dumb bitch, smart phone, calls dropped, she can't catch it
She get high all day, snort coke and drink Pepsi
Suwoo, Piru, this murder like Ja Rule
It's voodoo, it's taboo, my shooter shoot like Manu, pew pew
Achoo, I pray God bless you, I do
I lay you next to my shoe, don't get your flesh on my shoe
Run your mouth and we gon' slide, we slide
No lie I'm a blood repping 123
So 5, 45's and them 223's
And more 9's, Mac-10, 11's, 12-gauge
Numbers don't lie, lie
Run your mouth and we know it's
Lies, lies, lies, lies, lies, lies we know it's Sci-Fi

[Pre-Chorus]
They drowning in the water, we can't save 'em
Blood all on the leaves and on the pavement
Weighs heavy on our brains and on our conscience
We know that tomorrow isn't promised

[Chorus]
Living life on the edge, pray the sunrise there and
Put a price on his head, all the dogs get fed
All the dogs get fed, all the dogs get fed
All the dogs get fed
Living life on the edge, pray the sunrise there and

All the dogs get fed, all the dogs get fed
All the dogs get...

[Verse: JPEGMAFIA]
Fifth string, Young Peggy ring (Go)
Slick with the ink, these melodies need Duolingo (Shit)
Same size as Dua Lipa, where the fuck my pen go?
Second fiddle to weirdos, you feel like Eddie Winslow
Street Fighter like Birdie, keep a stick like Rolento
Did you win if your purpose is just perfect potential?
Did you live up to it, is you just doin' the minimum?
Used to get fifty views, now they need Peggy's momentum (Yeah)
Let's check the addendum
Switch the code, I'm speakin' prophecies, like That's So Raven
Bald headed with lil status, I feel like Maven
But I be dressed like Raven, up in the studio slavin'
Wonder how Peggy be- (Wait, wait)
Wonder how Peggy be cakin'? I be Easy Bakin'
My oven stay prepped and ready for the heat to take it
Niggas that took this road and failed ain't have proper placement
Some of you niggas don't look well, does Peggy make you hate him?
Is it how I make the beats sound like Poltergeist? (Huh?)
Or when my homies bring my name up is it breedin' spite?
It's all talent, perfectly balanced, young Supreme Kai
Who am I? Wake up every morning like it's do or die
No surprise, suits get jealous when you cut the ties
Livin' lie, Lance Armstrong at the finish line
Give it time, when we catch them cops on cam
I don't need six seconds, you remember Vine
It's nasty

[Outro: Method Man]
Cash rules everything around me
C.R.E.A.M., get the money
Dolla dolla bill y'all, y'all

[Part II: hold me]

[Intro: KRS-One]
Of course all the hardcore heads
This one goes out to you
Crank up the volume one time
Peace to all the real DJs out there
Cause I don't send my music to no garbage DJs
They get me
Woop-woop, that's the sound of da police
Woop-woop, that's the sound of the beast
Woop-woop, that's the sound of da police

[Verse: Kevin Abstract]
Stuck in the wild, murder with a smile
The only child to make it up out the mud (Yeah)
My fingers bloody, my tooth is kinda crushed (Uh-huh)
The rush I hate is the one that you love
Fingers crossed (Yeah), crisscrossed, applesauce
Rugrats, writin' raps, quittin' jobs, runnin' laps
Who was that that found the coke in your bag?
I was hopeless, we would laugh, on the lawn doin' math
Ayy, ayy, I need some new genes, I admire your blue jeans
I admire your mood swings, I admire the whole thing
It's gettin' lonely in Cali', yeah, it's so sunny though
Still got hope for the bloke over there with the runny nose
If I could keep your eyes on me long enough
I could prolly trick you into thinkin' that I'm right enough
Like I got it all together, tell your fam' I'm bright enough (Nah)
Keep my crew tight enough (Nah), give me the time, I'm ridin' up
(Nah, yeah)

[Break: Gil Scott-Heron]
It stands out on the highway
Like a creature from another time

[Chorus: Matt Champion & Kevin Abstract]
Hold me by surprise (Hold me by surprise, surprise, yeah)
And try to remember yesterday (Yesterday, ah, you)
Hold me by my head (Hold me by my head, head, yeah)
And rinse away the pain of yesterday (Yesterday, ah you)
I lay, I pray, for you in this time

C.R.E.A.M., get the money
Dolla dolla bill y'all, y'all
Pardon the, uh, technical difficulties
It stands out on the highway

[Intro: Joba]
Angels watchin' over me, god damn
Hope the homies rest in peace, I can't
As I sink into concrete
I throw a prayer to the old me

[Verse 1: Dom McLennon]
Twenty-five, they said twenty-five, no P.O. in sight, he just turned eighteen
Sun shinin' when they hit my cousin, it was like a month past MLK Day
Swear some nights I see him 'tween the shadows and the smoke, mane
God could watch me sin, he turned away from all my flaws, mane

[Verse 2: Kevin Abstract]
.45, he got a .45 and I pray to God he don't bring it, man
Sunset, just another Texan, and that last semester ain't mean a thing
Everything that's evil make me feel alive
Know my niggas on the Southside got my back tonight

[Break: Kevin Abstract]
If you want it, I got it, you want it, I got it
Can you tell that I'm high? (Ooh, ooh)
If you want it, I got it, you want it, I got it, now (High, high)

[Verse 3: Merlyn Wood]
Where my four-four? Where my po-po?
Po-po said can't have more, they say, "I got no drawers"
They say, "drum and you draw" They say, "drum and you lose"
They say, "drum and gun toss", I was very confused
I got friends that kill, I got friends that died
I got many woes, I got many wives
I got enemies, and I roll the dice, ayy-yeah, ayy-yeah-yeah
I got enemies, ayy-yeah, ayy-yeah-yeah

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract, Kevin Abstract & Jabari Manwa]
Smokin' on that fishbone, like, yeah, yeah, yeah, huh

[Verse]
They say my brain meltin'
And the only thing I'll tell 'em is
I'm livin' for the present and the future don't exist
So, baby, take your clothes off, a chance like this
You may never get to show off, show off
Show off what you talking about
Unless you like to tease, baby
When in reality you don't know how to please, baby
Blue-ball queen, take your fuckin' seat, baby
Ride it out, now I know you wanna scream, baby
Better than your next man
And if he swingin' I get dumber than the next man
'Cause I don't play
Unless it's keys, then I play all day (All day)
You like them keys? We gon' play all day (All day)
Wet dream fry your brain all day, all day
I think you lost your morals, girl (What?)
But it's okay 'cause you don't need 'em where we're goin'
In that two-floor loft in the middle of the city
After rollin' through the city with me
I promise you gon' see
That I'm only fuckin' 20, girl
Amnesia, put your mind in a dream world
What you doin' in the bathroom? (Woah)
I hear noises in the bathroom (Woah)
Baby, it's okay
We can do it in the living room
Twisting turns in 'em, the only girls that we fuck with
Seem to have 20 different pills in 'em
They tell us that they love us
Even though they want a next man
And the next man's bitch want the third man (Ooh whoa)
Eddie Murphy shit, yeah, we trade places
Rehearse lines to them and then we fuck faces
Yeah, we know just how to get a buzz
Mix it with the hash, come fuck with us (Ohh)
I'm raw, mothafucka, I'm raw
My love so lost, and my niggas, man
These bitches can't touch what we got if they wanted
I'll plug any nigga that'll step
Man, I got 'em, yeah, I got 'em
'Til the ending of our credits
Life's such a movie, filmed independent, us against the city
Please, don't get offended when we don't answer your calls
And if you got a problem, come and find us, we can talk about it
What's good, young ho? You about it?
Got a loft right now, you excited?
You excited

[Outro]
Uh
Got a girl who likes girls
So watch out, babe
She gonna make you like girls

They try to take that from me
Want blood, they want me
They want blood, they want me
They want blood, they want me

[Verse: A$AP Rocky]
Bankroll, couldn't even fold, couldn't stay afloat
Bank broke, now I got way too many bank codes
Fake hoes, and my day rose, walk around my spare rooms
Lamb zoom, lear zoom, sailor moon, silver spoon
But I ain't no oil tycoon
And if I'm gone 'til November
Won't see my ass 'til next June
And it's true, in the broad day-time afternoon
Tryna spoil my mood, I'm tryna enjoy my cartoons, bitch

[Chorus: Merlyn Wood & A$AP Rocky]
You ain't have many friends, but you the shit to me (Bankroll)
Every time you at the party it's a scene (Bankroll)
Always had to save you from a sunken thing (Bankroll)
Sunken place, always coming in your dreams

[Instrumental]

[Verse]
Ooh ooh oh oh
Can't know where you're going unless you know where you come from
The story's only as good as it's main characters
I know that I have some explaining to do
But every single failure's really a lesson learned
I find I lay low most these days
Just watching my whole community morph and change
Oh the history is fading
Yes I know, I know my history is fading

[Spoken Monologue]
When I was younger, I was at some point, born.
I grew in both IQ and EQ and as that happened I discovered that I was living in two realities at once.
They fought all the time and yet I made space for both of them for a reason I can't explain.
One reality I experienced was my Earth reality. The day, today, painting of what I was taught was my natural state in life.
At the time I also experienced a dream simultaneously and this dream was in combat with my Earth reality at all times.
A vision where I perform my thoughts for the world, a world where I mattered in a different way.
A world where I was valued for different things.
And in this world I was kind and that kindness spread through people, through sound.
This was the birth of Chromatica.

Love is an element on Chromatica, like earth, wind, fire, water.
It's a natural force and it's the only way that I can organize this super organism that is the Earth, it's by making it one whole thing.
Where time and linear structure don't matter, they don't exist.
We are all love.
I am love.
So it's everything around us.
It's how we work.
It's the thing we both initiate and respond to.
It's why everything happens, both good and bad.
It's the only way that I can make things simple.
And why shouldn't it be simple?
I breathe in and out love.
I don't believe it to be a choice other than I choose to breathe.
That is Chromatica.
It is how I do hard things.
It's neither right nor wrong nor is it greater or less than any other perspective on life.
No one thing is greater than another.
Kindness rules all things.
It simply is and it's mine.
You can have it too, though.
My best friend says "Sharing is caring" but we both know that I don't need to share your perspective with you for us both to care.
The Manifesto of Chromatica it's never-ending, I cannot finish it here.
It would be declaring I would never make music or be Lady Gaga again, which would mean I would stop being myself.
This manifesto finale marks the new beginning of my life.
One where I acknowledge that sound is my life force and that Lady Gaga is the mystery that carries it.
Chromatica can't end, it's how I make sense of things.
That's what you should tell people if they ask you what it is.
And for what is worth I think we all need that to make sense of things even if at times it feels absurd.

[Chorus]
If these buildings crumble
And all these machines shut down
I'm still here for you
If this city goes dark
And all these machines meltdown
I'm still here for you

[Pre-Chrous]
Things may come and things may go
But not my love
Things may come and things may go
But not my love for you

[Verse 1]
Mysterious
He rolled back into town
With war stories to tell
He met a girl and she listened well
So he poured out his soul
He said “I don't like what my city’s become now
But it's my hometown”
So the love still the same
And now she is a part of it
Eyes shine bright like the heart of it
So his love for her
Always will remain

[Pre-Chrous]
Things may come and things may go
But not my love
Things may come and things may go
But not my love for you

[Chrous]
If these buildings crumble
And all these machines shut down
I'm still here for you
If this city goes dark
And all these machines meltdown
I'm still here for you

[Verse 2]
They met up on a late-night
Heart racing like some race-bikes
Sw,sw-swtichin’ into high gear (high gear)
He took her on a ride in his skyline
Moonshining up above
She watched the red lights atop the skyscrapers peel away
As he punched on the gas
She cried out “dangerous”
But deep down she liked the rush
And thrill of it all

[Pre-Chrous]
Things may come and things may go
But not my love
Things may come and things may go
But not my love for you

[Chrous]
If these buildings crumble
And all these machines shut down
I'm still here for you
If this city goes dark
And all these machines meltdown
I'm still here for you
He city done changed
It feel so rearranged
It feel so very strange
But the fight remains the same

Tryna survive
Just try’n survive
Tryna survive

Peering into my soul
It feels so very coled
But deep down all they see
Is this heart of gold

My heart is pure
I am so pure now
My heart is pure

Feeling very digital
I want sentimental
Something i can feel
Feeling very digital
I want sentimental
Something real

Old memories come to mind
Lying with you in the morning time
Oh you used to stick around
Lying with me in the morning time

Yeah we used hang downtown
But the city done changed
City done changed
Downtown
Things are rearranged
Feelings aren’t the same
Yeah we used hang downtown
But the feelings done changed
We are not a thing
Downtown

The city life is trash
Everybody wear a mask
Today feels like we’re living in the past
So much anger, so much hate
So much anger
Everybody walks around
Numb and dumbed down
One question
Are you entertained ?
‘cause we’re distracted
So distracted
Feeling very digital
I want sentimental
Something i can feel

Feeling very digital
I want sentimental
Something real


Old memories come to mind
Lying with you in the morning time
Oh you used to stick around
Lying with me in the morning time
Oh you used to stick around
Lying with me in the morning time

Yeah we used hang downtown
But the feelings have changed
City done changed
Downtown
Things are rearranged
Feelings ain’t the same
Downtown
The feeling so strange
We used hang downtown
But city done changed
Ooh
Waiting and wishing
Longing and hoping
For someone to love me

So cold and alone
Is anybody there
Just to show they care and give..

Love (4x)

[Verse 2]
Me, I am you
We are one
All needing love
Just a smile, a glance
Or a stare
Just show that you're there and give...

Love (4x)

[Bridge]
I want to be loved
And you want to be loved
I want to be loved
I want to be loved

We find just ourselves in this place
A joy we've never known

In Shangri-La

No, 

[Ad-libbed lyrics], why we know

[Pre-Chorus]
We're strugglin' just to try to make these ends meet
Job juggling, Lord hear my cry
I'm wonderin' why the TV turned my people
Ride for the money, die for the money
For a little food on my plate

Give us freedom
For all our families
Give us freedom
Peace and harmony
That's the reason

We are the crowd
We're c-coming out
Got my flash on, it's true
Need that picture of you, it's so magical
We'd be so fantastical
Leather and jeans
Garage glamorous
Not sure what it means

Ready for those flashing lights
'Cause you know that, baby, I...

I'm your biggest fan
I'll follow you until you love me
Papa-paparazzi

Your papa-paparazzi
Promise I'll be kind
But I won't stop until that boy is mine
Baby, you'll be famous
Chase you down until you love me
Papa-paparazzi

[Verse 2]
I'll be your girl backstage at your show
Velvet ropes and guitars
Yeah, 'cause you're my rockstar in between the sets
Eyeliner and cigarettes
Shadow is burnt
Yellow dance and we turn
My lashes are dry
Purple teardrops, I cry
It don't have a price
Loving you is cherry pie
'Cause you know that, baby, I...

[Chorus]
I'm your biggest fan
I'll follow you until you love me
Papa-paparazzi
Baby, there's no other superstar you know that I'll be

Baby, you'll be famous
Chase you down until you love me

[Verse 1]
You're always too busy
Why don't you come with me?
Don't act like you don't hear me
Neglected, you're guilty
He noticed no one was with me
I started getting so friendly
He told me I was too pretty
I flirted, I'm guilty

[Pre-Chorus]
I had no reason to lie
I told you a thousand times
I needed you by my side
But you were nowhere to be found

[Chorus]
And you pushed your luck
When you stood me up
Now it's all messed up, forgive me
But you went too far when you broke my heart
I felt: "oh my God", I'm guilty
And if losing you is what I gotta do to satisfy all my needs (satisfy all my needs)
Then I guess that makes me
Guilty

[Verse 2]
Stop pointing the finger
I warned you, you were in danger
It's true, I'm nobody's angel
Convict me, I'm guilty
He worked it so perfect
Not like I did it on purpose
The veredict was worth it
He kissed me, I'm guilty

I had no reason to lie
I told you a thousand times
I needed you by my side
But you were nowhere to be found

[Chorus]
And you pushed your luck (yeah, you)
When you stood me up
Now it's all messed up, forgive me
But you went too far when you broke my heart
I felt: "oh my God", I'm guilty
And if losing you is what I gotta do to satisfy all my needs (satisfy all my needs)
Then I guess that makes me guilty
And you pushed your luck
When you stood me up
Now it's all messed up, forgive me
But you went too far when you broke my heart
I felt: "oh my God", I'm guilty
And if losing you is what I gotta do to satisfy all my needs (satisfy all my needs)
Then I guess that makes me
Guilty
Guilty (ty-ty-ty-ty)

[Bridge]
I'm done cryin', I did nothing wrong
That's why I decided to sing you this song about
Love making, girl's heart's breaking
I was out weeping and screaming, it wasn't faking
(So good, it wasn't the plan)
(My God!, it's out of my hands)
How do you sit there and say I'm filthy
When you're the one who made me guilty?

[Chorus]
And you pushed your luck
When you stood me up
Now it's all messed up, forgive me
But you went too far when you broke my heart
I felt: "oh my God", I'm guilty
And if losing you is what I gotta do to satisfy all my needs (to satisfy all my needs)
Then I guess that makes me guilty
And you pushed your luck
When you stood me up
Now it's all messed up, forgive me
But you went too far when you broke my heart
I felt: "oh my God", I'm guilty
And if losing you is what I gotta do to satisfy all my needs (to satisfy all my needs)
Then I guess that makes me guilty
Guilty (guilty, guilty, guilty)

[Verse 1]
Drown my sorrows in this bottle
Won't like wakin' up tomorrow
I'm the only one that cares about myself
And you don't need me like I need you
So if I go, maybe I'll free you
But I'll be lost, to tell the truth, I need your help
And even you can't fix my problems
Like you once did, I'm too hollow
I can't talk to you no more and I can't tell
If it's me or if it's you, 'cause
You don't even pick up my calls no more
I'm drunk and left alone with all my thoughts

[Chorus]
So maybe, maybe I'm drivin' me crazy
Maybe it's me and it's not you
I'm not too good at admitting when I fuck up
But maybe, maybe it's you who can save me
I got love for you, but I hate me
So maybe there's no way to change me
So maybe, maybe I'm drivin' me crazy
Maybe it's me and it's not you
I'm not too good at admitting when I fuck up
But maybe, maybe it's you who could save me
I got love for you, but I hate me
So maybe there's no way to change me, yeah

[Verse 2]
No way that I'll ever change
So I'm down to lay down next to my brain
I said I'm okay, but no way
It's more than I can take
And there's no one to blame but me
No need to wait for me
Why do you pick me up just to break me?
That's what you say to me
Why do you play with me?
You won't ever understand

[Chorus]
So maybe, maybe I'm drivin' me crazy
Maybe it's me and it's not you
I'm not too good at admitting when I fuck up
But maybe, maybe it's you who can save me
I got love for you, but I hate me
So maybe there's no way to change me
So maybe, maybe I'm drivin' me crazy
Maybe it's me and it's not you
I'm not too good at admitting when I fuck up
But maybe, maybe it's you who could save me
I got love for you, but I hate me
So maybe there's no way to change me
(And you don't know)
You've got me climbing up a mountain nowhere, baby
And swimming down an ocean of Hell
You've got me 

[ad-libbed lyrics]
(Ah, sorry, you can leave it going)

You've got me climbing up a mountain to nowhere
You've got me swimming in an ocean of Hell
You've got me 

[ad-libbed lyrics]
'Cause when you break hearts, you do it well

[Ad-libbed lyrics]
And if you cared about me, I couldn't tell
Somethin' bout you is 

[?] the devil
'Cause when you break hearts, you do it well
You do it well
You do it well
You do it well
You do it well

[Verse]
Why'd you have to leave, why'd you have to go?
Why you never call I'll never know
Don't you know these scars never, ever healed
Ooh, since you said goodbye
Underneath the smile that I like to wear
I am still a mess, you're unaware
And I just play the fool while you play around
Ooh, since you said goodbye

[Chorus]
Why'd you have to cut me off, my dear?
Why'd you have to poof and disappear?
All that's left for me is memories
A broken heart and Hennessy
Legendary producer Quincy Jones talks about historical meeting between Michael Jackson and Prince, the making of Bad the short film, and one of the tracks Streetwalker did not make the album.

[Quincy Jones]
Michael was saying "Let's go" you know, and so we started, like as usual, he goes on the studio, he starts a lot of stuff, you know, those hundreds of tapes and stuff like that, you know, and it was great. And this is the one where I asked to write all the tunes, and I can see him just drawing as an artist and understand the production and all that stuff. Bad was conceived, I wanted to do it with Prince, you know, It would've been great, man, really well, you know, it's just for drama, man, you know how it fights as two of them, you know. I have a video with him coming to kick Michael's ass and says "Your butt is mine", you know, I mean, that's what it's written for, you know, to do that, and I set up the meeting with Prince and Michael, this is the historical night, Prince finally said "You don't need me, to be honest", and I'm like "It will be him without me", you know. And I remember when we finished, I called Martin Scorsese, he was in the
The song you're about to hear, "Fly Away", was originally recorded during the Bad album sessions. The song was cut from the final selection of tracks.

You're stuck in the middle (Yeah, yeah)
And the pain is thunder (Yeah, yeah)

[Verse 1]
I took my baby to the doctor with a fever
But nothin' he found
By the time this hit the street
They said she had a breakdown
Someone's always tryin'
To start my baby cryin'
Talkin', squealin', lyin'
Sayin' you just want to be startin' somethin'

[Chorus]
I said you wanna be startin' somethin'
You got to be startin' somethin'
I said you wanna be startin' somethin'
You got to be startin' somethin'
It's too high to get over (Yeah, yeah)
You're too low to get under (Yeah, yeah)
You're stuck in the middle (Yeah, yeah)
And the pain is thunder (Yeah, yeah)
It's too high to get over (Yeah, yeah)
You're too low to get under (Yeah, yeah)
You're stuck in the middle (Yeah, yeah)
And the pain is thunder (Yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2]
Billie Jean is always talkin' when nobody else is talkin'
Tellin' lies and rubbin' shoulders
So they called her mouth a motor
Someone's always tryin'
To keep my baby cryin'
Treacherous, cunnin', declinin'
You got my baby cryin' (Hee)

[Chorus]
I said you wanna be startin' somethin'
You got to be startin' somethin'
I said you wanna be startin' somethin'
You got to be startin' somethin'
It's too high to get over (Yeah, yeah)
You're too low to get under (Yeah, yeah)
You're stuck in the middle (Yeah, yeah)
And the pain is thunder (Yeah, yeah)
It's too high to get over (Yeah, yeah)
You're too low to get under (Yeah, yeah)
You're stuck in the middle (Yeah, yeah)
And the pain is thunder (Yeah, yeah)

[Bridge]
You're a vegetable (You're a vegetable)
You're a vegetable (You're a vegetable)
Still they hate you (Still they hate you)
You're a vegetable (You're a vegetable)
You're just a buffet (You're just a buffet) (You're a vegetable)
You're a vegetable (You're a vegetable)
They eat off of you (They eat off of you) (You're a vegetable)
You're a vegetable, aaow!

[Instrumental Interlude]
(Hee-haw!)

[Verse 3]
If you can't feed your baby (Yeah, yeah)
Then don't have a baby (Yeah, yeah)
And don't think maybe (Yeah, yeah)
If you can't feed your baby (Yeah, yeah)
You'll be always tryin'
To stop that child from cryin'
Hustlin', stealin', lyin'
Now baby's slowly dyin'

[Chorus]
I said you wanna be startin' somethin'
You got to be startin' somethin'
I said you wanna be startin' somethin'
You got to be startin' somethin'
It's too high to get over (Yeah, yeah)
You're too low to get under (Yeah, yeah)
You're stuck in the middle (Yeah, yeah)
And the pain is thunder (Yeah, yeah)
It's too high to get over (Yeah, yeah)
You're too low to get under (Yeah, yeah)
You're stuck in the middle (Yeah, yeah)
And the pain is thunder (Yeah, yeah)

[Bridge]
Lift your head up high and scream out to the world
"I know I am someone," and let the truth unfurl
No one can hurt you now because you know what's true
Yes, I believe in me, so do believe in you

[Verse 1]
Reaching out, across the nighttime
The city winks a sleepless eye
Hear her voice, shake my window
Sweet seducing sighs
Get me out, into the nighttime
Four walls won't hold me tonight
If this town is just an apple
Then let me take a bite

[Chorus]
If they say why (why?), why (why?)
Tell them that it's human nature
Why (why?), why (why?), does he do me that way?
If they say why (why?), why (why?)
Tell them that it's human nature
Why (why?), why (why?), does he do me that way?

[Verse 2]
Reaching out to touch a stranger
Electric eyes are everywhere
See that girl, she knows I'm watching
She likes the way I stare

[Chorus]
If they say why (why?), why (why?)
Tell them that it's human nature
Why (why?), why (why?), does he do me that way?
If they say why (why?), why (why?)
Tell them that it's human nature
Why (why?), why (why?), does he do me that way?

[Bridge]
I like livin' this way
I like lovin' this way
Why? Oh, why?
Why? Oh, why?

[Verse 3]
Reaching out... across the nighttime
The city's heart begins to beat
Reaching out, I touch her shoulder
I'm dreaming of the street

[Chorus]
If they say why (why?), why (why?)
Tell them that it's human nature
Why (why?), why (why?), does he do me that way?
If they say why (why?), why (why?)
Ooh-ooh, tell 'em!
Why, does he do me that way?
If they say why
Cha-da-cha-sha-sha-sha-sha-sha (aah-ah)
Why, does he do me that way?
If they say why (why? why?), why (why? why? why?)
Ooh-ooh, tell 'em!
Why, does he do me that way?
Why? Oh, why?
Why? Oh, why?
Why? Oh, why?

[Verse 1: Michael Jackson]
It's close to midnight
Something evil's lurking in the dark
Under the moonlight
You see a sight that almost stops your heart
You try to scream
But terror takes the sound before you make it
You start to freeze
As horror looks you right between your eyes
You're paralyzed

[Chorus 1: Michael Jackson]
'Cause this is thriller
Thriller night
And no one's gonna save you
From the beast about to strike
Thriller
Thriller night
You're fighting for your life
Inside a killer
Thriller tonight, yeah, ooh, baby, ooh!

[Verse 2: Michael Jackson]
You hear the door slam
And realize there's nowhere left to run
You feel the cold hand
And wonder if you'll ever see the sun
You close your eyes
And hope that this is just imagination
Girl, but all the while
You hear a creature creeping up behind
You're out of time

[Chorus 2: Michael Jackson]
'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
And no one's gonna save you
Against the thing with 40 eyes, girl
(Hoo-hoo-hoo!)
Thriller, thriller night
You're fighting for your life
Inside a killer, thriller, aaow!

[Bridge: Vincent Price]
The foulest stench is in the air
The funk of 40 thousand years
And grisly ghouls from every tomb
Are closing in to seal your doom
And though you fight to stay alive
Your body starts to shiver
For no mere mortal can resist
The evil of the thriller!

[Chorus 3: Michael Jackson]
Thriller, thriller night
And no one's gonna save you
From the thing with 40 eyes, girl
(Hoo-hoo-hoo!)
Thriller, thriller night
You're fighting for your life
Inside a killer, thriller, chiller
Thriller here tonight
Thriller, thriller night
There ain't no second chance
Against the thing with 40 eyes, girl
(Hoo-hoo-hoo!)
Thriller, thriller night
You're fighting for your life
Inside a killer, thriller
Thriller

[Intro]
I just want to lay next to you for a while
Dedicated for this song to all of the people from Japan, for my dear friend, Yoshiaki
Your mouth is so sweet
A lot of people misunderstand me
That's because they don't know me

[Verse 1: Michael & Sheryl]
Each time the wind blows
I hear your voice so
I call your name
Whispers at morning
Our love is dawning
Heaven's glad you came
You know how I feel
This thing can't go wrong
I'm so proud to say I love you
Your love's got me high
I long to get by
This time is forever
Love is the answer
I hear your voice now
You are my choice now
The love you bring
Heaven's in my heart
At your call, I hear harps
And angels sing
You know how I feel
This thing can't go wrong
I can't live my life without you
I just can't hold on
I feel we belong
My life ain't worth living
If I can't be with you

[Chorus: Michael & Both]
I just can't stop loving you
I just can't stop loving you
And if I stop
Then tell me just what will I do
I just can't stop loving you

[Verse 2: Michael & Sheryl & Both]
At night when the stars shine
I pray in you I'll find
A love so true
When morning awakes me
Will you come and take me
I'll wait for you
You know how I feel
I won't stop until
I hear your voice saying, "I do"
"I do"
This thing can't go wrong
This feeling's so strong
Well, my Life ain't worth living
If I can't be with you

[Chorus: Michael & Both]
I just can't stop loving you
I just can't stop loving you
And if I stop
Then tell me just what will I do
I just can't stop loving you

[Bridge: Michael & Sheryl & Both]
We can change all the world tomorrow
We can sing songs of yesterday
I can say, "Hey, Farewell" to sorrow
This is my life and I
Want to see you for always

[Chorus: Both]
I just can't stop loving you (No, baby)
I just can't stop loving you
And if I stop
Then tell me just what will I do (What will I do?)
I just can't stop loving you (Oh, my love)
I just can't stop loving you (Oh, my love)
And if I stop
Then tell me just what will I do
I just can't stop loving you (You know I do, girl)
I just can't stop loving you (You know I do)
And if I stop
Then tell me just what will I do

[Outro: Michael & Sheryl]
I just can't stop
I just can't stop
You know, I just can't stop, oh, baby
Oh, I just can't stop
You know I just can't, baby
I just can't, baby
I just can't, baby
I just can't stop loving, loving you
Oh, I just can't stop, no
I just can't stop... loving...... you

[Verse 1]
Under the beauty lies something I can't explain
This ain't a movie, we fall out then we start again
What is the reason that I pull these false alarms?
All I want is to hold you in my arms
Don't make it harder than it really has to be
Take off your armor, one thing I can guarantee
Is I'll be in misery for as long as we're apart
All I want is to hold you in my arms
Hey!

[Chorus]
Everyone knows that I'm a fool without you darling
Everyone knows I'm in the dark (woah)
I don't ever want to see you anyplace but here
Wrapped up just like a present in my arms

[Verse 2]
Who ever knew I'd be the one to beg and plead
Yes, it is true I've done things that I won't repeat
That is the reason that you won't let down your guard
And let me wrap you up inside my arms
My little angel could you please hear me out
I miss the hazel mixed with the green in your eye
What is the reason that all my favorite scars
Came from tryna hold you in my arms

[Chorus]
Everyone knows that I'm a fool without you darling
Everyone knows I'm in the dark (woah)
I don't ever want to see you anyplace but here
Wrapped up just like a present in my arms

[Chorus]
We are just waiting, things changing
I've been so patient, please save me
I think one of y'all have the answers
If you would share them, amazing (Whoa, whoa, whoa)
Do you believe in love? (Whoa, whoa, whoa)
Do you believe in love?
I found a place to vacation
Inside my hallucination
Let's talk, just a conversation
Tell me what got you frustrated? (Whoa, whoa, whoa)
Do you believe in love? (Whoa, whoa, whoa)
Do you believe in love?

[Verse 1]
Yeah, lily pads on the water
Um, rose petals on the ground
Yeah, I been prayin' to the Father
He, pick me up when I'm down
Yeah, think fast or don't think at all
I, drown my sorrows in the alcohol
I, I been lookin' for a job
But there ain't shit around, so I'm leavin' this town tomorrow
With a backpack full of dreams
Bunch of bad bitches that audition for the team
Yeah, she said she could've been a queen
If papa was a doctor and mama wasn't a fiend
In that case, I coulda' been a genius
I'ma start livin' as soon as I find a reason
Yeah, it's a cycle of seasons
Life would be good if Michael was still breathin'
Yeah, God bless the dead
Give me the strength to find sleep when I rest my head
Catch my breath, sex with equestrians
'Cause God ain't shit but a pedestrian
Yeah, lessons learned and words ignored
Stomp your feet, it hurts the floor
The idea was mine, but the words were yours
Baby girl, said the world is yours

[Chorus]
We are just waiting, things changing
I've been so patient, please save me
I think one of y'all have the answers
If you would share them, amazing (Whoa, whoa, whoa)
Do you believe in love? (Whoa, whoa, whoa)
Do you believe in love?
I found a place to vacation
Inside my hallucination
Let's talk, just a conversation
Tell me what got you frustrated? (Whoa, whoa, whoa)
Do you believe in love? (Whoa, whoa, whoa)
Do you believe in love?

[Refrain]
Love is a miracle, my love
Love is a miracle, my love
Love is a miracle, my love
Love is a miracle, my love
Oh my god, oh my god
Oh my god, oh my god
Oh my god, oh my god
Oh my god, oh my god

[Verse 2]
Yeah, well, drownin' in the universe around us
We were far away, never found us
I been thinkin', drinkin', thinkin', doin'
Life is so much more, let's keep it movin'
Look at all the dreams that we pursuin'
Step into my life and leave it ruined
Freedom sings a song, it's out of tune and
Try to follow along
They, told us a lot of rules, all of them wrong
She don't love you no more, then you got to move on
Hold on to them lies she tells
How have you been, can you find yourself?
Lost in equation, a lot of frustration
Mind racin', time wastin', I’m facin'
Yeah, this a mirror with a fist up
Right trigger, A-B, uppercut, kick, punch

[Chorus]
We are just waiting, things changing
I've been so patient, please save me
I think one of y'all have the answers
If you would share them, amazing (Whoa, whoa, whoa)
Do you believe in love? (Whoa, whoa, whoa)
Do you believe in love?
I found a place to vacation
Inside my hallucination
Let's talk, just a conversation
Tell me what got you frustrated? (Whoa, whoa, whoa)
Do you believe in love? (Whoa, whoa, whoa)
Do you believe in love?

[Verse 1]
You want a love to last forever
One that will never fade away
I wanna help you with your problem
Stick around, I say

[Chorus]
Coming up, coming up
Coming up like a flower
Coming up, I say

[Verse 2]
You want a friend you can rely on
One who will never fade away
And if you're searching for an answer
Stick around, I say

[Chorus]
Coming up, coming up
Coming up like a flower
Coming up, yeah

[Verse 3]
You want some peace and understanding
So everybody can be free
I know that we can get together
We can make it, stick with me

[Chorus]
Coming up, coming up
Coming up like a flower
Coming up

[Bridge]
Coming up, coming up

[Chorus]
Coming up, coming up, I say
Coming up like a flower
Coming up
Feel it in my bones

[Verse 4]
You want a better kind of future
One that everyone can share
You're not alone, we all could use it
Stick around, we're nearly there

[Chorus]
Coming up, coming up
Coming up like a flower
Coming up, for all to share
Coming up, yeah
Coming up any way
Coming up like a flower
Coming up

[Backing vocals]
Ooh, ah
Ooh, ah
Aaaah, ah
Ooh, ah

[Verse 1]
So ya
Thought ya
Might like to go to the show
To feel the warm thrill of confusion
That space cadet glow

[Verse 2]
I got some bad news for you, sunshine
Pink isn't well
He stayed back at the hotel
And they sent us along as a surrogate band
Where gonna find out were you fans really stand

[Verse 3]
Are there any pooves in the theater tonight?
Get them up against the wall
There's one in the spotlight, he don't look right to me
Get him up against the wall
And that one looks Jewish!
And that one's a coon!
Who let all of this riffraff into the room?
There's one smoking a joint!
And another with spots!
If I had my way, I'd have all of you shot!

[Verse 1]
Don't wanna be forward
Don't wanna cross a line
But if I were to crash in this plane tonight
I'd want you to know this

[Verse 2]
Don't wanna say too much
Intrude on your space
But if I were to crash and I never made it home
I'd want you to know this

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, and to tell you is too scary
So I'll just say something else
And I wish that you could hear me
When I talk to myself
But this plane might not land safely
So what the hell do I have to lose?
If I just tell you

[Chorus]
I wanna eat pancakes for dinner
I wanna get stuck in your head
I wanna watch a TV show together
And when we're under the weather we can watch it in bed
I wanna go out on the weekends
I wanna dress up just to get undressed
I think that I should probably tell you this in case there is an accident
And I never see you again
So please save all your questions for the end
And maybe I'll be brave enough by then

[Verse 3]
Don't wanna say something wrong
Don't wanna be weird
But if you're still in love with her, I think that I'll leave it there
And I won't ever tell you this

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, 'cause to tell you is too scary
So I'll just say something else
Like how was fall semester
And what was that song about?
I'll try to hide the way I feel
But I'll just wanna shout
What do I have to lose right now?

[Chorus]
I wanna eat pancakes for dinner
I wanna get stuck in your head
I wanna watch a TV show together
And when we're under the weather we can watch it in bed
I wanna go out on the weekends
I wanna dress up just to get undressed
I think that I should probably tell you this in case there is an accident
And I never see you again
So please save all your questions for the end
And maybe I'll be brave enough by then

[Outro]
Or maybe I won't ever say what's in my head
No, I won't have to say anything
You'll say it instead

[Verse]
When you wish upon a star, makes no difference who you are
Anything your heart desires will come to you
If your heart is in your dream, no request is too extreme
When you wish upon a star as dreamers do

[Verse]
3:15 and the bell starts a ringing
The girls start walking home from school
3:15 and the bell keeps on a ringing
Everything starts getting cool

[Pre-Chorus]
It's so hard to walk home
When you're walking alone
I slow down in my car and I pull to the curb

[Chorus]
Lazy Lizzy
I saw you walking alone
Lazy Lizzy
I saw you walking alone

[Verse]
3:15 and the bell starts a ringing
The girls start walking home from school
3:15 and the bell keeps on a ringing
Everything starts getting cool

[Pre-Chorus]
It's so hard to walk home
When you're walking alone
I slow down in my car and I pull to the curb

[Chorus]
Lazy Lizzy
I saw you walking alone
Lazy Lizzy
I saw you walking alone
Lazy Lizzy
I saw you walking alone
Lazy Lizzy
I saw you walking alone
Lazy Lizzy
I saw you walking alone
Lazy Lizzy
I saw you walking alone

[Bridge]
It's so hard to walk home
(Whispering)
It's okay
When you're walking alone
(Whispering)

[Verse]
3:15 and the bell starts a ringing
The girls start walking home from school
3:15 and the bell keeps on a ringing

[Chorus]
Lazy Lizzy
I saw you walking alone
Lazy Lizzy
I saw you walking alone
Lazy Lizzy
I saw you walking alone
Lazy Lizzy
I saw you walking alone
Oooo step back look back look up dont be the one whos dumb step back lock back look up dont be dumb ooo  im the one yeah im the one

[Verse 1]
I don't always wake up in the mornin'
Pour myself a strong one
Aw, but when I get lonely I do
Your memory gets burnin'
Lean back on the bourbon
Sure as hell can't keep leanin' on you

[Pre-Chorus]
Looks like I'm learnin' the hard way again
It's all my fault
Yeah, I dropped the ball
You're gone and I'm gone three sheets to the wind
Thinkin' 'bout all I've wasted on you

[Chorus]
All of this time and all of this money
All of the these sorries I don't owe you honey
All of these miles on this Chevy, and prayers in a pew
All them days I spent, wasted on you
Wasted on you

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I swore this one'd be different
My heart wouldn't listen to my head and these boots on my feet
Looks like I'm learning the hard way again
That's why I've been wasted on you

[Chorus]
All of this time and all of this money
All these sorries I don't owe you, honey
All of these miles on this Chevy and prayers in a pew
All them days I spent, wasted on you
Wasted on you

[Bridge]
Like this pile of your stuff that's packed up in the back
Right down to the flame of this match
Wasted on you, wasted on you
Wasted on you, wasted on you
Wasted on you

[Chorus]
All of this time and all of this money
All these sorries I don't owe you, honey
All of these miles on this Chevy and prayers in a pew
All them days I spent, wasted on you
Wasted on you

[Outro]
Wasted on you, wasted on you

So don't you fight it
So don't you fight it

[Verse 1]
I always get it wrong
I leave the ones I love
There's something in my brain
That pushes you away
I wish I could rewind
And live a moment twice
I threw it all away
But I still feel that

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't leave me now, don't leave me now
I need you to stay
I'm fallin' down, I'm fallin' down
I'm broken and bent
Don't leave me now, don't leave me now
I promise I'll change, I'll do anything
Don't throw me away

[Chorus 1]
Photographs turn old and dusty
Roses rot, but memories never fade
You are the one that I die for
You are the one that I die for

[Verse 2]
I think about your heart
And how I broke it up
I always will regret
The secrets that I kept
I'm sorry that I lied
I never tried to fight
Don't get no second chance
I really wish I'd say

[Chorus 2]
People come and people pass by
Like the seasons, life will always change
You are the one that I die for
You are the one that I die for
Photographs turn old and dusty
Roses rot, but memories never fade
You are the one that I die for
You are the one that I die for

[Bridge]
Ahh-ahh-ohh-ohh (I'd die for you)
Ahh-ahh-ohh-ohh (I'd die for you)
Ahh-ahh-ohh-ohh (I'd die for you)
Ahh-ahh-ohh-ohh (I'd die for you)
Ahh-ahh-ohh-ohh
Ahh-ahh-ohh-ohh
You are the one that I die for
You are the one that I die for

[Outro]
People come and people pass by
Like the seasons, life will always change
You are the one that I die for
You are the one that I die for
People come and people pass by
Like the seasons, life will always change
You are the one that I die for
You are the one that I die for
Photographs turn old and dusty
Roses rot, but memories never fade
You are the one that I die for
You are the one that I die for
You are the one that I die for

[Verse]
Don't you forget to remember
Me when nothing's going right
I will be there when you need me
Call me any day, any night, hey
Lean on me when you get weary
Lean on me when you get hurt
Don't you worry about nothin'
I will wipe the dirt from your shirt

[Chorus]
'Cause when the whole thing feels like darkness
When it all turns out so bleak
When there's no on left to turn to
Don't forget to remember me
Don't forget to remember me

[Verse 1]
Yeah, nothin' is impossible
Do this shit together, we unstoppable
Raised to be a leader, not a navigator
Wrote this down on scraps of paper
All roads lead to the same confusion
I mean, all roads lead to the same conclusions
Found my body somewhere in the sewer
My girl defined the word "prolific" for me
And I can't read her mind, she wrote a different story
Oh well, redemption is a funny bitch
The devil always be right where the money is
Somebody gotta be watchin' you, but no one is
It's kinda crazy life could be this simple
Nothing's coincidence
My best friend packed his things, threw 'em in the car
I haven't seen him since
Guess I understand, he always got the chills
When he saw a room full of rolled up hundred dollar bills
Yeah

[Refrain]
Even pills turn to powder, baby
Said, even pills turn to powder
The world wanna crush 'em down
Even pills turn to powder, baby
Can you, sit right next to me and crush 'em down?
If pills can turn to powder
Then this world could turn to ash
Everything seems so slow
But my past, thought that it would last longer
I just thought that, thought that, thought that
This feelin', this feelin' would last longer
Yeah

[Bridge]
Oo-oo-oo-oo-ooh
Oo-oo-ooh
Oo-oo-oo-ooh
Oo-oo-ooh
Oo-oo-oo-ooh
Oo-oo-oo-ooh

[Verse 2]
Yeah, yeah
Somebody gave me a treasure map
Nowhere on that motherfucker say where the X is at
Now I wanna screw the whole world through a telecast
Been waitin' my whole life, I finally thought I should tell you that
Yeah
Started smokin' weed again, started tryna read again
Clean myself up, now would you be my friend?
Do I need to know the beginning to see the end?
What's the difference 'tween the truth and things that we pretend?
I lie awake faded, watch the days go by
And only at the lows do I chase that high
Fear God, stay humble
Original sin, we all come from the same struggle

[Outro]
Whatcha gonna do when the money comin' slow?
Whatcha gonna do when the money comin' slow?
Whatcha gonna do when the money comin' slow
And you left out on your own?
Whatcha gonna do when the money comin' slow?
Whatcha gonna do when the money comin' slow?
Whatcha gonna do when the money comin' slow
And you left out in the cold? Woah
Can I get four Norcos
Two Oxys, two Roxys, three methadone
Couple Percocets, some heroin
Two Xanax bars and six-ounces of that lean?
Thank you
—Do when the money comin' slow?
Whatcha gonna do when the money comin' slow?
Whatcha gonna do when the money comin' slow?
Whatcha gonna do when the money comin' slow?
Whatcha gonna do when the money comin' slow?
Woah-oh, woah-oh
Whatcha gonna do?

[Intro: Mac Miller]
Bob's dementia
Chapter one
Now here lies a great man, a man of the people
A man of the people, people (Yeah, oh)

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Yeah, here he comes, it's the highly unprofessional
Hyper sexual, intellectual
Fried my brain, now I've become a vegetable
Travel with a gang of weird lookin' extraterrestrials (Mi-mi-mi-mi)
They left me on their ship and made their bitches call me "General"
The dick quake could make a bitch shake like she got Parkinson's
You out there politickin', I'm studyin' Darwinism (God)
I keep some bars and hit 'em like a hard collision (Bang)
Don't fuck around it's murder in this art exhibit
And I got the whole game on paralyzed 'cause my volume on amplified
It's slow as a biracial bitch that's waitin' on her hair to dry (I don't wanna go yet)
Are you prepared to die? Burnin' this Ameri-fry
Where people that protect you are the ones that have you terrified
I only act this way 'cause my soul so broken
I'm the illest that you know, you a low dose Motrin
Laryngitis, hepatitis, the AIDS virus
I guess that's what you get from bein' 'round a bunch of rat vaginas
And you (And you), you pussy I wouldn't fuck with, a drunk dick
The day I came back from being hostage to the Russian mob
Missin' a finger and see my brother shot (Pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa)
I'm comin' for your neck, so hide your head inside your mother's box (Motherfucker)
It still ain't cliche to say, "Fuck the cops" (No)
Let's try it ("Fuck the cops")
'Cause I just smoked a bunch of rocks and walked around in just my socks
And made myself a birthday cake with caramel and butterscotch

[Bridge: Mac Miller, Hodgy & Mac Miller & Hodgy]
Tasty, tasty, that shit is tasty
This shit is tasty
Nigga, smoke

[Verse 2: Hodgy]
We servin' faster than the Chinese
This life carries a price cheaper than clown feet
Like prostitutes with hoops and combined weaves
Who hates herself inside
So she sellin' her punani by umami (ooh mind me?)
It's like my soul's inside the bowl
I hold it close, 'cause I don't know when it's my time to go
I'm blindin' fold, I hear my son laughing and time is froze
And he knows it, lookin' at me like "That's my pops," and I'm his goal, nigga
Motherfucker, I hit pockets, pickpockets
I'll beat you for your keys, bubblegum, and your bitch wallet
To his product, I'm a prodigy of a dead nigga
No name droppin', scribin' when nobody was dead meat when they came flockin'
Brain doctorin', where I left my hard dates
Small shakes and small dates, the ones I only call late in parlay
You know what the dark say, grab a bitch by the paw, ayy
Her name's Autumn, she happens to be fallin' on the wrong day

[Outro: Mac Miller, Hodgy & Mac Miller & Hodgy]
Nigga, tasty (Tasty), tasty
Tasty, that shit is tasty
That shit is tasty
Tasty, tasty, tasty, tasty

[Verse 1]
White churches, black churches
Different people, same hearses
It's kinda hard to fight with each other
Layin' down in the ground six under

[Pre-Chorus]
At every show I see my people
They ain't the same, but they're all equal
One love, one God, one family

[Chorus]
You're missing every color if you're only seeing black and white
Tell me how you're gonna change your mind if your heart's unmovable
We ain't that different from each other, from one to another
I look around and see worldwide beautiful

[Refrain]
Thank God, thank God, thank God
Thank God, thank God, thank God
Oh, thank God, thank God, thank God
Thank God, thank God, thank God

[Verse 2]
Coast to coast, city to city
Reach out your hands if you're with me
Still got some work but we still got a dream
Every shade, every heart, come together and sing

[Refrain]
Oh, thank God, thank God, thank God
Thank God, thank God, thank God (Woo)

[Chorus]
You're missing every color if you're only seeing black and white
Tell me how you're gonna change your mind if your heart's unmovable
We ain't that different from each other, from one to another
I look around and see worldwide beautiful

[Interlude]
One love, one God, one family (One family y'all, come on)
One love, one God, one family
One love, one God, one family (Worldwide beautiful)
One love, one God, one family (Sing it with me)

[Chorus]
You're missing every color if you're only seeing black and white
Tell me how you're gonna change your mind if your heart's unmovable (We're not that different)
We ain't that different from each other from one to another, I
Look around and see worldwide beautiful
Look around and see worldwide beautiful (So beautiful)
Look around and see worldwide beautiful
Worldwide beautiful (Worldwide beautiful)
Look around and see worldwide beautiful

Got water like Niagara Falls
I'ma come through and put brain on your wall
Turn that bitch up and Versace her draws
Smoke me some trees and it's stuffed in with logs (Woo)

[Verse 1]
Never knew how much I love you
Never knew how much I care
When you put your arms around me
I get a fever that's so hard to bear

[Chorus]
You give me fever
When you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever in the morning
Fever all through the night

[Verse 2]
Sun lights up the daytime
Moon lights up the night
I light up when you call my name
And you know I wanna treat you right

[Chorus]
You give me fever
When you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever in the morning
Fever all through the night

[Verse 3]
Everybody's got the fever
That is something you all know
Fever isn't such a new thing
Fever started long ago

[Verse 4]
Romeo loved Juliet
Juliet felt the same
When he put his arms around her
He said to Julie: Baby, you're my flame
You givest fever
When we kisseth
Fever with my flamin' youth
Fever, I'm on fire
Fever yeah, I burn forsooth

[Verse 5]
Captain Smith and Pocahontas
Had a very mad affair
When her daddy tried to kill him
She says: My daddy, oh don't you dare
He gives me fever
With his kisses
Fever when he holds me tight
Fever, I'm his Mrs
Daddy, won't you treat him right?

[Verse 6]
Now you've listened to my story
Here's the point that I have made
Cats were born to give chicks fever
Be it Fahrenheit or Centigrade
We're givin' ya fever
When we kiss ya
Fever if you live and learn
Fever, till you sizzle
What a lovely way to burn
What a lovely way to burn
What a lovely way to burn
What a lovely way to burn
What a lovely way to burn

[Outro]
You give me fever
Catch the fever
Catch the fever

[Intro]

[Intro: Donald Trump]
What do you have to lose?
You're living in poverty
Your schools are no good
You have no jobs
58% of your youth is unemployed
What the hell do you have to lose?

[Refrain: Meek Mill]
Reportin' live from the other side of America

[Verse 1]
Mama let me sip the forty, I was just a shorty (Damn)
Then I started spittin' godly, then they said 'record me'
I feel like this shit was for me, this shit just my story (Facts)
Yeah, uh
Jumped off the porch, uh
I got a Porsche, won't take it back
I'm on the block with the killers and holdin' my own, of course (Yeah, check, check)
I seen my mom and dad separate, ain't talkin' divorce (Talkin' divorce)
Said daddy was livin' by the fire, and he died by the torch (Check, check)
I'm where the AKs is, we like the Bébé's Kids
Ain't have a daddy, I listened to suckas the same way that Ray Ray did
I'm totin' Smith &'s and HKs and I just was a grade A kid
Ain't have no guidance, we grew up with hitters and did everything they said
Point out the block, we spinnin' that (Spinnin')
Run in the spot, we gettin' that (Get it)
Give us some work, we flippin' that (Flippin')
I'm hittin' from jail, they ain't hittin' back
I need a lawyer, money for commissary, and nobody ain't sendin' that
I'm in my cell like, "When I get out, I'm makin' a movie, no Cinemax" (Woo)
Yeah, back home and I'm fresh on bail
Phone chirpin', it was next to Tell
Block poppin', it was extra sales
Big dogs, they ain't showin' remorse
I was beggin' just to catch a sale
Same block, we was goin' to war
I was prayin' I ain't catch a shell (Check)

[Chorus]
Uh, we was starvin' for a thousand nights
Livin' like we tryna die tonight
Glock .40 sound like dynamite
I was fuckin' up my cop money
Sellin' soap like it's China white
OG's said, "You fuckin' the block up"
I was mad, I was tryna fight
Nigga, we hungry
Mama at work, daddy, he dead, nigga we lonely
Stomach growlin' like a AMG, goin' to bed, we hungry
Uzi on me, all my friends are dead, nigga, we lonely
Reportin' live from the other side of America

[Verse 2]
Reportin' live from the other side (Yeah)
Same corner where my brothers died (Yeah)
Livin' life, we ain't got a care
Told my mama I ain't dyin' here (No)
.40 on me, I ain't buyin' beer (No)
Ain't have a will, now I'm flyin' Lear
Bunch of felons on the jet with me
Make a movie like it's Con Air
Started off in the basement
Now it's rooftops and LeBron there
Still fightin' open cases
Out on bail, nigga, but it's my year
Summertime, it get cold out
Heater on me like a Moncler
Closet bigger than my old house
Thinkin' 'bout it, I was fine there
Came out the dirt (Dirt)
Dedicated, I was makin' it work
Medicated, I was takin' them Percs
Devastated when my niggas got murked
Educated, had to get to it first
I knew trappin', it would get me in jail
Playin' with pistols, it would get me a hearse
But I ain't give a fuck, send me to church (Woo)
Yeah, they gotta catch me in traffic (Traffic)
I ain't with none of this rap shit (Rap shit)
I've been tryna run from these caskets
All this pain built in me, nigga
You don't want none of this action
Go get some money and feed your fam
'Cause this is a fuckin' disaster, yeah

[Chorus]
Uh, we was starvin' for a thousand nights
Livin' like we tryna die tonight
Glock .40 sound like dynamite
I was fuckin' up my cop money
Sellin' soap like it's China white
OG's said, "You fuckin' the block up"
I was mad, I was tryna fight
Nigga, we hungry
Mama at work, daddy, he dead, nigga we lonely
Stomach growlin' like a AMG, goin' to bed, we hungry
Uzi on me, all my friends are dead, nigga, we lonely
Reportin' live from the other side of America

[Outro: Meek Mill & Michael Smercornish]
I always dreamed too, of being like, on like CNN and being able to like express myself
And, and, and speak for like the voiceless young men of America (Do it)
The first step, I would say, I grew up in America in a ruthless neighborhood where we were not protected by police, uh
We grew up in ruthless environments, we grew up around murder, you see murder
You see seven people die a week, I think you would probably carry a gun yourself
Would you?
Uh, yeah, I probably would

[Intro]
Hmm
I just gotta get some things off my chest
Tough times, I hope y'all holdin' up
We'll be aight 'cause we always is
But I'm feelin' like this

[Chorus]
How many mothers have to cry?
How many brothers gotta die?
How many more times?
How many more times?
How many more marches?
How many more signs?
How many more lives?
How many more times?

[Verse 1]
Take a look around, can you see it now?
Don't be colorblind, 'cause when they're killin' mine
They'll try to justify it
Oh each and every time
Playin' in a park, takin' your jog
Sittin' on the couch, in your own house
Never seem to matter what we do
You think we don't matter, but we do
You got a problem, 'cause the city on fire
But you quiet when niggas die
Let the soul up out that body that we buried
You with God now you no longer have to worry
It's so hard to sing these words out loud
All these beautiful, precious black lives
Lost in the name of senseless white pride
Tears fallin' from my eyes

[Chorus]
How many mothers have to cry?
How many brothers gotta die?
How many more times?
How many more times?
How many more marches?
How many more signs?
How many more lives?
How many more times?

[Verse 2]
Tell me how can you be quiet?
You know the language of the unheard, is a riot
All we ever see from you is violence (True)
You know you ain't no better if you silent
You talking 'bout the city on fire (Oh, oh)
Where your rage when my people die?
We ain't slaves, let my people fly (Oh, yeah)
Now it's time, watch my people rise

[Chorus]
How many mothers have to cry? (Ooh, how?)
How many brothers gotta die? (Ooh, how?)
How many more times? (Ooh, how?)
How many more times? (How many times?)
How many more marches? (Ooh, how?)
How many more signs? (Ooh, how?)
How many more lives? (Ooh, how?)
How many more times? (How many times?)
How many mothers have to cry? (Tell me? Ooh, how?)
How many brothers gotta die? (Tell me? Ooh, how?)
How many more times? (Oh no, ooh, how?)
How many more times? (How many times?)
How many more marches? (All across the world, ooh, how?)
How many more signs? (Woah, oh, oh, ooh, how?)
How many more lives? (Shame I gotta ask, ooh, how?)
How many more times? (How many times?)
I'll leave you with that (Yes, yeah)

[Intro]
Oh my (I can't hear anything)
Oh me, oh my
Yeah
Muah!
I told myself I'd never do cocaine, I told myself I'd never do cocaine
I told myself I'd never do cocaine, I told myself I'd never
Okay, yeah

[Verse 1]
I never leave the house without a rain coat, it's fatal
The eye of the storm is tryna tango (Tango)
When I say "Go," race me to my gravestone (Gravestone)
Welcome to the late show
A true loner, carryin' a bolder on my shoulders like it's nothin'
I'm comin' from deception and seduction
Buggin', hallucinogenic druggin' through customs
Wonderin' what's life without destruction
I'm a functionin' drug user
The feelin' that run through ya
You wanna be numb, do ya?
Somethin' that fuck you up (Fuck you up)
I told y'all I ain't a role model (Role model)
First you lose your mind, then your soul follows (Soul follows)
Full throttle through the city, dodgin' pot holes
I want no trouble, I'm just tryna find the crossroads
I'm awful, when I die, bury me in fossil
Bury me in polo with a hundred in my nostril (Nostril)
My motto is, "Fuck tomorrow"
Only God knows I'm not home
Probably sellin' drugs inside a Costco
Watch close, optical illusions and complex wit
Don't get tricked, the head trip will turn into a death wish
The high is deceptive
The mind playin' Tetris, follow signs to the exit
Hexes for my exes, I'm savin' them from the wreckage
Confession, all my regrets
I just hope I get into Heaven, I'm gone
Stood before death when he told me, "You are next"
Waitin' 'til the storm gets gorgeous
Then the Lord said from his '62 Corvette
"I'll see you when I see you," that's a sure bet (Sure bet)
I'll still be here sittin' on my porch steps (Porch steps)
Bumpin' Alanis Morissette
Do it big as Neil Diamond's forehead
I'm havin' more sex than a porn set, sinner
Lights dimmer, I'm a wizard
Hit Pittsburgh for the winter
Get trapped inside a blizzard, damn
It's Larry Fisher, man (Man)
Here he go with this again (Here he go with this again)

[Verse 2]
A new day with the same high (Same high)
Nothin' on the agenda, I'm watchin' paint dry (Paint dry)
It's okay to waste time, go and take five (Take five)
Not in over my head, I'm just waist high (Waist high)
I pray to God I can fall asleep
Sick of these annoyin' talkative sheep
A bunch of hustlin' llamas sellin' me fleece
Hopin' the gyro taste better in Greese (It's pronounced giro)
My dad told me I'm a werido
I told him, "Shut up, I'm a fuckin' superhero!"
When I grow up, I hope I'm Robert De Niro
Except Hov would pick the phone up
Worry 'cause I love coke so much
Well, now my nose sucks
I still pour up in the soda
I guess it make me think I'm Yoda, uh
Hit the red carpet in a toga
Piece of paper and a ticonderoga
I just wanna put my dick in Omarosa
And say she fired unless she make me a mimosa

[Outro]
That shit better be good too, bitch
That shit better be good too, bitch
That shit better get me drunk too, bitch
Better cover that shit with two lips
I ain't talkin' 'bout the flower, I'm talkin' 'bout your mouth
Just give me the power, woo!
This my house, I don't shower, and I wear a blouse
Change every hour

[Verse 1]
Someday, I'm gonna live
In your house up on the hill
And when your skinhead neighbor goes missing
I'll plant a garden in the yard, then
They're gluing roses on a flatbed
You should see it, I mean thousands
I grew up here, 'til it all went up in flames
Except the notches in the door frame

[Chorus]
I don't know when you got taller
See our reflection in the water
Off a bridge at the Huntington
I hopped the fence when I was seventeen
Then I knew what I wanted

[Verse 2]
And when I grow up, I'm gonna look up
From my phone and see my life
And it's gonna be just like my recurring dream
I'm at the movies, I don't remember what I'm seeing
The screen turns into a tidal wave
Then it's a dorm room, like a hedge maze
And when I find you
You touch my leg, and I insist
But I wake up before we do it

[Chorus]
I don't know how, but I'm taller
Must be something in this water
It's what I use in our garden
You don't have to know that it's haunted
The doctor put her hands over my liver
She told me my resentment's getting smaller
Yeah, she said I'm getting stronger
I get everything I want
I have everything I wanted

[Verse 1]
Day off in Kyoto
Got bored at the temple
Looked around at the 7-Eleven
The band took the speed train
Went to the arcade
I wanted to go, but I didn't
You called me from a payphone
They still got payphones
It costs a dollar a minute
To tell me you're getting sober
You wrote me a letter
And I don't have to read it

[Chorus]
I'm gonna kill you
If you don't beat me to it
Dreaming through Tokyo skies
I wanted to see the world
Then I flew over the ocean
And I changed my mind

[Verse 2]
Sunset's been a freak show
On the weekend, so
I've been driving out to the suburbs
To park at the old mill
And stare at the chem trails
Hang out with my little brother
He said you called on his birthday
You were off by like ten days
But you get a few points for tryin'

[Chorus]
I don't forgive you
But please don't keep me to it
Born under Scorpio skies
I wanted to see the world
Through your eyes and then it happened
Then I changed my mind
I changed my mind

[Outro]
I'm a liar
I lied
I'm a liar

[Verse 1]
Laying down on the lawn
I'm tired of trying to get in the house
I'm thinking out loud
I've been playing dead
My whole life
And I get this feeling whenever I feel good
It'll be the last time

[Refrain]
But I feel something when I see you now
I feel something when I see you

[Verse 2]
If you're a work of art
I'm standing too close
I can see the brush strokes
I hate your mom
I hate it when she opens her mouth
It's amazing to me how much you can say
When you don't know what you're talking about

[Refrain]
But I feel something when I see you now
I feel something when I see you

[Verse 3]
I used to light you up
Now I can't even get you to play the drums
'Cause I don't know what I want
Until I fuck it up

[Refrain]
I feel something when I see you now
I feel something

[Outro]
I'll climb through the window again
But right now, it feels good not to stand
Then I'll leave it wide open
Let the dystopian morning light pour in

[Intro]
Uh, there, turn my mic on so I can hear me a lil' bit
Nonstop on life, gon' survive
It's in our plan to survive
Sunlight and love in the sunshine
Yeah, I plant the seed on the vine
We pray our family will survive
And grow to be strong in the sunshine
And grow to be strong in the sunshine
We give the love on the soil
Nothing there now can't be spoiled
Nothing of our sunshine
Now, we be getting a little sunshine
If my lovin', duh, nah, nah, no, no, no, no, nah
No, no, no, nuh, fah, nah, no, my, my, my, my

[Chorus]
We plant the thorns in the vine
We know we are all the vine
Now, all we need is sunshine
All we need is sunshine

[Verse 1]
See, I said "We plant the"—
We say "We plant the seed in the vine" because we are the vine
Not "de-vine", because that means void of the vine
We are the vine, we are the root

[Chorus]
We plant the seed in the vine
Now all we need is sunshine
We plant the seed in the vine
Now all we need, my
In the vine

[Verse 2]
As we had the seed, we put the stronger soil around us
To make sure that we would grow in the mind
Once we have the stronger soil with the most nutrients, all we need is a little sunshine
You know, some exposure, you don't need to keep your kids
We— we don't need to keep our kids closed in and indoors
We need that exposure, we need that sunshine
But as long as they have a planet with the best soil around them
And not to spoil around them, and not too all around them
I got somethin' bumpin' all around them, got the thump in, never round 'em
Watch the people that's around them, something's on, that's down
Another somethin' that could ground 'em, I didn't even know they got to fly us
Got some people that's gon' round 'em, I got something's on them, at 'em
And things they didn't allow, and that's just so they just cool us down
And then I know they stole 'em down, uh
Do you beat your kids?
Do you read to your kids?
Wanna be some kids?
Have you ever worked for somebody that ain't never wanna— wanna meet your kids?
That's definitely a job, yeah

[Chorus]
Plant, don't stop now in the vine
Now we need the sunshine
We plant the seed in the vine
All that we need is sunshine

[Verse 3]
How much energy we be putting into going to work?
How much energy we be putting into— or we gon' do this for our kids
But at that certain point, your kid don't want a bigger room
Your kid don't want a bigger house, they actually want the house smaller so they can be closer, to us

[Chorus]
We plant the seed in the vine
All we need is sunshine (Let me catch that, they say)
All that we need is sunshine (We don't say that, we say this, so like this, let 'em see)
All we need is sunshine (Simplify, simplify, simplify)
All—

[Verse 4]
See, God is the simplicity, the devil is in the details
How they send 'em, they see tales, somethin', somethin' on retails
Got them pumped on, Fidel, lock them, see mails on the e-mail
Got the green before they see Hell, goin' hard like a shemale
You know what I mean, get it? Goin' hard like a shemale? Shit

[Chorus]
In the vine (Hahaha)
This the, in the vine
All that we need is sunshine
All that we need is sunshine
All that we need is sunshine
All that we need is sunshine
We plant the seed in the vine
Now all that we need is some shine

[Verse 5]
You see, I said "now", uh, I'm used to that, we used to that, right?
But there is no past, no present, no future, so the word "now" doesn't actually exist
It's stuck between space and time, so we avoid those words
We just say "We plant the seed in the vine"
And then say "All we need is sunshine"
Not "now", we always need it, it's not, no, specifically not—
'Cause like if somebody say, "Oh, you look good today"
But what about yesterday? Like, what are you talking about?
"Oh, you look real nice today" (Nah, yeah)
There's only one day, by the way (All that we need)
So that's what we gon' do, we gon' take all the holidays and put 'em in one day
Christmas (Mm, mm, mm, mm)
The doors always open
So imagine this, I'ma give you the visual
When you wake up, every morning is Christmas
Every afternoon is Valentine's Day and then every night is New Year's Eve
Every morning is Christmas, every afternoon is Valentine's Day and every night is New Year's Eve
Every morning is Christmas, every afternoon is Valentine's Day and every night is New Year's Eve
Every morning is Christmas, mm
Every night, Valentine's Day, at night, it's New Year's
(First one got ahead so we gotta chop it up to get the best version, so just—)
Take all your favorite holidays
You know, I feel like in Martin Luther King Day, for his dream to really be alive
We have to not celebrate, because it what it does, 'cause it puts us—
We have to not celebrate the holiday because it, it puts us in the loop
Just keeps reminding us of the struggles, they start pulling up pictures of us getting hit by dogs and firehoses and all that
You know like, my daughter came home from school, and her mother said
"My daughter— our daughter came home from school"
And our companion said—
Because, just like, I was about to say like "our" and "my wife" and "her mother", and that, that separates us, so we should always be together somehow
So we just trying this out, this is just a lil' freestyle, you know?
The way we can speak to each other with non-violent communication
Also, it shouldn't be "non-violent" because we should say "non-more violent"
But both of those are negative, so how can we say that in a positive way?
You say, um, "healing communication", "sharing communication"
What's the opposite of separation? What would be a word that's the opposite of separation?
"Joining communication"?
"Joining communication"
"Our daughter arrived home"
Instead of saying "My kid came home from school"
You can't say "Kid, came, that, got"
You see, um, grandmothers tell you "Don't say got"
You know what I'm sayin'? What you got? Get it?

[Chorus]
That's the dirt in the vine
All we, that we have (So we don't need sunshine, how would I say I need it if I got it? You got sunshine, sunshine's for free)
In the vine (So we plant our seeds in the vine, right?)
We have sunshine (We just have it, we don't need it, we don't want it, we have sunshine, we have all we need)

[Verse 6]
So, so, our daughter arrived home
Her mother, I need to find a way to be able to say—
What is the way I would say "my wife", "her mother", at the same time?
One statement, so it's all become this sorts of joining, forming a communication
Do you know how to say that?
What's one word that will bond us together?
Yeah, "Our family discussed school"
You got that? I, I, I've been—
Becuase what she said, she said "Tell Daddy what you learned at school today"
But we would say "Our family discussed school"
Um, but not "discussed" because I don't like it to sound like "disgusting"
What's another way to say "discussed"?
I don't know if I love the word "about"
Our family... what?
"In quorum", what?
What's "quorum"?
Formed, "Our family formed"
Forumed, "Our family created a forum"
There you go
"Tell Daddy what you learned at school today"
And she said "I learned that I'm black and Mommy's white"
I'm like "Damn, I wish she had the heads up"
And, uh, my wife said "No, no, she learned that because it's Martin Luther King Day, and they had to tell her why we have the holiday"
So, a white woman let my daughter know that she has a separation inside of this country from her mother
In order to inform her of Martin Luther King holiday
Can we get— can we get him on mic too?
Can you get him on the club in the one where he's at?
Yeah, yeah, heheheheh, yeah, heheh
Can— can you go closer to 'Quence right now? Or, if— when you just get closer to him
Get real close to him so we get as much, yeah, yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah, that's like if we had, uh, a holiday for couples that's like "Remember When You Cheated on Me Day"
Hahahahahaha, haha
And you bringin' those— start bringin' up the posts
"And 'member when I found your phone? And 'member what I was goin' through?"
Hahaha, we gon' have a "Remember When You Cheated on Me Day"
Mm, yeah, you— you gave that mic to 'Quence? Yeah

[Chorus]
Plant the seeds in the vine
Lovely, we have sunshine
We plant our seeds in the vine
Lucky we have sunshine (Lovely, not lucky)
We plant our seeds in the vine
Lovely, we have sunshine
We plant our seeds in the vine
Lovely, we have sunshine

[Outro]
Ice Cube wanted me to pass his— along, his new album for you to hear if you have time
Oh, most definitely
Plantin' our seeds in the vine
Alright, stop recording

[Intro]
Murda on the beat so its not nice!

[Chorus]
Oh my god, I wish I could escape from what's
On my mind, I could run but I can’t hide it
All this time, I have just watched it slip past my eye
All my life, all my life, all my life, all my life
I, I, I

[Verse]
I feel like that I want to see, but I can't control inside of me
Anxiety, the reason why I can't sleep I-
Wake up every night and I can’t breathe I-
Know that I'm not perfect, I don't deserve it
In this last year, I feel like I became a different person
I brought up shit in the past, now it's coming back to hurt me
I hope for the best but I'm preparing for the worst things
Uh, I know who I am and where I'm from (Uh, uh, uh)
But I'm still trying to find where I belong
Lately, I've been feeling really lost (Uh, uh, uh)
Just tryna find my way back home

[Chorus]
Oh my god, I wish I could escape from what’s
On my mind, I could run but I can’t hide it
All this time, I have just watched it slip past my eye
All my life, all my life, all my life, all my life
I, I, I

[Open Verse]

[Chorus]
Oh my god, I wish I could escape from what's
On my mind, I could run but I can’t hide it
All this time, I have just watched it slip past my eye
All my life

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj, with Kanye West & Charlie Wilson]

Weakness...

To love again
Thought that I'm afraid
The love that we had
So you will see the traces of my weakness

I will be
A star up in the sky
So u can see me:
How bright I really shine

My love away

I lost today
I'm more than you could...survive

Do you hold me

Do you feel it....
Feel so good

[Intro]
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah

[Verse 1]
I'm Miss American Dream, since I was 17
Don't matter if I step on the scene, or sneak away to the Philippines
They're still gon' put pictures of my derriere in the magazines
You want a piece of me? (You want a piece of me?)
I'm Miss Bad Media Karma
Another day, another drama
Guess I can't see the harm in working and being a mama
And with a kid on my arm, I'm still an exceptional earner
You want a piece of me?

[Chorus]
I'm Mrs. Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous
(You want a piece of me?)
I'm Mrs. 'Oh my God, That Britney's Shameless'
(You want a piece of me?)
I'm Mrs. 'Extra! Extra! This Just In'
(You want a piece of me?)
I'm Mrs. 'She's Too Big, Now She's Too Thin'
(You want a piece of me?)

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, yeah

[Verse 2]
I'm Mrs. 'You want a piece of me?'
Trying, and pissing me off
Well, get in line with the paparazzi who's flipping me off
Hoping I'll resort to some havoc, end up settling in court
Now, are you sure you want a piece of me?
(You want a piece of me?)
I'm Mrs. 'Most Likely to Get on the TV For Strippin' on the Streets When Gettin' the Groceries'
Now, for real, are you kiddin' me?
No wonder there's panic in the industry, I mean, please
Do you want a piece of me?

[Chorus]
I'm Mrs. 'Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous'

Piece of me, me, me, me
If I had just one wish
I won't ask for more than a kiss
But no matter how hard I try
I can't get you out of my mind

How could you say that you loved me?
How could you say that you cared?
I know that she may be pretty
But my love was aways there

They say that hearts always heal
But they don't know the pain that I feel
They say that you were so good to me
How did you do it so easily?

How could you say that you loved me?
How could you say that you cared?
I know that she may be pretty
But my love was aways there

I've looked so nice on you
Is that all I was to you
A pretty face with a name
I guess some things you can't explain
How you went away
I hope you, you will find that special girl
And you'll make her shine

I gave you heart and soul
All you did was play the role
Baby boy now you are gone

Oh, mystic man
Tell me who are you today?
Oh, mystic man
Do they know they're all being played?
Oh, mystic man
Baby, tell me what is this?
I'm out the door I can't take no more
Of your shhhh (it)

[Intro]
Oh, uh, pretty certain

[Verse 1]
I see you, you're waiting
Attention is crazy
My body is aching again, uh
Your language is so sick
You're hungry to get it
I think I should hit it again

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't stop, get it, get it
Are you with it, with it?
Please just hit it, hit it again

[Chorus]
Are you ready?
Take my hand and baby let's go
I'm so ready
Got it bad for you, you don't know
It's so crazy
Never thought I'd get a peep-show
Make me baby
Make me wanna scream

[Intro: Drake]
Uh-uh, yeah
Uh

[Chorus: Drake]
I wanna be together, when they say that they know somebody better
I just hope you stay down, uh
I just hope you stay down, yeah
I just hope you stay—
And girl, I know you got your spies, when they happen to catch me in a lie
I just hope you stay down, yeah
I just hope you stay down
I just hope you stay—

[Verse 1: Drake]
Look, I'm sorry that I'm super late
I was drivin' here jammin' them Lil Boosie tapes
Understand that I do not envision, I hallucinate
I'm the type of nigga you could never ever duplicate, but
Let's talk about the babies me and you could make
We could do it anywhere, baby, you just choose the place
I hope I'm not being inappropriate
But maybe if I peak under the table, you could show me it?
Let me get a quickie, speed stick, no deodorant
To cover up the smell 'cause your parents are the nosiest
When you famous all the bitches wanna throw you it
But even with a bunch of women, you could be the loneliest
I tend to ask more than I can give
Or wait whatever's next and just get bored of what it is
That's probably why I'm keepin' you around
Was looking for exactly what I found
I just hope you stay down

[Chorus: Busta Rhymes & Drake]
Babygirl, I hope you rep for me for real
And when they get to stereotypin' a nigga
I just hope you stay down, uh
I just hope you stay down
I just hope you stay—
Listen, even if you slightly doubt me
When these bitches start to writin' books about me
I just hope you stay down, yeah
I just hope you stay down, yeah
I just hope you stay—

[Verse 2: Busta Rhymes]
Everything about me cataclysmic
Big, obscure on every characteristic
I don't know what you're used to, but I'm a little different
Tremendous with credentials, resume is so prolific
Enough of that, despite I'm promisin' one in the booth
Always been a specialist at messin' with the best forbidden fruit
Never did I witness beauty so amazin', get it to the point when I see her, she glowin' like an angel with it
But after all the years of doin' it, I need an understanding with a woman good with followin' my lead
And though she finds it sexy and she loves that I'm the power, even in a crowded room, discreetly touching on her private
And when we goin' through a moment when we feelin' iffy
Believe in shit you hearin' while I question if you with me
You see that line of chicks? Let's go around the corner, waitin' and hopin' you drown, I just hope you stay down
I can't help the women lovin' everything about me, why you passin' judgement?
I just hope you stay down, yeah
I just hope you stay down
I just hope you stay—
I know it's hard to trust me, all this money got my baby mama tryna fuck me
I just hope you stay down, uh
I just hope you stay down
I just hope you stay—

[Intro]
Here goes
Here goes

[Verse 1]
Baby, tell me what's the deal (deal, deal)
Can I keep it real (real, real)
Tell you how I feel (feel, feel)
Here goes, here goes
I'm ready for all the things
Baby that you wanna do
But first I gotta know
If I can get a small commitment from you
OK, OK, OK
Tell me your way, way, way

[Chorus]
I know you wanna make it rain for me
No more drama
No more pain for me
Maybe we could hold hands if you were my boyfriend
I know you'll give me the moon and stars above
But that has no meaning
If we're not in love
We could slow dance
If you were my boyfriend
Don't you wanna be my (Be my, be my)
Here goes, here goes

[Verse 2]
Baby what it gonna be, be, be
Is it you and me, me, me
I'm waiting patiently (ly, ly)
Let's go
Come on, baby, let's go
Baby, if you just relax
And think about what you wanna do
And let your heart lead the way it'll be
OK, OK, OK
But tell me your way, way, way

[Chorus]
I know you wanna make it rain for me, (yeah)
No more drama
No more pain for me (yeah, yeah)
Maybe we could hold hands
If you were my boyfriend (here goes)
I know you'll give me the moon and stars above
But that has no meaning if we're not in love
We could slow dance (here goes)
If you were my boyfriend
Don't you wanna be my, be my, be my

[Outro]
Here goes
Here goes
Here goes
Alberta let your hair hang low

I'll give you more gold
Than your apron can hold
If you'd only let your hair hang low

Alberta what's on your mind
Alberta what's on your mind
You keep me worried and bothered
All of the time
Alberta what's on your mind

Alberta don't you treat me unkind
Alberta don't you treat me unkind
Oh my heart is so sad
Cause I want you so bad
Alberta don't you treat me unkind

Alberta let your hair hang low
Alberta let your hair hang low
I'll give you more gold
Than your apron can hold
If you'll only let your hair hang low

[Verse]
Damn, who would've thought? (Okay)
Gucci and Chanel, yeah, that's all that she want (She do)
Why the fuck am I surprised? I done been here before (I did)
How the fuck could you look in my eyes and tell me you love me?
Devil in disguise, now I see what you want, bitch
And I know that you lyin' but it's what I wanted (Oh, oh)
I had to pay the price for whatever comes with it
Fuck it, I'm done with it
Girl, I don't care anymore (I don't care, bitch)

[Chorus]
You told me, "Come over," 'cause you miss me (Oh, oh, oh)
Girl, I don't wanna fight, I wanna fix things, yeah (Oh, oh, oh)
Why you actin' like this shit ain't this deep? (Oh, oh, oh)

At this time, it's our pleasure to introduce Ms. Joni Mitchell

If you're driving into town with a dark cloud above you
Dial in the number who's bound to love you

Oh, honey, you turn me on, I'm a radio
I'm a country station, I'm a little bit corny
I'm a wildwood flower waving for you
Broadcasting tower waving for you

And I'm sending you out this signal here
I hope you can pick it up loud and clear
I know you don't like weak women, you get bored so quick
And you don't like strong women 'cause they're hip to your tricks

It's been dirty for dirty
Down the line, but you know
I come when you whistle
When you're loving and kind

But if you've got too many doubts
If there's no good reception for me, then tune me out
'Cause, honey, who needs the static?
It hurts the head
And you wind up cracking and the day goes dismal
From "Breakfast Barney" to the sign-off prayer
What a sorry face you get to wear
I'm gonna tell you again now if you're still listening there

If you're driving into town with a dark cloud above you
Dial in the number who's bound to love you
If you're lying on the beach with the transistor going
Kick off the sandflies, honey, the love's still flowing
If your head says forget it, but your heart's still smoking
Call me at the station, the lines are open

[Verse 1]
It was a rainy night
We took a taxi to your mother's home
She went to Florida and left you
With you father's gun, alone
Upon her small white bed
I fell into a dream
You sat up all the night and watched me
To see, who in the world I might be

[Verse 2]
I am from the Sunday school
I sing soprano in the upstairs choir
You are a holy man
On the FM radio
I sat up all the night and watched thee
To see, who in the world you might be

[Verse 3]
You called me beautiful
You called your mother - she was very tanned
So you packed your tent and went
To live out in the Arizona sand
You are a refugee
From a wealthy family
You gave up all the golden factories
To see, who in the world you might be

[Verse 1]
I came upon a child of God
He was walking along the road
And I asked him, "Where are you going?"
And this he told me

I'm going on down to Yasgur's Farm
I'm gonna join in a rock and roll band
I'm gonna camp out on the land
I'm gonna get my soul free

[Chorus]
We are stardust
We are golden
And we've got to get ourselves back to the garden

[Verse 2]
Then can I walk beside you?
I have come here to lose the smog
And I feel to be a cog in something turning
Well maybe it is just the time of year
Or maybe it's the time of man
I don't know who I am
But you know life is for learning

[Chorus]
We are stardust
We are golden
And we've got to get ourselves back to the garden

[Bridge]
By the time we got to Woodstock
We were half a million strong
And everywhere there was song and celebration

And I dreamed I saw the bombers
Riding shotgun in the sky
And they were turning into butterflies
Above our nation

[Chorus]
We are stardust
Billion year old carbon
We are golden
Caught in the devil's bargain
And we've got to get ourselves back to the garden
(To some semblance of a garden.)

[Verse 1]
There's a man who's been out sailing
In a decade full of dreams
And he takes her to a schooner
And he treats her like a queen
Bearing beads from California
With their amber stones and green
He has called her from the harbor
He has kissed her with his freedom
He has heard her off to starboard
In the breaking and the breathing
Of the water weeds
While she was busy being free

[Verse 2]
There's a man who's climbed a mountain
And he's calling out her name
And he hopes her heart can hear three thousand miles
He calls again
He can think her there beside him
He can miss her just the same
He has missed her in the forest
While he showed her all the flowers
And the branches sang the chorus
As he climbed the scaly towers
Of a forest tree
While she was somewhere being free

[Verse 3]
There's a man who's sent a letter
And he's waiting for reply
He has asked her of her travels
Since the day they said goodbye
He writes "Wish you were beside me
We can make it if we try"
He has seen her at the office
With her name on all his papers
Through the sharing of the profits
He will find it hard to shake her
From his memory
And she's so busy being free

[Verse 4]
There's a lady in the city
And she thinks she loves them all
There's the one who's thinking of her
There's the one who sometimes calls
There's the one who writes her letters
With his facts and figures scrawl
She has brought them to her senses
They have laughed inside her laughter
Now she rallies her defenses
For she fears that one will ask her
For eternity
And she's so busy being free

[Verse 5]
There's a man who sends her medals
He is bleeding from the war
There's a jouster and a jester and a man who owns a store
There's a drummer and a dreamer
And you know there may be more
She will love them when she sees them
They will lose her if they follow
And she only means to please them
And her heart is full and hollow
Like a cactus tree
While she's so busy being free

[Outro]
Like a cactus tree
Being free

[Verse 1]
Cold Blue Steel out of money
One eye for the beat police
Sweet Fire calling
"You can't deny me
Now you know what you need"
Underneath the jungle gym
Hollow-grey-fire-escape-thief
Looking for Sweet Fire
Shadow of Lady Release

[Chorus]
"Come with me
I know the way" she says
"It's down, down, down the dark ladder
Do you want to contact somebody first?
Leave someone a letter?
You can come now
Or you can come later"

[Verse 2]
A wristwatch, a ring, a downstairs screamer
Edgy - black cracks of the sky
"Pin-cushion-prick-
Fix this poor bad dreamer!"
"Money" cold shadows reply
Pawnshops crisscrossed and padlocked
Corridors spit on prayers and pleas
Sparks fly up from Sweet Fire
Black soot of Lady Release

[Chorus]
"Come with me
I know the way" she says
"It's down, down, down the dark ladder
Do you want to contact somebody first?
Does it really matter
You can come now
Or you can come later?"

[Verse 3]
Red water in the bathroom sink
Fever and the scum brown bowl
Blue Steel still begging
But it's indistinct
Someone's HI-Fi drumming Jelly Roll
Concrete concentration camp
Bashing in veins for peace
Cold Blue Steel and Sweet Fire
Fall into Lady Release

[Chorus]
"Come with me
I know the way" she says
"It's down, down, down the dark ladder
Do you want to contact somebody first?
I mean what does it really matter?
You're going to come now
Or you're going to come later"
I am a woman of heart and mind
With time on her hands
No child to raise
You come to me like a little boy
And I give you my scorn and my praise

You think I'm like your mother
Or another lover or your sister
Or the queen of your dreams
Or just another silly girl
When love makes a fool of me

After the rush when you come back down
You're always disappointed
Nothing seems to keep you high
Drive your bargains
Push your papers
Win your medals
Fuck your strangers
Don't it leave you on the empty side
I'm looking for affection and respect
A little passion
And you want stimulation-nothing more
That's what I think
But you know I'll try to be there for you
When your spirits start to sink

All this talk about holiness now
It must be the start of the latest style
Is it all books and words
Or do you really feel it?
Do you really laugh?
Do you really care?
Do you really smile
When you smile?

You criticize and you flatter
You imitate the best
And the rest you memorize
You know the times you impress me most
Are the times when you don't try
When you don't even try
Just before our love got lost you said
"I am as constant as a northern star"
And I said "Constantly in the darkness
Where's that at?
If you want me I'll be in the bar"

On the back of a cartoon coaster
In the blue TV screen light
I drew a map of Canada
Oh Canada
With your face sketched on it twice
Oh you're in my blood like holy wine
You taste so bitter and so sweet

Oh I could drink a case of you darling
Still I'd be on my feet
Oh I would still be on my feet

Oh I am a lonely painter
I live in a box of paints
I'm frightened by the devil
And I'm drawn to those ones that ain't afraid
I remember that time you told me you said
"Love is touching souls"
Surely you touched mine
'Cause part of you pours out of me
In these lines from time to time
Oh, you're in my blood like holy wine
You taste so bitter and so sweet

Oh I could drink a case of you darling
And I would still be on my feet
I would still be on my feet

I met a woman
She had a mouth like yours
She knew your life
She knew your devils and your deeds
And she said
"Go to him, stay with him if you can
But be prepared to bleed"

Oh but you are in my blood
You're my holy wine
You're so bitter, bitter and so sweet

Oh, I could drink a case of you darling
Still I'd be on my feet
I would still be on my feet
Blue
Songs are like tattoos
You know I've been to sea before
Crown and anchor me
Or let me sail away
Hey Blue, here is a song for you to
Ink on a pin
Underneath the skin
An empty space to fill in
Well there're so many sinking now
You've got to keep thinking
You can make it thru these waves
Acid, booze, and ass
Needles, guns, and
Lots of laughs
Lots of laughs
Everybody's saying that hell's the hippest way to go
Well I don't think so
But I'm gonna take a look around it though
Blue I love you
I love you
Blue here is a shell for you
Inside you'll hear a sigh
A foggy lullaby
There is your song from me
All the people at this party
They've got a lot of style
They've got stamps of many countries
They've got passport smiles
Some are friendly
Some are cutting
Some are watching it from the wings
Some are standing in the centre
Giving to get something

Photo beauty gets attention
Then her eye paint's running down
She's got a rose in her teeth
And a lampshade crown
One minute she's so happy
Then she's crying on someone's knee
Saying laughing and crying
You know it's the same release

I told you when I met you
I was crazy
Cry for us all beauty
Cry for Eddie in the corner
Thinking he's nobody
And Jack behind his joker
And stone-cold Grace behind her fan
And me in my frightened silence
Thinking I don't understand
I feel like I'm sleeping
Can you wake me
You seem to have a broader sensibility
I'm just living on nerves and feelings
With a weak and a lazy mind
And coming to peoples parties
Fumbling deaf dumb and blind

I wish I had more sense of humor
Keeping the sadness at bay
Throwing the lightness on these things
Laughing it all away
Laughing it alI away
Laughing it all away
I am on a lonely road and I am traveling
Traveling, traveling, traveling
Looking for something, what can it be
Oh I hate you some, I hate you some, I love you some
Oh I love you when I forget about me

I want to be strong I want to laugh along
I want to belong to the living
Alive, alive, I want to get up and jive
I want to wreck my stockings in some juke box dive
Do you want - do you want - do you want to dance with me baby
Do you want to take a chance
On maybe finding some sweet romance with me baby
Well, come on

All I really really want our love to do
Is to bring out the best in me and in you too
All I really really want our love to do
Is to bring out the best in me and in you
I want to talk to you, I want to shampoo you
I want to renew you again and again
Applause, applause - Life is our cause
When I think of your kisses my mind see-saws
Do you see - do you see - do you see how you hurt me baby
So I hurt you too
Then we both get so blue
I am on a lonely road and I am traveling
Looking for the key to set me free
Oh the jealousy, the greed is the unraveling
It's the unraveling
And it undoes all the joy that could be
I want to have fun, I want to shine like the sun
I want to be the one that you want to see
I want to knit you a sweater
Want to write you a love letter
I want to make you feel better
I want to make you feel free
I want to make you feel free
Rows and floes of angel hair
And ice cream castles in the air
And feather canyons everywhere
I've looked at clouds that way

But now they only block the sun
They rain and snow on everyone
So many things I would have done
But clouds got in my way

I've looked at clouds from both sides now
From up and down, and still somehow
It's cloud illusions I recall
I really don't know clouds at all

Moons and Junes and Ferris wheels
The dizzy dancing way you feel
As every fairy tale comes real
I've looked at love that way

But now it's just another show
You leave 'em laughing when you go
And if you care, don't let them know
Don't give yourself away
I've looked at love from both sides now
From give and take, and still somehow
It's love's illusions I recall
I really don't know love at all

Tears and fears and feeling proud
To say "I love you" right out loud
Dreams and schemes and circus crowds
I've looked at life that way

But now old friends are acting strange
They shake their heads, they say I've changed
Well something's lost, but something's gained
In living every day

I've looked at life from both sides now
From win and lose and still somehow
It's life's illusions I recall
I really don't know life at all

I've looked at life from both sides now
From up and down and still somehow
It's life's illusions I recall
I really don't know life at all
The wind is in from Africa
Last night I couldn't sleep
Oh, you know it sure is hard to leave here Carey
But it's really not my home
My fingernails are filthy, I got beach tar on my feet
And I miss my clean white linen and my fancy French cologne

Oh Carey get out your cane
And I'll put on some silver
Oh you're a mean old Daddy
But I like you fine

Come on down to the Mermaid Café and I will
Buy you a bottle of wine
And we'll laugh and toast to nothing and smash our empty glasses down
Let's have a round for these freaks and these soldiers
A round for these friends of mine
Let's have another round for the bright red devil
Who keeps me in this tourist town

Come on Carey get out your cane
I'll put on some silver
Oh you're a mean old Daddy
But I like you
Maybe I'll go to Amsterdam
Maybe I'll go to Rome
And rent me a grand piano
And put some flowers 'round my room
But let's not talk about fare-thee-wells now
The night is a starry dome
And they're playin' that scratchy rock and roll
Beneath the Matala Moon

Come on Carey get out your cane
I'll put on some silver
We'll go to the Mermaid Café
Have fun tonight

The wind is in from Africa
Last night I couldn't sleep
Oh you know it sure is hard to leave here
But it's really not my home

Maybe it's been too long a time
Since I was scramblin' down in the street
Now they got me used to that clean white linen
And that fancy French cologne

Oh Carey get out your cane
I'll put on my finest silver
We'll go to the Mermaid Café
Have fun tonight
I said, Oh, you're a mean old Daddy but I like you
But you're out of sight

[Verse 1]
They paved paradise and put up a parking lot
With a pink hotel, a boutique, and a swingin' hot spot

[Chorus]
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone?
They paved paradise, put up a parking lot
(Shoo-bop-bop-bop-bop
Shoo-bop-bop-bop-bop)

[Verse 2]
They took all the trees, put 'em in a tree museum
And they charged the people a dollar and a half just to see 'em

[Chorus]
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone?
They paved paradise, put up a parking lot
(Shoo-bop-bop-bop-bop
Shoo-bop-bop-bop-bop)

[Verse 3]
Hey farmer, farmer, put away the DDT now
Give me spots on my apples
But leave me the birds and the bees, please

[Chorus]
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone?
They paved paradise, put up a parking lot
(Shoo-bop-bop-bop-bop
Shoo-bop-bop-bop-bop)

[Verse 4]
Late last night, I heard the screen door slam
And a big yellow taxi took away my old man

[Chorus]
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone?
They paved paradise, put up a parking lot
(Shoo-bop-bop-bop-bop)
I said, don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone?
They paved paradise, put up a parking lot
(Shoo-bop-bop-bop-bop)
They paved paradise, put up a parking lot
(Shoo-bop-bop-bop-bop)
They paved paradise, put up a parking lot
I'll try to keep myself open up to you
That's a promise that I made to love
When it was new
Just like Jericho I said
"Let these walls come tumbling down"
I said it like I finally found the way
To keep the good feelings alive
I said it like it was something to strive for

I'll try to keep myself open up to you
And approve your self expression
I need that too
I need your confidence baby
And the gift of your extra time
In turn I'll give you mine
Sweet darling it's a rich exchange
It seems to me
It's a warm arrangement

Anyone will tell you
Just how hard it is to make and keep a friend
Maybe they'll short sell you
Or maybe it's you
Judas in the end
When you just can no longer pretend
That you're getting what you need
Or you're giving out anything for them to grow and feed on
I'll try to keep myself open up to you
It gets easier and easier to do
Just like Jericho
Let these walls come tumbling down now
Let them fall right on the ground
Let all these dogs go running free
The wild and the gentle dogs
Kenneled in me

[Verse 1]
Access granted, you can misbehave
Throw away your constraints
Say my name with no regrets
Yeah, you never have to take it back
Saying, "I don't wanna run around"
"Yeah, I'm carrying our only child"
Well, the static blowing through your hair
The signal's crossed but it's clear
I can make it out

[Chorus]
All alone
All the things that we do when we're left on our own
And all the things that we just love to hide
All alone
All the things that we do when no one's around
We're just playing in the underground

[Verse 2]
You throw up a prayer, then you move to another god
You throw up a prayer, then you move to another god
It seems you're not the only one
Who gives away your voice
Yeah, well, I've given up all control
No, we don't have to save the world
I don't need to understand
The way things spin around
Yeah, well, I'll never know

[Chorus]
All alone
All the things that we do when we're left on our own
And all the things that we just love to hide
All alone
All the things that we do when no one's around
We're just playing in the underground

[Bridge]
We cross lines for love
Some make it out
And some never make it out

[Outro]
I am, you are, you will or you won't
Come with me
Just play in the underground
We just play in the underground
Yeah, and we can play in the underground
When we're all alone
There's things that I want to do with you
Where we can play, we can play
We can play, we can play in the underground
You beating drum like dum di di day
I love the dirty rhythm you play
I wanna hear you calling my name
Like hey mama mama hey mama mama (hey)

Banging the drum like dum di di day
I know you want it in the worst way
I wanna hear you calling my name
Like hey mama mama hey mama mama (hey)

Banging the drum like dum di di day
I know you want it in the worst way
I wanna hear you calling my name
Like hey mama mama hey mama mama (hey)

Hey mama mama, hey mama mama

Yes, yes I'll do the cleaning
Plus I keep the na-na real sweet for your eating
Yes you be the boss, yes I be respecting
Whatever that you tell me cause it's game that you be spitting
You beating drum like dum di di day
I love the dirty rhythm you play
I wanna hear you calling my name
Like hey mama mama hey mama mama (hey)

Banging the drum like dum di di day
I know you want it in the worst way
I wanna hear you calling my name
Like hey mama mama hey mama mama (hey)

Hey mama mama, hey mama mama

[Chorus]
Don’t care what they say
I do things the player way
All day every day, I do things the player way
Everywhere I go, I do things the player way
You already know, I do things the player way
We gon’ have some fun, we gon’ have a good time
We gon’ have some fun, we gon’ have a good time
We gon’ have some fun, we gon’ have a good time
We gon’ have some fun, we gon’ have a good time
When the lights go off and it all fall down
I'll be in another state, i'll be in another town
You were so lost girl, now you say 

[?]
Let me up anytime you come around
Just know that 

[?] Games 

[?] Games
I don't play 

[?]
Just know that 

[?] Games 

[?] Games
I don't play 

[?]
Just know that 

[?] Games 

[?] Games
I don't play 

[?]
Just know that

[Verse 1]
You ain't losing when you choosing on a real one

[Intro: The Kid LAROI & TKingston]
(Ayy, f**k that nigga Haan, man)
Yeah, I'ma come, yeah, uh

[Chorus]
I just touched down on a late flight (I did)
Shawty blowing up my phone (She is)
I'ma come through on the late night (Oh, oh)
She wanna chill and do date night (She do)
She wanna chill in the daytime (Oh, yeah)
But shawty, you know I'm a dog (I am)
I don't got time just to play around (I don't)
(Oh, wow) Shawty, I don't want your love, I just want the bands now
(Oh, wow) Shawty, I just want to fuck and keep it like friends now
(Oh, wow) But you want attention
You want attention (Oh, wow), you want attention, uh, uh, uh

[Verse]
Come through, girl, I need some attention
I don't, don't know what your intentions are
I think that we need some time away
You want me all the time, I can't do every day (Nah, nah)
Not to mention, I don't want to do this all over again
Did I mention I've been through my own fair share of things?
I feel the tension when I walk into the room
Don't know what you want me to do
Either way, I'm gon' lose

[Chorus]
I just touched down on a late flight (I did)
Shawty blowing up my phone (She is)
I'ma come through on the late night (Oh, oh)
She wanna chill and do date night (She do)
She wanna chill in the daytime (Oh, yeah)
But shawty, you know I'm a dog (I am)
I don't got time just to play around (I don't)
(Oh, wow) Shawty, I don't want your love, I just want the bands now
(Oh, wow) Shawty, I just want to fuck and keep it like friends now
(Oh, wow) But you want attention
You want attention (Oh, wow), you want attention, uh, uh, uh

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, so many numbers on my phone (my phone)
So tell me why I feel alone (alone)
I think I overstayed my time
At your crib, cause now it don't feel so right (at all)
I know you said you hate me but
Actions speak louder than words so what
I fucked up, now I'm fucked up, testing my luck
Call somebody from the past, I'ma see what's up tonight

[Chorus]
I'm addicted to you, like cigarettes
You got my heart on fire and I'm sick of it
Crush me down when I'm out and you're sick of me
Smoke it out when I'm down and I'm feeling it
I'm addicted to you, like cigarettes
You got my heart on fire and I'm sick of it
Crush me down when I'm out and you're sick of me
Smoke it out when I'm down and I'm feeling it

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, so many numbers on my phone (my phone)
So tell me why I feel alone (alone)
I think I overstayed my time
At your crib, cause now it don't feel so right
I know you said you hate me but
Actions speak louder than words so what
I fucked up, now I'm fucked up, testing my luck
Call somebody from the past, imma see what's up tonight

[Chorus]
I'm addicted to you, like cigarettes
You got my heart on fire and I'm sick of it
Crush me down when I'm out and you're sick of me
Smoke it out when I'm down and I'm feeling it
I'm addicted to you, like cigarettes
You got my heart on fire and I'm sick of it
Crush me down when I'm out and you're sick of me
Smoke it out when I'm down and I'm feeling it
Downtown
My darling dime store thief
In the War of Independence
Rock 'n' roll rang sweet as victory
Under neon signs
A girl was in bloom
And a woman was fading
In a suburban room
I said take me to the dance
Do you want to dance?
I love to dance
And I told him They don't take chances
They seem so removed from romance
They've been broken in churches and schools
And molded to middle class circumstance
And we were rolling rolling rock 'n' rolling

Downtown
The dance halls and cafes
Feel so wild you could break somebody's heart
Just doing the latest dance craze
Gail and Louise
In those push-up brassieres
Tight dresses and rhinestone rings
Drinking up the band's beers
Young love was kissing under bridges
Kissing in cars kissing in cafes
And we were walking down Main Street
Kisses like bright flags hung on holidays
In France they kiss on Main Street
Amour, mama, not cheap display
And we were rolling, rolling, rock 'n' rolling
Downtown
In the pinball arcade
With his head full of pool hall pitches
And songs from the hit parade
He'd be singing "Bye Bye Love"
While he's racking up his free play
Let those rock 'n' roll choir boys
Come and carry us away
Sometimes Chickie had the car
Or Ron had a car
Or Lead Foot Melvin with his hot-wire head
We'd all go looking for a party
Looking to raise Jesus up from the dead
And I'd be kissing in the back seat
Thrilling to the Brando-like things that he said
And we'd be rolling rolling rock 'n' rolling
The big man arrives
Disco dancers greet him
Plainclothes cops greet him
Small town, big man, fresh lipstick glistening
Sophomore jive
From victims of typewriters
The band sounds like typewriters
The big man he's not listening
His eyes hold Edith
His left hand holds his right
What does that hand desire
That he grips it so tight

Edith in the ring
The passed over girls are conferring
The man with the diamond ring is purring
All claws for now withdrawn
One by one they bring
His renegade stories to her
His crimes and his glories to her
In challenge they look on
Women he has taken grow old too soon
He tilts their tired faces
Gently to the spoon
Edith in his bed
A plane in the rain is humming
The wires in the walls are humming
Some song some mysterious song
Bars in her head
Beating frantic and snowblind
Romantic and snowblind
She says his crime belongs
Edith and the Kingpin
Each with charm to sway
Are staring eye to eye
They dare not look away
You know they dare not look away
No regrets Coyote
We just come from such different sets of circumstance
I'm up all night in the studios
And you're up early on your ranch
You'll be brushing out a brood mare's tail
While the sun is ascending
And I'll just be getting home with my reel to reel
There's no comprehending
Just how close to the bone and the skin and the eyes
And the lips you can get
And still feel so alone
And still feel related
Like stations in some relay
You're not a hit and run driver no no
Racing away
You just picked up a hitcher
A prisoner of the white lines on the freeway

We saw a farmhouse burning down
In the middle of nowhere
In the middle of the night
And we rolled right past that tragedy
Till we turned into some road house lights
Where a local band was playing
Locals were up kicking and shaking on the floor
And the next thing I know
That coyote's at my door
He pins me in a corner and he won't take no
He drags me out on the dance floor
And we're dancing close and slow
Now he's got a woman at home
He's got another woman down the hall
He seems to want me anyway
Why'd you have to get so drunk
And lead me on that way
You just picked up a hitcher
A prisoner of the white lines on the freeway
I looked a coyote right in the face
On the road to Baljennie near my old home town
He went running thru the whisker wheat
Chasing some prize down
And a hawk was playing with him
Coyote was jumping straight up and making passes
He had those same eyes just like yours
Under your dark glasses
Privately probing the public rooms
And peeking thru keyholes in numbered doors
Where the players lick their wounds
And take their temporary lovers
And their pills and powders to get them thru this passion play
No regrets Coyote
I'll just get off up aways
You just picked up a hitcher
A prisoner of the white lines on the freeway

Coyote's in the coffee shop
He's staring a hole in his scrambled eggs
He picks up my scent on his fingers
While he's watching the waitresses' legs
He's too far from the Bay of Fundy
From appaloosas and eagles and tides
And the air conditioned cubicles
And the carbon ribbon rides
Are spelling it out so clear
Either he's going to have to stand and fight
Or take off out of here
I tried to run away myself
To run away and wrestle with my ego
And with this flame
You put here in this Eskimo
In this hitcher
In this prisoner
Of the fine white lines
Of the white lines on the free free way
I'm down to a roll of dimes
I'm stalking the slot that's hot
I keep hearing bells all around me
Jingling in the lucky jackpots
They keep you tantalized
They keep you reaching for your wallet
Here in fools' paradise

I talked to a cat from Des Moines
He said he ran a cleaning plant
That cat was clanking with coin
Well he must have had a genie in a lamp
'cause every time I dropped a dime I blew it
He kept ringing bells
Nothing to it!

He got three oranges
Three lemons
Three cherries
Three plums
I'm losing my taste for fruit
Watching the dry cleaner do it
Like Midas in a polyester suit
It's all luck!
It's just luck!
You get a little lucky and you make a little money!
I followed him down the strip
He picked out a booth at Circus Circus
Where the cowgirls fill the room
With their big balloons
The cleaner was pitching with purpose!
He had Dinos and Pooh Bears
And lions pink and blue there
He couldn't lose there!

Des Moines was stacking the chips
Raking off the tables
Ringing the bandit's bells
This is a story that's a drag to tell
(In some ways)
Since I lost every dime
I laid on the line
But the cleaner from Des Moines
Could put a coin
In the door of a John
And get twenty for one
It's just luck!
I was driving across the burning desert
When I spotted six jet planes
Leaving six white vapor trails across the bleak terrain
It was the hexagram of the heavens
It was the strings of my guitar
Amelia * it was just a false alarm

The drone of flying engines
Is a song so wild and blue
It scrambles time and seasons if it gets thru to you
Then your life becomes a travelogue
Of picture post card charms
Amelia it was just a false alarm

People will tell you where they've gone
They'll tell you where to go
But till you get there yourself you never really know
Where some have found their paradise
Others just come to harm
Oh, Amelia it was just a false alarm
I wish that he was here tonight
It's so hard to obey
His sad request of me to kindly stay away
So this is how I hide the hurt
As the road leads cursed and charmed
I tell Amelia it was just a false alarm

A ghost of aviation
She was swallowed by the sky
Or by the sea like me she had a dream to fly
Like Icarus ascending
On beautiful foolish arms
Amelia it was just a false alarm

Maybe I've never really loved
I guess that is the truth
I've spent my whole life in clouds at icy altitudes
And looking down on everything
I crashed into his arms
Amelia it was just a false alarm

I pulled into the Cactus Tree Motel
To shower off the dust
And I slept on the strange pillows of my wanderlust
I dreamed of 747s
Over geometric farms
Dreams Amelia - dreams and false alarms

[Verse 1]
Crashing waves, misbehaved
Paradise, so ashamed
Chandelier, drink my fears
Mansion house, disappear, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Slow it down and take a breath
Woke up with pain in my chest (Woah)
Now I'm floating, what's that stress
'Cause I can go anywhere, I can go anywhere

[Chorus]
Go out at night when I feel a little broken
I'm so afraid, need to move a little slower
It hurts to talk, so I pull somebody closer
I tell myself that the party's never over

[Post-Chorus]
So I throw my hands, so I throw my hands up in the sky
So I throw my hands, so I throw my hands up in the sky, in the sky
So I throw my hands, so I throw my hands up in the sky
So I throw my hands, so I throw my hands up in the sky, in the sky

[Verse 2]
Crowded room, bodies move
Eyes roll back, come up soon
Chandelier, looks like tears
Wash me out, disappear, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Slow it down and take a breath
Woke up with pain in my chest, woah
Now I'm floating, what's that stress
'Cause I can go anywhere, I can go anywhere

[Chorus]
Go out at night when I feel a little broken
I'm so afraid, need to move a little slower
It hurts to talk, so I pull somebody closer
I tell myself that the party's never over

[Post-Chorus]
So I throw my hands, so I throw my hands up in the sky
So I throw my hands, so I throw my hands up in the sky, in the sky
So I throw my hands, so I throw my hands up in the sky
So I throw my hands, so I throw my hands up in the sky, in the sky

[Verse 1]
Traveling in some vehicle
I'm sitting in some café
A defector from the petty wars
That shell shock love away

[Verse 2]
There's comfort in melancholy
When there's no need to explain
It's just as natural as the weather
In this moody sky today

[Verse 3]
In our possessive coupling
So much could not be expressed
So now I'm returning to myself
These things that you and I suppressed

[Verse 4]
I see something of myself in everyone
Just at this moment of the world
As snow gathers like bolts of lace
Waltzing on a bridal girl

[Verse 5]
You know it never has been easy
Whether you do or you do not resign
Whether you travel the breadth of extremities
Or stick to some straighter line

[Verse 6]
Now here's a man and a woman sitting on a rock
They're either going to thaw out or freeze
Listen, strains of Benny Goodman
Coming through the snow and the pinewood trees

[Verse 7]
I'm porous with travel fever
But you know I'm so glad to be on my own
Still somehow the slightest touch of a stranger
Can set up trembling in my bones

[Verse 8]
I know no one's going to show me everything
We all come and go unknown
Each so deep and superficial
Between the forceps and the stone

[Verse 9]
Well I looked at the granite markers
Those tribute to finality to eternity
And then I looked at myself here
Chicken scratching for my immortality

[Verse 10]
In the church they light the candles
And the wax rolls down like tears
There's the hope and the hopelessness
I've witnessed thirty years

[Verse 11]
We're only particles of change I know I know
Orbiting around the sun
But how can I have that point of view
When I'm always bound and tied to someone

[Verse 12]
White flags of winter chimneys
Waving truce against the moon
In the mirrors of a modern bank
From the window of a hotel room

[Verse 13]
I'm traveling in some vehicle
I'm sitting in some café
A defector from the petty wars
Until love sucks me back that way
There's a crow flying
Black and ragged
Tree to tree
He's black as the highway that's leading me
Now he's diving down
To pick up on something shiny
I feel like that black crow
Flying
In a blue sky

I took a ferry to the highway
Then I drove to a pontoon plane
I took a plane to a taxi
And a taxi to a train
I've been traveling so long
How'm I ever going to know my home
When I see it again
I'm like a black crow flying
In a blue blue sky

In search of love and music
My whole life has been
Illumination
Corruption
And diving diving diving diving
Diving down to pick up on every shiny thing
Just like that black crow flying
In a blue sky
I looked at the morning
After being up all night
I looked at my haggard face in the bathroom light
I looked out the window
And I saw that ragged soul take flight
I saw a back crow flying
In a blue sky
Oh I'm like a black crow flying
In a blue sky
It's a long long way from Canada
A long way from snow chains
Donkey vendors slicing coconut
No parkas to their name
Black babies covered in baking flour
The cook's got a carnival song
We're going to lay down some place shady
With dreamland coming on
Dreamland dreamland
Dreamland dreamland

Walter Raleigh and Chris Columbus
Come marching out of the waves
And claim the beach and all concessions
In the name of the suntan slave
I wrapped that flag around me
Like a Dorothy Lamour sarong
And I lay down thinking national
With dreamland coming on
Dreamland dreamland
Dreamland dreamland
Goodtime Mary and a fortune hunter
All dressed up to follow the drums
Mary in a feather hula-hoop
Miss Fortune with a rose on her big game gun
All saints all sinners shining
Heed those trumpets all night long
Propped up on a samba beat
With dreamland coming on
Dreamland dreamland
Dreamland dreamland

Tar baby and the Great White Wonder
Talking over a glass of rum
Burning on the inside
With the knowledge of things to come
There's gambling out on the terrace
And midnight ramblin' on the lawn
As they lead toward temptation
With dreamland coming on
Dreamland dreamland
Dreamland dreamland

In a plane flying back to winter
In shoes full of tropic sand
A lady in a foreign flag
On the arm of her Marlboro Man
The hawk howls in New York City
Six foot drifts on Myrtle's lawn
As they push the recline buttons down
With dreamland coming on
Dreamland dreamland
Dreamland dreamland
African sand on the trade winds
And the sun on the Amazon
As they push the recline buttons down
With dreamland coming on
Dreamland dreamland
Dreamland dreamland
The way I see it he said
You just can't win it
Everybody's in it for their own gain
You can't please 'em all
There's always somebody calling you down
I do my best
And I do good business
There's a lot of people asking for my time
They're trying to get ahead
They're trying to be a good friend of mine

I was a free man in Paris
I felt unfettered and alive
There was nobody calling me up for favors
And no one's future to decide
You know I'd go back there tomorrow
But for the work I've taken on
Stoking the star maker machinery
Behind the popular song

I deal in dreamers
And telephone screamers
Lately I wonder what I do it for
If l had my way
I'd just walk through those doors
And wander
Down the Champs Elysées *
Going cafe to cabaret
Thinking how I'll feel when I find
That very good friend of mine
I was a free man in Paris
I felt unfettered and alive
Nobody was calling me up for favors
No one's future to decide
You know I'd go back there tomorrow
But for the work I've taken on
Stoking the star maker machinery
Behind the popular song
Old Beale Street * is coming down
Sweeties' Snack Bar boarded up now
And Egles the Tailor and the Shine Boy's gone
Faded out with ragtime blues
Handy's cast in bronze
And he's standing in a little park
With a trumpet in his hand
Like he's listening back to the good old bands
And the click of high heeled shoes
Old Furry * sings the blues
Propped up in his bed
With his dentures and his leg removed
And Ginny's there
For her kindness and Furry's beer
She's the old man's angel overseer

Pawn shops glitter like gold tooth caps
In the grey decay
They chew the last few dollars off
Old Beale Street's carcass
Carrion and mercy
Blue and silver sparkling drums
Cheap guitars eye shades and guns
Aimed at the hot blood of being no one
Down and out in Memphis Tennessee
Old Furry sings the blues
You bring him smoke and drink and he'll play for you
Lt's mostly muttering now and sideshow spiel
But there was one song he played
I could really feel
There's a double bill murder at the New Daisy
The old girl's silent across the street
She's silent waiting for the wrecker's beat
Silent staring at her stolen name
Diamond boys and satin dolls
Bourbon laughter ghosts history falls
To parking lots and shopping malls
As they tear down old Beale Street
Old Furry sings the blues
He points a bony finger at you and says
"I don't like you"
Everybody laughs as if it's the old man's standard joke
But it's true
We're only welcome for our drink and smoke

W. C. Handy * I'm rich and I'm fey
And I'm not familiar with what you played
But I get such strong impressions of your hey day
Looking up and down old Beale Street
Ghosts of the darktown society
Come right out of the bricks at me
Like it's a Saturday night
They're in their finery
Dancing it up and making deals
Furry sings the blues
Why should I expect that old guy to give it to me true
Fallen to hard luck
And time and other thieves
While our limo is shining on his shanty street
Old Furry sings the blues
Every picture has its shadows
And it has some source of light
Blindness blindness and sight
The perils of benefactors
The blessings of parasites
Blindness blindness and sight
Threatened by all things
Devil of cruelty
Drawn to all things
Devil of delight
Mythical devil of the ever-present laws
Governing blindness blindness and sight

Suntans in reservation dining rooms
Pale miners in their lantern rays
Night night and day
Hostage smile on presidents
Freedom scribbled in the subway
It's like night night and day
Threatened by all things
God of cruelty
Drawn to all things
God of delight
Mythical god of the everlasting laws
Governing day day and night
Critics of all expression
Judges in black and white
Saying it's wrong saying it's right
Compelled by prescribed standards
Or some ideals we fight
For wrong wrong and right
Threatened by all things
Man of cruelty-mark of Cain
Drawn to all things
Man of delight-born again born again
Man of the laws the ever-broken laws
Governing wrong wrong and right
Governing wrong wrong and right
Wrong and right
He is three
One's in the middle unmoved
Waiting
To show what he sees
To the other two
To the one attacking so afraid
And the one that keeps trying to love and trust
And getting himself betrayed
In the plan oh
The divine plan
God must be a boogie man!

One's so sweet
So overly loving and gentle
He lets people in
To his innermost sacred temple
Blind faith to care
Blind rage to kill
Why'd he let them talk him down
To cheap work and cheap thrills
In the plan oh
The insulting plan
God must be a boogie man!
Which would it be
Mingus one or two or three
Which one do you think he'd want the world to see
Well world opinion's not a lot of help
When a man's only trying to find out
How to feel about himself
In the plan oh
The cock-eyed plan
God must be a boogie man!
I came upon a child of God
He was walking along the road
And I asked him where are you going
And this he told me
I'm going on down to Yasgur's farm *
I'm going to join in a rock 'n' roll band
I'm going to camp out on the land
I'm going to try an' get my soul free

We are stardust
We are golden
And we've got to get ourselves
Back to the garden

Then can I walk beside you
I have come here to lose the smog
And I feel to be a cog in something turning
Well maybe it is just the time of year
Or maybe it's the time of man
I don't know who I am
But you know life is for learning
We are stardust
We are golden
And we've got to get ourselves
Back to the garden

By the time we got to Woodstock
We were half a million strong
And everywhere there was song and celebration
And I dreamed I saw the bombers
Riding shotgun in the sky
And they were turning into butterflies
Above our nation

We are stardust
Billion year old carbon
We are golden
Caught in the devil's bargain
And we've got to get ourselves
Back to the garden

[Verse 1: Octavian]
I been drinkin' and smokin' too much, that shit damages
Give me it all, I can do it myself, I can manage it
Two seconds, I gotta leave, and you know how it is
You and me, we can take on the world, we can be savages

[Pre-Chorus: Octavian]
I call my dealer, said, "Share the white with all of us" (Light)
I told him, "We been so nice, don't turn on us" (Don't turn on us)
Isn't it funny how the time flies by (Flies by) so fast?
If we do all of these lines, we go up

[Chorus: Octavian]
(Oh) And if I look into your eyes, and we can realize (Oh, I can realize)

[Break: Octavian]
Before I commence and just rhyme to this (Rhyme to this)
(Ayy, go hard as shit man)

[Verse 2: Octavian]
It's definitely going down (Down)
Find a Pagan on the strip, spin him 'round (Spin him round)
Big man talking shit 'til we pin him down (Pin him down)
Big man talkin' shit 'til we lick him down (Until I lick him down)
Sure enough, I'ma spin you 'round
Put the big 

[_] in your belly then spin it 'round (Spin it 'round)
You can ask Crimbo if I've been about
Free him out (Free him out), I don't need to get the pictures out

[Pre-Chorus: Octavian]
I call my dealer, said, "Share the white with all of us"
I told him, "We been so nice, don't turn on us" (Don't turn on us)
Isn't it funny how the times flies by (Flies by) so fast?
If we do all of these lines (These lines), we go up

[Chorus: Octavian]
(Oh) And if I look into your eyes, and we can realize (Oh)

[Bridge: Octavian]
You know that we can be immortal, immortal
Are you loyal? Yeah (Oh, immortal)
I'm just praying that she loyal, is she loyal? Yeah
Recoil, yeah (Is she loyal)
I don't talk too much, man
Have they got mine?
Cryin' out finally, and a little mercy (Oh)
I don't talk too much, man
Came out silent
Came out silent
Came out silent
Came out silent

[Outro: 2D & Octavian]
Oh, it's a beautiful day (Is she loyal?)
Oh, it's a beautiful day (Is she loyal? Is she loyal?)
Oh, it's a beautiful day (Immortal, immortal)
(Oh, it's a beautiful day) I don't talk too much, man
Have they got mine?
Cryin' out finally, and a little mercy
I don't talk too much, man
Came out silent (Immortal)

[Chorus]
And he said
He said "Black"
He said "Black"
He said "Black"
He said "Black"
He said "Black is beautiful"
He said "Black is beautiful"
He said that "Black is beautiful, beautiful"
He tell me "Black is beautiful"
He said "Black is beautiful", yeah

[Verse]
Yeah, uh
Gorgeous, like George is
The portrait of a summertime Georgia, maybe
Or an Alabama farm
Made back against the wall at the mall, crazy
Let's take it back to that Mercedes in front of the store
Stephen put your baby on his shoulders like a chauffeur
And she told us exactly who you are
For every trail, known to carry revolution, every twenty dollar bills
H-Town Don (Don, don, don)
They say we doin' dirt, but we just break down ground
That's what happens when you're sons of mother earth
Things you said reflected the love for the church
Your fellow man and your brothers and the lurch
They be lurkin', trying not to go berserk
The only way that they can express they hurt
Kinda like how I be doin' with verse
For me birth, to you reverse
I think they misheard your last piece of work
The last words of a good man, pure and unrehearsed
The shell heard around the earth with your final breath
The last word, right before you left were-

[Chorus]
Black is beautiful
I heard you say "Black is beautiful"
We heard you say "Black is beautiful"
We all heard you say "Black, black is beautiful"

[Outro]
So, Big Floyd, man, say, I'm back at it, man
Gettin' back on up, man, you know
We had to do some things, man, to bounce back, man
I'm just sharin' right now, you know what I'm sayin'?
'Cause man, people quick to caught you out, man
But, just shit so, 

[?] in, you know
One thing about the whole flow, man, I love the world
Right with my own, as in by the motion and they know that
You know, 'cause, like
People be actin' like they be scared to embrace God
Worried 'bout that next man gon' say
Man, you got to get down, know what I'm sayin'?
Like I ain't here to show out and all that, you know
You should just break the motivation, somebody to wanna get God
He might need it, or whatever you're goin' through, man
Man, don't let Instagram fool you, man
And get you depressed, lookin' at what other people doing and all that, man
I love you man, Big Floyd, Cuney Home family
I'm ghost

And when that landlord game, lord have mercy

And I'll go chilling with some supermodels that'll take you to the head

Wow, comedic how funny these niggas act

All these cars in my garage, my neighbour feel neglected
Yeah, I let em borrow my swag

Tell me your biggest dream and we gonna live it out

But girl, you can't be scared

Hands, hands, hands, hands to the sky till you can't reach no more

[Verse 1]
I was raised on sundays and one ways
A room with glass stained views
Picture perfect washed in the words
That were my only truth

[Pre-Chorus 1]
It's not that I'm letting you go
Oh, but now I'm all grown up
And I need to know

[Chorus]
I'll make mistakes
But if that's what it takes
Then it's worth starting over again
'Cause I can and I will
And I'll do what I feel
When the world tries to break me, I'll bend
'Cause I can

[Verse 2]
Scared of asking too many questions
Scared to make the choice
From the beginning, you'll be my ending
If you can hear my voice

[Pre-Chorus 2]
'Cause it's not that I'm giving you up
Oh, your name is engraved, oh
And so is your love

[Chorus]
But I'll make mistakes
But if that's what it takes
Then it's worth starting over again
'Cause I can and I will
And I'll do what I feel
When the world tries to break me, I'll bend
'Cause I can

[Bridge]
Oh, always
There's always
Times we have to leave
Oh, but I know that
When I need you
Oh, you will rescue me

[Chorus]
Oh, I'll makes mistakes
But if that's what it takes
Then it's worth starting over again
'Cause I can and I will
And I'll do what I feel
When the world tries to break me, I'll bend
'Cause I can

[Outro]
Oh, when the world tries to break me, I'll bend
'Cause I can

[Verse 1]
Don't like it when you call me precious
Coming out it sounds so vicious
Don't like it when you're sympathizing
With your eyes so patronizing

[Pre-Chorus]
Never say never
You never thought
I wouldn't need you
And neither did I

[Chorus]
No more codependence
No more mending fences
It all leads to bad dreams
Now I'm wide awake
No more psycodrama
No more of your dirty karma
Believe me
I wash my hands clean
Watch me walk away

[Verse 2]
Sorry I don't have a tissue
For all your pathetic issues
Sorry I don't feel so sorry
When you touch me
You're in such a hurry

[Pre-Chorus]
Never say never
You never thought
I wouldn't leave you
And neither did I

[Chorus]
No more codependence
No more mending fences
It all leads to bad dreams
Now I'm wide awake
No more psycodrama
No more of your dirty karma
Believe me
I wash my hands clean
Watch me walk away

[Bridge]
No more no more
Watch me walk away
No more no more
Watch me walk away
No more no more
Watch me walk away
Just watch me walk away
Watch me walk away
There's nothing you can say, no more
Just watch me walk away

[Outro]
No more codependence
No more mending fences (Watch me walk away)
It all leads to bad dreams (No more)
Now I'm wide awake
No more psycodrama (Watch me walk away)
No more of your dirty karma
Believe me
I wash my hands clean
Just watch me walk away
Watch me walk away
Watch me walk away
Saw your picture on accident
Your face has changed
The lines are sinking in
I pressed play, I should haven't
Congratulations
But do you ever wonder what we could have been?
But your mind plays tricks with distance
Always makes things feel so unfinished

I miss you more than I loved you
I do
I miss you more than I loved you
(I wonder what we could have been)
I miss you more than I loved you
I do
I miss you more than I loved you
(I wonder what we could have been)

Saw a balloon floating away
I thought, "did someone let go, or did they lose it?"
So strange, you know all my secrets
Please keep them safe
And darling, you know I'll do the same
(You know I'll do the same)
The window, no longer in existence
Baby, you'll always be in my orbit
I miss you more than I loved you
I do
I miss you more than I loved you
(I wonder what we could have been)
I miss you more than I loved you
Oh, I do
I miss you more than I loved you

We were a match, but not a fake
We were a dream, unrealistic
We didn't lose, we didn't win
(Sometimes I wonder what we could have been) oh

I miss you more than I loved you
Oh, I do

I miss you more than I loved you
(I wonder what we could have been)
I miss you more than I loved you
(The window, no longer in existence)
Oh, I do

I miss you more than I loved you
(You'll always be in my orbit)
Everybody's reading the book
About the boy from Bethlehem
Story of a kid who would change
The world with the palm of his hand
So bring me some toast before you go

Because I'm beginning to see that the story is quite okay
Cuz I've seen movies, and I wear the shirts
But what does this story really say
From my love didn't come from fantasy
Or to play glamorous roles, for the

Company man that we've all made him out to be
Is not what the story has told

So entertain me if you want to
But I've heard it all
If you feel the need to say more than what's been said
But I'm sure Love can stand on His own
But I'm sure Love can stand on His own
Still she sings her top 20
About the boy she doesn't even know
Written by a man they call money
He's winning birds while saving souls
It's of the man, the marketing plans
And a new Mercedes for his 17 year old wife

He's really diggin' on the girl with the top 20
Ain't it funny
For my Love didn't come to win Grammys
Or to be the king of rock n' roll, for the

Company man that we've all made him out to be
Is not what the story has told

So entertain me if you want to
But I've heard it all
If you feel the need to say more than what's been said
But I'm sure Love can stand on His own
Oooh, entertain me if you want to
I'm sure Love can stand on His own
I'm sure Love can stand on His own
Love can stand on His own

So turn your eyes from the glow
And remember the Son

[Hook]
Stuck on, stuck on, stuck on rep-eat
Stuck on, stuck on, stuck on rep-p-p-eat
Stuck on, stuck, on, stuck on repeat
You're always on my mind

[Verse]
I'm moving under city lights, you know I'm never sleeping (no way!)
Always in the club with somebody next to me (someone next to me like)
So knock it back, I want to fill up my cup (woah, ya)
You know I keep it speeding
Always in the club rolling deep like submarines (we keep it rolling all night)

[Pre-Chorus]
And if you're always on my bad side
I’m never, never coming back to you
And if you're always on my bad side
I’m never coming back

[Chorus]
Always on my mind since the day I walked away
Left you behind, can't you see, wish I never pressed delete
Always on my mind since the day I walked away
Can't we rewind?
Can’t believe that you’re stuck, stuck on repeat

[Hook]
Stuck on, stuck on, stuck on rep-eat
Stuck on, stuck on, stuck on rep-p-p-eat
Stuck on, stuck, on, stuck on repeat
You're always on my mind
Stuck on, stuck on, stuck on rep-eat
Stuck on, stuck on, stuck on rep-p-p-eat
Stuck on, stuck, on, stuck on repeat
You're always on my mind

[Verse]
I'm moving under city lights, you know I'm never sleeping (no way!)
Always in the club with somebody next to me (somebody next to me like)
So knock it back, I want to fill up my cup (woah, ya)
You know I keep it speeding
Always in the club rolling deep like submarines (we keep it rolling all night)

[Pre-Chorus]
And if you're always on my bad side
I’m never, never coming back to you
And if you're always on my bad side
I’m never coming back

[Chorus]
Always on my mind since the day I walked away
Left you behind, can't you see, wish I never pressed delete
Always on my mind since the day I walked away
Can't we rewind?
Can’t believe that you're stuck, stuck on repeat

[Hook]
Stuck on, stuck on, stuck on rep-eat
Stuck on, stuck on, stuck on rep-p-p-eat
Stuck on, stuck, on, stuck on repeat
You're always on my mind
Stuck on, stuck on, stuck on rep-eat
Stuck on, stuck on, stuck on rep-p-p-eat
Stuck on, stuck, on, stuck on repeat
You're always on my mind

[Chorus]
Always on my mind since the day I walked away
Left you behind, can't you see, wish I never pressed delete
Always on my mind since the day I walked away
Can't we rewind?
Can't believe that you're stuck, stuck on repeat

[Hook]
Stuck on, stuck on, stuck on rep-eat
Stuck on, stuck on, stuck on rep-p-p-eat
Stuck on, stuck, on, stuck on repeat
You're always on my mind
Stuck on, stuck on, stuck on rep-eat
Stuck on, stuck on, stuck on rep-p-p-eat
Stuck on, stuck, on, stuck on repeat
You're always on my mind

[Intro]
Ah, ah
Run up, run up

[Verse 1]
No, no I ain’t no shy girl
But if you need a reminder
I’m about to push you like a big button (Big button)
I let you cuff me like I did something (Did something)
I’ll be your ride or die girl
Our videos go viral
I’m dressing up like it’s a big function
I’m ‘bout to give it to you, no bluffin’

[Pre-Chorus]
Here we go, here we go, go, go
I can make you scream my name, fucking on the balcony
Here we go, here we go, go, go
I’ma run up on you, oh baby
Here we go, here we go, go, go
Got you down upon on your knees, calling in the cavalry
Here we go, here we go, go, go
I’ma run up on you

[Chorus]
I’ma run up on you
I’ma run up on you
I’ma run up on you
I’ma run up on you (Don't try to fight it)
I’ma run up on you (You like it, like it)
I’ma run up on you (Got you inspired)
I’ma run up on you, ah
I’ma run up on you, baby

[Verse 2]
I told you I was a real one
My love got flow like the ocean
You got it raining baby, go deep
I do it, do it on the repeat
Anytime, you hit my phone when you feel like you need company
I’ma make you feel so good, got you feeling like you’re royalty (Yeah eh eh)

[Pre-Chorus]
Here we go, here we go, go, go
I can make you scream my name, fucking on the balcony
Here we go, here we go, go, go
I’ma run up on you, baby
Here we go, here we go, go, go
Got you down upon on your knees, calling in the cavalry
Here we go, here we go, go, go
I’ma run up on you

[Chorus]
I’ma run up on you (Run up, run up)
I’ma run up on you (Run up, run up)
I’ma  run up on you (Run up, run up)
I’ma run up on you (Don't try to fight it)
I’ma run up on you (You like it, like it)
I’ma run up on you (Got you inspired)
I’ma run up on you, ah
I’ma run up on you, baby

[Bridge]
If you get low, we can get high
Like aeroplanes, we can escape
We can run away
If you get low, we can get high
If you get low, we can get high
Like aeroplanes, we can escape
We can run away
If you get low, we can get high (Yeah)

[Pre-Chorus]
Here we go, here we go, go, go
I can make you scream my name, fucking on the balcony
Here we go, here we go, go, go
I’ma run up on you, baby
Here we go, here we go, go, go
Got you down upon on your knees, calling in the cavalry
Here we go, here we go, go, go
I’ma run up on you, baby

[Chorus]
I’ma run up on you
I’ma run up on you
I’ma run up on you
I’ma run up on you (Don't try to fight it)
I’ma run up on you (You like it, like it)
I’ma run up on you (Got you inspired)
I’ma run up on you, ah
I’ma run up on you, baby

[Verse 1]
Lost right at night laying next to you sleeping
I’m wide awake in your bed
Head on your chest, staring up at the ceiling
Feels like I’m playing pretend
The silence felt violent, been real for the first time
We used to talk until dawn
Head on your chest and I’m feeling you breathing, yeah
But it’s like the oxygen's gone

[Pre-Chorus]
We’re out of time

[Chorus]
It’s 3:05, I’m parked outside
Wondering if I should leave this place behind
No, I can’t decide
Every second longer, it gets harder
I know it’s over and it’s making me nervous
You know I never meant to hurt you on purpose
But it’s time, and I’m staring outside
Trying to find the words to make you feel alright
But I can’t decide
Every second longer, it gets harder
I know it’s over and it’s making me nervous
You know I never meant to hurt you on purpose

[Post-Chorus]
Hurt you on purpose
Hurt you on purpose

[Verse 2]
This is the part where we both try to fix it
Sex for the weekend instead
Instead of us coming to terms with our feelings, ya ya
Some good things were made to forget, ya it’s true

[Pre-Chorus]
We’re out of time

[Chorus]
It’s 3:05, I’m parked outside
Wondering if I should leave this place behind
No, I can’t decide
Every second longer, it gets harder
I know it’s over and it’s making me nervous
You know I never meant to hurt you on purpose
But it’s time, and I’m staring outside
Trying to find the words to make you feel alright
But I can’t decide
Every second longer, it gets harder
I know it’s over and it’s making me nervous
You know I never meant to hurt you on purpose

[Post-Chorus]
Hurt you on purpose
Hurt you on purpose

[Verse 1]
It's only been a couple weeks but I want way more than your body
You got the keys, replicate it
4AM secrets to morning
Are we there at the junction?
Run the lie, I'm about to be honest
Gon' let you in, under my skin
And get to know more than my body

[Chorus]
I won't say no words but I'mma make you feel it
Just a little pressure I'mma make you feel it
All the things I'mma make my body say
Speak to you in a deeper kind of way
I won't say no words but I'mma make you feel it

[Verse 2]
I don’t wanna jump the gun
Hit and run, stay till the sun rise
This connection, the crazy kind
Both afraid to speak with our minds
Say it through sex, biting all of my emotions
If I had a big house, I would always leave it open for you
Walk on in, under my skin
And get to know more than my body

[Chorus]
I won't say no words but I'mma make you feel it
Just a little pressure I'mma make you feel it
All the things I'mma make my body say
Speak to you in a deeper kind of way
I won't say no words but I'mma make you feel it

[Post-Chorus]
I’ma give it, give it all to ya
I’ma give it, give it all to you, aah
I’ma give it, give it all to ya
I’ma make you feel it
I’ma give it, give it all to ya
I’ma give it, give it all to you, aah
I’ma give it, give it all to ya
I’ma make you feel it

(Instrumental break)

[Chorus]
I won't say no words but I'mma make you feel it
Just a little pressure I'mma make you feel it
All the things I'mma make my body say
Speak to you in a deeper kind of way
I won't say no words but I'mma make you feel it

[Post-Chorus]
I’ma give it, give it all to ya
I’ma give it, give it all to you, aah
I’ma give it, give it all to ya
I’ma make you feel it
I’ma give it, give it all to ya
I’ma give it, give it all to you, aah
I’ma give it, give it all to ya
I’ma make you feel it

[Murdoc]
It's a number, isn't it? You know, it's just a number, you know and people are scared of this number. It's just a number!

[Russel]
But what about Octavian?

[2D]
Where did he get that name from?

[Russel]
From uh, Romulus and Remus.

[2D & Murdoc]
Ohhhh...

[2D & Murdoc & Noodle]
Ahhhh.

[Russel]
You could be in a tunnel

[2D]
Hmm.

[Russel]
Sometimes the light is the end of the tunnel.

[2D]
Right.

[Russel]
Sometimes it's just a train.

[Murdoc]
Wow! I'll tell you what though, that must have been a...

[2D]
As soon as you said tunnel there was a train!

[Russel]
That's right.

[2D]
It's always impu– important to remember that every day can be beautiful if you want it to be.

[Russel]
Yeah.

[2D]
I think it's about your perception, don't you think?

[Russel]
And- and– and every day starts in the dark.

[2D]
That's right.

[Russel]
And ends in the dark.

[Murdoc]
Ah man.

[2D]
That's right.

[Russel]
But in the middle there is light.

[2D]
Yeah.
We can't keep playing house
With such a big world outside
How do we shut it out?
At a fork in the road
Should I stay or should I go?
I'll keep the cat
Leave a spare under the mat
If you need to crash one day

Cause I know we swore forever
But it seems so far away
Don't you think we're just too young
To play these grown up games?

Cause you know me too well
It'd be like me lying to myself
But I'm so scared to be alone
And go back to sleeping with the lights on

Cause I can be myself
Drunk or sober fat proactive poster
Wouldn't it be nice
If we were older
Cause I know we swore forever
But it seems so far away
Don't you think we're just too young
To play these grown up games
Some days I wanna take my chances
Not live so modernized
Some day I wanna be a Mrs
But it's not yet quite right
No it's not yet quite right

So there go our future children's names
I put the rest of us in a box in the closet
That I cannot open without getting full
Full of emotion
Because you know I loved you
You know I loved you
You know I loved you
You know I loved you
You know I loved you

Cause I know we swore forever
But it seems so far away
Don't you think we're just too young
To play

One day I wanna take my chances
Not live so modernized
One day I wanna be a Mrs
But it's not yet quite right
No it's not yet quite right
No it's not yet quite right

[Intro]
Why you comin’ down, like whoa?

[Verse 1]
Beemers blazin', I’m gone
Drinkin’ liquor, fucked up
Tried to call you, dial tone
(Why you comin’ down, like whoa?)
When you feel me, ice cold
Why you actin’ loco?
I’m addicted to you
(Why you comin’ down, like whoa?)

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh
Drivin’ through a lonely, lonely night
Thinkin’ ‘bout you
Wishing you were here to hold me tight
Wanna get out, eh-eh
I can’t seem to get you off my mind
Don’t wanna be alone, alone tonight
Don’t wanna be alone, alone tonight

[Chorus]
I don’t know how, I don’t know why
Why you keep running-a-running away
Out of my bed, out of my life
Why you keep running-a-running away
I don’t know how, I don’t know why
I just wanna make you stay
Why you such a run-a-runaway?
Why you such a run-a-runaway? (Oh)

[Verse 2]
Put it on me, don’t front
If you want it, stun gun
Gotta love me for life
(Why you comin’ down, like whoa?)
I’m addicted, pop pills
You're an upper, my thrill
Don’t you know that love kills?
(Why you comin’ down, like whoa?)

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh
Drivin’ through a lonely, lonely night
Thinkin’ ‘bout you
I wish that you were here to hold me tight
Wanna get out, eh-eh
I can’t seem to get you off my mind
Don’t wanna be alone, alone tonight
Don’t wanna be alone, alone tonight

[Chorus]
I don’t know how, I don’t know why
Why you keep running-a-running away
Out of my bed, out of my life
Why you keep running-a-running away
I don’t know how, I don’t know why
I just wanna make you stay
Why you such a run-a-runaway?
Why you such a run-a-runaway? (Oh)

[Bridge]
Driving through a lonely, lonely night
Thinking bout you
Wishing you were here to hold me tight
Wanna get out, eh eh
Can’t seem to get you off my mind
Don’t wanna be alone, alone tonight
Don’t wanna be alone, alone tonight

[Chorus]
I don’t know how, I don’t know why
Why you keep running-a-running away
Out of my bed, out of my life
Why you keep running-a-running away
I don’t know how, I don’t know why
I just wanna make you stay
Why you such a run-a-runaway?
Why you such a run-a-runaway? (Oh)

[Outro]
Why you comin’ down, like whoa?
Why you comin’ down, like whoa?

[Verse 1]
You know I need the windows rolled down
Hundred miles, tires screech
Burnin' rubber, limousine off the chain
I go for 24 hour, neon pink, bring the heat
'Bout to swerve-a-swerve right through your lane

[Pre-Chorus]
It's like we're on the same wave
It's like we're on the same wave, now
We 'bout to go Miami
It's like we're on the same wave, no, no, no

[Chorus]
I wanna hop in the ride, drugs in the ride (Shh)
Drink in the ride, fucked up in the ride
I wanna hop in the ride, drugs in the ride (Shh)
Drink in the ride, fucked up in the ride
I wanna hop in the ride (Right now), drugs in the ride (Right now)
Drink in the ride, fucked up in the ride
I wanna hop in the ride (Right now), drugs in the ride (Right now)
Drink in the ride, fucked up in the ride (I wanna)

[Verse 2]
Foot on the gas
Squeezin’ on it like juice
Pedal pusher, sippin' on lemonade
Kaleidoscope, traffic light
All I see is red and blues
Guess we got a couple friends on the way

[Pre-Chorus]
It's like we're on the same wave
It's like we're on the same wave, now
We 'bout to go Miami
It's like we're on the same wave, no, no, no

[Chorus]
I wanna hop in the ride, drugs in the ride
Drink in the ride, fucked up in the ride
I wanna hop in the ride, drugs in the ride
Drink in the ride, fucked up in the ride
I wanna hop in the ride (Right now), drugs in the ride (Right now)
Drink in the ride, fucked up in the ride (I wanna, yeah)

[Intro]
Hmm-mm
Hmm-mm-mm
Hmm-mm-mm

[Chorus]
What will exist in forever?
Forever nothin' without truth
I can't tell you 'bout the weather
I fell asleep watchin' the news
Love will exist in forever
Forever nothin' without you
I can't tell you 'bout the weather
I fell asleep watchin' the news

[Verse]
Rain, always
The state of mind, flooded brain
Thoughts keep racin' by, jump and pray
Away we fly, day by day
Travel through space and time, save the day
Baby, you wastin' time, a-okay
Make up your crazy mind, fade away
Don't you fade away into an area of grey

[Bridge]
(Ooh-ooh) We are, we are everything but plain
(Ooh-ooh) We are, we are shinin' in the shade
(Ooh-ooh) I am Poseidon on the waves

[Chorus]
What will exist in forever?
Forever nothin' without truth
I can't tell you 'bout the weather
I fell asleep watchin' the news
Love will exist in forever
Forever nothin' without you
I can't tell you 'bout the weather
I fell asleep watchin' the news

[Intro]
Ebola, Ebola

[Verse]
Why you gotta leave town?
When you gonna come back, come back to me?
Why you gotta get 

[?]
When you gonna come, when you gonna come down?
I don’t 

[?]

[?]
I just wanna get down, for ya, for ya, for ya

[Chorus]
Gimme what you need, gimme what you need
Gimme what you need, so gimme what you need
Gimme what you need, gimme what you need
Gimme what you need, gimme what you need

[Post-Chorus]
Let it go, let it go, let it go
Let it go, let it go, let it go now
Let it go, let it go, let it go now, oooh
Let it go, let it go, let it go
Let it go, let it go, let it go now
Let it go, let it go, let it go now, oooh

[Verse]
Why you gotta leave town?
When you gonna come back, come back to me?
Why you gotta get 

[?]
When you gonna come, when you gonna come down?
I don’t

[?]
I just wanna get down, for ya, for ya, for ya

[Post-Chorus]
Let it go, let it go, let it go
Let it go, let it go, let it go now
Let it go, let it go, let it go now, oooh
Let it go, let it go, let it go
Let it go, let it go, let it go now
Let it go, let it go, let it go now, oooh

[Outro]
Ebola, Ebola

[Verse 1]
Marlena under Foster Grants
She's undercover from the dawn's advance
That girl is travel-drained
And the neon mercury vapor stained Miami sky, it's red as meat
It's a cheap pink rose
Otis in the driver's seat
Watches the street lights fade away
On louvered blocks in green sea air
In fluorescent fossil yards
Slippers are shuffling into folding chairs
Freckled hands are shuffling cards

[Chorus]
They've come for fun and sun
While Muslims stick up Washington

[Verse 2]
Otis empties out the trunk
On the steps of that celebrated dump
Sleazing by the sea
Bow down to her royal travesty
In her ballrooms heads of state
In her bedrooms rented girls
Always the grand parades of cellulite
Jiggling to her golden pools
Through flock and cupid colonnades
They jiggle into surgery
Hopefully beneath the blade
They dream of golden beauty

[Chorus]
They've come for fun and sun
While Muslims stick up Washington

[Verse 3]
Marlena, white as stretcher sheet
Watches it all from her tenth floor balcony
Like it's her opera box
All those Pagliacci summer frocks
Otis is fiddling with the TV dial
All he gets are cartoons and reruns
She taps her glass with an emery file
Watching three rings in the sun
The golden dive, the fatted flake
And sizzle in the mink oil
It's all a dream she has awake
Checked into Miami Royal

[Chorus]
Where they've come for fun and sun
While Muslims hold up Washington

[Outro]
Dream on
Dream on
Dream on
Dream on
Dream on

[Verse 1]
It came to pass
Like lightning striking from above
Electric flash
Like lightning striking from above

[Chorus]
Struck by precious love
Precious, precious love, so hopeless and so inspired
Why do you dream flat tires?
You dream flat tires, you dream flat tires

[Verse 2]
With a jack and a spare you're there
Trying to get to where love is
Coming in on a rim and a prayer
Trying to get to where love is

[Chorus]
'Cause love is precious love
You said it was precious when first you felt my fire
Before you dreamed flat tires
You dreamed flat tires, you dream flat tires

[Bridge]
"Woman she bounce back easy
But a man could break both his legs"
Are you telling me that to tease me
Or just to hear me beg?
"Please don't go!"

[Verse 3]
Cause I know that you love me
But when are you going to let love be
Just a vague flirtation
Or extra special company?

[Chorus]
'Cause love is precious love
Everybody knows it's precious when first they feel that fire
Before they dream flat tires
They dream flat tires, they dream flat tires

[Bridge]
"Woman she bounce back easy
But a man could break both his legs"
Do you tell me that to tease me
Or just to hear me beg?
"Please don't be cold"

[Outro]
I know that you love me
But, what are you going to let love do?
(Flat tires, love, love is precious, flat tires
Love, love is precious, flat tires, love
Love is precious)

[Verse 1]
Although I speak in tongues of men and angels
I'm just sounding brass and tinkling cymbals without love
Love suffers long, love is kind
Enduring all things, hoping all things, love has no evil in mind

[Verse 2]
If I had the gift of prophecy
And all the knowledge and the faith to move the mountains
Even if I understood all of the mysteries
If I didn't have love, I'd be nothing

[Verse 3]
Love never looks for love
Love's not puffed up or envious or touchy
Because it rejoices in the truth, not in iniquity
Love sees like a child sees

[Verse 4]
As a child I spoke as a child
I thought and I understood as a child
But when I became a woman, I put away childish things
And began to see through a glass darkly

[Verse 5]
Where as a child I saw it face to face
Now I only know it in part
Fractions in me of faith and hope and love
And of these great three, love's the greatest beauty

[Outro]
Love
Love
Love

[Verse 1]
I came upon a child of God
He was walking along the road
And I asked him, "Where are you going?"
And this he told me

I'm going on down to Yasgur's Farm
I'm gonna join in a rock and roll band
I'm gonna camp out on the land
I'm gonna try and get my soul free

[Chorus]
We are stardust
We are golden
And we've got to get ourselves back to the garden

[Verse 2]
Then can I walk beside you?
I have come here to lose the smog
And I feel to be a cog in something turning
Well maybe it is just the time of year
Or maybe it's the time of man
I don't know who I am
But you know life is for learning

[Chorus]
We are stardust
We are golden
And we've got to get ourselves back to the garden

[Bridge]
By the time we got to Woodstock
We were half a million strong
And everywhere there was song and celebration

And I dreamed I saw the bombers
Riding shotgun in the sky
And they were turning into butterflies
Above our nation

[Chorus]
We are stardust
Billion year old carbon
We are golden
Caught in the devil's bargain
And we've got to get ourselves back to the garden
If there's one rule to this game
Everybody's gonna name
It's be cool
If you're worried or uncertain
If your feelings are hurtin'
You're a fool if you can't keep cool
Charm 'em
Don't alarm 'em
Keep things light
Keep your worries out of sight
And play it cool
Play it cool
Fifty-fifty
Fire and ice

If your heart is on the floor
Cause you've just seen your lover
Comin' through the door with a new fool
Be cool
Don't get riled
Smile-keep it light
Be your own best friend tonight
And play it cool
Play it cool
Fifty-fifty
Fire and ice
Don't get jealous
Don't get over-zealous
Keep your cool
Don't whine
Kiss off that flaky valentine
You're nobody's fool
Be cool fool
Be cool
(Lots of other fish in the sea)

Play it cool
Play it cool
Fifty-fifty
Fire and ice

So if there's one rule to this game
Everybody's gonna name
It's--be cool
If you're worried or uncertain
If your feelings are hurtin'
You're a fool if you can't keep cool
They want you to
Charm 'em
Don't alarm 'em
Keep things light
Keep your worries out of sight
And play it cool
Play it cool
Fifty-fifty
Fire and ice

[Verse 1]
Turning and turning within the widening gyre
The falcon cannot hear the falconer
Things fall apart, the centre cannot hold
And a blood-dimmed tide is loosed upon the world

[Verse 2]
Nothing is sacred, the ceremony sinks
Innocence is drowned in anarchy
The best lack conviction, given some time to think
And the worst are full of passion without mercy

[Chorus]
Surely some revelation is at hand
Surely it's the second coming and the wrath has finally taken form
For what is this rough beast, its hour come at last
Slouching toward Bethlehem to be born
Slouching toward Bethlehem to be born

[Verse 3]
Hoping and hoping, as if with my weak faith
The spirit of this world would heal and rise
Vast are the shadows that straddle and strafe
And struggle in the darkness, troubling my eyes

[Verse 4]
Shaped like a lion, it has the head of a man
With a gaze as blank and pitiless as the sun
As it's moving its slow thighs across the desert sands
Through dark indignant reeling falcons

[Chorus]
Surely some revelation is at hand
Surely it's the second coming and the wrath has finally taken form
For what is this rough beast, its hour come at last
Slouching toward Bethlehem to be born
Slouching toward Bethlehem to be born
Ooh, head of a man, shape of a lion
Shape of a lion

[Verse 5]
Raging and raging, it rises from the deep
Opening its eyes after twenty centuries
Vexed to a nightmare out of a stony sleep
By a rocking cradle by the Sea of Galilee

[Chorus]
Surely some revelation is at hand
Surely it's the second coming and the wrath has finally taken form
For what is this rough beast, its hour come at last
Slouching toward Bethlehem to be born
Slouching toward Bethlehem to be born
Ooh, head of a man, shape of a lion
It's the shape of a lion
Head of a man, shape of a lion
It's the shape of a lion
No tongue in the bell
And the fishwives yell
But they might as well be mute
So you get to keep the pictures
That don't seem like much
Cold white keys under your fingers
Now you're thinking
"That's no substitute
It just don't do it
Like the song of a warm warm body
Loving your touch"

In the court they carve your legend
With an apple in its jaw
And the women that you wanted
They get their laughs
Long silk stockings
On the bedposts of refinement
You're too raw
They think you're too raw
It's the judgement of the moon and stars
Your solitary path
Draw yourself a bath
Think what you'd like to have
For supper
Or take a walk
A park
A bridge
A tree
A river
Revoked but not yet cancelled
The gift goes on
In silence
In a bell jar
Still a song
You've got to shake your fists at lightning now
You've got to roar like forest fire
You've got to spread your light like blazes
All across the sky
They're going to aim the hoses on you
Show 'em you won't expire
Not till you burn up every passion
Not even when you die
Come on now
You've got to try
If you're feeling contempt
Well then you tell it
If you're tired of the silent night
Jesus well then you yell it
Condemned to wires and hammers
Strike every chord that you feel
That broken trees
And elephant ivories conceal
Let me speak let me spit out my bitterness
Born of grief and nights without sleep and festering flesh
Do you have eyes?
Can you see like mankind sees?
Why have you soured and curdled me?
Oh you tireless watcher! What have I done to you?
That you make everything I dread and everything I fear come true?

Once I was blessed; I was awaited like the rain
Like eyes for the blind, like feet for the lame
Kings heard my words, and they sought out my company
But now the janitors of Shadowland flick their brooms at me
Oh you tireless watcher! What have I done to you?
That you make everything I dread and everything I fear come true?

(Antagonists: Man is the sire of sorrow)
I've lost all taste for life
I'm all complaints
Tell me why do you starve the faithful?
Why do you crucify the saints?
And you let the wicked prosper
You let their children frisk like deer
And my loves are dead or dying, or they don't come near
(Antagonists: We don't despise your chastening
God is correcting you)
Oh and look who comes to counsel my deep distress
Oh, these pompous physicians
What carelessness!
(Antagonists: Oh all this ranting all this wind
Filling our ears with trash)
Breathtaking ignorance adding insult to injury!
They come blaming and shaming
(Antagonists: Evil doer)
And shattering me
(Antagonists: This vain man wishes to seem wise
A man born of asses)
Oh you tireless watcher! What have I done to you?
That you make everything I dread and everything I fear come true?

(Antagonists: We don't despise your chastening)
Already on a bed of sighs and screams
And still you torture me with visions
You give me terrifying dreams!
Better I was carried from the womb straight to the grave
I see the diggers waiting, they're leaning on their spades

(Antagonists: Man is the sire of sorrow
Sure as the sparks ascend)
Where is hope while you're wondering what went wrong?
Why give me light and then this dark without a dawn?
(Antagonists: Evil is sweet in your mouth
Hiding under your tongue)
Show your face!
(Antagonists: What a long fall from grace)
Help me understand!
What is the reason for your heavy hand?
(Antagonists: You're stumbling in shadows
You have no name now)
Was it the sins of my youth?
What have I done to you?
That you make everything I dread and everything I fear come true?
(Antagonists: Oh your guilt must weigh so greatly)
Everything I dread and everything I fear come true
(Antagonists: Man is the sire of sorrow)
Oh you make everything I dread and everything I fear come true
Up in a sterilized room
Where they let you be lazy
Knowing your attitude's all wrong
And you got to change
And that's not easy
Dragon shining with all values known
Dazzling you-keeping you from your own
Where is the lion in you to defy him
When you're this weak
And this spacey

So what are you going to do about it
You can't live life and you can't leave it
Advice and religion you can't take it
You can't seem to believe it
The peacock is afraid to parade
You're under the thumb of the maid
You really can't give love in this condition
Still you know how you need it

They open and close you
Then they talk like they know you
They don't know you
They're friends and they're foes too
Trouble child
Breaking like the waves at Malibu
So why does it come as such a shock
To know you really have no one
Only a river of changing faces
Looking for an ocean
They trickle through your leaky plans
Another dream over the dam
And you're lying in some room
Feeling like your right to be human
Is going over too
Well some are going to knock you
And some'll try to clock you
You know it's really hard
To talk sense to you
Trouble child
Breaking like the waves at Malibu
He is three
One's in the middle unmoved
Waiting
To show what he sees
To the other two
To the one attacking so afraid
And the one that keeps trying to love and trust
And getting himself betrayed
In the plan oh
The divine plan
God must be a boogie man!

One's so sweet
So overly loving and gentle
He lets people in
To his innermost sacred temple
Blind faith to care
Blind rage to kill
Why'd he let them talk him down
To cheap work and cheap thrills
In the plan oh
The insulting plan
God must be a boogie man!
Which would it be
Mingus one or two or three
Which one do you think he'd want the world to see
Well world opinion's not a lot of help
When a man's only trying to find out
How to feel about himself
In the plan oh
The cock-eyed plan
God must be a boogie man!
I'm always running behind the time
Just like this train
Shaking into town
With the brakes complaining

I used to count lovers like railroad cars
I counted them on my side
Lately I don't count on nothing
I just let things slide

The station master's shuffling cards
Boxcars are banging in the yards
Jealous lovin'll make you crazy
If you can't find your goodness
'Cause you lost your heart

I went looking for a cause
Or a strong cat without claws
Or any reason to resume
And I found this empty seat
In this crowded waiting room
Everybody waiting
Old man sleeping on his bags
Women with that teased up kind of hair
Kids with the jitters in their legs
And those wide, wide open stares
And the kids got cokes and chocolate bars
There's a thin man smoking a fat cigar
Jealous lovin'll make you crazy
If you can't find your goodness
'Cause you've lost your heart

What are you going to do now
You've got no one
To give your love too

Well I've got this berth and this pull down blind
I've got this fold up sink
And these rocks and these cactus going by
And a bottle of German wine to drink
Settle down into the clickety clack
With the clouds and the stars to read
Dreaming of the pleasure I'm going to have
Watching your hairline recede
My vain darling
Watching your hair and clouds and stars
I'm rocking away in a sleeping car
This jealous lovin's bound to make me crazy
I can't find my goodness
I lost my heart
Oh sour grapes
Because I lost my heart
I pulled up behind a Cadillac
We were waiting for the light
And I took a look at his license plate
It said "Just Ice"
Is justice just ice?
Governed by greed and lust?
Just the strong doing what they can
And the weak suffering what they must?
And the gas leaks
And the oil spills
And sex sells everything
And sex kills
Sex kills

Doctors' pills give you brand new ills
And the bills bury you like an avalanche
And lawyers haven't been this popular
Since Robespierre slaughtered half of France!
And Indian chiefs with their old beliefs know
The balance is undone crazy ions
You can feel it out in traffic
Everyone hates everyone!
And the gas leaks
And the oil spills
And sex sells everything
And sex kills
Sex kills
All these jackoffs at the office
The rapist in the pool
Oh and the tragedies in the nurseries
Little kids packin' guns to school
The ulcerated ozone
These tumors of the skin
This hostile sun beating down on
This massive mess we're in!
And the gas leaks
And the oil spills
And sex sells everything
And sex kills
Sex kills
Sex kills
Sex kills
Sex kills
I met a friend of spirit *
A drunk with sage's eyes
And I sat before his sanity
I was holding back from crying
He saw my complications
And he mirrored me back simplified
And we laughed how our perfection
Would always be denied
"Heart and humor and humility"
He said "Will lighten up your heavy load"
I left him for the refuge of the roads

I fell in with some drifters
Cast upon a beachtown
Winn Dixie cold cuts and highway hand me downs
And I wound up fixing dinner
For them and Boston Jim
I well up with affection
Thinking back down the roads to then
The nets were overflowing
In the Gulf of Mexico
They were overflowing in the refuge of the roads
There was spring along the ditches
There were good times in the cities
Oh radiant happiness
It was all so light and easy
Till I started analyzing
And I brought on my old ways
A thunderhead of judgment was
Gathering in my gaze
And it made most people nervous
They just didn't want to know
What I was seeing in the refuge of the roads

I pulled off into a forest
Crickets clicking in the ferns
Like a wheel of fortune
I heard my fate turn turn turn
And I went running down a white sand road
I was running like a white-assed deer
Running to lose the blues
To the innocence in here
These are the clouds of Michelangelo
Muscular with gods and sungold
Shine on your witness in the refuge of the roads

In a highway service station
Over the month of June
Was a photograph of the earth
Taken coming back from the moon
And you couldn't see a city
On that marbled bowling ball
Or a forest or a highway
Or me here least of all
You couldn't see these cold water restrooms
Or this baggage overload
Westbound and rolling taking refuge in the roads

[Verse 1]
I'm traveling in some vehicle
I’m sitting in some café
A defector from the petty wars
That shell shock love away

[Verse 2]
There's comfort in melancholy
When there's no need to explain
It’s just as natural as the weather
In this moody sky today

[Verse 3]
In our possessive coupling
So much could not be expressed
So now I'm returning to myself
These things that you and I suppressed

[Verse 4]
I see something of myself in everyone
Just at this moment of the world
As snow gathers like bolts of lace
Waltzing on a ballroom girl

[Verse 5]
You know it never has been easy
Whether you do or you do not resign
Whether you travel the breadth of extremities
Or stick to some straighter line

[Verse 6]
Now here's a man and a woman sitting on a rock
They're either going to thaw out or freeze
Listen, strains of Benny Goodman
Coming through the snow and the pinewood trees

[Verse 7]
I'm porous with travel fever
But you know I'm so glad to be on my own
Still somehow the slightest touch of a stranger
Can set up trembling in my bones

[Verse 8]
I know no one's going to show me everything
We all come and go unknown
Each so deep and superficial
Between the forceps and the stone

[Verse 9]
Well I looked at the granite markers
Those tribute to finality to eternity
And then I looked at myself here
Chicken scratching for my immortality

[Verse 10]
In the church they light the candles
And the wax rolls down like tears
There's the hope and the hopelessness
I’ve witnessed thirty years

[Verse 11]
We’re only particles of change I know I know
Orbiting around the sun
But how can I have that point of view
When I'm always bound and tied to someone

[Verse 12]
White flags of winter chimneys
Waving truce against the moon
In the mirrors of a modern bank
From the window of a hotel room

[Verse 13]
I’m traveling in some vehicle
I'm sitting in some café
A defector from the petty wars
Until love sucks me back that way
Caught in the middle
Carol we're middle class
We're middle aged
We were wild in the old days
Birth of rock 'n' roll days
Now your kids are coming up straight
And my child's a stranger
I bore her
But I could not raise her
Nothing lasts for long
Nothing lasts for long
Nothing lasts for long

Down at the Chinese Cafe
We'd be dreaming on our dimes
We'd be playing "Oh my love, my darling"
One more time

Uranium money
Is booming in the old home town now
It's putting up sleek concrete
Tearing the old landmarks down now
Paving over brave little parks
Ripping off Indian land again
How long how long
Short sighted business men
Ah nothing lasts for long
Nothing lasts for long
Nothing lasts for long
Down at the Chinese Cafe
We'd be dreaming on our dimes
We'd be playing "You give your love, so sweetly"
One more time

Christmas is sparkling
Out on Carol's lawn
This girl of my childhood games
With kids nearly grown and gone
Grown so fast
Like the turn of a page
We look like our mothers did now
When we were those kids' age
Nothing lasts for long
Nothing lasts for long
Nothing lasts for long
Down at the Chinese Cafe
We'd be dreaming on our dimes
We'd be playing
"Oh my love, my darling
I've hungered for your touch
A long lonely time
And time goes by so slowly
And time can do so much
Are you still mine?
I need your love
I need your love
God speed your love to me"
(Time goes - where does the time go
I wonder where the time goes)
Cherokee Louise is hiding in this tunnel
In the Broadway bridge *
We're crawling on our knees
We've got flashlights and batteries
We've got cold cuts from the fridge

Last year about this time
We used to climb up in the branches
Just to sway there in some breeze
Now the cops on the street
They want Cherokee Louise

People like to talk
Tongues are waggin' over fences
Waggin' over phones
All their doors are locked
God she can't even come to our house
But I know where she'll go

To the place where you can stand
And press your hands like it was bubblebath
In dust piled high as me
Down under the street
My friend
Poor Cherokee Louise
Ever since we turned thirteen
It's like a minefield
Walking to the door
Going out you get the third degree
And comin' in you get the third world war

Tuesday after school
We put our pennies on the rails
And when the train went by
We were jumpin' round like fools
Goin' "Look no heads or tails"
Goin' "Look my lucky prize"

She runs home to her foster dad
He opens up a zipper
And he yanks her to her knees
Oh please be here please
My friend
Poor Cherokee Louise

Cherokee Louise is hiding in this tunnel
In the Broadway bridge
We're crawling on our knees
We've got Archie and Silver Screen
I know where she is
The place where you can stand
And press your hand like it was bubblebath
In dust piled high as me
Down under the street
My friend
Poor Cherokee Louise
Oh Cherokee Louise
Peridots and periwinkle blue medallions
Gilded galleons spilled across the ocean floor
Treasure somewhere in the sea and he will find where
Never mind their questions there's no answer for
The roll of the harbor wake
The songs that the rigging makes
The taste of the spray he takes
And he learns to give
He aches and he learns to live
He stakes all his silver
On a promise to be free
Mermaids live in colonies
All his seadreams come to me

City satins left at home I will not need them
I believe him when he tells of loving me
Something truthful in the sea your lies will find you
Leave behind your streets he said and come to me
Come down from the neon nights
Come down from the tourist sights
Run down till the rain delights you
You do not hide
Sunlight will renew your pride
Skin white by skin golden
Like a promise to be free
Dolphins playing in the sea
All his seadreams come to me
Seabird I have seen you fly above the pilings
I am smiling at your circles in the air
I will come and sit by you while he lies sleeping
Fold your fleet wings I have brought some dreams to share
A dream that you love someone
A dream that the wars are done
A dream that you tell no one but the grey sea
They'll say that you're crazy
And a dream of a baby
Like a promise to be free
Children laughing out to sea
All his seadreams come to me
The last time I saw Richard was Detroit in '68
And he told me all romantics meet the same fate someday
Cynical and drunk and boring someone in some dark café
You laugh he said you think you're immune
Go look at your eyes they're full of moon
You like roses and kisses and pretty men to tell you
All those pretty lies pretty lies
When you gonna realize they're only pretty lies
Only pretty lies just pretty lies

He put a quarter in the Wurlitzer and he pushed
Three buttons and the thing began to whirr
And a bar maid came by in fishnet stockings and a bow tie
And she said "Drink up now it's getting' on time to close"
"Richard, you haven't really changed" I said
It's just that now you're romanticizing some pain that's in your head
You got tombs in your eyes but the songs you punched are dreaming
Listen, they sing of love so sweet, love so sweet
When you gonna get yourself back on your feet?
Oh and love can be so sweet Love so sweet
Richard got married to a figure skater
And he bought her a dishwasher and a coffee percolator
And he drinks at home now most nights with the TV on
And all the house lights left up bright
I'm gonna blow this damn candle out
I don't want nobody comin' over to my table
I got nothing to talk to anybody about
All good dreamers pass this way some day
Hidin' behind bottles in dark cafes dark cafes
Only a dark cocoon before I get my gorgeous wings and fly away
Only a phase these dark café days
Everybody looks so ill at ease
So distrustful so displeased
Running down the table
I see a borderline
Like a barbed wire fence
Strung tight strung tense
Prickling with pretense
A borderline

Why are you smirking at your friend?
Is this to be the night when
All well-wishing ends?
All credibility revoked?
Thin skin thick jokes!
Can we blame it on the smoke
This borderline?

Every bristling shaft of pride
Church or nation
Team or tribe
Every notion we subscribe to
Is just a borderline
Good or bad we think we know
As if thinking makes things so!
All convictions grow along a borderline
Smug in your jaded expertise
You scathe the wonder world
And you praise barbarity
In this illusionary place
This scared hard-edged rat race
All liberty is laced with
Borderlines

Every income every age
Every fashion-plated rage
Every measure every gauge
Creates a borderline
Every stone thrown through glass
Every mean-streets-kick ass
Every swan caught on the grass
Will draw a borderline

You snipe so steady
You snub so snide
So ripe and ready
To diminish and deride!
You're so quick to condescend
My opinionated friend
All you deface all you defend
Is just a borderline
Just a borderline
Another borderline
Just a borderline
Yesterday a child came out to wonder
Caught a dragonfly inside a jar
Fearful when the sky was full of thunder
And tearful at the falling of a star

Then the child moved ten times round the seasons
Skated over ten clear frozen streams
Words like when you're older must appease him
And promises of someday make his dreams

And the seasons they go round and round
And the painted ponies go up and down
We're captive on the carousel of time
We can't return we can only look
Behind from where we came
And go round and round and round
In the circle game *

Sixteen springs and sixteen summers gone now
Cartwheels turn to car wheels thru the town
And they tell him take your time it won't be long now
Till you drag your feet to slow the circles down
And the seasons they go round and round
And the painted ponies go up and down
We're captive on the carousel of time
We can't return we can only look
Behind from where we came
And go round and round and round
In the circle game

So the years spin by and now the boy is twenty
Though his dreams have lost some grandeur coming true
There'll be new dreams maybe better dreams and plenty
Before the last revolving year is through

And the seasons they go round and round
And the painted ponies go up and down
We're captive on the carousel of time
We can't return we can only look
Behind from where we came
And go round and round and round
In the circle game
You put my heart in your hand

Baby
See

I'm like a dog...

Weight off of me, baby
Just get your weight off of me

Ain't gonna ever get out (Hoo hoo)

I got to keep (No, no, no)

Just get your weight off of me
Ain't gonna ever get out
Just get your weight off of me

Ain't gonna ever get out

Too much-Too much-Too-Too much-Too much stuff

Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! Hoo-hoo-hoo! (Jam)
Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
Jam, jam, here comes the man

[Verse 1]
Nation to nation, all the world must come together
Face the problems that we see then maybe somehow we can work it out
I asked my neighbor for a favor, she said later
What has come of all the people, have we lost love of what it's about?
I have to find my peace cause no one seems to let me be
False prophets cry of doom, what are the possibilities?
I told my brother there'll be problems, times and tears for fears
But we must live each day like it's the last
Go with it, go with it

[Hook]
Jam
It ain’t, It ain’t too much stuff

Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! Hoo-hoo-hoo! (Jam)
Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
Jam, jam, here comes the man

[Verse 2]
The world keeps changing, rearranging minds and thoughts
Predictions fly of doom, the baby boom has come of age, we'll work it out
I told my brothers don't you ask me for no favors
I'm conditioned by the system, don't you talk to me, don't scream and shout
She prays to God, to Buddha, then she sings a Talmud song
Confusions contradict the self, do we know right from wrong?
I just want you to recognize me in the temple
You can't hurt me, I've found peace within myself
Go with it, go with it

[Hook]
Jam
It ain't too much stuff
It ain't too much
It ain't too much for me to
Jam
It ain't, it ain't too much stuff

It ain't too hard for me to jam, it ain't too hard for me to jam

[Verse 3: Heavy D]
Jam, jam, here comes the man
Hot damn, the big boy stands with an upper hand
Makin' funky tracks with my man Michael Jackson
Smooth criminal, that's the man cause Mike's so relaxed
Mingle, mingle, jingle in the jungle
Bum rushed the door, 3 and 4's in a bundle
Execute the plan, first I cooled it like a fan
Got with Janet, then with Guy, now with Michael
Cause it aren’t too hard to

[Intro]
Hoo!

I don't know, bet you wanna try
Every time you see

[Verse 1]
Do you remember when we fell in love?
We were young and innocent then
Do you remember how it all began?
It just seemed like heaven, so why did it end?

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Do you remember, back in the fall?
We’d be together all day long
Do you remember us holding hands?
In each other's eyes, we'd stare
Tell me

[Chorus]
Do you remember the time?
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time?
When we first met, girl
Do you remember the time?
(Oh, I)
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time?

[Verse 2]
Do you remember how we used to talk?
You know, we’d stay on the phone at night till dawn
Do you remember all the things we said?
Like, "I love you so, I'll never let you go"

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Do you remember, back in the spring?
Every morning, birds would sing
Do you remember those special times?
They'll just go on and on
In the back of my mind

[Chorus]
Do you remember the time?
(Oh, I)
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time?
When we first met, girl

[Verse 1]
Nation to nation, all the world must come together
Face the problems that we see then maybe somehow we can work it out
I asked my neighbor for a favor, she said later
What has come of all the people, have we lost love of what it's about?
I have to find my peace cause no one seems to let me be
False prophets cry of doom, what are the possibilities?
I told my brother there'll be problems, times and tears for fears
But we must live each day like it's the last
Go with it, go with it

[Hook]

It ain’t, It ain’t too much stuff
It ain’t too much
It ain’t too much for me to

It ain’t, don't you
It ain’t too much for me to
Jam

[Verse 2]
The world keeps changing, rearranging minds and thoughts
Predictions fly of doom, the baby boom has come of age, we'll work it out
I told my brothers don't you ask me for no favors
I'm conditioned by the system, don't you talk to me, don't scream and shout
She prays to God, to Buddha, then she sings a Talmud song
Confusions contradict the self, do we know right from wrong?
I just want you to recognize me in the temple
You can't hurt me, I've found peace within myself
Go with it, go with it

[Verse 3: Heavy D]
Jam, jam, here comes the man
Hot damn, the big boy stands with an upper hand
Makin' funky tracks with my man Michael Jackson
Smooth criminal, that's the man cause Mike's so relaxed
Mingle, mingle, jingle in the jungle
Bum rushed the door, 3 and 4's in a bundle
Execute the plan, first I cooled it like a fan
Got with Janet, then with Guy, now with Michael
Cause it aren’t too hard to

[Outro]
Get on it
Get on it
Give it baby
Give it to me
Come on
You really give it to me
Got to give it
You just want to give it

[Verse 1]
She always takes it with a heart of stone
'Cause all she does is throw it back to me
I've spent a lifetime looking for someone
Don't try to understand me
Just simply do the things I say

[Chorus]
Love is a feeling
Give it when I want it
'Cause I'm on fire
Quench my desire
Give it when I want it
Talk to me, woman
Give in to me, give in to me

[Verse 2]
You always knew just how to make me cry
And never did I ask you questions why
It seems you get your kicks from hurting me
Don't try to understand me
Because your words just aren't enough

[Chorus]
Love is a feeling
Quench my desire
Give it when I want It
Taking me higher
Love is a woman
I don't wanna hear it
Give in to me, give in to me

[Bridge]
You and your friends were laughing at me in town
But it's okay and it's okay
You won't be laughing girl when I'm not around
I'll be okay
And I'd, I'd never find
Better, a peace of mind, no

[Guitar Solo]

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't try to tell me
Because your words just aren't enough

[Chorus]
Love is a feeling
Quench my desire
Give it when I want It
Taking me higher
Talk to me, woman
Love is a feeling
Give in to me, give in to me, give in to me

[Chorus]
Oh, love is a feeling
I don't wanna hear it
Quench my desire
Takin' me higher
Tell it to the preacher
Satisfy the feeling
Give in to me, give in to me

[Outro]
Give in to the fire
Give in to me
Give in to me
Give in to me
Love is a woman
Give in to me
Give in to me

Give in to me
Give in to me
'Cause I'm on fire
Talk to me, woman
Quench my desire
Give in to the feeling
The story we paint is the wish of a dream
A hard journey traced by hope
How the alignment of the stars
My heart longs for something that couldn't stay
A true lover of the future burned in the sand

Like a scene where I just saw it in my dreams
Birds fly to the ocean
Just as we are genuinely free
My heart keeps beating
As the waves break
And the winds carry
All the memories that make me return to you

[Verse 1]
Fame, (fame) makes a man take things over
Fame, (fame) lets him loose, hard to swallow
Fame, (fame) puts you there where things are hollow
Fame (fame)

[Chorus 1]
Fame, it's not your brain, it's just the flame
That burns your change to keep you in... sane (sane)
Fame (fame)
Fame (fame)
Fame Fa-fa-fame (fame)
(Fame)

[Verse 2]
Fame, (fame) what you like is in the limo
Fame, (fame) what you get is no tomorrow
Fame, (fame) what you need you have to borrow
Fame (fame)
Fame a-a-a-a-a-ame (fame)

[Chorus 2]
Fame, "Nein! It's mine!" is just his line
To bind your time, it drives you to... crime
Fame (fame)
What's your name?
Fame

[Bridge]
Could it be the best, could it be?
Really be, really, babe?
Could it be, my babe, could it, babe?
Could it, babe? Could it, babe?

[Verse 3]
Is it any wonder I reject you first?
Fame, (fame) fame, fame, fame (fame)
Is it any wonder you are too cool to fool
Fame (fame)
Fame a-a-a-a-ame (fame)

[Chorus 3]
Fame, bully for you, chilly for me
Got to get a rain check on... pain (pain)
(Fame)

[Outro]
Fame, fame, fame, fame, fame, fame, fame, fame
Fame, fame, fame, fame, fame, fame, fame, fame
Fame, fame, fame, fame, fame, fame, fame

[Intro: Kanye West]
We at war
We at war with terrorism, racism
But most of all we at war with ourselves
Jahlil Beats, holla at me

[Verse 1]
Skin head, dead head, everybody gone bad
Situation, aggravation, everybody, allegation
In the suit, on the news, everybody, dog food
Bang bang, shot dead, everybody's gone mad

[Chorus]
All I wanna say is that they don’t really care about us
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us

[Verse 2]
Beat me, hate me, you can never break me
Will me, thrill me, you can never kill me
Jew me, sue me, everybody do me
Kick me, kike me, don't you black or white me

[Chorus]
All I wanna say is that they don’t really care about us
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us

[Post-Chorus]
Tell me, what has become of my life?
I have a wife and two children who love me
I am the victim of police brutality, now
I'm tired of being the victim of hate
You're ripping me of my pride, oh, for God's sake
I look to heaven to fulfill its prophecy, set me free

[Verse 3]
Skin head, dead head, everybody's gone bad
Trepidation, speculation, everybody, allegation
In the suit, on the news, everybody, dog food
Black male, blackmail, throw the brother in jail

[Chorus]
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us

[Post-Chorus]
Tell me, what has become of my rights?
Am I invisible ’cause you ignore me?
Your proclamation promised me free liberty, now
I’m tired of being the victim of shame
They're throwing me in a class with a bad name
I can’t believe this is the land from which I came
You know, I really do hate to say it
The government don't wanna see
But if Roosevelt was livin'
He wouldn't let this be, no, no

[Verse 4]
Skin head, dead head, everybody’s gone bad
Situation, speculation, everybody, litigation
Beat me, bash me, you can never trash me
Hit me, kick me, you can never get me

[Chorus]
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us

[Bridge]
Some things in life
They just don't wanna see
But if Martin Luther was livin'
He wouldn't let this be, no, no

[Verse 5]
Skin head, dead head, everybody's gone bad
Situation, segregation, everybody, allegation
In the suit, on the news, everybody, dog food
Kick me, kike me, don't you wrong or right me

[Chorus]
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us
Time passes slowly up here in the mountain
We sit beside the bridges and walk beside the fountains
Catch the wild fishes that float though the stream
Time passes slowly when you're lost in a dream

Once I had a sweetheart, she was fine and good-looking
She sat in the kitchen while her mama was cooking
Stared on out the window to the stars high above
Time passes slowly when you're searching for love

Ain't no reason to go in a wagon to town
Ain't no reason to go to the fair
Ain't no reason to go up, ain't no reason to go down
Ain't no reason to go anywhere

Time passes slowly up here in the daylight
We stare straight ahead and try so hard to stay right
Like the red rose of summer that blooms in the day
Time passes slowly and fades away

[Intro]
I don't know, bet you wanna try
Every time you see

[Verse 1]
Do you remember when we fell in love?
We were young and innocent then
Do you remember how it all began?
It just seemed like heaven, so why did it end?

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Do you remember, back in the fall?
We'd be together all day long
Do you remember us holding hands?
In each other's eyes, we'd stare
Tell me

[Chorus]
Do you remember the time?
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time?
When we first met, girl
Do you remember the time?
(Oh, I)
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time?

[Verse 2]
Do you remember how we used to talk?
You know, we'd stay on the phone at night till dawn
Do you remember all the things we said?
Like, "I love you so, I'll never let you go"

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Do you remember, back in the spring?
Every morning, birds would sing
Do you remember those special times?
They'll just go on and on
In the back of my mind

[Chorus]
Do you remember the time?
(Oh, I)
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time?
When we first met, girl
Do you remember the time?
(Oh, I)
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time?

[Bridge]
Those sweet memories
Will always be dear to me
And girl no matter what was said
I will never forget what we had
Now baby

[Chorus]
Do you remember the time?
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time?
When we first met, girl
Do you remember the time?
(Oh, I)
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time?

Till dawn, two or three
What about us, girl?

Do you, do you?
In the park, on the beach

You and me, in Spain
What about, what about

Grrrrrat, tat tat, tat

After dark, do you, do you, do you?

Do you, do you, do you, did you?

Yeah, yeah, hoo!

[Intro: Princess Stephanie of Monaco]
There are no secrets

[Verse 1: Michael Jackson]
She's just a lover
Who's doing me by
It's worth the giving
It's worth the try
You cannot cleave it
Or put it in the furnace
You cannot wet it
You cannot burn it

[Refrain: Michael Jackson]
She wants to give it
(She wants to give it)

You can't neglect it
You can't abuse it
It's just desire
You cannot waste it
Then, if you want it
Then, won't you taste it

[Refrain: Michael Jackson]
She wants to give it

One thing in life you must understand
The truth of lust, woman to man
So open the door and you will see
There are no secrets
Make your move
Set me free

[Chorus: Michael Jackson]
Because there's something about you baby
That makes me want to give it to you
I swear there's something about you baby
Just promise me whatever we say
Or whatever we do to each other
For now we will be making a vow, to just
Keep it in the closet

[Verse 3: Michael Jackson + Princess Stephanie of Monaco]
If you can get it
It is worth a try
I really want it
I can't deny
It's just desire
I really love it
'Cause if it's aching
You have to rub it

[Refrain: Michael Jackson]
She wants to give it

Keep it in the closet

These hands aren't the hands of a gentleman
These hands are calloused and old
But these hands raised a family
These hands built a home

Now these hands raise to pray the Lord
These hands won the heart of my loved one
And with hers they were never alone
If these hands filled their task
Then what more can one ask?
For these fingers have worked to the bone

Now don't try to judge me by what you'd like to be
For my life ain't been much success
While some people have power, but still they grieve
While these hands brought me happiness

Now I'm tired and I'm old and I ain't got much gold
Maybe things ain't been all that I planned
But Lord above, hear my plea, when it's time to take me
Take a look at these hard-workin' hands

[Chorus]
I enjoyed, your bud, your bud with me
I enjoyed, your bud, your bud with me
I enjoyed, your bud, your bud with me

[Line 1]
You so fine, but why are you so sexy?
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh yeaaah
Chronic weed, is what I need
No steams, no seeds
Smoke with me darling, smoke with me tonight
Smoke with me... girl

[Chorus]
I enjoyed, your bud, your bud with me
I enjoyed, your bud, your bud with me
I enjoyed, your bud, your bud with me

[Line 2]
It made me horny, because you are so sexy
I had a back, and I just couldn't understand
Will you put some weed and your phone number in my hand?

[Chorus]
I enjoyed, your bud, your bud with me
I enjoyed, your bud, your bud with me
I enjoyed, your bud, your bud with me

[Line 3]
Will you smoke a blunt with me tonight, baby?
Will you smoke a blunt with me tonight, lady?
Will you smoke a blunt with me tonight, baby?
Will you smoke a blunt with me tonight, lady?

And she don't put me down when her friends around
She keeps my beers cold
I let my guards down
And yeah, she is my lover and my friend

Well, I found someone better than you
And she don't treat me like you do
I found someone better than you
And she don't treat me like you do

[Verse 3: Lil Yachty]

[Outro: Lil Yachty]
Frrt
Sada, Boat, Sada
Fuck 'em, fuck 'em
Haha

[Verse 1]
I've been consumed, with the idea
Of finding the one, falling head over heels
Am I just a fool? A desperate cliché
Should I resist or let my heart have its way

[Chorus]
The thought of us keeps ringing in my head
I guess I'm just addicted to the butterflies, the ups and downs
The 4 AM euphoria
I tell myself "she'll only let you down"
I'm hopeless in her hand
So I fall in love again

[Verse 2]
I'm often confused, consistently blindly
Following footsteps in hopes I might find
But in comes the time, not even surprised
That once again love has left me behind

[Chorus]
Still the thought of us keeps ringing in my head
I guess I'm just addicted to the butterflies, the ups and downs
The 4 AM euphoria
I tell myself "she'll only let you down"
I'm hopeless in her hand
So I fall in love again
No, love

[Bridge]
And I say "hey, love, don't break me"
Every time I think I'm over you
You pull me back again
And I say "please, love, have mercy"
Every beginning swears I'm different
But they always end the same

[Chorus]
Still the thought of us keeps ringing in my head
She is loving, I can't give her up just yet
So I fall in love again
Again and again and again
Again and again and again
She is loving, I can't give her up just yet

[Verse 1]
Nation to nation, all the world must come together
Face the problems that we see then maybe somehow we can work it out
I asked my neighbor for a favor, she said later
What has come of all the people, have we lost love of what it's about?
I have to find my peace cause no one seems to let me be
False prophets cry of doom, what are the possibilities?
I told my brother there'll be problems, times and tears for fears
But we must live each day like it's the last
Go with it, go with it

The world keeps changing, rearranging minds and thoughts
Predictions fly of doom, the baby boom has come of age, we'll work it out
I told my brothers don't you ask me for no favors
I'm conditioned by the system, don't you talk to me, don't scream and shout
She prays to God, to Buddha, then she sings a Talmud song
Confusions contradict the self, do we know right from wrong?
I just want you to recognize me in the temple
You can't hurt me, I've found peace within myself
Go with it, go with it

They said she had a breakdown
Someone's always tryin'

Talkin', squealin', lyin'
Sayin' you just want to be startin' somethin'

Treacherous, cunnin', declinin'
You got my baby cryin' (Hee)

[Verse 2]
The world keeps changing, rearranging minds and thoughts
Predictions fly of doom, the baby boom has come of age, we'll work it out
I told my brothers don't you ask me for no favors
I'm conditioned by the system, don't you talk to me, don't scream and shout
She prays to God, to Buddha, then she sings a Talmud song
Confusions contradict the self, do we know right from wrong?
I just want you to recognize me in the temple
You can't hurt me, I've found peace within myself
Go with it, go with it

And when the groove is dead and gone (Yeah)
You know that love survives
So we can rock forever, on

Feel the beat

Feel the heat
Feel the beat

[Verse 1]
Girl, close your eyes
Let that rhythm get into you
Don't try to fight it
There ain't nothin' that you can do
Relax your mind
Lay back and groove with mine

[Pre-Chorus]
You gotta feel that heat
And we can ride the boogie
Share that beat of love

I wanna rock with you (All night)
Dance you into day (Sunlight)
I wanna rock with you (All night)
We're gonna rock the night away (Rock, right)

Out on the floor
There ain't nobody there but us
Girl, when you dance
There's a magic that must be love
Just take it slow
'Cause we got so far to go

[Pre-Chorus]
When you feel that heat
And we're gonna ride the boogie
Share that beat of love

I wanna rock with you (All night)

[Verse 1]
Nation to nation, all the world must come together
Face the problems that we see then maybe somehow we can work it out
I asked my neighbor for a favor, she said later
What has come of all the people, have we lost love of what it's about?
I have to find my peace cause no one seems to let me be
False prophets cry of doom, what are the possibilities?
I told my brother there'll be problems, times and tears for fears
But we must live each day like it's the last
Go with it, go with it

She prays to God, to Buddha, then she sings a Talmud song

Did you watch the news today?
Did you hear what they said?

[Verse 1: will.i.am]
One thousand more people passed away
Aw, nah, somebody tell me what's going on
New York, New York, big city of dreams
There's a nightmare goin' down from the Bronx to Queens
And everywhere in between
We fighting somethin' we can't even see
There's an invisible enemy
Just knocked out Italy
Keep the mask on 'cause if you cough they gon' look at you like you did a felony
And they said we can't hug nobody
Not until we find a remedy
So we pray for Spain, France, and the U.K. 
China and U.S.A., I pray we gon' be okay
Pray for the grandmas and grandpas
So they can live to see another day

[Refrain: will.i.am]
Did you watch the news today?
Did you hear what they said?

[Verse 2: apl.de.ap]
They say don't worry folks, it's all a hoax
The news is fake and it's all a joke
The death toll's rising with broken hopes
Now they got the cure and a antidote
Inject yourself with the bleach and soap
And a check's in the mail 'cause they know we're broke

[Refrain: will.i.am]
Did you watch the news today?
Did you hear what they said?

[Verse 3: Taboo & will.i.am, Both]
They said no one's allowed to see the Pope
It's a ghost town coast to coast
We're just people that's tryna cope
From different sides with different strokes
Livin' different lives from different tribes
But everybody's in the same boat

[Refrain: will.i.am]
Did you hear the news today?

[Verse 4: will.i.am]
They say the world is one
'Cause we're all fighting a war
But nobody pick up a gun
We got nurses and doctors
They fightin' in the front line, savin' lifes
I'm waitin' in line, I'm frightened
In the store, ah, that's the hero
Behind the counter
They makin' the world go round
Riskin' new encounters
They in the front line
Dying for the minimum wage

[Refrain: will.i.am]
Did you watch the news today?
Did you hear what they said?

[Verse 5: apl.de.ap & will.i.am, Both]
They say stay in the house, don't step out
If you step out, put the mask on the mouth
Six feet back, virus attack
Soap on the hands so your lungs don't collapse
Don't know the truth, don't know the facts
Ro-ro killin' all the brown and the black

[Verse 6: will.i.am]
COVID-19 got us on our knees
Got the temperature risin', 106 degrees
It don't care if you speak Cantonese
François or Portuguese, Español or Japanese
Gotta start sayin', "I can't breathe"
Ah, isn't it ironic?
When we can't breathe, the planet breathes
And we can see blue sky, blue seas, green leaves, birds and bees
I don't know what to believe
All the lies or conspiracies

[Refrain: will.i.am]
Aw, did you hear the news today?
Did you hear what they said?

[Outro: will.i.am]
One thousand more people passed away
Aw, nah, somebody tell me what's going on
And on, and on, and on, and on, and on, and on, and on
On, and on, and on, and on, and on, and on
Somebody tell me what's going on

Talk about a range of subjects, anything you like
Oh yeah

But we always came back to the song we were singing
At any particular time
Yeah, we always came back to the song we were singing
At any particular time

For a while, we could sit, smoke a pipe
And discuss all the vast intricacies of life
We could jaw through the night
Talk about a range of subjects, anything you like

But we always came back to the song we were singing
At any particular time
Yeah, we always came back to the song we were singing
At any particular time
Wake up from your dream, come and take the day
You wanna look bright, but you don't know what to say
Hold on to your love, hold on to the string she gives you
Never runs away, never runs
Never runs away, never runs

For a while, we could sit, smoke a pipe
And discuss all the vast intricacies of life
We could jaw through the night
Talk about a range of subjects, anything you like

But we always came back to the song we were singing
At any particular time
...back to the song we were singing
At any particular time

Hang on to your hat while you make a move
You wanna be bold, but there's nothing left to prove
Go on and enjoy the love that is staring at you
Never runs away, never runs
Never runs away, never runs

For a while, we could sit, smoke a pipe
And discuss all the vast intricacies of life
Yeah, we could jaw through the night
Talk about a range of subjects, anything you like
But we always came back to the song we were singing
At any particular time
Always came back to the song we were singing
Oh yeah
I saw you sitting in the center of a circle
Everybody, everybody wanted something from you
I saw you sitting

I saw you swaying to the rhythm of the music
Caught you praying, caught you playing with the voice inside you
I saw you swaying there

I don't know what you want to be
I go back so far, he's in front of me
I don't care what you're gonna say
As long as the people say, "Hey, hey, hey"

I can see the future
I can see the world tonight
Love will make me happy
And the future bright

I saw you sitting at the center of an earthquake
Saw you shaking, saw you shaking with the world around you
You sitting there
I don't know what you want to be
I go back so far, he's in front of me
I don't care what you're gonna say
As long as the people say, "Hey, hey, hey"

I can see the future
I can see the world tonight
Mmm
Some days I look
I look at you with eyes that shine
Some days I don't
I don't believe that you are mine

It's no good asking me what time of day it is
Who won the match or scored the goal
Some days I look
Some days I look at you with eyes that shine

Sometimes I laugh
I laugh to think how young we were
Sometimes it's hard
It's hard to know which way to turn

Don't ask me where I found that picture on the wall
How much it cost or what it's worth
Sometimes I laugh
I laugh to think how young we were

We don't need anybody else
To tell us what is real
Inside each one of us is love
And we know how it feels
Some days I cry
I cry for those who live in fear
Some days I don't
I don't remember why I'm here

No use reminding me what time of day it is
Who ran the race or came in first
Some days I cry
I cry for those who live in fear

Some days I look
I look at you with eyes that shine

We don't need anybody else
To tell us what is real
Inside each one of us is love
And we know how it feels

Some days I look
I look at you with eyes that shine
Some days I don't
I don't believe that you are mine

It's no good asking me what time of day it is
Who won the match or scored the goal?
Some days I look
I look at you with eyes that shine
Some days I look
Some days I look into your soul

[Verse 1]
He's just a poor boy looking for a way to find love
It isn't easy, nothing you can say will help him find love
He has to do it for himself, and it can take so long

[Verse 2]
He doesn't need another helping hand from someone
But please don't think he fails to understand that he wants someone
He has to do it for himself, and it can take so long

[Bridge]
Better know that you'll be there when he decides to call
But remember you can't share it all

[Verse 1]
He's just a young boy looking for a way to find love
It isn't easy, nothing you can say will help him find love
He has to do it for himself, and it can take so long
Looking for a way to find love
It was written that I would love you
From the morning I opened my eyes
And the moment when I first saw you
Gave me life under calico skies

Long live all of us crazy soldiers
Who were born under calico skies
May we never be called to handle
All the weapons of war they despise

I will hold you for as long as you'd like
I’ll hold you for the rest of my life

It was written that I would love you
From the moment I opened my eyes
And the morning when I first saw you
Gave me life under calico skies

I'll hold you for as long as you'd like
I’ll hold you for the rest of my life
For the rest of my
For the rest of my life
That's my producer
Making love underneath the bed
Shooting stars from a purple sky
I don't care how you do it
I'm the man on the flaming pie

Stick my tongue out and lick my nose
I tuck my shirt in and zip my fly
Go ahead, have a vision
I'm the man on the flaming pie

Everything I do has a simple explanation
When I'm with you, you could do with a vacation
I took my brains out and stretched them on the rack
Now I'm not so sure I'm ever going to get them back

Go ahead, check my rhythm
I'm the man on the flaming pie
Go ahead, have a vision
I'm the man on the flaming pie

Hey!

[Verse]
When you're fed up, shedding so many tears
And your memories feel like just so many souvenirs
I will come to you to ease the pain

[Chorus]
Should you love me, tell me now
I don’t want to hang around this place anyhow
If you love me, let me know
I don't want to hang around this place too long

[Verse]
When you're fed up, shedding too many tears
And your memories seem like just so many souvenirs
I will come to you to ease the pain

[Chorus]
Should you want me, let me know
I don’t wanna hang around this place too long
If you love me, tell me now
Girl, I don't wanna hang around this place anyhow
If you love me, let me know
I don't wanna hang around this place too long
If you love me, tell me now
Lord, we don't wanna hang around here anyhow
Bend, little willow
Wind's going to blow you hard and cold tonight
Life, as it happens
Nobody warns you, willow, hold on tight

Nothing's going to shake your love
Take your love away
Nothing's out to break your heart
It only seems that way today

Sleep little willow, peace going to follow
Time will heal your wounds

Nothing's going to shake your love
Take your love away
No one wants to break your heart
It only seems that way today

Bend, little willow
Wind's going to blow you hard and cold tonight
Hard and cold tonight
Someone's gone out fishing, someone's high and dry
Someone's on a mission to the lonely Lorelei
Some folk's got a vision of a castle in the sky
And I'm left stranded, wondering why

I don't need a rowboat, i don't need a wood
Even if I get a medal from my local neighborhood
I won't need a castle, they've got castles in Versailles
And I'm left stranded, wondering why

Things can go wrong, things can go right
Things can go bump in the dead of the night
Let me be there, let me be there
Let me be there with you in the dead of the night

Make it a beautiful night for me
It's a beautiful night for love
A wonderful sight for lovers in love to behold
Make it a beautiful night for me
It's a beautiful night for love
A wonderful sight for lovers of love to behold
Some boat's on the ocean, we're here in this room
Seems to me the perfect way to end an afternoon
We can look for castles, pretty castles in the sky
No more wondering, wondering why

Things can go wrong, things can go right
Things can go bump in the dead of the night
Let me be there, let me be there
Let me be there with you in the dead of the night

Make it a beautiful night for me
It's a beautiful night for love
A wonderful sight for lovers of love to behold
Make it a beautiful night for me
It's a beautiful night for love
A wonderful sight for lovers of love to behold

Make it a beautiful night for me
It's a beautiful night for love
A wonderful sight for lovers of love to behold
Make it a beautiful night for me
Oh, it's such a...
When you're wide awake, say it for goodness sake
It's going to be a great day
While you're standing there, get up and grab a chair
It's going to be a great day

And it won't be long, oh no
It won't be long, it won't be long, no no
It won't be long, it won't be long, no no
It won't be long, it won't be long

When you're wide awake, say it for goodness sake

It won't be long, it won't be long

It's going to be a great day

And it won't be long, oh no
It won't be long, it won't be long, no no
It won't be long, it won't be long, no no
It won't be long, it won't be long
Let's just try it through, see if this length and stuff is gonna work, yeah? Okay

Why don't I just come in at the top even though I know on the real record I'll go through the second one so I can get into it?

Yeah, okay. Two three...

Someone's gone out fishing, someone's high and dry
Someone's on a mission to the lonely Lorelei
Some folk's got a vision of a castle in the sky
I'm left stranded, wondering why
You and me together, nothing feels so good
Even if I get a medal from my local neighborhood
I won't need a castle, they've got castles in Versailles
And I'm still stranded, wondering why

Make it a beautiful night for me
It's a beautiful night for love
A wonderful sight for lovers of love to behold
Make it a beautiful night for me
It's a beautiful night for love
A wonderful sight for lovers of love to behold
Some boat's on the ocean, we're here in this room
Seems to me the perfect way to spend an afternoon
We can look for castles, pretty castles in the sky
No more wondering, wondering why
Things can go wrong, things can go right
Things can go bump in the dead of the night
So let me be there, let me be there
Let me be there with you in the dead of the night

Make it a beautiful night for me
It's a beautiful night for love
A wonderful sight for lovers of love to behold
Make it a beautiful night for me
It's a beautiful night for love
A wonderful sight for lovers of love to behold

Yeah, it's a beautiful night
Yeah, it's a beautiful night
Yeah, it's a beautiful night
Yeah, it's a beautiful night
Yeah, it's a beautiful night
Yeah, it's a beautiful night

I Love This House

[Verse 1]
Cracks in the pavement, cracks in the road
Cracks in the ceiling where the bathtube overflowed
Overflowed
Holes in the gutters, holes in the slate
Holes in the carpet, but i won't evacuate

[Chorus]
I love this house, it's where i'll stay
Eat and sleep the night and day
I love this house, it's where i'll be
For you to spend some time with me
I love this house

[Verse 2]
Damp in the basement, damp in the hall
Damp in the living room that's climbing up the wall
Up the wall
Rust in the drainpipe, rust in the spout
Rust in the radiators still won't get me out

[Chorus]
I love this house, it's where i'll stay
Eat and sleep the night and day
I love this house, it's where I'll be
For you to spend some time with me
I love this house

[Bridge]
Hot in the summer
Rattling windows, teeth and knees
Perfect place for cat and mouse
But never mind, I love this house
Ow!

[Verse 1]
Cracks in the pavement, cracks in the road
Cracks in the ceiling where the bathtub overflowed
Holes in the gutters, holes in the slate
Holes in the carpet, but I won't evacuate

[Chorus]
I love this house, it's where i'll stay
To eat and sleep the night and day
I love this house, it's where i'll be
For you to spend some time with me
I love this house

Oobu Joobu

Paul talks about "Young Boy"
“Young Boy” was another of these “set yourself an arbitrary deadline”

[Intro: Luke Steele]
Danger in the street, lookin' into my eye
Seems like I'm feelin' the last time
Strange things over me, changin' up my life
All these feelings come out, out
Woah

[Chorus: Luke Steele]
Hel-el-el-el-lo, he-el-el-el-lo
What you say? (Danger)
Hel-el-el-el-lo, he-el-el-el-lo
What you say? (Ooh)

[Verse 1: Aminé]
(Mic check, mic check, free)
Look, I'm a hot boy, you know I'd be with her sun be
Used to be a bum, now I'm looking like I'm Bun B
Had to go crazy, had to go crazy
These niggas don't faze me, these niggas don't faze me
Hello world, I'm the mighty one
Y'all Aminé's sons, bought a Rivian
Say somethin' when you want to say it
Don't second guess it like you scared of somethin' (Yeah)
Good riddance to the barbershop (Yeah)
Open up a new coffee shop
Who the fuck are you? Danger coming like a petty cop

[Chorus: Luke Steele & Aminé]
Hel-el-el-el-lo (Limbo), he-el-el-el-lo
What you say? (Danger)
Hel-el-el-el-lo (Hello), he-el-el-el-lo (Hello)
What you say? (Uh, let me tell you)

[Verse 2: Aminé]
Shoppin' so much that my arm gettin' stretch marks
Stuntin' like a winner but I treat her like a sweetheart (Yeah)
The brain so stupid, A-K-A, you know the head smart (True)
Y'all thought y'all was ahead, but I just gave you a head start
Hi hater, bye hater, hello to the world
And hell nah if you want a favor, run into my thoughts
In the fall 'cause the summer's stupid, A-K-A, I gotta do it
You know we been cookin', boy, y'all ain't danger to us

[Chorus: Luke Steele & Aminé]
Hel-el-el-el-lo (Limbo), he-el-el-el-lo (Limbo)
What you say? (Danger)
Hel-el-el-el-lo (Hello), he-el-el-el-lo (Hello)
What you say? (Uh, let me tell you, Limbo)

[Pre-Chorus]
Centre of attention
You know you can get whatever you want from me
Whenever you want it, baby
It's you in my reflection
I'm afraid of all the things it could do to me
If I would've known it, baby

[Chorus]
I would've stayed at home
'Cause I was doing better alone
But when you said, "Hello"
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home
'Cause I was doing better alone
But when you said, "Hello"
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?
I should've stayed at home
But when you said, "Hello"
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?

[Bridge]
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

[Pre-Chorus]
Centre of attention
You know you can get whatever you want from me
Whenever you want it, baby
It's you in my reflection
I'm afraid of all the things it could do to me
If I would've known it, baby

[Chorus]
I would've stayed at home
'Cause I was doing better alone
But when you said, "Hello"
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?

[Verse 1]
Now, if I give you me, this is how it's got to be
First of all, I won't take you cheatin' on me
Tell me, who can I trust if I can't trust in you?
And I refuse to let you play me for a fool (Yeah, yeah)

[Pre-Chorus]
You said that we could possibly spend eternity
But if you want me, you have to be fulfilling all my dreams
If you really want me, bae (Baby)
If you really want me, bae (Baby)
If you really want me, bae (Baby)

[Chorus]
If you had my love, and I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me?
(Comfort me? Ooh, tell me, baby)
If you had my love, and I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me?
Tell me, baby
Would you comfort me? (Yeah, comfort me)
Would you comfort me? (Yeah)
Would you comfort me?
Tell me, baby
Would you comfort me?
Tell me right now
Would you comfort me? (Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah)
Tell me, baby (Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah)
Tell me, baby (Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah) (Would you comfort me?)
Tell me, baby (Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah) (Would you comfort me?)

[Verse 2]
You said you want my love and you've got to have it all
But first, there are some things you need to know
If you wanna live with all I have to give
I need to feel true love or it's got to end, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't want you trying to get with me
And I end up unhappy
So before I do give myself to you (Mmm)
I have to know the truth
If I spend my life with you

[Chorus]
If you had my love, and I gave you all my trust (Had my love, gave you trust)
Would you comfort me? What would you do, babe? Tell me right now
If you had my love, and I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me? (Tell me, baby)
Tell me right now

[Bridge]
Ooh, na na na
Ooh, na na na (Ooh)
I need to know
If you really want me, baby (I need to know)
Ooh, if i gave it to you
I need to know
What would you do, if I gave it to you?
I need to know
Ooh, na na na

[Chorus]
If you had my love (Had my love), and I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me? (What would you do, babe? Would you comfort me?)
Tell me right now
If you had my love and I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me? Would you comfort me?
If you had my love, and I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me?

[Verse 1]
I've always been the one to say the first goodbye
Had to love and lose a hundred million times
Had to get it wrong to know just what I like
Now I'm falling
You say my name like I have never heard before
I'm indecisive, but, this time, I know for sure
I hope I'm not the only one that feels it all
Are you falling?

I would've stayed at home
I would've
Stayed at home

[Bridge]
Break my heart
Break my heart
Break my heart
Break my heart
Break my heart
Break my heart
Break my heart
Break my heart
Better alone
Better alone
Break my heart
Break my heart
Break my heart
Break my heart
Break my heart
Break my heart
Break my heart
Break my heart
Break my heart

[Verse 2]
I wonder, when you go, if I stay on your mind
Two can play that game, but you win me every time
Everyone before you was a waste of time (I know)
Yeah, you got me

[Pre-Chorus]
Centre of attention
You know you can get whatever you want from me
Whenever you want it, baby
It's you in my reflection
I'm afraid of all the things it could do to me
If I would've known it, baby (Baby)

[Bridge]
Break my heart
Break my heart
Break my heart
Break my heart
Break my heart (ooh, ooh)
Break my heart (ooh, ooh)
Break my heart (Ooh, ooh)
Break my heart (ooh, ooh)

[Outro]
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?
(I would've stayed at home 'cause I–)
Better alone

Ooh ma, ooh pa

[Verse 1]
Do I have to stand up, wild eyed in the spotlight?
Fuck me, what a nightmare, who's there?
Have they all gone?

[Bridge]
It's okay now you're in luck
The worms have fled the rising sun
Their evil power is on the way
Forget the past and start again

It was just a mistake
I didn't mean to let them take away my soul
Am I too old?
Is it too late?

Ooh ma, ooh pa
Your mother's so sorry now
Ooh ma, ooh pa
Your mother's so sorry now

Oh, my God, can't believe what I saw as I turned on the TV this evening
I was disgusted by all the injustice, all the injustice
All the injustice

[Verse 3: Treach]
Now who’s deceivin’ ya to believe in a
Monotonous fever mainstream mumble the media made up
Keeping a shadow on people, the slaves of the day
Deceived and believed that we’re equal to rights
Peep and getting even
And even when breathing, we can’t inhale freedom
Save the playa haters for later, it’s demons I’m weaving
We’re needing a scheme, it’s making me feel like screaming

[Pre-Chorus: Michael, Janet, Both]
With such collusions, don't it make you wanna scream?

(Stop your pressure)
I'm sittin' on my terrace, lost in the stars
Listening to the sounds of the sad guitars
Been thinking it all over and I've thought it all through
I've made up my mind to give myself to you

I saw the first fall of snow
I saw the flowers come and go
I don't think that anyone ever else ever knew
I've made up my mind to give myself to you

I'm giving myself to you, I am
From Salt Lake City to Birmingham
From East L.A. to San Antone
I don't think I can bear to live my life alone

My eye is like a shooting star
It looks at nothin' here or there, looks at nothin' near or far
No one ever told me, it's just something I knew
I've made up my mind to give myself to you

If I had the wings of a snow white dove
I'd preach the gospel, the gospel of love
A love so real, a love so true
I've made up my mind to give myself to you
Take me out traveling, you're a traveling man
Show me something I don't understand
I'm not what I was, things aren't what they were
I'll go far away from home with her

I traveled a long road of despair
I met no other traveler there
Lot of people gone, lot of people I knew
I've made up my mind to give myself to you

Well, my heart's like a river, a river that sings
Just takes me a while to realize things
I've seen the sunrise, I've seen the dawn
I'll lay down beside you when everyone's gone

I've traveled from the mountains to the sea
I hope that the gods go easy with me
I knew you'd say yes, I'm saying it too
I've made up my mind to give myself to you
All through the summers, into January
I've been visiting morgues and monasteries
Looking for the necessary body parts
Limbs and livers and brains and hearts
I'll bring someone to life, is what I wanna do
I wanna create my own version of you

Well, it must be the winter of my discontent
I wish you'd've taken me with you wherever you went
They talk all night and they talk all day
Not for a minute do I believe anything they say
I'm gon' bring someone to life, someone I've never seen
You know what I mean, you know exactly what I mean

I'll take the Scarface Pacino and The Godfather Brando
Mix it up in a tank and get a robot commando
If I do it up right and put the head on straight
I'll be saved by the creature that I create
I'll get blood from a cactus, gunpowder from ice
I don't gamble with cards and I don't shoot no dice
Can you look at my face with your sightless eyes?
Can you cross your heart and hope to die?
I'll bring someone to life, someone for real
Someone who feels the way that I feel
I study Sanskrit and Arabic to improve my mind
I wanna do things for the benefit of all mankind
I say to the willow tree, "Don't weep for me"
I'm saying to hell to all things that I used to be
Well, I get into trouble, then I hit the wall
No place to turn, no place at all
I'll pick a number between a-one and two
And I ask myself, "What would Julius Caesar do?"
I will bring someone to life in more ways than one
Don't matter how long it takes, it'll be done when it's done

I'm gonna make you play the piano like Leon Russell
Like Liberace, like St. John the Apostle
I'll play every number that I can play
I'll see you maybe on Judgment Day
After midnight, if you still wanna meet
I'll be at the Black Horse Tavern on Armageddon Street
Two doors down, not that far to walk
I'll hear your footsteps, you won't have to knock
I'll bring someone to life, balance the scales
I'm not gonna get involved any insignificant details

You can bring it to St. Peter
You can bring it to Jerome
You can bring it all the way over
Bring it all the way home
Bring it to the corner where the children play
You can bring it to me on a silver tray
I'll bring someone to life, spare no expense
Do it with decency and common sense
Can you tell me what it means, to be or not to be?
You won't get away with fooling me
Can you help me walk that moonlight mile?
Can you give me the blessings of your smile?
I'll bring someone to life, use all of my powers
Do it in the dark, in the wee, small hours

I can see the history of the whole human race
It's all right there, it's carved into your face
Should I break it all down? Should I fall on my knees?
Is there light at the end of the tunnel, can you tell me, please?
Stand over there by the cypress tree
Where the Trojan women and children were sold into slavery
Long before the first Crusade
Way back before England or America were made
Step right into the burning hell
Where some of the best-known enemies of mankind dwell
Mr. Freud with his dreams, Mr. Marx with his ax
See the raw hide lash rip the skin from their backs
Got the right spirit, you can feel it, you can hear it
You've got what they call the immortal spirit
You can feel it all night, you can feel it in the morn'
It creeps in your body the day you were born
One strike of lightning is all that I need
And a blast of electricity that runs at top speed
Show me your ribs, I'll stick in the knife
Gonna jumpstart my creation to life
I wanna bring someone to life, turn back the years
Do it with laughter and do it with tears

[Verse 1]
Black rider, black rider, you've been living too hard
Been up all night, have to stay on your guard
The path that you're walking, too narrow to walk
Every step of the way, another stumbling block
The road that you're on, same road that you know
Just not the same as it was a minute ago

[Verse 2]
Black rider, black rider, you've seen it all
You've seen the great world and you've seen the small
You fell into the fire and you're eating the flame
Better seal up your lips if you wanna stay in the game
Be reasonable, mister, be honest, be fair
Let all of your earthly thoughts be a prayer

[Verse 3]
Black rider, black rider, all dressed in black
I'm walking away, you try to make me look back
My heart is at rest, I'd like to keep it that way
I don't wanna fight, at least not today
Go home to your wife, stop visiting mine
One of these days I'll forget to be kind

[Verse 4]
Black rider, black rider, tell me when, tell me how
If there ever was a time, then let it be now
Let me go through, open the door
My soul is distressed, my mind is at war
Don't hug me, don't flatter me, don't turn on the charm
I'll take a sword and hack off your arm

[Verse 5]
Black rider, black rider, hold it right there
The size of your cock will get you nowhere
I'll suffer in silence, I'll not make a sound
Maybe I'll take the high moral ground
Some enchanted evening I'll sing you a song
Black rider, black rider, you've been on the job too long

[Verse 1]
I live on a street named after a Saint
Women in the churches wear powder and paint
Where the Jews, and Catholics, and the Muslims all pray
I can tell they're Proddie from a mile away
Goodbye Jimmy Reed, Jimmy Reed indeed
Give me that old time religion, it's just what I need

[Verse 2]
For thine is kingdom, the power, the glory
Go tell it on the mountain, go tell the real story
Tell it in that straightforward, puritanical tone
In the mystic hours when a person's alone
Goodbye Jimmy Reed, godspeed
Thump on the Bible, proclaim a creed

[Verse 3]
You won't amount to much, the people all said
'Cause I didn't play guitar behind my head
Never pandered, never acted proud
Never took off my shoes, throw 'em in the crowd
Goodbye Jimmy Reed, goodbye, goodnight
Put a jewel in your crown and I put out the lights

[Verse 4]
They threw everything at me, everything in the book
I had nothing to fight with but a butcher's hook
They had no pity, they never lend a hand
I can't sing a song that I don't understand
Goodbye Jimmy Reed, goodbye, good luck
I can't play the record 'cause my needle got stuck

[Verse 5]
Transparent woman in a transparent dress
Suits you well, I must confess
I'll break open your grapes, I'll suck out the juice
I need you like my head needs a noose
Goodbye Jimmy Reed, goodbye and so long
I thought I could resist her but I was so wrong

[Verse 6]
God be with you, brother dear
If you don't mind me asking what brings you here?
Oh, nothing much, I'm just looking for the man
Need to see where he's lying in this lost land
Goodbye Jimmy Reed, and everything within ya
Can't you hear me calling from down in Virginia?
Mother of Muses sing for me
Sing of the mountains and the deep dark sea
Sing of the lakes and the nymphs of the forest
Sing your hearts out, all your women of the chorus
Sing of honor and fate and glory be
Mother of Muses sing for me

Mother of Muses sing for my heart
Sing of a love too soon to depart
Sing of the heroes who stood alone
Whose names are engraved on tablets of stone
Who struggled with pain so the world could go free
Mother of Muses sing for me

Sing of Sherman, Montgomery, and Scott‬
And of Zhukov, and Patton, and the battles they fought
Who cleared the path for Presley to sing
Who carved the path for Martin Luther King
Who did what they did and they went on their way
Man, I could tell their stories all day
I'm falling in love with Calliope
She don't belong to anyone, why not give her to me?
She's speaking to me, speaking with her eyes
I've grown so tired of chasing lies
Mother of Muses, wherever you are
I've already outlived my life by far

Mother of Muses, unleash your wrath
Things I can't see, they're blocking my path
Show me your wisdom, tell me my fate
Put me upright, make me walk straight
Forge my identity from the inside out
You know what I'm talking about

Take me to the river, release your charms
Let me lay down a while in your sweet, loving arms
Wake me, shake me, free me from sin
Make me invisible, like the wind
Got a mind that ramble, got a mind that roam
I'm travelin' light and I'm a-slow coming home

[Verse 1]
I crossed the Rubicon on the 14th day
Of the most dangerous month of the year
At the worst time, at the worst place
That's all I seem to hear
I got up early
So I can greet the goddess of the dawn
I've painted my wagon, abandoned all hope
And I crossed the Rubicon

[Verse 2]
Well, the Rubicon is a red river
Goin' gently as she flows
Redder than your ruby lips
And the blood that flows from the rose
Three miles north of purgatory
One step from the great beyond
I prayed to the cross, I kissed the girls
And I crossed the Rubicon

[Verse 3]
What are these dark days I see?
In this world so badly bent
I cannot redeem the time
The time so idly spent
How much longer can it last?
How long can it go on?
I embrace my love, put down my hair
And I crossed the Rubicon

[Verse 4]
I can feel the bones beneath my skin
And they're tremblin' with rage
I'll make your wife a widow
You'll never see old age
Show me one good man in sight
That the sun shines down upon
I pawned my watch, I paid my debts
And I crossed the Rubicon

[Verse 5]
Put my hide up on a hill
Where some happiness I'll find
If I survive, then let me love
Let the hour be mine
Take the high road, take the low
Take any one you're on
I poured the cup, I passed it along
And I crossed the Rubicon

[Verse 6]
Well, you defiled the most lovely flowers
In all her womanhood
Others can be tolerant
Others can be good
I'll cut you up with a crooked knife
Lord, and I'll miss you when you're gone
I stood between Heaven and Earth
And I crossed the Rubicon

[Verse 7]
You won't find any happiness here
No happiness or joy
Go back to the gutter, try your luck
Find you some nice pretty boy
Tell me how many men I need
And who can I count upon
I strapped my belt, I buttoned my coat
And I crossed the Rubicon

[Verse 8]
I feel the holy spirit inside
See the light that freedom gives
I believe it's in the reach of
Every man who lives
Keep as far away as possible
It's darkest 'fore the dawn (Oh Lord)
I turned the key, I broke it off
And I crossed the Rubicon

[Verse 9]
Mona, baby, are you still in my mind?
I truly believe that you are
Couldn't be anybody else but you
Who's come with me this far
The killing frost is on the ground
And the autumn leaves are gone
I lit the torch, I looked to the east
And I crossed the Rubicon

[Verse 1]
McKinley hollered, McKinley squalled
Doctor said, "McKinley, death is on the wall
‪Say it to me, if you got something to confess"
‪I heard all about it, he was going down slow ‬
‪I heard it on the wireless radio ‬
‪From down in the boondocks way down in Key West
‪I’m searching for love, for inspiration ‬
‪On that pirate radio station
‪Coming out of Luxembourg and Budapest ‬
‪Radio signal, clear as can be
‪I'm so deep in love that I can hardly see ‬
‪Down on the flatlands, way down in Key West

[Chorus 1]
‪Key West is the place to be ‬
‪If you're looking for immortality ‬
‪Stay on the road, follow the highway sign ‬
‪Key West is fine and fair
‪If you lost your mind, you will find it there
‪Key West is on the horizon line

[Verse 2]
‪I was born on the wrong side of the railroad track
‪Like Ginsberg, Corso and Kerouac
‪Like Louis and Jimmy and Buddy and all the rest ‬
‪Well, it might not be the thing to do ‬
‪But I'm sticking with you through and through ‬
‪Down in the flatlands, way down in Key West
‪I got both my feet planted square on the ground ‬
‪Got my right hand high with the thumb down ‬
‪Such is life, such is happiness
‪Hibiscus flowers, they grow everywhere here
‪If you wear one, put it behind your ear
‪Down in the bottom, way down in Key West ‬

[Chorus 2]
‪Key West is the place to go
‪Down by the Gulf of Mexico ‬
‪Beyond the sea, beyond the shifting sand
‪Key West is the gateway key ‬
‪To innocence and purity ‬
‪Key West, Key West is the enchanted land

[Verse 3]
‪I've never lived in the land of Oz ‬
‪Or wasted my time with an unworthy cause ‬
‪It’s hot down here, and you can't be overdressed
‪Tiny blossoms of a toxic plant ‬
‪They can make you dizzy, I'd like to help you but I can't
‪Down in the flatlands, way down in Key West ‬
‪Well, the Fishtail Palms, and the orchid trees
‪They can give you that bleeding heart disease
‪People tell me I ought to try a little tenderness ‬
‪On Amelia Street, Bayview Park ‬
‪Walking in the shadows after dark ‬
‪Down under, way down in Key West ‬
‪I played Gumbo Limbo spirituals
‪I know all the Hindu rituals ‬
‪People tell me that I'm truly blessed ‬
Bougainvillea blooming in the summer, in the spring
Winter here is an unknown thing
Down in the flat lands, way down in Key West

[Chorus 3]
Key West is under the sun, under the radar, under the gun
You stay to the left, and then you lean to the right
Feel the sunlight on your skin, and the healing virtues of the wind
Key West, Key West is the land of light

[Verse 4]
Wherever I travel, wherever I roam
I'm not that far from the convent home
I do what I think is right, what I think is best
Mystery Street off of Mallory Square
Truman had his White House there
East bound, West bound, way down in Key West
Twelve years old, they put me in a suit
Forced me to marry a prostitute
There were gold fringes on her wedding dress
That's my story, but not where it ends
She's still cute, and we're still friends
Down on the bottom, way down in Key West
I play both sides against the middle
Trying to pick up that pirate radio signal
I heard the news, I heard your last request
Fly around, my pretty little Miss
I don't love nobody, give me a kiss
Down on the bottom, way down in Key West

[Chorus 4]
Key West is the place to be
If you're looking for immortality
Key West is paradise divine
Key West is fine and fair
If you lost your mind, you'll find it there
Key West is on the horizon line

Only love, only love
Only love, only love

[Verse 1]
Eighty-six thousand, four hundred seconds in a day
I swear lately most of 'em have been a waste
I feel 'em come and go, bury my mistakes
But time just goes on and on in a way

[Pre-Chorus]
If I had one day left to live
And if the stars went out on me, the truth is
Yeah, there's so much I'd say and do
If I had nothing to lose, nah, nothing to lose

[Chorus]
Oh, I'd call my mother and tell her I'm sorry
I never call her back
I'd pour my heart and soul out into a letter
And send it to my dad
Like, oh my God, the time I've wasted
Lost in my head
Let me leave this world with the hate behind me
And take the love instead

[Post-Chorus]
Give me
Only love, only love
Give me
Only love, only love

[Verse 2]
I swear sometimes I hear myself talking, getting mad
Take shit so personal, like it really matters
Oh, am I awake, am I sleepwalking? Tell me that
It's scary how quickly I lose perspective and I react

[Pre-Chorus]
If I had one day left to live
And if the stars went out on me, the truth is
Yeah, there's so much I'd say and do
If I had nothing to lose, no, nothing to lose

[Chorus]
Oh, I'd call my mother and tell her I'm sorry
I never call her back
I'd pour my heart and soul out into a letter
And send it to my dad
Like, oh my God, the time I've wasted
Lost in my head
Let me leave this world with the hate behind me
And take the love instead

[Post-Chorus]
Give me
Only love, only love
Give me
Only love, only love (No)
Yeah, give me
Only love, only love
Let me leave this world with the hate behind me
And take the love instead
Give me (Mmm)
Only love, only love (Only love, only love)
Give me
Only love, only love (Only love, only love, only love)
Only love, only love (Oh, no, only love)
Let me leave this world with the hate behind me (Oh)
And take the love instead

Grrrrrat, tat tat, tat

Grrrrrat, tat tat, tat
Grrrrrat, tat tat (Hoo!)

Remember the time?
Remember the time?

[Verse 1]
Do you remember when we fell in love?
We were young and innocent then
Do you remember how it all began?
It just seemed like heaven, so why did it end?

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Do you remember, back in the fall?
We'd be together all day long
Do you remember us holding hands?
In each other's eyes, we'd stare
Tell me

[Chorus]
Do you remember the time?
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time?
When we first met, girl
Do you remember the time?
(Oh, I)
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time?

[Verse 2]
Do you remember how we used to talk?
You know, we'd stay on the phone at night till dawn
Do you remember all the things we said?
Like, "I love you so, I'll never let you go"

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Do you remember, back in the spring?
Every morning, birds would sing
Do you remember those special times?
They'll just go on and on
In the back of my mind

[Chorus]
Do you remember the time?
(Oh, I)
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time?
When we first met, girl
Do you remember the time?
(Oh, I)
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time?
Grrrrrat, tat tat (Hoo!)
Remember the time?

[Bridge]
Those sweet memories
Will always be dear to me
And girl no matter what was said
I will never forget what we had
Now baby

[Chorus]
Do you remember the time?
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time?
When we first met, girl
Do you remember the time?
(Oh, I)
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time?
Grrrrrat, tat tat (Hoo!)

I bet-I bet you remember

I don't know

Remember the time?
(Do you remember, girl? Do you?)
Remember the time?
(in Spain, what about, what about, what about)

Remember the time?
(Do you remember, girl?)
Remember the time?
(On the phone, In the park, till dawn? Do you?)
Remember the time? (Do you, do you?)
(In the park, in Spain?) (Do you?)
Remember the time?
(in Spain, what about, what about, what about)

Remember the time?
(Do you remember, girl?)
Remember the time?
(Do you remember, girl?)
Remember the time?
(Do you remember, girl? Do you?)
Remember the time?
(Do you remember, girl?)

[Verse 1]
I believe that I could trace you
In any form you may appear
I want to reach out and hold on tight
To the one thing I hold dear

What's the matter with you?
Rip that clover from the sky
What's the matter with you?
Rip that seaweed from your spine

A wicked hand will raise a gambler
I'll gut the Ganon if it takes all my life
Grab a hold, lay it on the green
Grab a hold, lay it on the green

All I want to see is that sparkle in your eye
All I want to see is that sparkle in your eye

[Chorus]
Can I turn, can I turn you on?
When I get to you
Do you mind? Do you mind? Not at all

[Verse 2]
I believe I'll always chase you
I'm a heartsick Bokoblin
Grab a hold, lay it on the green
Tell me who, tell me who to be

After all it's you
You're the one to satisfy
After all it's you
I can't stand to see you cry

[Chorus]
Can I turn, can I turn you on?
When I get to you
Do you mind? Do you mind? Not at all
When I get to you

Can I turn, can I turn you on?
Do you mind? Do you mind? Not at all
When I get to you

Can I turn, can I turn you on?
Do you mind? Do you mind? Not at all
Can I turn, can I turn you on?

[Verse 1]
Who needs a remote control?
The way I feel right now is impenetrable
And on the big 4th down, a bump in the road
The shortest little tunnel ride from Lake to Monroe
Ring, ring, ring, oh my death machine
Well it rings all day it doesn’t mean anything
I took the red line south, the mask on my mouth
For all my friends in different metropolitan towns
For all my friends in different metropolitan towns
It’s just another wrinkle in the cloud

[Chorus]
It’s what you get, it’s where you are
It’s how we're built
What a world, what a world
It’s what you get, it’s where you are
It’s not a race
What a world, what a world

[Bridge]
It's like a whistle in the wind
Feels like the end of everything

[Verse 2]
Who sees the thread in the veil
I need my government check, it got lost in the mail
And for the fresh new pack, fifteen on the bill
Everything considered, still a drop in the pail
Ooh-wee, checking your messages, please
I'm in the crib these days, where would you rather be?
I miss the brown line track too close to the screen
'Cause that view of the city is my favorite scene
Yeah that view of the city is my favorite scene
Covering up the wrinkles underneath

[Chorus]
It’s what you get, it’s where you are
It’s how you're built
What a world, what a world
It’s what you get, it’s where you are
It’s not a race
What a world, what a world

[Verse 1]
There's a ray
I’ll be gone today
I wish I was sayin bye
And steadily wave
But I don't know if I'll be back again
Far away
I’m traveling far away

[Chorus]
If I see my friends
Where I'm goin'
I'll let you know as soon as I know it
Cause I feel so alone
No matter where I've been

[Instrumental]

[Verse 2]
Your tired face has kept me up for days
Its within you to uncover what's in your head
But first we gotta find you a bed
What they said is not worth argument
Since we've seen death come before
Steps above
Maybe you just need someone not to show ya

[Outro]
There's a way to carry on
There’s a way to not belong




Any more than you want
Any more than you want
Any more than you want

[Verse 1]
Eagle screaming above and below
Which is real?
Illusion can still take control
It’s always been frayed and

Don’t close your eyes

[Instrumental]

[Verse 2]
Eagle may just fly up to the sun
As it burns
The day they will think that they’ve won
Evil, a          with his name

Believes they are one and the same

[Instrumental]

I don't know - don't you wanna chill with me
Every time you see me, hahaha

[Verse 1]
Do you remember when we fell in love
We were young and innocent then
Do you remember how it all began
It just seemed like heaven
So why did it end?

[Pre-Chorus]
Do you remember back in the fall
We'd be together all day long
Do you remember us holding hands
In each other's eyes we'd stare
Tell me

You know we'd stay on the phone at night 'til dawn

Every morning birds would sing
Do you remember those special times
They'll just go on and on in the back of my mind

[Verse 1]
I took my baby on a Saturday bang
Boy, is that girl with you?
Yes, we're one and the same
Now, I believe in miracles
And a miracle has happened tonight
Hee!

[Chorus]
But, if you're thinking about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white
Ooh!

[Verse 2]
They print my message in the Saturday sun
I had to tell them I ain't second to none
And I told 'em about equality
And it's true, either you're wrong or you're right
Hoo!

[Chorus]
But, if you're thinking about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white
Hoo!
Gone withca girl!
Hee-hee!

[Bridge]
I am tired of this devil
I am tired of this stuff
I am tired of this business
So when the going gets rough
I ain't scared of your brother
I ain't scared of no sheets
I ain't scared of nobody
Girl, when the going gets mean

[Rap: L.T.B.]
Protection for gangs, clubs and nations
Causing grief in human relations
It's a turf war on a global scale
I'd rather hear both sides of the tale
See, it's not about races
Just places, faces
Where your blood comes from is where your space is
I've seen the bright get duller
I'm not going to spend my life being a color

[Verse 3]
Don't tell me you agree with me
When I saw you kicking dirt in my eye
Hee-hee!

[Chorus]
But, if you're thinking about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white
I said if you're thinking of being my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white
I said if you're thinking of being my brother
It don't matter if you're black or white

It's black, it's white, hoo! (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
It's black, it's white
It's tough for you to get by (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

This is dedicated to that, "Ooh-laa"
Run it to me real quick

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't make me wait
I've been thinking about it all day
You know what I want
The second, the minute, I'm home

[Chorus]
It's ooh-laa
That's the only music that I wanna hear
Is, "Ooh-laa"
Get a little louder, scream it in my ear, yeah
Spin it 'round, let it bounce some
Up and down, think we found something
Smack it, flip it, rub it down
To the sound of, "Ooh-laa"
"Ooh-laa, ooh-laa"

[Verse 2]
You know I'm romantic
I'd cross the Atlantic for that, "Ooh-laa"
I'll wear my best tuxedo
And you can undress me and we go, "Ooh-laa"

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't make me wait
I've been thinking about it all day
You know what I want
The second, the minute, I'm home

[Verse 1]
When I think about the messes I've made
Think about the rest of my days
I wonder if you'll stick with me or walk away
I think about all of my faults
Will you love me just because?
Do you believe that we could last forever, babe?

[Pre-Chorus]
Why don't we go all the way? (All the way)
All the way (All the way)

I hope we go all the way (All the way)

Ooh, I hope you do too

[Verse 2]
When I think about every time (Time)
That your eyes light up like mine (Mine)
I know I want that feeling every single night
Am I crazy to think that you
Could ever want it as bad as I do?
I need it more than you could ever realize

[Pre-Chorus]
Why don't we go all the way? (Why don't we go all the way?)
All the way (All the way)

We're in motion, and I’m emotional, and I'm all over you
So whatchu wanna do?

Where we’ll go
We don't know
Everywhere and nowhere, we'll go

[Verse 2]
Let's go everywhere and nowhere
Days turn night
Let's bathe in the moonlight
Dance around the stars
Maybe go too far
Sensational
No particular place to go
Feeling insatiable
Like even outer space could be attainable

[Pre-Chorus]
But if you don't mind
We'll let our love fly
Just give me your time
'Cause you've got all mine

[Chorus]
We've got one life

When you're tryna shake it up and it still looks the same
Oh, but I know I'm coming home to you, so I can't complain, no, no
When I walk through the door, all the world melts away

[Chorus]
And I just focus, mmm
I focus on you
Woo, hoo
I just focus, mmm
I focus on you

[Verse 3]
Hey
When the world gets heavy
When the days are long
Oh, you keep me steady
And you make me strong
When the train is speedin'
I keep holding on
I won't let it shake me
I won't let it break me, no, no

[Outro]
I'm just focused
Yeah, I'm focused on you, mmm
I just focus, mmm
I focus on you

Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Oh, oh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

[Verse 1]
I miss you most of all
When autumn starts to fall
When the sun sets early
When nights are getting long
And I hear our favorite song
Playing each memory

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm trying to fall asleep
Just to see if you'll keep me company in my dreams
You, you've been out of reach
All the letters I send keep coming back to me

[Chorus]
I'm ready, I'm ready
If you want me, come get me
I'm ready, so ready
If you want me

[Verse 2]
Please reach across the sky
Take the early morning flight
I haven't moved since you've gone
Hope you still remember how
To get back in my house
Hope it ain't been too long

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I'm trying to fall asleep
Just to see if you'll keep me company in my dreams
Oh, if you find a way to me
I can find some ways to make you never ever leave

[Chorus]
I'm ready, I'm ready
If you want me, come get me
I'm ready, so ready
If you want me

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh
La-la-la, la-la, la-la, la-la, la-la
Ooh
La-la-la, la-la, la-la, la-la, la-la

[Chorus]
I'm ready, I'm ready
If you want me, come get me
I'm ready, so ready
If you want me

[Outro]
Ooh, ooh, baby
You know that I'm ready, baby
What do I have to do?
Oh, you know where I am
Baby, come on over now
Come on, ooh, come on

[Verse 1]
Hey, love
My first love
My last love
I can't stop looking for you
I'm movin'
But can't move on
Since you've gone
I don't know what to do

[Pre-Chorus]
So emotional
Can't let love go
I'm a midnight shade of blue
I've been broken in
I can't start again
Can't trade you for something new

[Chorus]
I will always love you
You will always be the one
I will always, I'll wait for you
I will always love you
You will always be the one
Know that always, I'll wait for you

[Verse 2]
Why am I
Stuck in time?
Stuck inside
While the whole world's passing me by
This old song
Keeps playing on
The melody's so strong
I can't help but sing along

[Pre-Chorus]
So emotional
Can't let love go
I'm a midnight shade of blue
I've been broken in
I can't start again
Can't trade you for something new

[Chorus]
I will always love you
You will always be the one
I will always, I'll wait for you
I will always love you
You will always be the one
Know that always, I'll wait for you

[Bridge]
I've been everywhere
No one else compares to you
Nobody here
In your stratosphere
I gotta get back to you
I'm tellin' you I wanna get back to you

[Chorus]
I will always love you
You will always be the one
I will always, I'll wait for you
I will always love you
You will always be the one
Know that always, I'll wait for you

[Outro]
Oh
Oh, oh
Hey, love
My first love
My last love
Oh

[Intro]
Oh, yeah

[Verse 1]
We got a good thing, babe
Whenever life is hard
We'll never lose our way
'Cause we both know who we are
Who knows about tomorrow?
We don't know what's in the stars
I just know I'll always follow
The light in your heart

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm not worried about us
And I've never been
We know how the story ends

[Chorus]
We will never break
We will never break
Built on a foundation
Strong enough to stay
We will never break
As the water rises
And the mountains shake
Our love will remain

[Post-Chorus]
We will never
Nah, nah, never
We will never
Nah, nah, never

[Verse 2]
It's more than a good sensation
It's more than a passing fling
You are the explanation
Of what love really means
It's bigger than you and me
It's one plus one equals three
When we talk about forever
Then forever's what we mean

[Pre-Chorus]
So I'm not worried about us
And I've never been
No matter what may come our way

[Chorus]
We will never break
We will never break
Built on a foundation
Stronger than the pain
We will never break
As the water rises
And the mountains shake
Our love will remain

[Post-Chorus]
We will never
Nah, nah never
We will never
Nah, nah never
We will never
Nah, never
We will never
No

[Bridge]
The world is dangerous
Throw it all at us
There's nothing we cannot take

[Chorus]
We will never break
We will never break
Built on a foundation
Strong enough to stay
We will never break
As the water rises
And the mountains shake
Our love will remain

[Post-Chorus]
We will never
Nah, nah, never
We will never
Nah, nah, never
We will never
Nah, never
We will never
No

[Outro]
We will never
No, never
We will
No

(Pyrex)
Go, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
Uh, Uh, Uh
Durk, Durk, Durk
Lurk, Lurk, Lurk, Lurk, Look

[Verse 1: Lil Yachty]
These niggas be bitches
Whip on switches then fuck on your misses
So malicious, look at the militia
On a mission, they pray like the Christians
Talking sweet, rap you up like it's Christmas
She want dick in her mouth, I'm a dentist
Entertaining, but I don't have interest
Got no stomach, she look like a gymnast
And she take inches
That's none of your business
Get the witness he ready to tell it all
Go call Nino, he ready to sell it all
Got a plug up in Portland he mail it off
Ain't no love in the streets, word to Durkio
Got a lightskin lil' bitch, came from Turkey though
Ima beat on that back till' she cryin'
Ima beat on that back till' I can't no more

[Verse 2: Lil Durk]
.45 g-lock, tucked under tee top
Gucci high knee socks, free-brand Reebok's
Percocet pressed up, any drink, re-roc
Or I could make a diss song, I don't even beat-box
Chiraq niggas be Persian
Free number 9 got em goin' for a murder
Five baby mommas, I ain't trynna be on Maury
Steve got a chopper, make niggas nervous
Pop me a pill, no water I'm thirsty
And I got a block her down, she thirsty
I be with savages, hide in your alleyway
Talking to murder, ain't talking bout' battery
Mixing these drugs, I'm high like a galaxy
We don't like Reggie, it fuck with our allergies
I bought an ounce before I got a Patek
Two blunts of runts and I think I'm gonna panic

[Verse 3: Lil Yachty]
My niggas stay with me and bitches can't stand it
Bandannas in pockets like niggas was bandits
These niggas be bitches, could tell by they antics
They do it for clout, then ask for a 

[?]
Only 21, but my life can get frantic
My neck on Atlantis, my lil bitch, they high like Aladdin
Just got a lil check from E-8 for the manner
I'm getting paid to play on my momma, no cappin'
Your pussy was good, but your attitude crappy
He said he gon' slap me, must look up to Slick Rick
Tryna' get shot in his eye, dumbass
Touch me it's lightning, I probably move too fast
I promise, they look over me like the Trojan
No one doing better, she lick like a letter
I cum in her mouth, she said it make her wetter
Come up out that sweater, lemme see them titties

[Verse 4: Lil Durk]
High off the pills, don't be fuckin' with xannies
Niggas be bitches, be tuckin' they panties
New York on a bike, got the Glock on the bench
See me, I'm too cool, but my brothers ain't friendly
I give her a drink and she fuck on the camera
Murderers, robbers, I'm cool with the scammers
Margiela's, the neon way
He turnt a rat to a Beyoncé
Shoot out the cat, ain't see our face
Diamonds baguettes, that's the izzy way
Suck my dick cause' she left, got the shitty face
Bitch at the crib and that's anyway
Black jeans with the zebra, Amiri way
Know some niggas that scheme, but they in the way
Niggas caught on that scene, bullet penetrate
And you be in them foreigns, the rented way

[Intro: Quavo]

Last night, she told me she love me
But now she act like she forgot (Damn)
Tonight is my night, so I'm fuckin' her twice
Ballin' like it's the last night of my life
Big diamond crosses like Holy Christ
We flyin' at night just to blow on my dice
With Huncho and Derulo, the car came with a umbrella (Wop)
The Maybach seats like pillows and the Lambo truck bright yellow (Huh)

[Pre-Chorus]
To escape the world, I've got to enjoy that simple dance
And it seemed that everything was on my side

She seemed sincere like it was love and true romance
And now she's out to get me
But I just can't take it
Just can't break it

[Chorus]
Susie got your number and Susie ain't your friend
Look who took you under with seven inches in
Blood is on the dance floor, blood is on the knife
Susie's got your number and Susie says it's right

She got your number, ah (She got your number)
How does it feel? Ah (How does it feel?)

Uh oh she just your type right
Tryin to figure out how you could play a major part up in her life right
Shorty got your mind tight
And everytime you see her walk by start thinkin bout your night like
She all that's in your eye sight
And ever since the first day you seened her thinkin she the wife type
You figure she'll be perfect lovin you
Fantasize the tingle from her fingers rubbin you
Tryin to analyze the situation, you feelin crazy
Wan't it there forever what's so special 'bout this lady?
Feelin like you wanna cool back
But you know you perfect for her you got all of what them fools lack
Maybe you should make this thing happen
Raise some things swingin on the porch while the kids nappin
You got everything else you need
Snatch her up fill that empty space she can make your life complete

[Verse 2: Eve]
You like, wait, stop, the way that she got you hot
Excited said you be what she got
Enticin' mommy like the cream of the crop
Pressure gettin heavy 'bout to make your heart pop
All your life you waited for this chick
Nobody told you would it feel like this
Do anything just to feel that kiss
Wanna give her whatever you got
In front of millions make it known whatever the plot

[Spoken Intro]
The way she came into the place, I knew right then and there
There was something different about this girl
The way she moved her hair, her face, her lines
Divinity in motion

As she stalked the room, I could feel the aura of her presence
Every head turned feeling passion and lust
The girl was persuasive, the girl I could not trust
The girl was bad, the girl was dangerous

[Verse 1]
I never knew but I was walkin' the line (Hee!)
"Come go with me", I said, "I have no time" (Hee-hee!)
She said "Don't you pretend we didn't talk on the phone" (Hee!)
My baby cried, she left me standin' alone (Hee! Hee!)

[Chorus]
She's so dangerous
The girl is so dangerous (Hee-hee!)
Take away my money, throw away my time
You can call me honey, but you're no damn good for me

[Spoken Interlude]
She came at me in sections with the eyes of desire
I fell trapped into her web of sin
A touch, a kiss
A whisper of love, I was at the point of no return

Deep in the darkness of passion's insanity
I felt taken by lust's strange inhumanity
This girl was persuasive, this girl I could not trust
The girl was bad, the girl was dangerous

[Verse 2]
I never knew but I was livin' in vain (Hee!)
She called my house, she said "You know my name"
(You know my name!)
"And don't you pretend you never did me before"
(Don't you, don't you, baby!) (Hee!)
With tears in her eyes, my baby walked out the door
(Don't you, don't you, don't) (Hee! Hee! Hee! Hee!)

[Chorus]
She's so dangerous
The girl is so dangerous (Hee-hee!)
Take away my money, throw away my time
You can call me honey, but you're no damn good for me

[Alternate Chorus]
Dangerous
The girl is so dangerous
I have to pray to God, 'cause I know how lust can blind
It's a passion in my soul, but you're no damn lover friend of mine

[Ad-Libs]
Hee-hee!
Ooh!
Ooh!
Hoo!

[Bridge]
I cannot sleep alone at night
My baby left me here tonight
I cannot cope 'til it's all right
You and your manipulation, you hurt my baby

[Spoken Interlude]
And then it happened, she touched me
For the lips of a strange woman drop as a honeycomb
And her mouth was smoother than oil, but her inner spirit and words were as sharp as a two-edged sword
But I loved it, 'cause it's dangerous

[Chorus]
Dangerous (Hee!)
The girl is so dangerous (Hee-hee!)
Take away my money, throw away my time
You can call me honey, but you're no damn good for me
Dangerous (Hee!)
The girl is so dangerous (Hee-hee!)
Take away my money, throw away my time
You can call me honey, but you're no damn good for me

Dangerous (Hee!)

Pull up and fuck with her friend
Study me like a mentor, I had to water the wrist

Tonight you're mine, completely
You give your soul so sweetly
Tonight the light of love is in your eyes
But will you love me tomorrow

Is this a lasting treasure
Or just a moment's pleasure
Can I believe the magic in your sighs
And will you still love me tomorrow

Tonight with words unspoken
You say that I'm the only one
But will my heart be broken
When the night meets the morning sun

I'd like to know if your love
Is a love I can be sure of
So tell me now and I won't ask again
Will you still love me tomorrow
Will you still love me tomorrow
Will you still love me tomorrow

[Eminem & Proof]
Yo, Al-Albert
Fuck are you doing
Man what the fuck are you doing

[Voicemail: Mariah Carey]
I heard you were getting back with your ex-wife. Why won't you see me? Why won't you call me?

[Eminem (Puke from Encore)]
*Pretends to puke*
You don’t know how sick you make me...

[Intro]
(Fox!)

[Verse 1]
I was good on my own, that's the way it was
That's the way it was
You was good on the low for a faded fuck
On some faded love
Shit, what the fuck you complaining for?
Feeling jaded, huh?
Used to trip off that shit I was kickin' to you
Had some fun on the run though I'll give it to you

[Pre-Chorus]
But baby, don't get it twisted
You was just another nigga on the hit list
Tryna fix your inner issues with a bad bitch
Didn't they tell you that I was a savage?
Fuck ya white horse and ya carriage
Bet you never could imagine
Never told you you could have it

[Chorus]
You needed me
Ooh, you needed me
To feel a little more, and give a little less
Know you hate to confess
But baby ooh, you needed me

[Verse 2]
You been rollin' around, shit I'm rollin' up
Light and roll it up
Break it down, like a pound, shit was never us
Shit was never us
That's the real, on the real, are you serious?
How you feel, how you feel?
Used to trip off that shit I was kickin' to ya
Had some fun on the run though, I'll give it to ya

[Pre-Chorus]
But baby, don't get it twisted
You was just another nigga on the hit list
Tryna fix your inner issues with a bad bitch
Didn't they tell you that I was a savage?
Fuck ya white horse and ya carriage
Bet you never could imagine
Never told you you could have it

[Chorus]
You needed me
Ooh, you needed me
To feel a little more, and give a little less
Know you hate to confess
But baby ooh, you needed me

[Verse]
Where did you go, Angelina?
Why did you take my foolish heart? Oh
I should've known, Angelina
I was never right for that part
I could've sworn, Angelina
We would get hitched and you'd be a bitch about
Getting us there on time
And I'd thank the lord for Angelina
Oh, so I guess the wedding I'll never be getting
Will live in the back of my mind

[Chorus]
I never loved you more than when you said goodbye
'Cause maybe I knew that love wasn't honest if you had to lie
I never loved you more than when you walked away
'Cause maybe I knew, Angelina, you'd never stay

[Trumpet Solo]

[Outro]
Are you coming home, Angelina?
I think I'm done trying to hold on to you, mmm
I think you should know, Angelina
That I'd probably fall again if you wanted me to
And she said "I love you," so I said it back
But I wished she was you, mmm

[Intro]
Oh my God, God
I hear you

[Chorus]
With or without you, I'll be okay
With or without you, I'll be on my way
I'm tired of waiting on you (Oh, oh, babe)
With or without you, I'll be okay
With or without you, I'll be on my way
I'm tired of waiting on you (Oh, oh, babe)

[Verse]
I'm done, baby I'm done
Sitting at home alone, smoke in my lungs
Thinking about what we could've been and done (We could, we could)
Oh, it was cool while it lasted, a beautiful happening
Sorry I met you, but good that we happened
I learned to lie, just from you

[Pre-Chorus]
And even though I wish (I do)
Shit went more how I said (I do)
It's time to move on and forget
The past, the past, the past

[Chorus]
With or without you, I'll be okay
With or without you, I'll be on my way
I'm tired of waiting on you (Oh, oh, babe)
With or without you, I'll be okay
With or without you, I'll be on my way
I'm tired of waiting on you (Oh, oh, babe)

[Bridge]
I won't, I won't, I won't wait on you
I won't, I won't, I won't wait on you, no
Won't wait on you, no, no, no (Oh, oh, babe)

[Chorus]
With or without you, I'll be okay
With or without you, I'll be on my way
I'm tired of waiting on you (Oh, oh, babe)
With or without you, I'll be okay
With or without you, I'll be on my way
I'm tired of waiting on you (Oh, oh, babe)

[Outro]
Oh, oh, babe

You're bad and you know it
You tell me that you're with it, gotta show me now
Mixing Hennessy with emotions
I'm tryna let go, can you hold me down?

[Outro: Lil Mosey]
Yeah
My love she speaks like silence
Without ideals or violence
She doesn’t have to say she’s faithful
Yet she’s true, like ice, like fire

People carry roses
Make promises by the hours
My love she laughs like the flowers
Valentines can’t buy her

In the dime stores and bus stations
People talk of situations
Read books, repeat quotations
Draw conclusions on the wall

Some speak of the future
My love she speaks softly
She knows there’s no success like failure
And that failure’s no success at all

The cloak and dagger dangles
Madams light the candles
In ceremonies of the horsemen
Even the pawn must hold a grudge
Statues made of matchsticks
Crumble into one another
My love winks, she does not bother
She knows too much to argue or to judge

The bridge at midnight trembles
The country doctor rambles
Bankers’ nieces seek perfection
Expecting all the gifts that wise men bring

The wind howls like a hammer
The night blows cold and rainy
My love she’s like some raven
At my window with a broken wing
Most of the time
I'm clear focused all around
Most of the time
I can keep both feet on the ground
I can follow the path, I can read the signs
Stay right with it when the road unwinds
I can handle whatever I stumble upon
I don’t even notice she gone
Most of the time

Most of the time
It's well understood
Most of the time
I wouldn't change it if I could
I can make it all match up, I can hold my own
I can deal with the situation right down to the bone
I can survive, I can endure
And I don’t even think about her
Most of the time

Most of the time
My head is on straight
Most of the time
I'm strong enough not to hate
I don't build up illusion 'till it makes me sick
I ain't afraid of confusion no matter how thick
I can smile in the face of mankind
Don't even remember what her lips felt like on mine
Most of the time
Most of the time
She ain't even in my mind
I wouldn't know her if I saw her
She’s that far behind
Most of the time
I can’t even be sure
If she was ever with me
Or if I was ever with her

Most of the time
I'm halfway content
Most of the time
I know exactly where it all went
I don’t cheat on myself, I don't run and hide
Hide from the feelings that are buried inside
I don't compromise and I don't pretend
I don’t even care if I ever see her again
Most of the time
Some of us turn off the lights and we live
With the moonlight shooting by
Some of us scare ourselves to death in the dark
To be where the angels fly
Pretty maids all in a row lined up
Outside my cabin door
I've never wanted any of them wanting me
Except the girl from the Red River Shore

Well, I sat by her side and for a while I tried
To make that girl my wife
She gave me her best advice and she said
Go home and lead a quiet life
Well, I been to the east and I been to the west
And I been out where the black winds roar
Somehow though I never did get that far
With the girl from the Red River Shore

Well, I knew when I first laid eyes on her
I could never be free
One look at her and I knew right away
She should always be with me
Well, the dream dried up a long time ago
Don't know where it is anymore
True to life, true to me
Was the girl from the Red River Shore
Well, I'm wearing the cloak of misery
And I've tasted jilted love
And the frozen smile upon my face
Fits me like a glove
Well, I can't escape from those memories
Of the one that I'll always adore
All those nights, when I lay in the arms
Of the girl from the Red River Shore

Well, we're living in the shadows of a fading past
Trapped in the fires of time
I'd tried not to ever hurt anybody
And to stay out of a life of crime
And when it's all been said and done
I never did know the score
One more day is another day away
From the girl from the Red River Shore

Well, I'm a stranger here in a strange land
But I know this is where I belong
I'll ramble and gamble for the one I love
And the hills will give me a song
Though nothing looks familiar to me
I know I've stayed here before
Once, a thousand nights ago
With the girl from the Red River Shore
Well, I went back to see about her once
Went back to straighten it out
Everybody that I talked to had seen us there
Said they didn't know who I was talking about
Well, the sun went down on me a long time ago
I had to go back from the door
I wish I could have spent every hour of my life
With the girl from the Red River Shore

Now I heard of a guy who lived a long time ago
A man full of sorrow and strife
That if someone around him died and was dead
He knew how to bring 'em on back to life
Well, I don't know what kind of language he used
Or if they do that kind of thing anymore
Sometimes I think nobody saw me here at all
Except the girl from the Red River Shore
In the lonely night
In the blinking stardust of a pale blue light
You’re coming’ thru to me in black and white
When we were made of dreams

You’re blowing down the shaky street
You’re hearing my heart beat
In the record-breaking heat
Where we were born in time

Not one more night, not one more kiss
Not this time baby, no more of this
Takes too much skill, takes too much will
It’s revealing

You came, you saw, just like the law
You married young, just like your ma
You tried and tried, you made me slide
You left me reeling with this feeling

On the rising curve
Where the ways of nature will test every nerve
You won’t get anything you don’t deserve
Where we were born in time
You pressed me once, you pressed me twice
You hang the flame, you’ll pay the price
Oh babe, that fire

Is still smoking
You were snow, you were rain
You were striped, you were plain
Oh babe, truer words
Have not been spoken or broken

In the hills of mystery
In the foggy web of destiny
You can have what’s left of me
Where we were born in time
Well I'm sitting in church
In an old wooden chair
I knew nobody
Would look for me there
Sorrow and pity
Rule the earth and the skies
Looking for nothing
Anyone's eyes

Once I had pretty girls
Did me wrong
Now I'm marching to the city
And the road ain't long

Snowflakes are falling
Around my head
Lord have mercy
It feel heavy like lead
I been hit too hard
Seen too much
Nothing can heal me now
But your touch
Once I had a pretty girl
She done me wrong
Now I'm marching to the city
And the road ain't long

Loneliness
Got a mind of its own
The more people around
The more you feel alone
I'm chained to the earth
Like a silent slave
Trying to break free
Out of death's dark cave

Once I had a pretty girl
Done me wrong
Now I'm marching to the city
And the road ain't long

Boys in the street
Beginning to play
Girls like birds
Flying away
I'm carrying the roses
That were given to me
And I'm thinking about paradise
Wondering what it might be
Once I had a pretty girl
She done me wrong
Now I'm marching to the city
And the road ain't long

Go over to London
Maybe gay Paree
Follow the river
You get to the sea
I was hoping we could drink from
Life's clear streams
I was hoping we could dream
Life's pleasant dreams

Once I had a pretty girl
But she done me wrong
Now I'm marching to the city
And the road ain't long

Well the weak get weaker
And the strong stay strong
The train keeps rolling
All night long
She looked at me
With an irresistible glance
With a smile
That could make all the planets dance
Once I had a pretty girl
She did me wrong
Now I'm marching to the city
And the road ain't long

My house is on fire
Burning to the skies
I thought the rain clouds
But the clouds passed by
When I'm gone
You'll remember my name
I'm gonna win my way
To wealth and fame

Once I had a pretty girl
But she did me wrong
Now I'm marching to the city
And the road ain't long

I don't know
I can't wait, wait for you to change your mind
It’s late, I'm trying to walk the line
Well, it's way past midnight and there are people all around
Some on their way up, some on their way down
The air burns and I’m trying to think straight
And I don't know how much longer I can wait

I'm your man, I'm trying to recover the sweet love that we knew
You understand that my heart can't go on beating without you
Well, your loveliness has wounded me, I'm reeling from the blow
I wish I knew what it was keeps me loving you so
I'm breathing hard, standing at the gate
But I don't know how much longer I can wait

Skies are grey, I’m looking for anything that will bring a happy glow
Night or day, it doesn’t matter where I go anymore, I just go
If I ever saw you coming I don't know what I would do
I’d like to think I could control myself, but it isn't true
That's how it is when things disintegrate
And I don't know how much longer I can wait
I’m doomed to love you, I've been rolling through stormy weather
I'm thinking of you and all the places we could roam together

It's mighty funny, the end of time has just begun
Oh, honey, after all these years you're still the one
While I'm strolling through the lonely graveyard of my mind
I left my life with you somewhere back there along the line
I thought somehow that I would be spared this fate
But I don't know how much longer I can wait
Why should you have to be so frantic
You always wanted to live life in the past
Now why d you wanna be so Atlantic
You finally got your wish at last

You used to be oh so modest with your arm
Around your cigarette machine
Now you lost it all I see and you all you got is your
Two dollar bill and your hat full of gasoline

[Verse 1]
Well I'm going to Chicago, going on the Western Road
Yes I'm going to Chicago, going on the Western Road
There are good times in Baltimore
But I've packed this heavy load

[Verse 2]
Might take a train I might take a plane
But if I have to walk
I'll be going to Chicago just the same
I'm going to Chicago on the Western Road
There's bad times in Baltimore I can't take this load

[Verse 3]
Have you seen, have you seen, have you seen Miss Mary Anne?
Have you seen, have you seen, have you seen Miss Mary Anne?
Well I want to tell you that's one kind of woman, who is missing her man

[Verse 4]
Look down the street on Friday and found out she was gone
I looked for her on Thursday but she has moved along
Miss Maggie Anne, has anybody seen Miss Maggie Anne?
Well let me tell you that's one woman
One woman who's sure missing her man
At my door the leaves are falling
A cold wild wind has come
Sweethearts walk by together
And I still miss someone

I go out on a party
And look for a little fun
But I find a darkened corner
Because I still miss someone

Oh, no I never got over those blues eyes
I see them every where
I miss those arms that held me
When all the love was there

I wonder if she's sorry
For leavin' what we'd begun
There's someone for me somewhere
And I still miss someone
And I still miss someone
I keep a close watch on this heart of mine
I keep my eyes wide open all the time
I keep the ends out for the tie that binds
Because you're mine
I walk the line

I find it very, very easy to be true
I find myself alone when each day is through
Yes, I'll admit I'm a fool for you
Because you're mine
I walk the line

As sure as night is dark and day is light
I keep you on my mind both day and night
And happiness I've known proves that it's right
Because you're mine
I walk the line

You've got a way to keep me on your side
You give me cause for love that I can't hide
For you I know I'd even try to turn the tide
Because you're mine
I walk the line
I keep a close watch on this heart of mine
I keep my eyes wide open all the time
I keep the ends out for the tie that binds
Because you're mine
I walk the line

I keep a close watch on this heart of mine
I keep my eyes wide open all the time
I keep the ends out for the tie that binds
Because you're mine
I walk the line

Because you're mine
I walk the line

Because you're mine
I walk the line

Because you're mine
I walk the line
There's a big hollow tree
Down the road here from me
Where you lay down a dollar or two
Then you go around the bend
When you come back again
There's a jugful of mountain dew

Oh, they call it that old mountain dew
And them that refuse it are few
Oh, I'll shut up my mug
If you'll fill up my jug

With that good old mountain dew
Well, there's my old Aunt June
Bought some brand new perfume
It had such a sweet smellin' phew

But to her surprise, when she had it analyzed
It was nothing but good old mountain dew
And there's Uncle Mort
He's sawed off and short
He's just five feet and one inch or two
But he thinks he's a giant
When he gets him a pint
Of that good old mountain dew

Now, there's Uncle Bill
Got a still on the hill
Where he runs off a gallon or two
And the buzzards in the sky
Get so dizzy they can't fly
Just from smelling that mountain dew
Love, oh love, oh careless love
Love, oh love, oh careless love
Love, oh love, oh careless love
Don't you see what love has done

I pass your window by
I pass your door an' your window too
I pass your door an' your window too
Yes I'm still very much in love with you

Well I pass your window, pass your door
You pass my window and you pass my door
You pass my window and you pass my door
But you never get by my 44

Love, oh love, oh careless love
Love, oh love, oh careless love
Love, oh love, oh careless love
Can't you see what your love has done to me

Well I pass your door, I pass your gate
You pass my door an' you pass my gate
Yes you pass my door an' you pass my gate
But you don't pass by my 38
Love, oh love, oh careless love
Love, oh love, oh careless love
Love, oh love, oh careless love
Don't you see what your love has done to me

You can pass my house, son-of-a-gun
You can pass by my house, you female son-of-a-gun (daughter of pistol)
You can pass by my house, you son-of-a-gun
But you can't pass by my 41

Love, oh love, oh careless love
Love, oh love, oh careless love
Love, oh love, oh careless love
Can't you see what your love has done to me

You can pass my nest and you can pass my hive (my what?)
You can pass my nest and you can pass my hive
You can pass my nest and you can pass my hive
But you won't pas by my 45

Love, oh love, oh careless love
Love, oh love, oh careless love
Love, oh love, oh careless love
Can't you see what your love has done to me

You can pass by my window pane
Pass right by my window pane
You can pass right by my window pane
But you can't pass by my 41 again
Love, oh love, oh careless love
Love, oh love, oh careless love
Love, oh love, oh careless love
Can't you see what your love has done to me

You can throw your stones, you can throw your sticks
Throw your stones, throw your sticks
You can throw your stones, you can throw your sticks
But you can't pass by my thirty old six

Love, oh love, oh careless love
Love, oh love, oh careless love
Love, oh love, oh careless love
Well I'm sitting here wondering
Will a matchbox hold my clothes
Yeah I'm sitting here wondering
Will a matchbox hold my clothes

I ain't got no matches, but I got a long way to go
I'm an ol' poor boy and a long way from home
I'm an ol' poor boy and a long way from home

Guess I'll never be happy, everything I do is wrong, yeah
Well let me be your little dog, 'till your big dog comes
Let me be your little dog, 'till your big dog comes
When the big dog gets here, tell him what this little puppy done

Will a matchbox hold my clothes

As I walk, let me walk close to Thee

Just a closer walk with Thee
Grant it, Jesus, is my plea
Daily walking close to Thee
Let it be, dear Lord, let it be

Through this world of toil and snares
If I falter, Lord, who cares?
Who with me my burden shares?
None but Thee, dear Lord, none but Thee

Just a closer walk with Thee
Grant it, Jesus, is my plea
Daily walking close to Thee
Let it be, dear Lord, let it be

When my feeble life is o’er
Time for me will be no more
Guide me gently, safely o'er
To Thy kingdom shore, to Thy shore
Just a closer walk with Thee
Grant it, Jesus, is my plea
Daily walking close to Thee
Let it be, dear Lord, let it be
My mama always taught me that good things come from adversity if we put our faith in the Lord
We couldn't see much good in the flood waters
When they were causing us to have to leave home
But when the water went down, we found that it had washed a load of rich black bottom dirt across our land. The following year we had the best cotton crop we'd ever had

I remember hearing:

How high's the water, mama?
Two feet high and risin'
How high's the water, papa?
Two feet high and risin'

We can make it to the road in a homemade boat
That's the only thing we got left that'll float
It's already over all the wheat and the oats
Two feet high and risin'

How high's the water, mama?
Three feet high and risin'
How high's the water, papa?
Three feet high and risin'
Well, the hives are gone
I've lost my bees
The chickens are sleepin'
In the willow trees
Cow's in water up past her knees
Three feet high and risin'

How high's the water, mama?
Four feet high and risin'
How high's the water, papa?
Four feet high and risin'

Hey, come look through the window pane
The bus is comin', gonna take us to the train
Looks like we'll be blessed with a little more rain
Four feet high and risin'

How high's the water, mama?
Five feet high and risin'
How high's the water, papa?
Five feet high and risin'

Well, the rails are washed out north of town
We gotta head for higher ground
We can't come back till the water comes down
Five feet high and risin'
Well, it's five feet high and risin'
The other night dear, as I lay sleeping
I dreamed I held you in my arms
But when I awoke, dear, I was mistaken
So I hung my head and I cried

You are my sunshine, my only sunshine
You make me happy when skies are gray
You'll never know dear, how much I love you
Please don't take my sunshine away

I'll always love you and make you happy
If you will only say the same
But if you leave me and love another
You'll regret it all some day:

You are my sunshine, my only sunshine
You make me happy when skies are gray
You'll never know dear, how much I love you
Please don't take my sunshine away

You told me once, dear, you really loved me
And no one else could come between
But not you've left me and love another;
You have shattered all of my dreams:
You are my sunshine, my only sunshine
You make me happy when skies are gray
You'll never know dear, how much I love you
Please don't take my sunshine away

In all my dreams, dear, you seem to leave me
When I awake my poor heart pains
So when you come back and make me happy
I'll forgive you dear, I'll take all the blame

You are my sunshine, my only sunshine
You make me happy when skies are gray
You'll never know dear, how much I love you
Please don't take my sunshine away
T for Texas, T for Tennessee
T for Texas, T for Tennessee
T for Thelma, the gal that made a wreck out of me
If you don't want me, mama you sure don't have to stall
If you don't want me, mama you sure don't have to stall
I can get more women than a passenger train can haul

I'm gonna buy me a pistol just as long as I'm tall
I'm gonna buy me a pistol just as long as I'm tall
I'm gonna shoot poor Thelma, just to see her jump and fall

And if that's your mama, you better tie her to your side
If that's your mama, better tie her to your side
'Cause if she flags my train I'm sure gonna let her ride
I'm gonna buy me a shotgun with a great long shiny barrel
I'm gonna buy me a shotgun with a great long shiny barrel
I'm gonna shoot that rounder that stole away my gal

I'd rather drink muddy water and sleep in a hollow log
I'd rather drink muddy water and sleep in a hollow log
Than to be in Atlanta, treated like a dirty dog
Well, it's T for Texas, T for Tennessee
T for Texas, T for Tennessee
T for Thelma, the gal that made a wreck out of me
Where was you, mama
When the train passed your shed?
Where was you, mama
When the train passed your shed?
Standing in my front door
Wishing to the good lord I was dead

Yodle-hee-hee
Yodle one time for me, Bob!
Yodle-hee-hee

I get my breakfast here
I get my dinner down in New Orleans
I get my breakfast here
Get my dinner down in New Orleans
(Or down in Birmingham)
Gonna get me a mama
Lord, I ain't never seen

Yodle-hee-hee
I'd rather drink muddy water
Sleep in a hollow log
I'd rather drink muddy water
Sleep in a hollow log
Than to stay in Atlanta
Treated like a dirty dog

Yodle-hee-hee

If your house catches fire
And there ain't no water around
If your house catches fire
And there ain't no water around
Throw my trunk out the window
Let the house burn on down

I'd like to do it another time. Okay!

[Verse 1]
Went to see the gypsy
Staying in a big hotel
He smiled when he saw me coming
And he said, “Well, well, well”
His room was dark and crowded
Lights were low and dim
“How are you?” he said to me
I said it back to him

[Verse 2]
I went down to the lobby
To make a small call out
A pretty dancing girl was there
And she began to shout
“Go on back to see the gypsy
He can move you from the rear
Drive you from your fear
Bring you through the mirror
He did it in Las Vegas
And he can do it here”

[Bridge]
Outside the lights were shining
On the river of tears
I watched them from the distance
With music in my ears

[Verse 3]
I went back to see the gypsy
It was nearly early dawn
The gypsy’s door was open wide
But the gypsy was gone
And that pretty dancing girl
She could not be found
So I watched that sun come rising
From that little Minnesota town
Time passes slowly
Up here in the mountains
We sat beside bridges
And walked beside fountains

Catch the wild fishes
That float through the stream
Times passes slowly
When you're lost in a dream

Once I had a sweetheart
She was fine and good lookin'
We sat in her kitchen
While her mama was cookin'

Starin' out the window
To the stars high above
Time passes slowly
When you're searchin' for love

Ain't no reason to go
In a wagon to town
Ain't no reason to go to the fair
Ain't no reason to go up
Ain't no reason to go down
Ain't no reason to go anywhere
Time passes slowly
Up here in the daylight
We stared straight ahead
An' tried so hard to stay right

Like a red rose of summer
That blooms in the day
Time passes slowly
Then fades away

[Verse 1]
Hold me
Like the River Jordan
And I will then say to thee
You are my friend
Carry me
Like you are my brother
Love me like a mother
Will you be there?

[Verse 2]
Weary
Tell me will you hold me
When wrong, will you scold me
When lost will you find me?
But they told me
A man should be faithful
And walk when not able
And fight till the end
But I'm only human

[Bridge]
Everyone's taking control of me
Seems that the world's got a role for me
I'm so confused, will you show it to me?
That you'll be there for me and care enough to bear me

[Verse 4: Michael Jackson & Cleveland Orchestra]
Hold me
Show me
Lay your head lowly
Told me
Softly then boldly
Yeah
Carry me there
I'm only human
Lead me
Hold me
Love me and feed me
Yeah, yeah
Kiss me and free me
Yeah
I will feel blessed
I'm only human
Carry
Carry
Carry me boldly
Carry me
Lift me up slowly
Yeah
Carry me there
I'm only human!
Save me
Lift me
Heal me and bathe me
Lift me up, lift me up
Softly you say to me
I will be there
I will be there
Lift me
Lift me up slowly
Carry me boldly
Yeah
Show me you care
Hold me
Hoo!
Lay your head lowly
It gets lonely sometimes
I get lonely, yeah, yeah
Softly then boldly
Carry me there
Need me
Hoo!
Love me and feed me
Lift me up, hold me up
Lift me up sometimes, up sometimes
Kiss me and free me
I will feel blessed

[Spoken]
In our darkest hour, in my deepest despair
Will you still care?
Will you be there?
In my trials and my tribulations
Through our doubts and frustrations
In my violence, in my turbulence
Through my fear and my confessions
In my anguish and my pain
Through my joy and my sorrow
In the promise of another tomorrow
I'll never let you part
For you're always in my heart

[Verse 1]
You roll like thunder when you come crashin' in
Town ain't been the same since you left with all your friends
You roll like thunder when you come crashing in
Regattas in the wind, that's why you're visiting

[Pre-Chorus]
You act like fucking Mr. Brightside when you're with all your friends
But I know what you're like when the party ends

[Chorus]
Just do it
Just do it, don't wait
Just do it
Just do it, don't wait

[Verse 2]
You roll like thunder, pourin' all your drinks
The party's lit and you, my friend, half-cut when it begins
You roll like thunder, you're tryna catch that wind
That lightning in the bottle, that moonbeam in your hand

[Pre-Chorus]
And you try to see the bright side when each new day begins
But you're not satisfied at the rainbow's end

[Chorus]
Just do it
Just do it, don't wait
I don't wanna wait
Just do it
Just do it, don't wait

[Bridge]
'Cause if you're on fire, you're on fire (Just do it)
Just keep burnin', 'til rain (Just do it, don't wait)
Baby, keep me ablaze
Honey, if you're on fire, you're on fire (Just do it)
Just keep burning, keep me alive (Just do it, don't wait)
Spare your blade

[Chorus]
Just do it
Just do it, don't wait
If hello just means goodbye then, honey, better walk away
Just do it
Just do it, don't wait
If hello just means goodbye then, baby, better walk away
Just do it
Just do it, don't wait
'Cause I don't wanna wait
Just do it
Just do it, don't wait

[Outro]
(Just do it)
(Just do it, don't wait)
If you're on fire, you're on fire
You should just keep burning (Just do it)
(Just do it, don't wait)
(Just do it)
(Just do it, don't wait)

[Verse 1]
Are you gonna see me when light gets dark?
The sun goes down over Gramercy Park
And it's become easy to hide pieces away
Making up someone in the hope that you'll stay

[Chorus]
'Cause I've been trying to be everything I think you want me to be
I've been doing all the things that I think you wanna see
I've been trying to fulfill you with your every need
Now you falling for a person that's not even me
Said you falling for a person that's not even me (Gimme the beat)

[Post-Chorus]
Mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm (Gimme the beat)
Mmm, mmm
Now you falling for a person that's not even me

[Verse 2]
Don't get me wrong, I wasn't out to deceive
I like the attention with your eyes on me
The trouble with the truth is it's so hard to believe
Now, here I stand with my heart on my sleeve

[Chorus]
And I've been trying to be everything I think you want me to be
I've been doing all the things that I think you wanna see
I've been trying to fulfill you with your every need
Now you falling for a person that's not even me
Said you falling for a person that's not even me (Gimme the beat)

[Post-Chorus]
Mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm (Gimme the beat)
Mmm, mmm
Now you falling for a person that's not even me
Now you falling for a person that's not even me
'Cause I forgot about the person that I used to be

[Verse 1: Usher]
It's been a while now, hope you don't hate me

Laid 'til the sunset, you tearin' it up (Ha)
Got a question: can I make you mine?
Can I take you courtside to see LeBron?
Can I put you in a condo in the sky?
Can I put your necklace on wintertime
Man, I got a lot ridin' on my line
And I got a lot of money on my mind (Yeah)

If we wasn't locked down right now, we be lockin' up right now (Aye!)

Pull up, yeah, yeah, yeah, pull up
How's the view from California?
Pull up, pull up, yeah, gotta pull up, pull up
Pull up, pull up, pull up, I'ma pull up
Little boxes on the hillside
Little boxes made of ticky-tacky
Little boxes on the hillside
Little boxes, all the same

There's a green one and a pink one
And a blue one and a yellow one
And they're all made out of ticky-tacky
And they all look just the same

And the people in the houses
All go to the university
And they all get put in boxes
And they all look just the same

And there's doctors and there's lawyers
And business executives
And they're all made out of ticky-tacky
And they all look just the same
Sitting here on a spaceship
Staring at spacemen
Floating away while they’re waving
All of a sudden
Everything starts to
Just fade away
I’m left in the dark all alone
There’s no one to talk to
And nowhere to go
I guess I’ll just get lost inside my mind
I’ve got the time
I know that I’m trying too hard
It’s just I haven’t been okay in a while
So stay for a while
Let’s get away for a while
Staring out of my window
Watching the world get small while I’m taking it all
In from the view that nobody knows
What do you know?
I know that I’m going too far
It’s just I haven’t been this close in a while
Stay for a while
Let’s get away for a while
Could you be my sunshine on a gloomy day?
Could you be my sunshine on a gloomy day?
Could you be my sunshine on a gloomy day?
Could you be my sunshine on a gloomy day?
I know I get dark sometimes
It’s just I have to go be alone for a while

[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
Lime and limpid green, a second scene
A fight between the blue you once knew
Floating down, the sound resounds
Around the icy waters underground
Jupiter and Saturn, Oberon, Miranda and Titania
Neptune, Titan, stars can frighten

[Verse 1]
Lime and limpid green, a second scene
A fight between the blue you once knew
Floating down, the sound resounds
Around the icy waters underground
Jupiter and Saturn, Oberon, Miranda and Titania
Neptune, Titan, stars can frighten

[2:28 - 7:17 - Instrumental]

[Verse 2]
Blinding signs flap
Flicker, flicker, flicker, blam
Pow, pow
Stairway scare Dan Dare who’s there?

[Verse 3]
Lime and limpid green, the sound surrounds
The icy waters under
Lime and limpid green, the sound surrounds
The icy waters underground

"50 Ways"

[Verse 1]
I could see me sittin' in the back of a cop car bangin' my head on a window
I could see me slammin' that last call shot glass, losin' everything in my billfold
Ooh, ooh
That's what I do when I'm drinkin' 'bout you

[Chorus]
So, I don't wanna go downtown doin' what we used to
Twist the top off another round, hell I got enough loose screws
I’m gettin' tired of hurtin' 'bout you
Nothin' ever changes
I think I'm gonna stay right here tonight
'Cause that could be dangerous
'Cause that could be dangerous

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I could see me doin' just fine with a Daisy Duke dime but I don't see it lastin' long
I could see me orderin' too many drinks at the bar
Get the bartender pourin' 'em strong
That's what I do when I'm tryna drink you gone

[Chorus]
So, I don't wanna go downtown doin' what we used to
Twist the top off another round, hell I got enough loose screws
I’m gettin' tired of hurting 'bout you
Nothin' ever changes
I think I'm gonna stay right here tonight
'Cause that could be dangerous
'Cause that could be dangerous

[Bridge]
Yeah, 'cause you
Got somebody else that you've been foolin'
Them same tricks up your sleeve, yeah
Ooh
I'd usually be the type to be out too
But you ruined that for me, so

[Chorus]
I don't wanna go downtown doin' what we used to
Twist the top off another round, hell I got enough loose screws
I’m gettin' tired of hurting' 'bout you
Nothin' ever changes
I think I'm gonna stay right here tonight
'Cause that could be dangerous
That could be dangerous
Dangerous
That could be dangerous

[Verse]
Sometimes I just feel like quittin', I still might
Why do I put up this fight? Why do I still write?
Sometimes it's hard enough just dealin' with real life
Sometimes I wanna jump on stage and just kill mics
And show these people what my level of skill's like
But I'm still white, sometimes I just hate life
Somethin' ain't right, hit the brake lights
Case of the stage fright, drawin' a blank like
Da-duh-duh-da-da, it ain't my fault
Great big eyeballs, my insides crawl
And I clam up, I just slam shut
I just can't do it, my whole manhood's
Just been stripped, I have just been 'vict'd
So I must then get off the bus, then split
Man, fuck this shit, yo, I'm goin' the fuck home
World on my shoulders as I run back to this 8 Mile Road

[Chorus]
I'm a man, I'ma make a new plan
Time for me to just stand up and travel new land
Time for me to just take matters into my own hands
Once I'm over these tracks, man, I'ma never look back
(8 Mile Road) And I'm gone, I know right where I'm goin'
Sorry, Momma, I'm grown, I must travel alone
Ain't gon' follow no footsteps, I'm makin' my own
Only way that I know how to escape from this 8 Mile Road

[Chorus: Eminem & Proof]
That's why they call me Slim Shady (I'm back)
I'm back (I'm back), I'm back
That's why they call me Slim Shady (I'm back)
I'm back (I'm back), I'm back
That's why they call me Slim Shady (I'm back)
I'm back (I'm back), I'm back
That's why they call me Slim Shady (I'm back)
I'm back (I'm back), I'm back

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I murder a rhyme, one word at a time
You never heard of a mind as perverted as mine
You better get rid of that 9, it ain't gonna help
What good's it gonna do against a man that strangles himself?
I'm waitin' for Hell, like hell, shit, I'm anxious as hell
Manson, you're safe in that cell, be thankful it's jail
I used to be my mommy's little angel at twelve
Thirteen, I was puttin' shells in a gauge on a shelf
I used to get punked and bullied on my block 'til I cut a kitten's head off
And stuck it in this kid's mailbox (Hey Ma', Ma'!)
I used to give a fuck, now I could give a fuck less
What do I think of success? It sucks, too much press
I'm stressed, too much cess, depressed, too upset
It's just too much mess, I guess I must just blew up quick (Yes)
Grew up quick (No) was raised right
Whatever you say is wrong, whatever I say's right
You think of my name now whenever you say, "Hi"
Became a commodity 'cause I'm W-H-I-
T-E, ‘cause MTV was so friendly
To me, can't wait 'til Kim sees me
Now, is it worth it? Look at my life, how is it perfect?
Read my lips, bitch! What, my mouth isn't workin'?
You hear this finger? Oh, it's upside down
Here, let me turn this motherfucker up right now

[Chorus: Eminem & Proof]
That's why they call me Slim Shady (I'm back)
I'm back (I'm back), I'm back
That's why they call me Slim Shady (I'm back)
I'm back (I'm back), I'm back
That's why they call me Slim Shady (I'm back)
I'm back (I'm back), I'm back
That's why they call me Slim Shady (Shady!)
I'm back (I'm back), I'm back

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I take each individual degenerate's head and reach into it
Just to see if he's influenced by me, if he listens to music
And if he feeds into this shit, he's an innocent victim
And becomes a puppet on the string of my tennis shoe
(*Scratches*) My name is Slim Shady
I been crazy way before radio didn't play me
The sensational (*scratch*) "Back is the incredible!"
With Ken Kaniff, who just finds the men edible
It's Ken Kaniff on the Internet
Tryin' to lure your kids with him into bed
It's a sick world we live in these days
"Slim, for Pete's sakes, put down Christopher Reeve's legs!"
Geez, you guys are so sensitive
"Slim, it's a touchy subject, try and just don't mention it."
Mind with no sense in it, fried schizophrenic, whose eyes
Get so squinted, I'm blind from smoke in 'em, with my windows tinted
With nine limos rented, doin' lines of coke in 'em
With a bunch of guys hoppin' out, all high and indo-scented
And that's where I get my name from, that's why they call me—

[Chorus: Eminem & Proof]
They call me Slim Shady (I'm back)
I'm back (I'm back), I'm back
That's why they call me Slim Shady (I'm back)
I'm back (I'm back), I'm back
That's why they call me Slim Shady (I'm back)
I'm back (I'm back), I'm back
That's why they call me Slim Shady (I'm back)
I'm back (I'm back), I'm back (Back)

CALI!

[Chorus: Eminem & Proof]
I said you don't wanna fuck with Shady ('Cause why?)
'Cause Shady will fucking kill you (Ah, ha-ha)
I said you don't wanna fuck with Shady (Why?)
'Cause Shady will fucking kill you

[Verse 1: Eminem]
They said I can't rap about being broke no more
They ain't say I can't rap about coke no more (Ahh)
Slut, you think I won't choke no whore
'Til them vocal cords don't work in her throat no more? (Ahh)
These motherfuckers are thinkin' I'm playin'
Thinkin' I'm sayin' this shit 'cause I'm thinkin' it just to be sayin' it (Ahh)
Put your hands down, bitch—I ain't gon' shoot you
I'ma pull you to this bullet and put it through you (Ahh)
Shut up, slut! You're causin' too much chaos
Just bend over and take it like a slut—okay, Ma?
"Oh, now he's raping his own mother
Abusing a whore, snorting coke
And we gave him the Rolling Stone cover?"
You're goddamn right, bitch, and now it's too late
I'm triple platinum and tragedies happened in two states
I invented violence, you vile venomous volatile bitches
Vain Vicodin, *vrin vrin vrin!*
Texas Chainsaw, left his brains all
Danglin' from his neck while his head barely hangs on
Blood, guts, guns, cuts
Knives, lives, wives, nuns, sluts

[Pre-Chorus: Eminem & Proof]
Bitch, I'ma kill you! You don't wanna fuck with me
Girls neither, you ain't nothin' but a slut to me
Bitch, I'ma kill you! You ain't got the balls to beef
We ain't gon' never stop beefin', I don't squash the beef
You better kill me, I'ma be another rapper dead
For poppin' off at the mouth with shit I shouldn't have said
But when they kill me, I'm bringin' the world with me
Bitches too, you ain't nothin' but a girl to me

[Chorus: Eminem & Proof]
I said you don't wanna fuck with Shady ('Cause why?)
'Cause Shady will fucking kill you (Ah, ha-ha)
I said you don't wanna fuck with Shady (Why?)
'Cause Shady will fucking kill you
Bitch I'ma kill you

[Interlude: Eminem & Em & Proof]
Cali what the fuck is going on?
Shit. How y'all doing....
Motherfuckin' D!

[Intro: D12]
Put em up! Put em up! Put em up! Put em up! Put em up!
Put em up! Put em up! Put em up! Put em up! Put em up!

[Hook: D12]
So you can suck my dick if you don't like my shit
‘Cause I was high when I wrote this, so suck my dick!

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Two pills I pop, 'til my pupils swell up like two pennies
I'm Clint Eastwood in his mid-twenties
A young-ass man with a trash can, strapped to the back
Of his ass so the rats can't chew through his last pants
I'm like a mummy at night, fightin' with bright lightnin'
And frightened with five little white Vicodin pills bitin' him
I'm like a fuckin' wasp in the hospital, lost
Stingin' the fuck outta everything I come across in the halls
I light a candle and place it up on the mantel
Grab a knife at the blade and stab you with the fuckin' handle
So when you find yourself wrapped up in the blinds, hurtin'
(Bitch, it's too late)
‘Cause once you're hung from the drapes, it's curtains

[Verse 2: Swifty]
I'm an instigator, .380 slug penetrator
Degradin', creatin' murders to kill haters
Accused for every crime known through the equator
They knew I did it for havin' blood on my 'gators
My weed'll hit your chest like a double barrel gauge and
I'm a black grenade that'll blow up in yo' face
With a fifth in me, when I guzzle Remy I do shit on purpose
You never hear me say, "Forgive me"
I'm snatchin' every penny, it gotta be that way, nigga, face it
That weed I sold to you, Brigade laced it
You hidin', I make the President get a facelift
Niggas just afraid, handin' me they bracelets
Chillin' in the lab wasted, I'm the type
That'll drink Kahlua and gin, throw up on the mic
Your life is ruined, you get socked right on sight
And even at the Million Man March, we gon' fight

[Hook: D12]
So you can suck my dick if you don't like my shit
‘Cause I was high when I wrote this, so suck my dick!
‘Cause I don't give a fuck if you don't like my shit
‘Cause I was high when I wrote this, so suck my dick!

[Verse 3: Bizarre]
I'm a compulsive liar, settin' my preacher on fire
Slashin' your tires, flyin' down Fenkell and Meyers
Plates expired, soon as I'm hired I'm fired
Jackin' my dick off in a bed of barbed wire
(Hey, is Bizarre performin'?) Bitch, didn't you read the flyer?
The special invited guest will be Richard Pryor
(Aren't you a male dancer?) No, bitch, I'm retired
Fuckin' your bitch in the ass with a tire iron
I'm ripped, I'm on an acid trip
My DJ's in a coma for lettin' the record skip
I'm fuckin' anything when I'm snortin'
It's gonna cost 300 dollars to get my pitbull an abortion
Some bitch asked for my autograph
I called her a whore, spit beer in her face and laughed
I drop bombs like I was in Vietnam
All bitches is hoes, even my stinkin'-ass mom

[Verse 4: Proof]
Ayo, flashback, two feets, two deep up in that ass crack
Weed laced with somethin'– nigga, pass that!
In Amsterdam we only hang out with hash rats
At a "Stop the Violence" rally, I blast gats
BMI on publishin'; get yo' ass capped
The Kuniva, divide up yo' cash stack
Run yo' motherfuckin' pockets, ASAP
I don't need a platinum chain, bitch, I snatched Shaq's
Born loser, half thief and half black
Bring your boys and your guns and get laughed at
Bitch smacker, rich rappers get they Jag jacked
And found chopped up in a trash bag

[Hook: D12]
So you can suck my dick if you don't like my shit
‘Cause I was high when I wrote this, so suck my dick!
‘Cause I don't give a fuck if you don't like my shit
‘Cause I was high when I wrote this, so suck my dick!

[Chorus]
Why you looking at me?
Why you looking at me? Oh
All these bitches looking at me
Tell me, do you like what you see?

[Post-Chorus]
Pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up
When I pull up, pull up, pull up
When I pull up, pull up, pull up,  pull up, pull up
When I pull up, pull up, pull up, hey

[Verse 1]
Gimme that paycheck
Worked all week, now I wanna forget
Make it rain, so wet
I get lucky like Russian Roulette
Wanna lose control
Feel good and so damn beautiful
Gonna spend it all
'Cause it's the weekend and I wanna let go

[Pre-Chorus]
I got the flashing lights
Chandeliers and limousines, in a dream
And we're never going home
'Cause we’re up so high
Airplanes and luxury, can't you see?
We just got payed so we're 'bout that money

[Chorus]
Why you looking at me?
Why you looking at me? Oh
All these bitches looking at me
Tell me, do you like what you see?

[Post-Chorus]
Pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up
And when I pull up, pull up, pull up
And when I pull up, pull up, pull up,  pull up, pull up
And when I pull up, pull up, pull up, hey

[Verse 2]
Now I'm on a roll
Propane, I'm about to take off
Sippin' from bottles
Champagne with the cherry on top
Man, I lost control
Feel good and so damn beautiful
Gonna spend it all
'Cause it's the weekend, I don't wanna go home

[Pre-Chorus]
I got the flashing lights
Chandeliers and limousines, in a dream
And we're never going home
'Cause we’re up so high
Airplanes and luxury, can't you see?
We just got payed so we're 'bout that money

[Breakdown]
'Bout that money, 'bo-bout that money
'Bo-bo-bout that money
'Bout that money, 'bout that money
'Bo-bo-bout that money

[Chorus]
Why you looking at me?
Why you looking at me? Oh
All these bitches looking at me
Tell me, do you like what you see?

[Pre-Chorus]
I got the flashing lights (Lights)
Chandeliers and limousines, in a dream
And we're never going home
'Cause we’re up so high (So high)
Airplanes and luxury, can't you see?
We just got payed so we're 'bout that money

[Instrumental outro]

[Verse 1]
Walking right behind you through lights and lost tears
My imagination is black and unclear

[Chorus]
This heart beats harder everyday
Harder everyday, harder everyday
I still see through
To you it's never hard to walk away
Purple clouded pain
Harder everyday to fall for you, ooh

[Verse 2]
Memories of a bright silver star, lame girl here
Words you said echo in the dark through my ears
Haunted I'm loosing my place
Toxic blood runs through my veins
I start to fade

[Chorus]
This heart beats harder everyday
Harder everyday, harder everyday
I still see through
To you it's never hard to walk away
Purple clouded pain
Harder everyday to fall for you, ooh
This heart beats harder everyday
Harder everyday, harder everyday
I still see through
To you it's never hard to walk away
Purple clouded pain
Harder everyday to fall for you, ooh

[Bridge]
Obsessed, I'm meant to build my fences
Only to break them down
Your purple poison, leaves me breathless
But can't seem to knock me out

[Chorus]
This heart beats harder everyday
Harder everyday, harder everyday
I still see through
