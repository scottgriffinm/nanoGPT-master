[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
When it comes to the bread, I got the keys to the bakery
These niggas out 'chere trippin', sellin' keys to them agencies
My bitch keep saying that the judge got a date for me
I tell a silly bitch and your honor they can wait for me
I'm gone in the coupe with the roof steady chasing me
Shine so hard, like the fucking sun facing me—basically
Take it how you take it, I be making you be hating me
Loving me, but hating me; ho, you got to pay for me
Riding in the big boys, sitting on them grown folks
Every time I park, it's a motherfucking car show
I guess I'm the number-one Lakers fan
Yellow bottle, yellow bottle; purple bag, purple bag

[Hook: Mack Maine, Curren$y, & DJ tags]

[Verse 2: Curren$y]
Well, they know me as lil' Curren$y, but some call me "The Hot Spitta"
Sittin' in the Chevy on three wheels, like a tricycle
Always been a fly nigga since I was a little one
Bottle-pop like the NBA Finals is what we won (Yeah)
I puff a lot of blunts (Yeah) with my nigga, Weezy B
One night, I was so high, I thought that I forgot how to read
Young Money fly boys, mami—weed a different breed
Throwing parties at secret locations somewhere on the beach
We off in Privé, Patrón shots for the models
And send a bottle of that Cris' up to the DJ
I live by these rules only: money over bitches (Ha)
And it been like that ever since I could remember

[Hook: Mack Maine]
Now, ever since I could remember, I been poppin' them bottles
Pop— Poppin' them bottles, pop— poppin' them bottles

Now, ever since I could remember, I been poppin' them bottles
Pop— Poppin' them bottles (Hey), pop— poppin' them bottles (Hey)
Now, ever since I could remember (Hey), I been smokin' that 'dro (Bitch, I'm Mack Maine!)
With my motherfucking pistol in my hand, in my hand (Hey, hey, ayy)

[Verse 3: Mack Maine]
I just copped me some purp' (Purp'), I'm 'bout to open up (Chyeah)
I put my heart in my prices—see, I'ma show you love
See, I front you an ounce—to get you started, clown (Yeah)
And you ain't got to go to Mickey-D's for quarter-pounds (Ugh)
I be in A-Town, livin' la vida, la loca (Yeah)
Throwin' that money on cho'cha (Yeah), spendin' a stack up in Strokers (Chyeah)
Yes, I'm a ani-mal (Ani-mal); to be frank, I'm a dog
If it's that time of the month, baby-girl, I need some skull (Bitch!)
Some mouth-and-lip service—that'd be perfect
You saw the rims on the Benz, and you got nervous (Ugh)
But I'm a G—yep! I pop my collar (Ugh), hop in Impalas (Ugh)
Ride for the dollars (Ugh), hit the club (Ugh)
Go straight to the bar (Ugh), and pop my bottles (Ugh)

[Hook: Mack Maine]
Now, ever since I could remember, I been poppin' them bottles
Pop— Poppin' them bottles, pop— poppin' them bottles
Now, ever since I could remember, I been smokin' that 'dro
With my motherfucking pistol in my hand, in my hand
Now, ever since I could remember, I been poppin' them bottles

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne & DJ tags]
Ridin' with a bitch I call "Hot-Mouth Shelly"
She pop them ecstasies and get that cottonmouth heavy
I give her bottled water; bitch break out sweatin'
And then, she get straight to that head, like a fuckin' Excedrin
I'm a fly-ass nigga—take a look at me, bitch
Now, ho, go and tell the cops I got a crook in my dick
Straight gut a bitch open, like a hook in a fish
I got a lady from Paris who French-kiss my shit, yeah
Why you think I gotta tint my whips?
'Cause I be gettin' some head—right in my shit
You say you love that woman, but that been my bitch
And if you kiss that woman, then you suck my dick
These hoes is nasty—y'all niggas is trippin'
I got a bitch with a mouth like that boy, Ken Griffey
When I'm out in the streets, better believe I'm pimpin'
And if you ever saw me with one of them video vixens— (Gangsta Gri-Zillz!)

[Chorus: Lil Wayne & Too $hort sample]
I was gettin some head, gettin— gettin some head (Yeah)

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
You know me—I smoke a blunt while I'm gettin' brain
Stick my finger in her butt while I'm gettin' brain
Yeah, I'm nasty bitch! What! Lil Wayne
I like them Mac'd-up lips and two tongue rings
I gotta say it: I'm the President—I run things
Now, all these hoes tryna save a nigga' cum-stains
Real talk: I get head on the airplane
Bitch be climbin' all over that lil' chair-thing
I pull her hair back—she holler "Yeah" back
I like a bitch with some lips like a bear-trap
And I don't mind goin' down—I take care of that
I have homie at home, like, "Where she at?"
She with me in my bad-ass ride
Givin' me a blowjob like a nine-to-five
She said she eat her vegetables so she stay alive
So she slob on my knob, like corn on the cob

[Hook: Lil Wayne, Too $hort sample, & DJ tags]
I was— gettin— gettin (Yeah)
Gettin— gettin some head (You know)

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
My name Wayne, and I came to party
My watch an Icee, and my chain a Frosty
Them bitches like me, but they mans is salty
I ain't on strike three, but his brains'll cost me
I'ma chill, like waiting for the doctor
I'm awaitin' for the proper head doctor—
Hey, I need a check-up!
And mami telling me her man need to step up
I'm like, "Say no more, 'cause there's the door"
And my niggas like I ain't tryin' hate on yours"
I'm like, "Boy I don't save no whore"—oh, no!
I'm too small to go against the code
So I grab me a freak and be like, "Let's roll"
'Cause after the afterparty—
It's the muh'fuckin' bachelor party—that's what's up
Master suite, master: me
And we "Ungh!"-ing all night like Master P, yeah!

My name Wayne, and I came from money
I gotta pretty bitch with me, but her brains is ugly
Got a city bitch with me, but her brains is country
Yeah, a silly bitch with me, man—her brains is dummy
Be smart—I'll take the brains of dummies
That Desert Eagle "New Workout Plan": brain, then tummy
I ain't got no umbrella, and it's rainin' money
I'm dumb-better than these lames that's stuntin'
I run better, like Corey Dillon for the New England Pats
They like, "No, he didn't get that new Bentley, black and white"
Sure he did, no kiddin', know he kitted it
Know he told the dealer, "Make sure there's no equivalent"
So that makes this a one-of-one
That mean: none before it, none to come
Young Money, but the money ain't young; neither the night
So, what are you drinkin'? Make it a double—you in trouble, oh! (Trendsetter!)

[Break: Lil Wayne, DJ Drama, & DJ tags]

My name Wayne, and I came to rock
I come a long way from turnin' cocaine to rock
Like the song say, "Get— Get your ass on up"
But her thong say, "Pull me down or to the side":
And I go and say, "Sweetie, can you open up your walkway?"
Bet I run up and down your hallway all day, shit!
Ain't nothin like a hard-day menage, ayy
I call it "three the hard way," oh!
Hollygrove hard case, star-face, Scarface
Very similar to my pa' face
I'm particular 'bout my court case
I ride fly: Look out the window—you saw space—I ride high
My interior tie-dye, I'm so superior
You lookin' at Cash Money's interior, you hearin' me?
Birdman J-R-uh, period
Holla at a nigga when you're serious—shit (Gangsta Gri-Zillz!)

Pistol right there in my reach—you know what it be: him or me
Bitches know when that limo leave, two words: room key

Super bowl ring, bitch

I told you I'm coming back—I got that Tommy Mottola
That's blood all over your Rover, blood all over your chauffeur
Blood all over your loafers—
If I get any closer, there's blood all over my toaster, blood all over my holster
I'm in them S. Dots: That's blood all over my Hovas—fuck!
I'm hustlin' with a motive: My niggas need me
And that Tiger in my pocket say, "Feed me"—it's greedy
See them niggas—jack them niggas; kill them niggas—whack them niggas
Ask them bitches, ask them niggas: Weezy Baby—that's the nigga
Catch me mashing in a V: matching seats, matching feet
Sheesh! That bitch too sweet for the streets
Got that keef in the leaf if he finna beef; no need to speak—let it be what it be
Niggas want peace—I make 'em leave here, piece by piece
Fuck me? Fuck you! What it is? What it do?
I been ready since eighty-one, and I was born in eighty-two
Hollygrove where I'm from, but we call that bitch "The Zoo"
I ain't never trust a bitch since she ate that forbidden fruit
Sucker-free, sucker-proof; fifty shots, cut 'em loose
Quarterback Weezy, baby: Shotgun, run, and shoot
Coming true—Young'un' do what young'un's do: ball, baby
At home, fornicating; homie by the phone, waiting
Goddamn, I am a man, "the man"

[Outro: DJ Drama]
So I'ma talk my shit for a minute
I wanted to take a vacation
Niggas wouldn't let me
The streets too dry—they need us!

[Intro]
I know, I know
Weezy Wee, this dedicated to my father, nigga
Rabbit nigga, y'all excuse the expressions

[Verse 1]
What it be like up there baby boy, ay this here ya son hollerin at ya
I miss the shit out ya, it's hard to be without ya
But I know you watchin, peepin down on how I'm livin
Ay, tell Jesus I said thanks for the blessings he sendin
Please ask him to forgive me for the sins I commit
Just let him know I'm still young and at risk
Say, I'll never forget the time that you caught me smokin herb in the house
I was dead wrong, I deserved to get out
But you just talked it over with my mom and got it situated in due time
Told me get the paper instead of high
So now I take that advice and shed light over my whole life dog
I wanted to be just like you my whole life dog
I can't believe them niggas stole ya, that shit's pain to me
But don't trip, I hold you down, you still remain through me
And dog I know I can't see you but I bet that you smilin
And I'm a make you even happier, I promise

[Chorus]
I know you can't be close to me nigga, I know
But I know you watchin over me nigga, I know
But the shit's steady hurtin, burn deep
But it's alright dog, everything gon' be alright dog
I know you can't be close to me nigga, I know
But I know you watchin over me nigga, I know
But the shit's steady hurtin, burn deep
But it's alright dog, everything gon' be alright dog

[Verse 2]
I know you see my daughter growin up and bad as ever
But she cool cause she do whatever daddy tell her
And your wife, she's still the most wonderful woman
I just built her a new house, she ain't runnin from nothin
B and Slim, them niggas still love me like they own child
Ms. Rose nerves get bad, but still she gon' smile
And me I'm on some squad shit and some debate it
But I know they love it way more than they hate it
And I know you probably laughin at the way I treat these hoes and these
Bitches
I try love 'em, my BM be trippin
But Rabbit, you know one thing, I got the game from you, every perspective
That's why I keep the gun at close connection for protection
And you see I left school behind and chose CMB
It was impossible on the road every week, but I know enough
And I follow by everything you ever told me, think wisely
Watch over me my nigga, just guide me

[Chorus]
I know you can't be close to me nigga, I know
But I know you watchin over me nigga, I know
But the shit's steady hurtin, burn deep
But it's alright dog, everything gon' be alright dog
I know you can't be close to me nigga, I know
But I know you watchin over me nigga, I know
But the shit's steady hurtin, burn deep
But it's alright dog, everything gon' be alright dog

[Verse 3]
I swear to you man, at some times I really wish I was with you
Cause I get fed up with this life and I miss you
Somebody pass me a tissue, and let me wipe the tears from my eyes
Yeah, nigga I cried, it's cause I loved you dog
I promise I won't ever put nothin above you dog
So I live my life in dedication of you dog
I know you see me happy on the outside and hurt within
Make me wanna grab that gun and burst again
But I know they got a reason why I'm here
And I know they got a reason why you gone
And therefore, I'm succeedin on my own
But you ain't never left me, nigga, you still dwell in my heart
I can't forget you kept it real from the start
And until my last breath I exhale, I'm a keep you with me
And when we do meet again, I'm a keep you with me
And tell them niggas Pac, B.I.G. and Pun I said "thay's my peoples"
Watch over me nigga 'til I see you

[Chorus]
I know you can't be close to me nigga, I know
But I know you watchin over me nigga, I know
But the shit's steady hurtin, burn deep
But it's alright dog, everything gon' be alright dog
I know you can't be close to me nigga, I know
But I know you watchin over me nigga, I know

[Outro]
I know I can't be close to you (dog)
I know you watching over me dog
But the shit's that it hurt and burn deep

And plus now I'm on some squad shit
My niggas, they keep it real with me

My little girl growning beutiful as ever man
You need to see her dog, she bad though man
Anyway dog, aiight holla!

[Verse 1]
The block is hot, the cops is swarmin a neighborhood heavy
While niggas off in the neighborhood sellin, with penitentiary chances
The dope roped up in the cup of their pants
Fiends flock like spazzes come get this candy
I got heroin in bundles, them Highland O's
Plus a cooked slab, chopped up, dimes is swoll
If I spot the law's comin', hey, it's time to roll
Candy Carter got a line of parole, out of control
The first fell a Tuesday this month oh sweet thang
Plus it's a sweet day, me next score for three days
One time they say what you mean, I gets the green
Break up the block like Maurice Green, ya feel me?
In my predicament I'm guilty until proven innocent
Hustle ridiculous, I'm tryin to get this dope continuos
Ball til I fall, one thing, I ain't tryin to fall
Want everybody numb like anbesol
But he heard

[Chorus]
Uh oh
There go them fuckin' po-po's
And if you know like I know
You better get off the corner
Uh oh
There go them fuckin' po-po's
And if you know like I know

Uh oh

And if you know like I know
You better get off the corner
Uh oh

And if you know like I know

[Verse 2]
I'm a young dog, wild and ecstatic, violent when passin
Hem gangstas doin time in a parishment, role models
And keep ya cup, we drink whole bottles, and cuss at niggas
Like fuck that nigga, I let my pump subtract niggas
You beef with me I guarantee your mams be missin
With a note behind demandin three chickens or she gets it
Do not twist it because lil man is trippin
They could have ya body in three different places
Ain't nothin gravy, but save it
Cause I'm a ride and hit the nigga street
Weezy go to war like Sadaam and Clinton disagree
While I'm shitty from the weed
Like were them bustas be
I promise ya never fuckin sleep, I clear the set
Come outside late at night to your surprise I'm here with Tec's
Two shots knock off the niggas necks, it's so realistic
So I hope ya get it, or else them shots poke ya fitted
Be on the block until them souljas hit it
That's when he heard....

[Chorus]
Blocka
Me come to tear your block up
If you don't want no problems
You better get off the corner
Blocka
Me come to tear your block up
If you don't want no problems

If you don't want no problems
You better get off the corner
Blocka
Me come to tear your block up
If you don't want no problems
You better get off the corner

[Verse 3]
All right, I cook it, cut it, ship and move it
I make a livin in this crooked public distributin
Just take a peek around, the hood is floodin, shit is boomin
The hottest D in town lookin for me hit me Tuesday, like after six
See I crack the bricks right down to Z's
Got pounds of trees, my blocks blazin qp's to ki's
Gangin in the cheese, them bricks is comin
No droughts I don't sit on nothin
I don't believe I'm frontin
If I give you a dime, I leave with somethin
The big dog, Nigga I got the city under siege
And the law don't bother me, I give the pigs a couple of G's
Shit, I hustle strong to push this work through the streets
I'm tryin to deal with every nigga, and sell the birds up cheap
I'm greedy, if there's any money bein made from drugs I need it
Twenty bricks two weeks completed, you can't beat it
Whatever you want, holla at me when you need to get it
Does anybody else, I'll pay em a visit
That's when ya heard....

[Chorus]
Come here peeps
I'm hearin' that you run these streets

[Intro]
Check
Huh
What?
What?
Let's go, nigga (Where you at, Wheezy?)

[Verse 1]
You liable to catch me speedin' up the six, or beatin' up a chick
Or standin' over a stove, sweatin', heatin' up a brick
And we keep the hustlin' slick, and got clips like bananas
We twist the bandanas, and spit at niggas with cannons
We ran in habitats with masks and plastic gats
Stormin' through the house, screamin', "Where's this bastard's crack?!!"
I flash the mack in front of your gal and make her tell
Like, "Slut! Where's the yay, or I'mma pop one in your grill!"
It's Lil Wayne, nigga - blast and bang triggas
Pay with my change, then I'm gon' have to bang niggas
I bag the caine quicker, and sprinkle like rain, nigga
Flood the av quick with the quarters and halves, nigga
If you out, you can find me on the street with the work
If it's a drought, you can find me on the street with the work
Never slip - I empty half a clip deep in your shirt
And put your whole clique deep in the dirt
Smell me?

[Chorus]
Who wan' beef with 'em?
Who wan' creep with 'em?
And when it comes down to guns, nigga, I sleep with 'em
See, we can sweep with 'em cause it get deep with 'em
And when it comes down to drugs, I'm on the streets with 'em
Who wan' beef with 'em?
Who wan' creep with 'em?
And when it comes down to guns, nigga, I sleep with 'em
See, we can sweep with 'em cause it get deep with 'em
And when it comes down to drugs, I'm on the streets with 'em

[Verse 2]
Look
I'm the youngest Hot Boy on the field with heaters
Let my nine-millimeters kill your peoples
Bust up in your house and put the gun to lil' Renita
Give me the yay, or else I'mma put her in her sneakers
Wow (wow, wow) you can catch me in all black with no smile
Me, Turk, Geezy, and 'Nile - chicka-POW!
How come these niggas keep burnin the world?
And why the hell this nigga Wheezy keep firmin your girl?
Turnin the wheel on the orange and teal Bentley drop
Then I'mma put that up and hop in the van and hit your block
Tell your mom to get the cops cause y'all gon' need 'em
When you see them bullets that my Glock pop, y'all gon' eat 'em
See this for all my niggas in the pen, I hope for freedom
And this for all my niggas buyin bricks, I got 'em cheaper
Keep a nigga quiet as a mouse when I come
Wayne #1 Hot Boy, hot as the sun - ya smell me?

[Chorus]
Who wan' beef with 'em?
Who wan' creep with 'em?
And when it comes down to guns, nigga, I sleep with 'em
See, we can sweep with 'em cause it get deep with 'em
And when it comes down to drugs, I'm on the streets with 'em
Who wan' beef with 'em?
Who wan' creep with 'em?
And when it comes down to guns, nigga, I sleep with 'em
See, we can sweep with 'em cause it get deep with 'em
And when it comes down to drugs, I'm on the streets with 'em

[Verse 3]
Nasty case, nigga run up in your crib, crash the place
Mask the face, automatic attach to waist
You bastards play? Then it get awful and bad
There will be no more walkin for dad, and it's off with your head
And they gon' either get it right, or they get it at night
And when they spit, it lick his ass twice like 20 damn dice
Henny and ice is what I prefer, but light on the rocks
I pack them clips tight on them Glocks and light up your block
And if there's coke involved, then your throat's involved
I get the toaster and roll up and smoke most of y'all
Me and my nigga, Super Sosa, run up in your crib
While your grandma watchin Oprah, jag her up and rope her
If you wan' grudge, chances slim like Ethiopia
If you want drugs, I got more flavors than Fruitopia
Recognize it's real and nothing other than that
Cause one from the mac'll have blood coverin your back, ha?

[Chorus]
Who wan' beef with 'em?
Who wan' creep with 'em?
And when it comes down to guns, nigga, I sleep with 'em
See, we can sweep with 'em cause it get deep with 'em
And when it comes down to drugs, I'm on the streets with 'em
Who wan' beef with 'em?
Who wan' creep with 'em?
And when it comes down to guns, nigga, I sleep with 'em
See, we can sweep with 'em cause it get deep with 'em
And when it comes down to drugs, I'm on the streets with 'em
Who wan' beef with 'em?
Who wan' creep with 'em?
And when it comes down to guns, nigga, I sleep with 'em
See, we can sweep with 'em cause it get deep with 'em
And when it comes down to drugs, I'm on the streets with 'em
Who wan' beef with 'em?
Who wan' creep with 'em?
And when it comes down to guns, nigga, I sleep with 'em
See, we can sweep with 'em cause it get deep with 'em
And when it comes down to drugs, I'm on the streets with 'em

[Outro]
Who wan' beef with a nigga? Creep with a nigga?
When it comes down to guns, look, I sleep with them triggas

Wrapped around my waist like a cummerbund
Don't make a nigga pump (clap clap) you up!
I come in that new thing she threw up
Now yo' bitch ass gotta clean yo' shoe up
I'm rich as fuck and I never blew up
Business mug gotta get my loot up
Bet ya bitch get fucked if I ever met her
Bet ya ditch get dug you ever step up
One by one I push 'em down
Fat bullet fat head make a pussy sound
Hard head soft ass make a gushy ground
I'm straight from a crooked town

[Verse 3]
I give my arms and my legs to the game I'm ahead of the game

And I'm a fool wit the flame and the 'caine
Cut it just a little bit but the drain stay the same yea
Young Wayne and the pain and the stain still remain
On the chest where the four made a mess, yes
I'm still here in the flesh, 21-year-old legend, I'ma live way after my death
I sacrifice whateva that's left

Spit wine at ya face if you watch me bitch!

Now she wanna get inside of me 66
She see my wrist is blue and yellow like Michigan
She say she love her man, she misses him
But nobody do it better than her distance dick, me
I'm her long distance pimp
When I land my bitches want for me on the strip, yup
And I don't lie I confess
I'm the one who turn that orange vest to a dress
Gotta dress to impress though
Gotta stay clean, plus mami in a Lex 4
She with me, what you expect, I live to be fly to death

Bet he was lame, bet he ain't Lil Wayne, no
Cause I'm way more fly, yeah
Have you hangin' 'round a bunch of yayo buyers, nope
And not a day go by us
We don't get higher than the telephone wires
Cut your telephone off, we ridin'
Where phones don't roam, they don't even come on
You're far from home so leave it alone
You creeping with the king of the throne
You sleeping in a tee and a thong
With your hair in a pony
I ain't got no blinds we can stare at the morning, yeah
But I can't be there all morning
I'm a pimp baby, yeah I'm going, going, going, gone

[Chorus: Jazze Pha & Lil Wayne]

And you walk kinda mean, how you strut with a dip
And you talk kinda clean and you lick your lips
But I can't fall for you cause I stick to the script, yeah
I said I stick to my grip

Sorry honey Jazze

[Chorus: Jazze Pha & Lil Wayne]

You ain't gotta have the staff of ESPN
You ain't gotta have ABC staff just to speak sports, baby

Just fuck with your boy and I'll get you a jersey
What you want me to put on the back?
"Daddy's little girl", that's right

And you can see what you see and peek how you peek
And get what you get
Know what I'm talking 'bout?

[Break: Lil Wayne]
Ladies and gentlemen, the great Manuella

[Verse 2: Mannie Fresh]
I got this rat named Shelly that love Makavelli
Number five combo meals and splashin' KY jelly
I have old school shorty, still drink a forty
Grab the mic, start a fight, and fuck up the whole party
Baby you should leave, adjust yo weave
That's velcro, hell no, bitch go wit Steve
I got this lead singer bitch from a popular group
I would say her name, but she bought me a coupe
Got this super ho Shawna, smell like marijuana
How she dig Lil Wayne, but she love the Big Tymers
Got pretty girl Patrice found out I'm fuckin her niece
She tried to stab me, so I grabbed her and we called the police
Mister Officer, the bitch done lost it bruh
She goin to jail, oh well, I be fuckin her
See two dyke Spanish twins nuts pressed on they chin
Will we go video, well nigga, that depends

[Chorus; Lil Wayne]
Hoes, let's just talk about hoes
Can we talk about hoes, these hoes
I don't love 'em
Hoes, let's just talk about hoes
Can we talk about hoes, these hoes

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
I got old school bitches and new school hoes
Female basketball players with cornrolls
And I don't like short-haired girls, no not really
If I do, she gotta look like the old Halle Berry
Or the broke Toni Braxton, the first Lil Kim
But I still take hood rats and work with them
Put yo ass in a jag and I drop ya quick
Give ya ass a lil game, if ya smirk ya in
I'm a pimp, not a simp, like ice in my drink
And I don't think twice or blink cause I'm focused
Rollin in the whitest mink like I'm polar
Bear, yea, let down my hair
Get jazzy on a bitch like Fred Astaire
Rose gold in her face get her red as glare
My Bentley plum, my Mercedes pear
I am lookin for a freak, mama take me there, yea

[Chorus; Lil Wayne]
Hoes, let's just talk about hoes
Can we talk about hoes, these hoes
I don't love 'em
Hoes, let's just talk about hoes

I go by Weezy The Don
Magnificent nigga, lot of ice around my neck, freezin' the arm
And if a nigga decide to test, their chest get completely took off
And if you wonder who the fuck are them killas with the money nigga
We be the squad. It's so serious like
It's like ain't nothin' but 10 hot shellys
On the block everyday sellin' rocks and shit
Choppin' bricks - give the damn cops a dick
We cop a whip and drop a brick - that's how we do it
Weed, liquor, money, and guns how we do it
Freak bitch to swallow cum like fluid
Who it be? Through his feet, Dubbs
Ain't nothin' sweet cause I can't keep trust
Lil' nigga - worth well over a mill, nigga
Real nigga - come around and show up where you live, nigga
Better hide the kids nigga parents and all
Wayne 'bout to damage your home
Look up out the window, see the man and his dawgs
Hoppin' out the van with bandanas and all
Cannons went off
News cameras takin' pictures of your family when your abdomen’s gone
Damn, it's a shame how the bullets slammed in your brain
How the ice slammed the pain, rammin' your dame
That's because she ran into the game
Nigga, stop playin' with Lil Wayne
Come on!

[Chorus]
It ain't a game, nigga - I don't know who told you it was
I put holes in your mug if you're holdin' a grudge
Try to take 'em when you get the gun and load
And the slug check ya low when I bust
Come to show you no love
Uh, fuck with me now - they can't fuck with me now
No! They can't fuck with me now - they can't fuck with me now
Stop playin' with me get it understood
Cause I know if you know what's good for ya
Come around your hood for ya
You don’t know me, I’ll kill everyone who should love ya
You have them motherfuckers lookin' all up in the woods for ya

[Verse 2]
Iceberg Shorty dammit, pants is saggin', forty magnum
Comin' out the club on Bacardi's, staggerin'
Tinted up Ferrari wagon, braggin'
Ohh, what's happenin'?
(??) 'round the court cause some ex just looked at me
Runnin' with them cats that be clappin' the plastic
Nigga put a cap in your asses
Catch me on the ave with the crack and a 'matic
Hopin' that the law don't pass me - stash it
First of the month, just snatched me a package
Bag it - 'bout to get this motherfucker crackin'
If a nigga think about jackin', please believe
I be clip-slappin', click-clackin'
Pull the bitch back and run up on his parents
Kidnap for his snacks, and then whack him
Shit get drastic
That's why I try to stay as fars away from beef as I could
Grab me a freak to eats on my wood
Transport coke from each of my hoods
Weezy Wee - CMB's in my blood
Eagle Street 17's where I'm from
And I ain't got no feelins for none of these womens
Scrilla, Dough, fetticheese is my love
You know the streets made me
And I don't give a damn if you hate me
Nigga better be S-Q-A-D
Until the day the man do take me
Squad shit!
You don't want no violence to keep the quiet
We call my people wild, and then we beef in quiet
Or we'll creep in houses, we'll sweep your momma
So, please stay out it, or you leave in silence
Come on! What!

[Chorus]
It ain't a game, nigga - I don't know who told you it was
I put holes in your mug if you're holdin' a grudge
Try to take 'em when you get the gun and load
And the slug check ya low when I bust
Come to show you no love
Uh, fuck with me now - they can't fuck with me now
Uh, they can't fuck with me now, them can't fuck with me now
Stop playin' when ya get it understood
Cause I know if you know what's good for ya
Come around your hood for ya
You don’t know me, I’ll kill everyone who should love ya
You have them motherfuckers lookin' all up in the woods for ya
Uh, fuck with me now - they can't fuck with me now
Uh, they can't fuck with me now - them can't fuck with me now
Come on!

[Verse 3]
It's too dark for ya's
I ain't got no love for ya's
Let gunshots smoked ya's
Who fuck with us?
Weed, liquor done corrupted us
Wet a nigga like umbrellas
Take the woman out a man; stomach out a man
Pump and bust, the guts comin' out a man
Runnin' out the Hummer with guns in each palm
If the motherfucker sleep, call him come get it
Niggas be kiddin' – me awake, DOA
Gun-spray - bullets damn near took off your son face
Oh, shit - niggas on that ho shit
Fours spit so quick like that lil' nigga ain't got no sense
Slow this shit down - let me get back down to reality:
I cause fatalities for any technicality
Wipe off your family randomly - U Understand?
It ain't a motherfuckin' game, and I ain't fuckin' playin'
Come on!

[Chorus]
It ain't a game, nigga - I don't know who told you it was
I put holes in your mug if you're holdin' a grudge
Try to take 'em when you get the gun and load
And the slug check ya low when I bust
Come to show you no love
Ah, fuck with me now - they can't fuck with me now
Uh, they can't fuck with me now - them can't fuck with me now
Stop playin' when ya get it understood
Cause I know if you know what's good for ya
Come around your hood for ya
You don’t know me, I’ll kill everyone who should love ya
You have them motherfuckers lookin' all up in the woods for ya
Ah, fuck with me now - they can't fuck with me now
Them can't fuck with me now - ah, they can't fuck with me now
Look-
It ain't a game, nigga - I don't know who told you it was
I put holes in your mug if you're holdin' a grudge
Try to take 'em when you get the gun and load
And the slug check ya low when I bust
Come to show you no love
Ah, fuck with me now - them can't fuck with me now
They can't fuck with me now - them can't fuck with me now
Stop playin' when ya get it understood
Cause I know if you know what's good for ya
Come around your hood for ya

You have them motherfuckers lookin' all up in the woods for ya
Ah, fuck with me now - they can't fuck with me now
Them can't fuck with me now - no, they can't fuck with me now

[Outro]
Can't fuck with me now - it's not a game, nigga
Can't fuck with me now - it's not a game, nigga
Wha, wha, uh, uh, nigga!
Wheezy Whee!!! (Whee! Whee! Whee!)
Watch out! (Watch out!)

[Verse 1: Turk]
Come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
I roll with a bunch of untamed guerrillas, head bustas, and sharks
Niggas that's 'bout beefin' - lettin' them K's spark
Knockin'-it-off-your-shoulder soldiers - them real niggas
Niggas who did time - hard-to-kill niggas
How you live, you get it is the way a nigga play it
Niggas ain't fightin' no more - niggas bustin' your head
Sendin' you to your grave - it's do or die, cousin
Aimin' straight for your head, makin' sure you die, cousin
They dressin' in black, prepared for combat
Ridin' four deep strapped with choppers and macks
Not givin' a fuck, gettin' your cut, lettin' it bust
You get hit, that's on you, my nigga - you're outta luck
You're stuck like chuck - wodie, you're assed out
That's what happen to ya tryin' to be hard, runnin' your mouth
Get erased, my nigga (my nigga)
Look here: I leave no trace, my nigga (my nigga)
No witnesses so can you see my face, my nigga (my nigga)
Fled the scene - so you have no case, my nigga- -case, my nigga
Look here: you can play if you wanna get down
Get your stupid ass left where you can't be found

[Chorus: B.G.]
We done hit you up, lit you up, twist you up (Ooohh!)
We done chopped you up, popped you up, boxed you up (Ooohh!)
We done hit you up, lit you up, twist you up (Ooohh!)
We done popped you up, chopped you up, boxed you up (Ooohh!)
We done hit you up, lit you up, twist you up (Ooohh!)
We done popped you up, chopped you up, boxed you up (Ooohh!)
We done hit you up, lit you up, twist you up (Whaa?)
We done chopped you up, popped you up, boxed you up

[Verse 2: Juvenile]
I was wrong for a lot of shit that I'mma take to my grave
Continuously whippin' niggas like a runaway slave
Must was meant for me to be thuggin' - I stay in some beef
Baby and Slim keep tellin' me, "Juvenile, stay off them streets."
I can't help - I draw attention; they be fuckin' with me
I'm hot in the ass and can't get enough of these streets
A lil' nigga in the Rolls screamin', "Fuck the police!"
Peelin' out in front the club, about to duck to the east
Now play yourself, you gon' find yourself by yourself
In a nice place ducked off with fucked up health
I done been strucked and snuck, but never fucked and stuck
My life is four hundred degrees, so I bust 'em up
Still stickin' to the g-code, Ree's, and B's
Quit drinkin', but I will smoke some weed indeed
All they understand is my project English
And if you don't like it, you can kiss my penis

[Chorus: B.G.]
We done hit you up, lit you up, twist you up (Ooohh!)
We done chopped you up, popped you up, boxed you up (Ooohh!)
We done hit you up, lit you up, twist you up (Ooohh!)
We done chopped you up, popped you up, boxed you up (Ooohh!)
We done hit you up, lit you up, twist you up (Ooohh!)
We done chopped you up, popped you up, boxed you up (Ooohh!)
We done hit you up, lit you up, twist you up (Ooohh!)
We done chopped you up, popped you up, boxed you up (Ooohh!)

[Verse 3: B.G.]
I run the streets cause I'm real if it's daylight or dark
You a killer, nigga? (Eah?) Ain't no fear in my heart
I'll go toe to toe with ya or take ya to war
I'll even go K for K with ya - now make your choice
Better know when I'm in beef that I be creepin', nigga
Better know that I'm a snake, and I'mma sneak ya, nigga
Each time I hit the corner, I be leavin' niggas
Momma upset - can't even go on and grievin', nigga
Nothin' change - I'm on TV, I don't play with you niggas
Still the same that'll spin broad day on you niggas
And empty a hundred out that K
Where you're caught hangin' is where you're left stankin', ya heard me
I've been in the game - niggas know what I'm 'bout
So many murders under my belt, I done lost count
If you wanna be another number, my nigga
Go ahead, drop your nuts, and run up, my nigga

[Chorus: B.G.]
We done hit you up, lit you up, twist you up (Ooohh!)
We done chopped you up, popped you up, boxed you up (Ooohh!)
Now, we done hit you up, lit you up, twist you up (Ooohh!)
Nigga, we done chopped you up, popped you up, boxed you up (Ooohh!)
Now, we done hit you up, lit you up, twist you up (Ooohh!)
And we done chopped you up, popped you up, boxed you up (Ooohh!)
Look, we done hit you up, lit you up, twist you up (Whaa?)
Look, we done chopped you up, popped you up, boxed you up (Ooohh!)

[Verse 4: Lil Wayne]
Hello, world
I zip through fast in a yellow pearl drop Porsche Boxter
Young mobster, wild and obnoxious
Pop some in your dreadlocks - What? Me not no rookie, boy
Glock cookin', boy
I'll turn your forehead to a pussy, boy
Off the gate, cousin, you niggas gon' make me stalk and spray somethin'
Spark or lace somethin'
Park the car, get out, walk, and spray somethin'
Taught to stay thuggin' brought up in this shit that we call America
And in my hood the laws are scared of us - we are too terrible
If I live to be old, it's a miracle
Cause the way a nigga hatin' or bitch plottin', the shit's hysterical
That's why I keep me two big guns on blast like a stereo
Come to your burial and kill anybody else who care for you
Don't blame me, society changed me
You haul white, you smash powder all night for the fast dollar
Cut off lights, we masked riders
The hood trash got us in a position we can't shake
With bars we can't break, and due to that you ain't safe, bitch

[Chorus: B.G.]
We done hit you up, lit you up, twist you up (Ooohh!)
Now, we done chopped you up, popped you up, boxed you up (Ooohh!)
Look, we done hit you up, lit you up, twist you up (Ooohh!)
Now, we done chopped you up, popped you up, boxed you up, nigga (Ooohh!)
(Did you see that?)
We hit you up, lit you up, twist you up (Ooohh!)
And we done chopped you up, popped you up, boxed you up (Ooohh!)
(Did you see that?)
We done hit you up, lit you up, twist you up (Ooohh!)
Now, we done chopped you up, popped you up, boxed you up (Ooohh!)
Boy, look
We done hit you up, lit you up, twist you up (Ooohh!)
Now, we done chopped you up, popped you up, boxed you up (Ooohh!)
Look, we done hit you up, lit you up, twist you up (Ooohh!)
Look, we done chopped you up, popped you up, boxed you up (Ooohh!)

[Outro: B.G.]
Nigga - we put holes in you bitch-ass niggas, ya heard me
We don't barrow nothin', don't fear nothin'
And ain't nothin' you can do 'bout these (Hot! Hot! Hot!) Boy$, nigga
Let 'em burn, nigga

[Verse 1]
I tell 'em no lie

I low-ride, cuz these 20 inch rims just make it so hot
You know I, been had Twinkie, look at the pinky
And the link be all the way down to the nuts, diamonds twinklin'
They think you need to stop they say it's not called for
It's such a small car, but cost more than a ballpark
See my life is high priced, a lot a room a lot a bling
My ice is like Andrew Dice "Ba-Da-Boom, Ba-Da-Bing"
You'll probably see me flying in a Lamborghini
Wit your girl right beside me in a tan bikini
Cut the music down and tell her, "hey ya man's a weenie"
Plus I'm hot and got more iceberg than damn Bananeeie
And I'm just a teenager and I make this dough
Pull out my bankcard and Bill Gates feel broke
And I keep it on a hush but I'm richer than normal
And a frost bit wrist, have me sniffin and coughin (*cough*)

[Chorus]

Pull over by some broad; make her hop right in a blow me
And suck a nigga drive, then its, "slut get out my ride"
Have you heard about, shorty be Iceberged out
Got them birds real affordable, so get the word out
And you still can see the grill wit the lights burn out
Nothin' lil' about the wheels on my bright orange drop
I'm thuggin and pimped out, flossin and glissed out
Sit my arm in warm water, I'm thawin my wrist out
Got quarters in this house, ki's in that van
Got ounces in her ride, and G's in that bag
Shhh, You hear that, here come Weezy on his way in a platinum leer jet
We gamblin' nigga bet, bet nigga disrespect and he get dampled and wet
Whole goddamn family get trampled wit that

Alright I bounce for the 17 and jump for the Grover

Slump the bitch over, cum on her shoulder
Bet I make the slut eat it up like yogurt
Wrists is ferocious, dick is just bogus
Fuck a ho watch she come back like a chorus
Like one named Deloris met her in a taurus
She like to snort coke, you should see the size her nose is
We really the ones controllin', no choices
And we got Guns and Roses, Rolls Royces
Beefin' ain't fake, not to mention
All our rides are dubbed like blank tapes
I really think my jewelry and lights have somethin' in common
Cuz everytime you put them bitches on they start shinin'
The shit is mind blowin'
As a matter of fact I got a bitch that's mind blowin'
She give my head a blow job, I guess she's mind blowin'

[Chorus]
Jump, jiggy, jiggy, jump, jiggy, jump, jump
Jiggy, jump, jiggy, jiggy, jump, jiggy, jump, jive
Jump, jiggy, jiggy, jump, jiggy, jump, jump
Jiggy, jump, jiggy, jiggy, jump, jiggy, jump, jive
Jump, jiggy, jiggy, jump, jiggy, jump, jump
Jiggy, jump, jiggy, jiggy, jump, jiggy, jump, jive

I popped up by her mamas so her nigga won't know nada
She took thirty minutes play me like a some kinda coward
Now hopped up in my car and started talkin bout her doctor
She said she started ridin it in her babys fathers Honda
She wish that he would trade it in and cop a brand new Mazda
I'm drivin to the label to the back and put the top up
I roll down all the windows put the car in function "watch the"
I tried to touch her thigh she moved my hand and said ah ah bro
It took five minutes to bang then you know she propper

And but you and baby too can still come over early Tuesday
I just bought a new mansion just finished it and my movie

And me I'm Iceberg Tom and Jerry, Daffy and Goofy
She say "oo" it would be so nice and usually she would do it
But lately she been spooked her boo just come from institution
I say that's cool cuz I don't really wanna have to shoot him
I gave the braud the pager number and said that she should use it
As soon as I flew by in that navy and baby blue six
She beeped and left a message that she come up with a solution
I scootin a run through straight to my house I won't be foolish
She had no bathin suit and then want me to see her booty
I oozed it in her coochie when she got in my Jacuzzi
She asked me for a kiss ah

[Chorus]

[Intro: Baby]
It's gravy nigga. Believe it
You hot? Fuck it. Hot as a firecracker
(It's gravy too.) I got a mac in this bag
(click clock) What you got? Glock. (Look)

[Verse 1: Baby]
Nigga I'ma tell ya straight off the bat
I got a mac in this bag with 20 grams of crack
And I'ma sit in the back seat of yo' 'Lac
Just in case I gotta snap, a firette to the chest
If I don't know shit, I know cars and broads
I done ordered plenty hits and watched heads come off
And I done saw my nigga get life behind them bars
To them dog hoes, nigga, we scream "fuck 'em all!"
I hustle hard in these city streets
I got my block on fire with my HB's
Spinnin' Benz in these drop tops double r
Cook a brick, flip 'em up, now I got 'em hard
And you can find me
Right up in them hallways, holdin' and totin'
Got the whole motherfuckin block loaded and smokin'
Nigga know one thang: its some uptown shit
If a nigga get it fucked, then we killin' a bitch

[Chorus: Baby & Lil Wayne]
Nigga I'ma tell ya this, straight off the bat
I got a mac in this bag, with 20 grams of crack
Well let's go nigga, see we can slide nigga
'Cause if you hot, then I'm hot, let's ride nigga
Look, I'ma tell you this, straight off the top
I got a blunt, and a Glock, and a bag of rocks
Let's go nigga, let's slide nigga
If you hot, then I'm hot, let's ride nigga

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Better pay attention now so you don't forget later
I run the damn block, I oversee all of the paper
Don't make me take ya, play ya
I cock the Glock and spray ya
Call it a caper, won't be no as-salamu alaykum
And J, he got the gauges, they cocked and ready
Make me run up in ya places and pop ya daddy
Got them bricks rocked and heavy, let it be known
I cook it hard and cut 'em in zones and the money be gone
Then I hit a blunt to the dome, and ride when night falls
Supply the white raw, if there's a problem, knock ya wife off
Lock the spot down
Respect it young nigga, I'm creepin' over
Now cut it with just a little bakin' soda, breakin' boulders
I take it out my holster and bakin' soldiers whenever
Nigga it's whatever, tell ya ma to call the reverend
You see me on the block with crack, gats, and weed
Rats, plats, and ki's, that's practically me

[Chorus: Baby & Lil Wayne]
Nigga I'ma tell ya this, straight off the bat
I got a mac in this bag, with 20 grams of crack
Well let's go nigga, see we can slide nigga
'Cause if you hot, then I'm hot, let's ride nigga
Look, I'ma tell you this, straight off the top
I got a blunt, and a Glock, and a bag of rocks
Let's go nigga, let's slide nigga
If you hot, then I'm hot, let's ride nigga

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
See I'm a hustler, cut-throat, put rhymes in mom's muffler
You can't even count how many times the 9's bust at ya
Some of the, niggas that you run with are, suckas bruh
None of ya, won't leave, without some bullets up in ya
Niggas can't hold me down, wodie wild
'Cause all that they can hear is loud screamin' and explosive sounds
They show me how to cook that brown and rock that white
No school, put that book back down, pick up that knife
See that's the real reason I hate to be on tour
I'd rather be back on the block with a bird of that pure
Niggas got it all wrong, thinkin' I'm all song
But yall gon' twist it and end up all gone
Dog-gone cocksuckers, you not thuggers
I pop dozens of Glocks, cousins, in my struggle
So stop frontin', it ain't gon' get ya everywhere
I'ma start bustin', and bullets hit ya everywhere

[Chorus: Baby & Lil Wayne]
Nigga I'ma tell ya this, straight off the bat
I got a mac in this bag, with 20 grams of crack
Well let's go nigga, see we can slide nigga
'Cause if you hot, then I'm hot, let's ride nigga
Look, I'ma tell you this, straight off the top
I got a blunt, and a Glock, and a bag of rocks
Let's go nigga, let's slide nigga
If you hot, then I'm hot, let's ride nigga

[Outro: Baby]

[Verse 1]
Dressed in all black and my gun the same color
Murder my enemy love thy brother
And I ain't never gave a shit about a motherfucker
Hit him up and watch the guts come up out a youngin stomach
You niggas better take side with young money, Cash Money
You'll get left in your ride crash dummy
I'll be around when the times get ugly
When the wheels fall off and the tires stop running
The magazine empty and the nine stop busting
I bang my fist till my palms get bloody
Cuz I'm a monster man
I'm gonna find you and my AP nine don't jam
I'm a rider you can't take it out of me man

I'ma die with this blazer right in these hands

[Chorus]

Tucked in my thirty-eight, mack on my back I am
So ready for whatever that awaits me
Run up in your place while you're sleepin, awake thee
Calicoes, ak's, Uzi-machines
Got ya misplacin your arms and losin your knees
I am takin names, so who wanna leave
Out this bitch with your brains and your dew on your sleeve?
I got the hood with the names of the crew on they t's
And I might make a funeral sweep, I ain't bullshitin
AR hit ya truck got ya hood flippin
Feet by the engine, head by the transmission
And I be right where I am mister
Me and my damn pistol

In this world alone, so bring it on
And imma have to sing you this song nigga

[Chorus]
I shoot your arm, leg, leg, arm, head
The heater burner bruisa is on my hip this year

[Verse 3]
I got the scope on the tool I can see what you do
With a little red dot nigga peek-a-boo
Shhh the silence will speak to you
Hit you from across the street wile you tying ya shoe
Like bang, bang, say breathe nigga breath I stand over the body with the boy in his tee
Say bang, bang, say breathe deep breath I stand over the body with the boy in his chest, clear
Now the boy is a mess and the block in fear cause ya boy up and left
Life is short enjoy what ever is left
Before you run into a nigga like me and meet death
In less than three seconds I'll pull a three-eighty
Three feet from my waist
Three inches from your face
Make no mistake Weezy never hesitate
I'll pop till your shit separate like ew!

[Chorus]
I shoot your arm, leg, leg, arm, head
The heater burner bruisa is on my hip this year
I shoot your arm, leg, leg, arm, head

[Bridge]
Up, down, front, back, side to side
You hit that nigga like that, he gotta die
Hit him up, down, front, back, side to side
You hit that nigga like that, he gotta die
Say up, down, front, back, side to side
You hit that nigga like that, he gotta die
Say up, down, front, back, side to side
Hit that nigga like that, he gotta die woah

[Outro]
Weezy F Baby, yeah, yeah, yeah, this is The Carter for you
One

[Intro]
Yeah yeah yeah
It's the Carter motherfucker, I came back around
It's the Carter motherfucker, I came back around
It's the Carter motherfucker
Let me show you my building man, it's the Carter
I'ma show y'all the ins the outs, the ups the down, know what I'm talking 'bout
This is me, fourth solo album baby, I came back around
By myself this time, back off the wall
Guns up in the air in the middle of the street like bang, bang, bang bang, welcome

[Verse]
Welcome, this is the Carter y'all welcome
Hard as Malcolm, dark as The Falcon, Lord help him
But y'all felt him, and that make you a part of me and pardon me
If a part of me is what you wanna be what you oughta be
Doing, recording me, I'm just acting accordingly, I give orders
To the commander in chief, just the commander in me
Handling streets in the Mandarin V
I hear you haters slandering me, I just hand 'em to P
Any drama, I pace it like Indiana
I take your grandma pacemaker and just hand her the piece
Not two fingers I simultaneously pop two bangers
You do not want angus, USDA prime beef, you're dead meat
I'm so ahead of these trendy rappers speed up
I'm already hot when another one starting to heat up
Got Mannie hot with me 'cause I always beat his beat up
Y'all cats wit y'all feet up starting to look like V'd up
I'm G'd up on the re-up, in the truck I gotta put my seat up
In the trunk I got my base and I ain't speakin about no speakers
What's leaking up out of your speakers is the speech of Weezy F. Baby
No more no less Baby, so forth and so on, (let's go)
Front door, living room young nigga switching weed
What you need? Get you crack, get you weed
Make your way to the back, look ahead and see
White bitch in the bathroom giving head for speed
But don't you turn your head at me, the president been doin it
Then he tried to ruin it, but I built this building from the ruts
I own all the corners and the cuts in this motherfucker
And the feds know just what's in this motherfucker
Made niggas so they can't bust in this motherfucker
So with that, let's keep it movin'
Onto the kitchen where my witches keep it brewin'
Uh huh, look at how my bitches do it
Bucky buck naked, look at all my bitches booties
They handle all my pharmaceutics
I got it from Promethazine to Metamucil
I'm crucial, don't mean to spook you
But, this is New Orleans, so my queens do voodoo, ya know?
So the things just move through
I feel your pain, I got things to soothe you
There's fields of 'caine, so Wayne and neutral
Don't hate the game hate the institution
There's fields of 'caine, so Wayne and neutral
Don't hate the game hate the institution, fucker

[Outro]
I came back around, it's the Carter
Show you the rest of the house later
We gonna go upstairs, ya know
You know what this is right
The Carter, the Carter, the Carter

[Intro: Birdman]
Ay Wayne
I know this bullshit that I'm hearing ain't true, right?
Ya feel me?
These niggas out here picking bullshit over money nigga
But you know what fuck a nigga
We gone keep grinding this shoe box is full

[Chorus: Birdman]
The only way we get it only way we know to get it
Off the block, off the clip, off the 'caine nigga
The only way we live it only way we know to live it
On the grind tote a nine do yo thang nigga
The only way we get it only way we know to get it
Off the block, off the clip, off the 'caine nigga
The way we live it is the only way we know to live it
On the grind tote a nine do yo thang nigga

[Verse 1]
Well I'm a 17 nigga got that Hollygrove in me
It ain't coming to me so I gotta go get it
You ain't fucking with me I got the hottest flow nigga
There ain't nothing to see because I'm not in yo vision
On and I'm gone get fed up one day
Put lead up in the K
Come and hit up where ya stay so
Baby momma betta get up out the way
Cause the bullet got no heart
And the trigger man crazy
Little man if a bigger man jumps through
Then I'm in the hood with the pump in the truck looking
But if you ain't in them cuts or on them benches
I'm a park the fucking truck and knock yo door off the hinges
Yes Weezy Baby flow off the hinges
So off the temple, no pad or pencil
Well let me go back to what men do
Throwback Benz coupe on throwback 22s, bitch

[Chorus: Birdman]
The only way we get it only way we know to get it
Off the block, off the clip, off the 'caine nigga
The only way we live it only way we know to live it
On the grind tote a nine do yo thang nigga
The only way we get it only way we know to get it
Off the block, off the clip, off the 'caine nigga
The way we live it is the only way we know to live it
On the grind tote a nine do yo thang nigga

[Verse 2]
Weezy F. Baby hand cocked
Demand my cheese

Please, what you crazy?
Man I'm a get it like the man on the chorus
Got my hand on a fortune
Bang at ya porches, Bang at ya window
Kidnap ya neighbor, torture ya kinfolks
And tell the cops I murder the infoer
Leave him on the precinct steps in a pillow
Niggas wanna keep they breath then tell 'em get low
I got ten left in the tech so what they here fo'?
Nigga you ain't scaring nothin Weezy been a tiger in the jungle since a cub
With my paws in the mud, yeah me and my paw in the mud
Interior Maybach like what, Bitch nigga!

And he ain't got to, his son'll shoot ya, bloaw!

[Chorus: Birdman]
The only way we get it only way we know to get it
Off the block, off the clip, off the 'caine nigga
The only way we live it only way we know to live it
On the grind tote a nine do yo thang nigga
The only way we get it only way we know to get it
Off the block, off the clip, off the 'caine nigga
The way we live it is the only way we know to live it
On the grind tote a nine do yo thang nigga

[Verse 3]
Homeboy you gotta know that avenue
To get off a bag or two or you just passin through
True true, and we just passed the truth
Passin through the streets of the murder capital
Where you think ya own brothers after you
So you ain't got no other brother after you
Don't let the boys in blue capture you
'Cause they vigilante attitudes
It's all fucked up
Bossman Weezy get y'all touched up
Gat blacked ya face like ya run into a wall or something
Its cash money all or nothing
Its Lil Wayne the reverend call it Sunday
The congregation know I come with nothing
But leave with everything, I ain't come for nothing
And the choir know I come with money
And y'all know I'm Stunnas youngin like dat bitch

[Chorus: Birdman]
The only way we get it only way we know to get it
Off the block, off the clip, off the 'caine nigga
The only way we live it only way we know to live it
On the grind tote a nine do yo thang nigga
The only way we get it only way we know to get it
Off the block, off the clip, off the 'caine nigga
The way we live it is the only way we know to live it
On the grind tote a nine do yo thang nigga

I move it from a eighth to a slab, from a slab to a quarter
From a quarter to a half, from a half to a hard one

[Verse 2]
Hustle boy sell a nick to ya mom I'll sell a brick out ya house

Front of the gun to ya clothes I let it rip and I bounce
Lights off young Teddy Pender is out

Tomb sittin in ya room sing for me

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
We don't give a fizzuck my nigga we young and bizzuck

[Intro]
Yeah

Yeah
Lighters up
Know you miss somebody (Got to)
Put your (Yeah), let's go (Get 'em)

[Chorus: Nikki Jean & Lil Wayne]
Though, though I'm missing you (Straight to your head, man)
I'll find a way to get through (Nik', talk, yeah)
I know livin' without ya is impossible (Yeah, that's right)
And I, I know you gon' live on (Cry, mama, yeah, cry, mama)
'Cause you were my brother (My sister)
And I love ya, and I miss ya, oh-oh

[Verse 1]
Stay strong, be tough, that's what the preacher tell ya
He never really felt ya, so he can't even help ya
Need a shoulder to lean on, somebody to cry to
It's like everything's gone, but I'm a survivor
Standin' on stage in front of thousands (Yeah)
Don't amount to me not havin' my father
That's real talk, I know a lot of y'all got 'em
But you need 'em way more when you gotta go without 'em
And I'm without 'em, but that's life, y'all
Sometimes you gotta learn to swim with no lifeguard (Yup)
I'm alright, God, shit, I'm still breathin'
But loss hurt like bullets, I'm 'bout to start bleedin'
Throw me down some comfort 'cause my heart need it (Yeah)
Tryna cope but my chances are needle
There's a dark road ahead, but I'm tryin' to take it easy
Rest in peace Lil Beezy, my nigga

[Chorus: Nikki Jean & Lil Wayne]
Though, though I'm missing you (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
(I miss my dawg, I can't believe that it's over)
I'll find a way to get through (But I'm a soldier, so I gotta get over)
I know livin' without ya is impossible (Can't stay sober, I'm just tryna get over)
And I, I know you gon' live on (Real rap for you)
(Man, I miss my dawg, I can't believe that it's over)
'Cause you were my brother (My sister, but I'm a soldier, so I gotta get over)
And I love ya, and I miss ya, oh-oh (Can't stay sober, I'm just tryna get over)

[Verse 2]
And now we smoke kush all day and pop painkillers (Yeah)
Fuck who don't understand it, this what the game did us
This what the streets showed us, this how the block made us
The same block where they layed 'em (Damn)
I pray every time I cross the spot on the pavement, save me
Lord, will I be next for the taking? Take me
I know I'm livin' like I know when I'm comin'
But I'm just livin' 'cause I know that it's comin'
And the end is comin', but I ain't runnin', I ain't hidin' and duckin'
I'm in the middle of a war, I'm alive and love it
I'm just speakin' from the heart of the dyin' public
We still beatin', we gon' rise above it
Though it seem like they cheatin' and we losin'
We survive, if nothin'
They could never take the stride from struggling
I gotta ride, and sometimes that ride get bloody
But I just think about my buddy and go after that money
But, uh

[Bridge: Nikki Jean & Lil Wayne]
Oh (Yeah), we gotta get over (Yeah)
We gotta get over, we gotta get over (Yeah)
It's almost over (I said, I said I gotta get over)
And we gon' be alright (I gotta get over)
('Cause, bitch, I'm a soldier)

[Verse 3]
Straight Patrón out the bottle to the head now (Bitch)
We gettin' red now, bitch, my nigga dead now (Bitch)
And all the things I never said, I gotta say it now (Damn)
I shoulda said it then, now I gotta talk to clouds (Damn)
Now I gotta walk around, brim down
Just tryin' to find my way 'til the next day, escape
Your birthday could be your death date
So I'm livin' like it was just yesterday, let's pray
Ten fingers together, can't bring 'em together
It's murda-murda, I don't think it get better
So be a competitor or get out the weather
Me? I got an umbrella and a Beretta (Rah)
I'm just tryin' to make sure my daughter future progressin'
And behind that, I'm shootin' excessive (Bang), trust me (Yeah)
The beautiful dead, we living with the ugly
I just tell my pops, "Wait for me, I'm comin'"

[Chorus: Nikki Jean & Lil Wayne]
Though, though I'm missing you (Yeah, yeah)
(Man, I miss my dawg, I can't believe that it's over)
I'll find a way to get through (But I'm a soldier, so I gotta get over)
I know livin' without ya is impossible (Can't stay sober, I'm just tryna get over)
And I, I know you gon' live on (They ask me what's wrong)
(Man, I miss my dawg, I can't believe that it's over)
'Cause you were my brother (My sister, but I'm a soldier, so I gotta get over)
And I love ya, and I miss ya, oh-oh (Can't stay sober, I'm just tryna get over)

[Outro]
They ask me why I wear shades at nighttime
(Man, I miss my dawg, I can't believe that it's over)
'Cause I don't wanna see nothin' (But I'm a soldier, so I gotta get over)
Yeah (Can't stay sober, I'm just tryna get over)
Like I said (Man)
Life ain't nothin' but a long extended road, keep drivin'
(But I'm a soldier, so I gotta get over)
I done passed up plenty people on the side of road, no help
Keep goin', yeah (I'm just tryna get over)
Lost a lot of passengers on the ride, kept goin', yep
(But I'm a soldier, so I gotta get—)
Who knows when I'll run outta gas? Yeah (Over)

[Lil Wayne]
Catch me I'm stumbling but no I'm never slipping
I come up out that water with nothing dripping, who fucking with him
I'm the guy they call the Carter the slaughter house
I go hard don't try cause I ride like the Marlins
Come buy I supply you with quarters
And bricks if your money that thick
I ain't running I'm running this bitch, sun on my wrist
I rock that, That rose ? parkay with the crock strap (Damn)
I stroll every single day with the Glock strap (Blam)
I'm spittin like Pac back (Wham)
I got that Bentley GT same color as rock crack
Interior stock black, but don't get popped at
I watched half my neighborhood get kept back
The other half sleeping where its best at
Minor set backs, this is grown man talk minor get back
I just had to stress that, talk to 'em B

[Hook: Baby]
You better know about the game of life
Cause When you hustle you can shine for life
You better know it could happen tonight
When your hood rich living the life
You got the money that could change the frame
And have a bitch just loving your game
You Got a Benz and a brand new Range
With 26's all over them thangs

[Lil Wayne]
Hey, I made a few adjustments, but for better justice
I get that cheddar fuck em.. maybe motherfuck 'em
I'm handing nothing to 'em but a plate of murder
It ain't beef if you can't make a burger... Nigga
I'm on the streets you on the curb
Ain't no talking to police cause we don't speak the same word
Who that, Tryna take the Carter for a new jack
I'll pistol whip you on your block 'til your blue black
(laugh)... Till your blue black (listen)
Alot of niggas like to touch other cities
But my city like to touch other niggas (yea)
You come down for the Essence and the Mardi Gras
But I got here thats where your partys are
Dont shine too hard, watch behind you god
That chain looking like a sign that say "follow me home"
I'm a desperado from the Hollygrove side
Where alot of folks ride, and a lot of folks died

[Hook]

[Lil Wayne]
I'm on the corner with my work in the mailbox
One foot out the grave one foot in the jailhouse
I done put my foot in the flow
To fast feet my cash, get my feet out your ass (yea)
I told momma im gone; I'll be back with money
I came back with the throne; she very proud of me
I tell her pray for me; cause everyday for me
Is a struggle to make of it
They got my nigga Big Blake in the state oven
But he gonna eat a nigga plate when he escape from it
Please label me real cause I ain't make it here faking
Neither was it vacant; take a nigga bacon (shit)
Break bread or we break heads
Put the pump to your stomach turn your face red
Pump a nigga dome now he a bass head
Hit him one more time like stay dead

[Chorus}

[Spoken: Lil Wayne]
OK, OK, OK. Mhm, mm, mhm. That's what I'm talking 'bout, man. I killed that shit, man. Man, that right there—it's easy, man. You know what I mean? Give me something else, man, Drama. I'm on fire, man, rock. Watch this, man!

[Intro: Lil Wayne, DJ Drama, & DJ drops]
Let's do this for Hollygrove!
Yeah
Can't forget Magnolia Projects!
Young
Shout to the N.O.! (Dramatic, nigga!)
Young
DJ Drama! Weezy F. Baby!
Dedication 2, let's go! (Dramatic)

[Verse: Lil Wayne & DJ drops]
Weezy, motherfucker, what it do? Holla at me
All the niggas tryna hate me, and them bitches tryna have me, I'm a—
Money man, yep, I get it from my daddy, ho
And boy, we can beef like Magnolia and Calliope
Hollygrove my barrio, let that automatic go
Test me when I'm chilling, and I kill you from my patio
Bitch, my shadow look good, I'm just feeling Weezy
Hop in my shit and say goodbye 'cause the ceiling's leaving (Gangsta!)
Believe me, they ain't tryna see me
Tell 'em I be the nigga with the burner in the beanie, I'm—
The fireman, she just call me when she steamin
I wet her up and put her out and leave the bitch dreaming
Niggas say they hot, but it's really not seeming
If these guys bad, then I gotta be a demon
Wayne's getting money like Damon and Keenan
Try, take it from me, and I'm aiming and beaming
Banging and leaving stains on the cement
Slide the crackers something so they tame the policemen
Left in a Porsche, came in a carnation
I'm fresh, yeah, the Gucci sweats came with the creases
I'm hot, but I'm cold, I just change with the seasons
Tryna put some cheese on my pieces
If you looking for your nigga, I be where the water gets deeper
Hugging on that money, tryna put it in a sleeper
Yeah, I'm here—who the fuck wanna say something?
Leave your whole head empty like a straight pumpkin
Make no assumptions, I'm hustling
Your girlfriend guzzling when you thought she wasn't
Name still buzzing even when I'm doing nothing
But I'm never doing nothing, 'cause I'm always getting money
It's that simple, jackass, if you don't get it, you're a dummy
And them niggas that diss me ain't nothing but pure pussy
Sure, honey, I done heard what you said
But if a nigga really cared, you'd already be dead
Just a young-ass nigga with some old-ass bread
Yes, I keep them dollars running like them bitches got legs
And my nigga Tez Po been riding with me since pegs
And my right wrist is looking like a cracked-open egg, that's—
White and yellow diamonds, adjust your lighting
I got 'em so mad, but, "Oh, I think they like me" (Gangsta Gri-Zillz!)

[Intro: DJ Drama & Lil Wayne]
I'ma tell y'all like this (Yeah)
I learn something new every day (What it do?)
More money, more problems!
Haha! Ayy, you already know
I always knew I was gon' make it
Yeah, listen, man
But you never know what you gon' go through
Yeah, my nigga, we got this shit
I'm glad to be here! But sometimes, you wonder
Yeah, ayy-ayy, I tried told 'em
Is it worth it? But I done dedicated my life to this shit!
Cash Money millionaire!
It's nowhere to turn! (Ya know!)
So I'm in it for life!
I can't feel my FACE! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah, yeah!
And this what we do!
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! Hahaha! I told em!
I told y'all! (Shout out to Bun B!)
Pay attention! (Yeah!)

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Yeah, straight up D-boy, 17th Ward
Miss Katrina turned my city to a seashore
I keep going for them coins like Lyor
They gon' either respect me or: E.R.
Burnin' them bitches like a ci-gar
Punk, put a hump in your back, they called it "Igor"
War? This shit is hard, any yard where we are
We call that cocaine "rice"—I got that Condoleezza
Huh? You fuck with me, chump, I rock your teacup
I say, before you spend a dollar boy, put up the re-up
Yep! Get up, 'cause we up, foot up and knee up
In the game, put up or shut up, I hit your head up
Bukka-bang; the Birdgang and the Birdman J—
Lil Wayne, here to hang—other words, here to stay
Feel my pain! Fireman, I spark in the rain
I walk through the flames, yeah, all for the change, yeah
Call it insane, but I'm a hustler to the muscle
And them new drop Bentleys look like pussy in the summer
So I'm fucking that, hugging that block like I'm loving that
Never sell a crumb where my mother at—run with that
You can come at me for beef, and shots come with that
Your bitch come at me for wood and I'm the lumberjack
I come in that Similac Maybach, shades black
Looking like I'm tryna bring yay' back, ASAP
Give it to 'em raw, no Ajax—taste that
Heh, fuck around and make your face crack
I know niggas that shoot dope, arms looking like a racetrack
Nigga missed a vein in his neck, his whole face fat
You can't take that? Well, I can't take back
Where I come from, so I learned how to make that
Yeah, turn that straight to a G stack
Stack up my cheese, now I'm screaming, "Where the keys at?"

[Interlude: DJ Drama & Juelz Santana, & DJ tags]
Big shout to the Dipset movement! (Trendsetter!)
Shout my nigga DukeDaGod! (Cannon!)
Shout my nigga Hell Rell!
I can't feel my face!
Twin, what up?
I really don't think they ready for this
(The Aphilliates, nigga! Pay attention!)
OH!

[Verse 2: Juelz Santana]
I'm live from, block one, five-one
Where my young niggas on the rise to get a name, don't try them
Wayne, I feel your pain and I see your stress
How they think your people 'posed to get through Katrina
Off a FEMA check? (Nope!)
Coke in the Pyrex (Yup!); dope and the ice, yes (Yup!)
Mind on the highway, road signs, right, left (Yup!)
And that's the mindstate of kids growin' up
Still they wonder why the crime rate's goin up
Throw it up: Eastside, Westside, Southside, Northside
Fuck with my money, I torch guys, off guys (Gangsta!)
Hire men, fire men, send 'em to a higher man
("There he go") Torture 'em: vice-grip, pliers, man
Niggas turn to tinfoil when they see the iron, man
Pressure bust pipes, I apply it and
Move like a lion through the jungle, yes
There is none higher than me
Don't slip up and end wind up in the lion's den (rrr!)
Big body Benz idlin', higher than
A chick that flight-attend or Air Force flyer, man
Bad bitches, I fly 'em in, fuck 'em
Send 'em back home hyped, feeling like they on nitrogen
Just call me the Pied Piper, man
Still get the coke through the pipeline
Then off to the piper stem (Piper stem)
And I'm still getting paper back in rubber bands
I still got paper bags coming in
I still got that mattress with the paper bags under it
Comic books, Playboy baby mag under it, still!
I still got ties with my guys who don't speak no English
Them vatos, they got those cheapest (Cheapest)
Got no green card, got no visas
And got those Pablo features (Just watch!)
They drop off and pick up; I pick up then drop off
Then drop off what's picked up, and then what? I do it
Gangsta Gri-zillz!

[Outro: DJ Drama]
And like that, we gone!
I told y'all!
I'm so dedicated!
Nothing can take me out my zone!

Yes
Gotta get 'em
Fee!

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Straight-up gangsta, Hollygrove gangsta
Lay a nigga down in pink stuff
Them soft-ass dudes just think tough
We shooting—put them shanks up
We tryna live to summer and put them minks up
I'm synced up in the coupe, the eyes Chinked up
Pull up on a bitch at the light—that night, linked up
Whole lotta shit in the life of a young boss
Bet that VVS ice will bite your face off
Yeah, I ignite and take off—now, catch up
I'm the best doing it—c'mon, niggas, 'fess up
Nigga feel different, he could chess up, and guess what?
I bring it to his chest—to his right lung and left lung
Nigga get a checkup, nigga, put your check up
I swear, I'm on fire, need water like a hiccup
So I guess I might as well could say that
I'm the best today, and...

[Break: Sample]
Forever
Forever

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Yeah, candy paint! T, I'm riding in a peppermint
Even my leather got leather trim
I'm on another element
I keep somethin' in the trunk like a elephant
Bet you remember it, like a elephant
I got this rap bottled up like medicine
Who's better than...? Fuck him!
I probably fucked her—ehh, what's new?
And if you hatin' on us, yeah, fuck you
And if them bitches wanna fuck us, we wan' fuck too
What a coincidence
And we cause accidents, not incidents
I am big shit, they're eensy-wens'
They're not even a letter in my sentences
Sitting in my coupe on 20-inch
So it's like I'm fencing, bitch, I will stunt...
Forever
So stop being defensive, bitch
I'm relentless, bitch, I'm in this shit...
Forever
Now end this shit

I'm a New Orleans gangsta, after the storm

My pockets on Raven-Symone
That's fat—what you know 'bout that? Huh?
See, I'ma keep it goin', keep it movin'—we can do it, I ain't trippin'
So far ahead of them niggas, we got a time difference
Don't confuse me with them: I'm different
Tryna holler at Tip for a movie audition, shit!
I push that Maserati to the limit (*Vroom*)
Zig-zaggin' through that traffic like Emmitt
I tell them niggas, "Hurry and buy!"
And if you dry-snitch, you get buried alive
Yeah, and I don't chase 'em like you do
I keep a bad bitch skatin' like New-New (Gangsta—)

In the middle of tha night, I be fatigued, camouflagin' by
Byy-bahda-by-by-by
Huh? Nigga, what? Takin' me for a joke, and watch me hurt cha
Boys there, they be commercial... I beat 'em 'til they purple

Apple N' Eagle, my nigga, so ain't no play in me
Yeah, I may be... a lil' small and all that
But I'm 'bout war, totin' a gat, flippin' a car and all that
Now freeze! Me and my g's hitch your hood like fleas
Soldier rag, black 'Bauds, white T's, and Ree's
Please, tell me that you was fulla weed

Cause I don't think nonna ya'll famileez wan' see ya'll bleed
I know what tha hell it be
Ya'll niggas don't listen up when we speak

Lettin' 223's chop trees

So he... who take tha biggest bite, lose all-a his teeth
Hook up wit Juve, Turk, and B.G
Open niggas like ki's

Look, dog... you can be stupid if ya want, watch, it be war
Or all you drive tha car, I hit tha block and.. cut 'em off
Whole nation gon' fall... when Wayne spins tha cut
Guns up, nigga, what!... I clutch and bust
Niggas duck and hide... when.. I.. ride
I load tha forty-five, and explode on your side
My niggas, Mike and Mario, they got them 2's for me
And I spin a nigga ben until he use ta me
I'm on a 3000-dollar duck.. on your block, just waitin'
Nonna dem niggas could take me, I was too in-tox-i-cat-ed
But, nigga, if you want war with me, busta be 'bout your issue
Hit your set with.. my nigga with them things ta split cha
Picture a lil' nigga dressed in black... with a big ole gun

Don't hate on me boy if you do, pow, get down
Come from under my shirt try to lift you off the ground
But on the other hand, I'ma key runner man
I got about a hundred coming up with three Hummers man
We stuntas man
I might stumble across a grand and give it to your wifey
And watch how she, *slurp*, on my pipey like a Icee
I might be in a Range that night

I got a hundred on Kobe, hope he playing it right
But if I lose, its cool, that's some change lil shite
That ain't nothing
I ain't doing nothing if I, I ain't stunting
Hold up, girl be quiet, Lil Wayne coming

At the bar dranking
But go head, just be quiet with 'em lil one

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Broads I use 'em, hatas I bluse 'em
My whole front grill is full of confusion
Got dammit
Weezy pull up in a Porsche, expanded (Expanded)
The top was to the back, niggas couldn't stand it
Soon as I left the scene, the women vanished
I got it like that
Got Rolex, blue shit, hard to say watches
Plus I bought all of my niggas Cartier watches
Weezy and his clique leave with forty b-e-atches
"Million Dollar Man" baby Ted DiBiase
Catch me sippin on some Hen, maybe Covoursier

You might see me dippin' low in a Benz truck
Tell yo girl hello

Took one to tha chest, I never die, I'm tha same brotha
Jump out and shoot K's, let 'em fly, I'm tha same brotha
It's a must they recognize that I'm untamed, brotha
Disconnect a boy like a damn change number

Spark it up, and make a nigga block fry again
Go ta jail, and do life, not five ta ten
Me, Lil' Mario, and Toolie, that's my man, fam
My niggas don't give a Jean-Claude Van Damme
About'chu, cause we don't play around
Bring tha K around, spray tha town, take tha ground
Take tha ground that you walk on
Tap tha phones that you talk on

Call me the number one Hot Boy on fire
Fire, when you shoot outta town, then I'mma holler
With a crate of Crystile, couple of blunts, and a condom
Let him know if (let him know if) he down bad, that ain't my problem
Let him know if he come at me bad, then I'mma chop him
Ch-uh.. chop him
Put tha flame to him
All of a sudden tha thing hits straight through him
Cause I'm tha same nigga, pimper boy, Lil' Wayne
Thugged out, pants fall to my shoe strings

Get it clear like a mirror, that's why ya girlfriend stare
Just been elected the president's here
Cheers, cheers, tangerine tequila, no beers
Ye, I like this here
Wit Ciara on the track it's music to my ears
That's when I go to the store and I ask for a Philly
If they don't have a Philly, I ask for a Swisha
If they don't have a swisha, I ask for..
That's when I ask for, that's when I ask for a Dutchey!
I ask for a Dutchey, they gotta have a Dutchey
I don't smoke backwoods I just smoke Dutcheys
And mama over there say she gon' fuck me
But, but naw she can't touch me
Cuz my girl is lookin' way good

[Intro]
Mouse drop the track
That'll make you bounce it back, what
Yeah
Hehe
Tell 'em, yeah, bah!

[Verse 1]
Weezy bad—naw, really, I'm good
Sound like a T-Rex live under my hood
Gotta know the Tec live under my seat
Put you in the ground; now, you live under my feet
All-white diamonds on the front of my teeth
And you better put the "O" in front of my "G"
The bullshit they talking doesn't come to my knee
I'm like a linebacker: Don't run it by me
My two best friends will accompany me
And right now, they are in my dungarees, sleep
One named "Mac," one named "Nina"
They hit you, make you do the Macarena
Where your tool? You gon' need it like a muh'fucker
And I am so New Orleans like a muh'fucker
It's Young Money and we eating, get your own supper
Make me go off in the trunk, get that Bone Crusher, haha!

[Hook]
Tecs, AKs, I leave the scene ugly
Chest, head, face, arm, leg, stomach
I never been afraid, I ain't scared of nothing
'Cause I got my thang, my thang, my thang
And that bitch go boom, boom, boom
Boom, boom, boom
You hear them guns, like boom, boom, boom
Boom, boom, boom

[Verse 2]
They like the way I ball, they call me "Hot Sauce"
They know I keep that toaster; you can be my Pop Tart
I never had height, but, boy, I got heart
And I ain't gotta speak, I just let my car talk
I got more clips than any movie you saw
I pull up on you like I need some Grey Poupon
Hardhat? No, but I got the tool on
And you should be my paper if ever the tool's drawn, yeah
Flow retarded: When I spit, I get my drool on
I don't rap, I just shit, like a newborn
I don't write, I just spit, like a tooth gone
So tell them haters, "Cut it out" like a coupon
How come that chopper sound like a nuke bomb?
Little nigga, gotta hold that bitch with two arms
I got that heat, the fire, and the lukewarm
I'm on your heels like a shoehorn

[Hook]
Tecs, AKs, I leave the scene ugly
Chest, head, face, arm, leg, stomach
I never been afraid, I ain't scared of nothing
'Cause I got my thang, my thang, my thang
And that bitch go boom, boom, boom
Boom, boom, boom
You hear them guns, like boom, boom, boom
Boom, boom, boom
I remember then, back in December, it was winter like '89
Shit I must have been 7 goin' on 8
And comin' from da kitchen was an echo from all the bass
And I ain't talkin bout speakers
I saw my daddy in there I would stare, but I wouldn't touch
But it wasn't because I didn't know enough
Shit, I just knew too much
So I stop bein' lazy, and I became creative
And I learned how to create it
And all that pot's for me
So come see, or come eat

And I hope that she is having da ride of her life
No red lights in sight
Just a bare room with green lights
Come on now
Who did you, where did you, why did you what did you think she was
That's your ho
But does her water help your garden grow... no

Yeah I know that was crazy
But I think you are more crazier than her
Cuz she is no daisy
Shit she jus pottery
With no seeds
So she can't eat
My heroes had the broads and the cars with big ol' rims
And I could remember slangin', thinkin'
I wanna be like them
Ever since I was little, ever since I was little
I lived life numb

It made so much sense for me to run
When da 5-0 come
Cause I ain't dumb

And that shit I hated
Like early 90's late 80's
I was hustlin' as a baby
You can ask Eagle Street, about me
I'm a G

Ever since I was little, ever since I was little I tote my gun
Cause it made no sense where I was from
To walk around wit none
Shit, nigga you would be crazy
Cause niggas is crazy
And I'm a 80's baby
You should be proud of me
Cause in them streets
I'm hot like da 80's
And my temperature's raisin'
I'm at 100 I'm blazin'
Somebody shower me
Please, pretty please
You can call me wizzle, or you can call me Wayne, man either one
But it's Weezy Baby for your slut
I told her Weezy Baby, I told her more than once
But she just say, "Baby", she just calls me "Baby"
She just screams out "Baby!" when she's on top of me
And the sheets be stickin' like pages
And the bed is so stanky
If she say that is my baby, shit it is possibly not for me
M.-O.-E

[Intro: Lil Wayne & Juelz Santana]

Guess what?We already did
Already

[Verse 1: Juelz Santana]
I'm feeling like a Black Republican, naw, I can't call it
More like a Black Democrat runnin' 'em out of office (Get out)
Young Barack-a Obama, I'm all for it
The Rock of Gibraltar has now fallen on you
I protect my land like a farmer
Pockets stay chubby like Toccara (Yup), huh
Or should I say fat like the Parkers
Tote big guns like I'm still playing Contra (Ha)
Y'all washed up like money that's laundered (Yeah)
Y'all funny, I'm bonkers
Honest, girls strapped to my dick like a harness
Rock star, I'm flyer than an ostrich (Ha)
And I cover east, west, north, south like a compass
I shall shine forever, never tarnish (Never)
Money buried behind my house like a garden (What?)
All green, my bank account's like a forest
I Can't Feel My Face is gettin' started (Yeah)
And Weezy is my accomplice (Ya dig?)
A black activist like Sonny Carson
Stripes of a sergeant, salute me
And chicks, I get 'em high, higher than turbulences
White Phantom, lookin' so Fergalicious (Haha)
I'm from the city of big drugs and murder victims
It's get rich, go to jail, or be a murder victim
Ayy! Now all y'all listen
If you can't take the heat, get out the kitchen

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
I feel like a Black Republican, tote the MAC in the public
AndAct so southern n' die for my brethren
Money, money-money, like Money Mackin' Publishing
One life to live, never ask for a mulligan
Streets cold but the heat make me feel covenant
Been had cake, you late like Ed Sullivan
Fly like an eagle, but no, I'm not Donovan
Boy, you better go eat some soup with your mama 'nem
And my mind is on another continent
I am real Cash Money, no counterfeit
I don't parking-lot pimp, I just politick
But I get all in her mouth like Polident
New Orleans representer to the inner
Come from the city where the glitter don't glimmer
The sun don't shine, and the guns don't sleep
Wake a nigga ass up like he got somewhere to be

[Outro: Lil Wayne & Juelz Santana]
Ya dig?

[Intro: Curren$y]
Uh, yeah, yeah
Hot Spitta, Spitta, Fly Society
Young Money y'all, Young Money y'all
Yeah

[Verse 1: Curren$y]
Figured it's time that I step back from the game
And peep it from a coach's point of view, so I can see
How niggas went wrong and how the players was wrong
And I can do it how a pro supposed to do
No mistakes allowed, you get caskets for that shit
The line of scrimmage is waiting
Niggas is blitzing, you could get sacked quick
Drop back like an all-star QB
Or the top on that high-end sports car with two seats
You niggas don't comb the pages of the duPont Registry
Looking for vehicles and accessories
Like I do, and every representor of my crew
I get love from Cuz and the Piru
Slide through the drive through of a fast food restaurant
Turn the music down and tell the broad what kind of sauce I want
Scratch off quickly to a main street, intentions to make cheese
Let the windows down and let the purp' scent clear out
The police is peeping me and they don't think that I can see
I know they gon' pull me over and make me get out
But I'm on to 'em
Spray the chronic-killer and talk calm to 'em
"Good day officer, what's the problem?"
You looking for answers? I don't got none
I'm from New Orleans and New Orleans don't raise no rats
You know the consequences of your acts, I'm getting money nigga

[Interlude: Lil Wayne]
Haha, I know that's right
Hello world, yeah
Yeah, uh-huh, Music to Fly To coming soon, y'all

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
You can see me on the Eastside of New Orleans with a red bitch
Fuck the world, make it walk with a leg twitch
Flow retarded, I'm on some Special Ed. shit
The magnificent, twist it like a dread, bitch
And I can get up in the car and drive
And if the record is a smash, I can still survive
Yeah, money ain't a thing but everything to me
Shit, I gotta make them C-notes sing to me
Yeah, higher than all of the angels be
And, no I never choke but I strangle beats
And, I am just a player in this game we be
So go blame the referee, don't complain to me
And I used to have a cutlass on stainless feet
Passin' all day up Latoya's Street
Back when Scarface used to sing to me
Had me feeling like a G was the thing to be
Back when I was pedaling my ten-speed bike
Who knew I'd be pedaling the six-speed white
Big dog through the yard where the little dogs bite
So if you are female dog, you don't fight
Bitch ass nigga, I ain't got no master
Rich ass nigga, I got all my masters
Bitch ass nigga, I ain't got no master
Rich ass nigga...

[Intro]
This the remix, baby!

'Cause if you don't you just don't know nothin
Shit, period! Stupid

[Verse]
You know me, I just be chilling in the Phantom, listening to opera
Gun is my bodyguard, call it "Kevin Costner"
Prolly won't stop if I get to poppin them shots
You niggas is sweeter than a box of Red Hots
Ha...
Fuck around, see a flock of red dots
Smoke good, eat good
Only fuck a bitch if her throat good, feet good
Just bought a Fleetwood
And I'ma put some D's on that bitch
Looking like I got a diamond disease on my wrist
Fresh, bunch of little G's on my kicks
I'm a dog, you're all a bunch of fleas on my dick
Young Money, Cash Money

And I'ma ride 'til the motherfucking wheels off

Gyals give me brain, give me brain like Temple
And him got game, game sharp like a pencil
And if you want fromage, we can crash like a cymbal
Look pon me window, ah mi new sports coupe
Twelve horses in the hood, sitting on horseshoes
Come from the land dat Jesus walk through
Sacrifice me life, man, I bleed for mi own crew
Dem no wanna rum-rum with me, dem no want to
Murder dem and di family dem belong to
Gangsta, dem know I run the street like the car do
You can haffi leave me or dearly depart you
Hip hop is mine now, mine—what ya gyan do?
I can jump on any nigga song and make a Part Two
Playtime for me, 'cause see, to me, they are cartoons
How come every joint be on point like a harpoon?
How come every bar stand strong like a barstool?
How come every line so raw, you gon' snort two?
Murder dem, man, I murder dem
Fuck a competition, man, I murder dem

[Intro]
Haha
Drought 3
Yessir!
Hahaha
Look

[Verse 1]
I bought it out like Stunna
I hope when we kiss, we make you sick to your stomach
Stuntin' like my daddy, and your mama eat rubbers
I bet that I can do the mouth-to-mouth with your woman
My house is a dungeon
Yellow diamond ring looking like a little Funyun
Stand on my toes, you can call me "Paul Bunyan"
Switching up my flows like a nigga do construction
The microphone wet 'cause my words like seduction
And when we on the jet, you don't come up in the discussion
And if you say you balling, we probably don't trust you
And I know plenty freaky hoes that probably won't fuck you
Even if you pay 'em, boy, they probably won't fuck you
Only if I say that she can touch you, like Busta
But she might cut you, and burn you, like Usher
Me and my clique be in red, like Russia
I shit these rappers out, and sometimes, I forget to flush you
Grandaddy purp or bubble kush-crusher
Explode in a bitch mouth like a Gusher
Cash Money, Young Money, check the production
I am just a Martian, get prepared for abduction

[Break]
Hahahaha
Hehehe
Hahahaha

[Verse 2]
Um, I walk it out, like crutches
Two girls jump me, like double-dutches
My nigga T-Streets know a girl named Duchess
And every time he see her in the street, she be cussing
I told him he should wave the black flag 'cause she bugging
He said, "The pussy good," he said, "You dig?" So I dug him
I'm looking for a real bad bitch with a husband
I'll give her much dick and a whole lot of nothing
I'm spitting like I stumbled on a gold pot of something
And when I was six, I saw my role model hustling
So I gotta hustle
These rappers talking 'bout a whole lot of nothing
You dropped me on Saturday, I sold out on Sunday
Fuck is the arguing 'bout? Nigga, Tha Carter out
This is what I call Da Drought... 3
And we don't walk it out, we drop-top-Porsche it out
They better walk 'em out, before we chalk 'em out
We chalk it out, we chalk it out, we chalk it out, we chalk it out
We chalk it out, we chalk it out, we chalk it out, we chalk 'em now
They don't want it, uh-uh; no, they don't want it, uh-uh
You see, they phony, I'm not; oh, yeah, they phony, I'm not
I Eastside walk it out, I bring New Orleans out
I am a Saints fan; oh, yeah, we marching now
Like we're a Saints band, I play the organs now
And if they talking, most likely, I'm what they talking 'bout
My nigga T from the East roll up that forest now
Man, I'm just trying to get my peanuts, I'm like Charlie Brown
OK, that Uzi make a Harley sound
Take two of these and walk around
Come straight from that homeless town
This game belong to Carter now, bitch

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Yeah

Cannon in my hand
And I'll be damned
If any man
Disrespect me on my land
Intercept a nigga plans
An effective ass nigga
I'm a f-f-fireman, but I'll wet that ass nigga
My vessel pump liquor, I'm a special-ass nigga
No frontin' I'm in front of these extra-last niggas
I'm a extra bad nigga, I'm a sideways shooter
Open up the Maserati
Fuck the highway troopers
'Cause nowadays dudes'll
Run and tell the troopers
So I hope that same trooper could
Find you when I lose ya
Hey, these niggas talkin' at the side of they medullas

On my dizzick
Snakes in the grass
Rats, lizards
But 'round here snitches don't exist
Like wizards
Ho, this ain't punch

And do my fingers like scissors
The game so cold
I done had my share of blizzards
But now I got that big money
Runnin' like rivers
Nigga
I'm here to get my shit straight
Burner on the hip-waist
Leave a nigga's street full of bones
Like a fish plate
Yeah, I'm from the hood

Swear I got on my knees
And thanked God for this day
So say what you wanna say

Alright, I like a bitch, that like a bitch

And I treat money like glue
You know I got to stick to the paper, you know I'm like a staple
That's why I got that Cash Money right above my navel
Young Money is the label, money, bitches and cable
We multiplying money sitting at the time table
So holler at a nigga when you see me on the grind
And bust that pussy open like we runnin' out of time

The girl may be yours but the pussy is mine

[Hook: Ludacris]

[Intro: Leah Kunkel Sample]
City streets, that's where I learned
Play with fire, you get burned
When the heat was on, I turned
Turned to trouble... trouble

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Yeah, yeah, C3, yeah
New Orleans baby
A street called Eagle
And everybody's ill
Yeah, ill-egal
People steal cars
We steal people
We eat like dogs
But we still people
And even when ya lost
Trouble still see you
And even if ya dead broke
We are still equal
One time for the lil people
Eat ya meal, don't let ya meal eat you
(I run with trouble...)
StreetRunner we crazy with this one
I, run, with, trouble

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
And just the other day my nigga Chris killed his self
I pray to God that I never feel the way he felt
Where do we go when there's no help?
He figured heaven, so he went left
Y'all know that ain't right
Plus he was high as a plane on that same night
Shit I probably been on that same flight
Shit I probably had that same fight
I just kept swinging
Twelve rounds coming, bells ringing
(I run with trouble...)
Introduced to the game when I was just a child
Mama loved a drug dealer, straight quit her job
They took his life
And along with him I died
And she died
We died
Then came my daughter to my bedside
Told me "Daddy, don't cry, I'm alive"
I look her in the eyes
And see me with no sins
But this is how the note ends

[Bridge: Lil Wayne & (Leah Kunkel Sample)]
(I have walked a bitter line
Chosen second over cheap wine)
Ya know
Just kick it back
(Still I look for brighter times)
I can't call it
(I run with trouble...)
Ya know? Heheh
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
The tooly poke out the jeans
The coke smell just like a bunch of coffee beans
Ya na mean?
And everything ain't what it seem
Ya na mean?
And don't play that game without your team
Kill for my bread, kill for my cheese, kill for my cream
I will have that red beam on high beam
Now I hear sirens
Wait I think I see one behind me
I ain't trippin baby, money got me
(I run with trouble...)
And fuck the police, fuck the feds too
I ain't jumpin' in that jumpsuit
A one-two, I'm on my one-two
Check me out
I fuck around and check you
Respect due
Pay yours nigga
Mine's under the seat
By my feet
Where yours nigga?
Too much hoarse liquor huh
Too much pressure, too much force
Too much money
You never heard that before
Shit
And we stop the snitches at the door
Cut that tail off the rat
He won't rat no more
(I run with trouble...)
That's right
Get trapped fuckin' with my cheese
Keep shooting 'til I burn my sleeves
Nigga, please
These boys is Gs
Represent New Orleans like a fleur-de-lis

Ready to battle anyone

You against me is like Man Vs. Wild
Me against you is like man versus child
Hehe and I am the man
It's Young Moolah, applaud my team
And we prefer red carpet if the floor's not clean
It's Mister, it's the microphone fiend
And they running with my words like I'm writing on jeans
Yeah, and if the lights could all scream
They'd sing my song, I like to be seen
I deserve to be heard if anything else
So I fear God and the world going deaf
Can you hear me now? Heh
Even the hip-hop vets tell me I'm the..

[Bridge]
Scary!
Don't stop the beat Diesel

Like diesel, yeah..

[Verse 3]
Heh I put it down like it's too heavy
But how can I with the world in my hands
Heaven in my plans
I swear I am important like the evidence I'm saying
I'm just trying to make my alphabets as heavy as I can
How do I live, whem I'm as deadly as I am?
I get props and every other extra credit that I can
Cause see, I respect the merit of a fan
No homo but please blow me to Japan
Okay I'm getting hotter I'mma need another fan
I keep going so here I go again
Always trying to be better than I am
Label me the best and in the throne I will stand
Why? Because I'm just a standup guy
Your hands smoking me cause I got your hands high
I pop a bean and bang Ja Rule when I Cry
You only know me but God knows I try
No x-ray show my insides
And I gotta stay in touch with my pimp side
So, tell your girl I said what's up.. I said hi..
She like that's what's up.. like the sky..
Byrd Gang taking off bitch watch em fly
And paint the sky red like the Crimson Tide
Flow retarded, Special Olympics kind
That gold medal heavy but it fit just fine
So, I just had to spit this rhyme
Spit like I'm trying to tongue kiss this rhyme
Some say greatness gets better with time
So I bought a zillion watches but don't watch mine
You little fucks are so i-ron-ical
Nickel plus fo' is a nine millimeter
No starch but I tote i-ron
All out in the open like I'm in I-ran
Young, champ-i-on, like a lamp I'm on
But um, I could clap and then lights off
Take no nights off but my days the same
And people change but fuck it nothing stays the same
And naw I ain't speaking so don't wave the blame
Lock me up but you could never cave the blame
Gasoline, can you invision if our gaze was flames
No you can not stop my vibe, couple page a game
Dang, a game? Yep, well gimme some baby flames
And if this camera shoots me dead, Lord save my chains
Lord save the rings, I am way too vain hehe
Listen to that Kanye again
I play the game like I made the games
You playing like your trying to get traded mane
And you ain't gotta call me the greatest mane
But I am more of a dog than the greatest dane
You boys acting like ladies mane
Crying like you bout to have babies mane
And you can find me grinding on the days we playin'
And that's because I know the sun'll raise again
And when it do I'mma praise the mane
They say you crazy Wayne, but I just bake em mane
And that's Ms. Baker saying, that I'm the...

Blue seats white paint wetter than new rain

I keep a black Glock, red dot blue flame
Feet hanging out the window jock my shoe game
Cause all my kicks fly, like Liu Kang
Hehe, old playa new game
I'm focused, I'm thinking like I got two brains
I'm in my prime I feel like a new Wayne
How come there is two bitches but ain't no two Waynes?
{*Wayne over Hook*}

The cops'll grab a roll of yellow tape and run around your house
Why y'all fuckin with Lil Spitta?
I wasn't doing nothing just laid up chillin
Playing Tony Hawk on the Xbox, burnin incense
Rocking sweat pants and some Jordan number sixes
My check cleared I'm officially a rich nigga
So from this day I'mma smile in all my pictures
Get the champagne from the top shelf
The crib got wings like a jet, one east one west

[Hook: Swizz Beatz]

[Verse: Mack Maine]

The kush got me higher than an old hooker's skirt (skirt)
And I never been to culinary school but cook work (cheah)
I'm no sergeant homie so I never cuff a ho
And I hustle for my +Bills+ like I'm from Buffalo
Ya figga deal - but on the really-real
Pause the clock my flow timeless
Say my name and lose your job like you're Don Imus (fuck you)

[Hook: Swizz Beatz]

[Intro: Lil Wayne]
We had them bitches addicted like it was some drug
Its Weezy Wee, Mannie Fresh, and Unplugged
We had them bitches addicted like it was some drug
Weezy, Fresh, and Unplugged

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Give me a big fine bitch in a dress, one who put them lips in effect
Suck the dick until the shit in her chest
You can piss on her breast, I like that shit
Project hoes like that dick, don't bite that dick
Give me a Spanish big and sweet ho, black from Puerto Rico
Freak ho, specializin in givin me deep throat
Really don't care how (?) shorty
Give me head, don't care, swallow cum, don't spit
Aww shit, I like them Jamaicans and them Haitians
Niggas can't take it when they shake an make me rape 'em
White girls I video tape 'em and they enjoy it
They love it when everybody saw it, it's off the chain
High yellow Mexican bitches they all for brains
But watch them hoes that want the change, it's not a game
Or a short cuban ho, with a fat ass though
Bet I'll treat the bitch just like Fidel Castro

[Chorus: UnPlugged]
Tell me what you like, let me tell you what I like
If you go on and break me off by the end of the night
You can ride with me
Cause I like ya Simmon's jeans, ain't tryin to make a love scene
Truly I just want you to break me off

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Listen, listen, it's Weezy the hottest, drinkin Barcadis
I stream through the scene in a Lincoln on Robbers
Lookin for the finest dime to wine and dine
Later on I'm tryin to climb behind ya spine
Hold up lil mama, slow ya ass down
Pick ya up, dick up in ya, throw ya ass down
Now throw ya ass around, and scream my name
I can't hear you say it louder what (Wayne, Wayne)
A damn shame, better watch that boy he nasty
I strap on de plastic, make ya bounce like elastic
Put the pickle in the middle, make it wiggle for y'all
Might be small, but that dick ain't little at all
I like a short thick broad, fat ass and shit
Like sassy, flip like Trina, "Da Baddest Bitch"
Matter of fact when I see her, +Pull+ her +Over+ like a cop
Juvey coulda "Backed It Up" and I'da "Dropped it Like It's Hot"
Ya heard me?! (What, haha)
Haha, Unplugged

[Chorus: UnPlugged]
Tell me what you like, let me tell you what I like
If you go on and break me off by the end of the night
You can ride with me
Cause I like ya Simmon's jeans, ain't tryin to make a love scene
Truly I just want you to break me off

[Verse 3: Mannie Fresh]
I like them big and round, pretty and brown
A bitch that take it from the back and make the (Ugh Ugh) sound
Now you can bounce slide drop, giddy up, giddy up
Now you can ride til you feel it get a nut, get a nut
Shake for ya hood, bounce for ya baby daddy
Twerk for that nigga got you pregnant in the Caddy
Slide with the KY, hold up, pause
My bitch got thongs, yo' bitch got drawers
My chick like to swallow, yo' chick like to spit
If yo' chick was my chick I'd still love that bitch
Hold up, wait a minute, chill out, stop
My ginseng, viagra, and a strawberry pop
See I'm gettin kinda bold, won't ya bring a friend
From vagina to the asshole do it again
I want a yucky down misses bout delta
Yo mama loved a Tymer but now you welcome
You ok lil mama and I love that chick
But deep down inside I just love my dick

[Chorus: UnPlugged]
Tell me what you like, let me tell you what I like
If you go on and break me off by the end of the night
You can ride with me
Cause I like ya Simmon's jeans, ain't tryin to make a love scene
Truly I just want you to break me off
Tell me what you like, let me tell you what I like
If you go on and break me off by the end of the night
You can ride with me
Cause I like ya Simmon's jeans, ain't tryin to make a love scene
Truly I just want you to break me off
Tell me what you like, let me tell you what I like
If you go on and break me off by the end of the night
You can ride with me
Cause I like ya Simmon's jeans, ain't tryin to make a love scene
Truly I just want you to break me off
Tell me what you like, let me tell you what I like
If you go on and break me off by the end of the night

Chorus: Baby, (Lac)

(If you move twenty birds I consider you real)

Put it on the streets and let em cook up and wiegh up
Put it on his ass if he don't hook up then pay up
I, put it on the streets and let em cook up and wiegh up
Put it on his ass if he don't hook up then pay up

(Nigga if you got lets continue to deal)
(If you move twenty birds I consider you real)

What, put it on the streets and let em cook up and wiegh up
Put it on his ass if he don't hook up then pay up

[Intro]
Look look look - don't play with me
Look look look
Huh? Huh? Look

[Verse 1]
Let's get the pistols out the trunk, let's get ready to bust bang!
Leave a nigga block full of nothin' but guts, brains
Ain't no way, nowhere that these niggas could duck flames
My guns up for and tellin' all to suck Wayne
I'm runnin' with a clique that just be thuggin' heavy
Plus I'm runnin' in them bricks, cook it, cut it, sell it
One time for my daddy, Rabbit, up in Heaven
Ever since my nigga died I've been strapped up and ready
Come and get it - it's Weezy Wee, the hottest ever
Now this fella gon' get bullets inside his sweater
I'm just terror, or better yet, horror or drama
And tomorrow I'mma hit the block and borrow your momma
Beef with me, you're swimmin' in water with sharks and piranhas
Revolvers and choppers got all your partners callin' the coppers
And for the grand finale, I might pull up in a tan Denali
When I hop out, in my hand is a Calico sprayin' your family

[Chorus]
Don't play with me - I wish you would
I'ma hit your hood, then split your hood
You bet' not play with me cause I cock my gun
I pop my gun
Better hide and run
Niggas bet' not play with me cause I wish you would
I'ma hit your hood, then split your hood
Niggas bet' not play with me cause I cock my gun
And I pop my gun
Better hide and run

[Verse 2]
What is this that done got me in your district? Twist it
Now everybody got dots on they heads like Egyptians
I'm tipsy - I've been sippin' on that Hennessy, people
Then it get deeper, I start shootin' up innocent people
Seventeen Creeper is who I - what I - be, dog
The clip slide in the four-five, then it blow five
In heat, dog? It's your life or me, dog
On four tires, or feet, dog
I still be on the block sweepin'
Nobody is not sleepin'
Got me in all black with a gun in a palm
Run in his home, start shootin', hit his son in the dome
Dummy, it's on - ain't gon' be no relaxin' and stuff
Cause when I come through mashin' the truck, I'm blastin' a pump
And passin' a blunt - me circle once to see if he dead
Gotta be sure cause niggas promised me a ki if he dead
But, dog, you get it raw if you war with the kid
I'll push your baby momma car off the bridge
Huh?!

[Chorus]
Don't play with me - I wish you would
I'ma hit your hood, then split your hood
You bet' not play with me cause I cock my gun
I pop my gun
Better hide and run
Niggas bet' not play with me cause I wish you would
I'ma hit your hood, then split your hood
Niggas bet' not play with me cause I cock my gun
And I pop my gun
Better hide and run

[Verse 3]
You might catch me with bandanas and strapped T
On the back street of your block in the back seat
I'mma cap three at the first coward I up and see
I'mma bust the piece and knock his body a couple of feet
When I rush your front door, you get a few to your stomach
Hope they dress you up nice because your funeral Sunday
Nigga shouldn't've played tough - wouldn't've got his head bust
Now your whole livin' room is full of pink and red stuff
Now you're gatted up, full of that vodka and weed added up
Fresh platted up, your T-shirt all tatted up
Crack in the tongue of my kicks
Plus I got a gun on my hip, and I'm runnin' the strip
I know you see me: Little Weezy kill 'em all easy
A hundred rounds from the chopper leave 'em real sleepy
You know how we be smellin' weedy up in our clothes
Cutthroatin', connivin' killers, but that's all I know
Huh? Huh? Huh?

[Chorus]
Don't play with me - I wish you would
I'ma hit your hood, then split your hood
You bet' not play with me cause I cock my gun
I pop my gun
Better hide and run
Niggas bet' not play with me cause I wish you would
I'ma hit your hood, then split your hood
Niggas bet' not play with me cause I cock my gun
And I pop my gun
Better hide and run
Don't play with me - I wish you would
I'ma hit your hood, then split your hood
You bet' not play with me cause I cock my gun
I pop my gun
Better hide and run
Niggas bet' not play with me cause I wish you would
I'ma hit your hood, then split your hood
Niggas bet' not play with me cause I cock my gun
And I pop my gun
Better hide and run
Don't play with me - I wish you would
I'ma hit your hood, then split your hood
You bet' not play with me cause I cock my gun
I pop my gun
Better hide and run

[Outro]
Niggas bet' not play with me
Look, uh-huh (uh-huh uh-huh)
Look look look
Look look look

Now they actin funny ‘cause they know a nigga strong
Money long and we comin’

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
I ain’t have to touch a piece of work since ‘94

In ‘98 (i got a brand new Lexus coupe)
(now them laws won’t leave me alone)
They pull me over, lock me up, I bail out on my own
I call my poppa on the phone, tell him cook up a zone
I leave a house with a pocket full of stones
Got them hoes slangin’, hidin’ packs in they titties
Them small chest bitches gotta put it in their butt
(20s in them they can’t fuck wit us)
I got so many hoes

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]

Milk this game 'til it's sour
Why I gotta do the backstreets when it's hotter?

The tool yellin' like, holla, y'heard me?
Got the fools bailin' like Jackie, Kersee
You try join him, I can help you with that

[Hook x2: Lil' Wayne]
Yea, and we ain't stressin' 'bout shit

The cops on my trail so my track I switch
See niggas with money shouldn't act like this

[Verse 2: Birdman]
Yeah, pimpin', there's some fraud 'round here
Nigga better stop hatin' before they disappear
I see the same ol' shit

Disrespect that Nolia dawg
Them third world Hot Boys soldiers dawg
And make a nigga understand
When you fuckin' with a soldier with the grandmaster plan (nigga)
I'm tryin' to make a few million
Buy a few buildings, one day stop dealin'
And go and raise my children
Got it on my mind, that's the way a nigga livin'
I bring you back to '84
Dope game jumpin' when the water hit the flo' (nigga)
Cause we was doin' it, dogg
Everybody gettin' money, we was doin' it, dogg

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Weezy, and I ride to the end of the road
And I'm hotter than a fire on the end of the fo'
And plenty times I had to get it from the flo'
But I made it to the ceiling and every wall could hear me
And if these walls could talk
They'd probably cry, like the strings on the guitar
And see you, you with that bullshit that's leeway to the do'
Only to cut off the lights, g'night

[Verse 4: Birdman]
Look, it's Sunday, we in the hood gettin' our groove on
Every nigga uptown gotta have they tool on
Yeah, and they Birdman'd down
Niggas represent the bling cause I hold my own crown nigga
Shit, a hood rich high clique
That come from the slums where they pack extra clips
I love 'em nigga, the only way that we know is how to flip and rescore 'em
And go and get some more dough, nigga

[Hook]

[Outro: Birdman]
Yeah, this grindin' to another linin' nigga
Know what I'm sayin'?
If you in the way, you'll get moved over nigga
Think I'mma let one of you bitch niggas stop me from gettin' a billion dollars nigga?
Fuck ya and what ya made of nigga
Y'understand? Nigga got a problem with this shit
That's your shit nigga
Suck a nigga dick a die nigga
Birdman, made man nigga
Yeah, that's how it's goin' diggity nigga
Fuck anything in between
If you in the line of duty nigga you got your issue, feel me?
One

[Verse 1]
Come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Ain't nothin' nice or sweet (Huh?)
They don't even much understand this (Uh-uh)
Look-
Now when I crawl up out the Rove' I got quarters and O's
Forty-fours under my clothes, I'm drunk and blowed
And I done told them boys if they play I dump their mothers
Now they findin' niggas everyday slumped in gutters
I come through on the block strapped, bumpin' Bubba
For the summer in a bright orange pumpkin Hummer
Stumblin' from the Courvoisier, and lots of hay
And make me run in your place and take your pops away
See, they got niggas in my hood who can't cop the yay
So I can get it understood and have you chopped today
And not to say I could even hit your block and spray
And try to knock all the bone structure out your face
Stick a potato on the head of my nine, it's deadly quiet
Leave a nigga redder than swine, you damn pig
The plan is to take everything and kill 'em all
Young or old, nigga, big or small
Ain't nothin' nice

[Chorus]
Ain't nothin' nice around here, stupid
Keep playin', you won't see next year, stupid
And in the van there's a box in the back full of plenty of tools
And when you see me on the block, I come to give 'em the blues

[Verse 2]
Look-
Now we all do dumb things
Playin' with Wayne doesn't have to be one of 'em
I'll murder his father right in front of him
None of 'em are ready for the trouble I'm 'bout
Pull up in a bubble, hop out, then let a couple pop out
I got two double Desert Eagles, bustin' at your peoples
Cussin' at polices, and roughin' up your nieces
See me just off the meters
Don't leave without the heaters
Believe this, my nina's got more shelves than Adidas
You see the slick jackin', believe it's Glocks and millimeters
Run up on your family and pop your senioritas
A lot of Hennessy, just twist that lil' baby
Damn, them hollow tips just missed that lil' baby
This is definitely, step to me, get a hysterectomy
Technically I'll murder anyone who disrespectin' me
Seventeen Carollton, mess with me, I bury one
Three-eighty, I carry one
Come to kill up everyone
What!

[Chorus]
Ain't nothin' nice around here, stupid
Keep playin', you won't see next year, stupid
And in the van there's a box in the back full of plenty of tools
And when you see me on the block, I come to give 'em the blues

[Verse 3]
Everybody freeze and drop when Lil Weezy cock
And niggas be like Q-Tip cause they breathe and stop
Believe or not, the ki's ten G's a wat
Until I die apple and Eagle that be's the block
And he's so hot that four hundred degrees the spot
And weed and vodk' got me wanna beat a cop
I grease the Glock, the scope with the beam and dot
And I'm hangin' out the Beamer top releasin' shots
Follow me, everybody in the family die sourly
Niggas drop hourly ruinin' your economy
Liquor power me, now there's nothin' that can bother me
Creep up in your window while you're sleepin', take your child with me
I'm wild, and Wheezy more violent than Dennis Rodman
Slide up in a blue truck and shoot-up a whole lot of men
A lot of heat, a lot of fire, a blazer like Stoudamire
Ride around your neighborhood and you wake up with bodies by your house

[Chorus]
Ain't nothin' nice around here, stupid
Keep playin', you won't see next year, stupid
And in the van there's a box in the back full of plenty of tools
And when you see me on the block, I come to give 'em the blues

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
I know some niggas that'll merk ya for a quarter birdy
You bitch ass niggas just be lucky that the boy ain't hurtin'
I got the money to lag and I got that swagger workin'
I'm smokin' somethin' I can't pronounce behind them Phantom curtains
What is you holl'in' bitch I'm on some gangsta shit
She wanna make me dinner I tell her make me rich
You fuckin' wit' a winner but I come from a little
Ho but bet I can take that dirt and turn that shit glitter
I leave the work wit' her yeah she my baby sitter
And if I find out she stealin' for realer I'mma kill her
I'm just a money maaan so where the dollars at
Sorry momma but it be that until them flowers black
She wanna ride on this I make her ride wit' that
Her pistol in the ceilin' that's her survival pack
And do I love her nawww man I just love her spirit
Blind deaf or crazy it's money over bitches

[Hook - Lil Wayne - 2X]
Now everybody that I know get that money baby
And we ain't worryin' 'bout them hoes get that money baby
You get that cooked or that blow you done called a baller
If you ain't talkin' 'bout that dough homie what'cha talkin'

[Verse 2: Birdman]
So get'cha game up take a bitch break a bitch
Strap her down wit' work and tell her don't trip take a trip
Get'cha hustle up the money's what you make of it
These niggas want it cooked and I done closed down the bakery
So stop stuntin' homie false promotin'
It ain't about what'cha makin' it's about what ya totin'
Burn him up leave him naked bring him back to his wife
The bitch ain't even cry cause he was livin' that life
These niggas think I'm slippin' cause I'm fallin' back
Bitch I got money in the walls for that
Young'n get it from the ground homie hold the hood down and
Don't make a sound if them people swing around this bitch
Do ya thang whoa' hustle try to stay low
This is for my old school G's who ain't around this bitch
But shawty they ain't fuckin' wit' pops
Let them niggas chase that pussy we gon' follow that guap... yeah

[Hook - Lil Wayne]

[Verse 3: Birdman]
Fifty stacks in the garden in the backyard
Money talkin' turn a key into a crack charge
Y'all niggas ain't eatin' how we eatin' B
Fuck how we used to be now we how we need to be
If they ain't wit' us they must be against us
We shoot 'em in the head cause they act like they senseless
If you ain't gettin' bread nigga keep yo' distance
We sharks over here nigga keep on fishin'

[Verse 4: Lil Wayne]
Money money money is my intuition
Money over bitches such an easy decision
Young Money money men monster militia
Hardbody these niggas boxes of tissue
That nina will kiss ya that chopper will twist ya
Them .380 snapshots now smile for the pictures
Weezy motherfuckin' Baby pay me
My 9-to-5 is overrated I'm on that grind ho

[Hook - Lil Wayne]

Can smell it in my clothes you can smell it in my seats
That's how a nigga rolls I was raised in them streets
I'm rolling up a sweet, I'm fillin' it with keef
I'm too high to talk bitch, keep it real brief
If it ain't about money, you don't even gotta speak
I smoke it in a paper, Weezy smoke it in a leaf
And nigga I'mma Stunna, I got runnas
And we keep them shotguns like hunters
We smoke thunder, it put me under

See I be fuckin' with them trees, cause I'm straight out the jungle

And I be calmer than a soma, inside of the phantom
And it's lookin' like a sauna, and I stay high and I still got my diploma
And I still keep the maggie on me like a Homer
And I'm too sick, man, I'm spittin' out a coma
And I'm still lettin' the money pile like goma
And I smoke that kill, y'all blowin' on begonias
And I keep a field of that grass like a farmer
And I keep that armor, try me and I'll spin you around
I'll be with the stars and I ain't talkin' Tinsel Town
That's right the prince in town, bitch tear the fences down
Like Prince in town, boy I shits a pound of that purple rain on the marvin's day
You wit' me now? Too high you can't set me down

[Hook] (x2)

[Verse 3: Daz & (Kurupt)]
We got that AK-47 white right on set painted
And named it orange purple kush that million dollar top brand

(Blazin' up so much bomb, I got a bad bitch on my side)
See see we just smokin' we just smokin', we just tryin' to fire up
If you got the bomb bomb nigga come and light it up
(Yeah blaze up ain't nothin like ridin' by, drivin' high)
(Me and all the homies smokin', dumpin' if you chokin' smokin')
Smoke slow when they hit you cuz you might pass out
(Look over at the bitches, snatch a blunt up out her mouth, bitch)
Switch it to another scene, that has you smokin' endo green
(Some homies be on that lean, mix it with that endo weed)
Because we fucked up, we fucked up, you know that we fucked up

Because we fucked up, we fucked up, you know that we fucked up

[Hook] (x2)

Original gangsta, black clothes and bangers
Bullet shells and chambers, fill the L's up
We stay low from the ranges cause they trying to tame us
But we brainless and just think
I'm one sell out record away from being famous
Shit I guess I ain't it
You could paint it how you may, but I remain this gangsta 'til the day
I lay where the worms stay
I spit it for my nigga's sake, I spit it for myself a long time ago
Got a few houses, few whips, few condos
I'm so straight I'm pointing
The game is hurting, and baby boy the ointment
Baby boy the president now, shit you gotta make an appointment
Two record labels, you should come join 'em
Do check the label
And make sure it's yellow or rose 'fore you bring it to my table

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
Gansters don't die, they get chubby and they move to Miami, I move to Miami

Had to pop a few pussies that was bad feathers
Million on the floor
Thats fo' sho' that lil' homie got the flow, so we all just goin flow
And don't think about the past
A little water came, now we floatin on everything
Niggas doing about anything, killin while they hustlin
Niggas puttin it in for the change
So we headed to the game, Culpepper gettin' his roll on

[Verse 4: Birdman]
Trap me, I'm in there early, gettin money ridin dirty

Big shouts to all them cities who opened your arms to us nigga
And let us through that motherfucker, ya' heard me
Cause that water ran us out that motherfucker, but we did bounce back
Believe that 305, 404, 713, all that, Dallas, Kansas
Everybody ya' heard me, Oklahoma, yeah, everybody, the whole world

[Verse 1]
Whaaat
You can find me on the corner with stones, quarters and zones
Or dope and powder broke, and our sale's soap and flour
And most of our customers come up to us daily
Yet and still I cut this stuff crazy - a hustler, baby
What can I give you? I distribute ki's to the kings
And z's to the fiends, and ecstasy and weed to the teens
You need to see Weez - anything you like and I have 'em
From crack to Viagra, and Vicodins, Valiums
I'm the nigga they point to when you hit my av
So get all your money together, come and get my slabs
I get my cash, put some aside, and flip like half
And still enough for me to TV and deep-dish my Nav'
And you can tell the law that I say they can kiss my acid
For the white people
When I get two bricks for ten, I know the right people
And I keep a nine on my waistline
And I'mma be right on the corner, wodie - I'm gonna grind

[Chorus]
I tell 'em, "Whaaat!!"
You see me hustlin' on the block all the time
Sittin' at the table, breakin' ki's down to dimes
Sooner or later this neighborhood gon' be mine
Nigga, I'm tryin' to grind
I tell 'em, "Whaaat!!"
You see me hustlin' on the block all the time
Sittin' at the table, breakin' ki's down to dimes
Sooner or later this neighborhood gon' be mine
Nigga, I'm on the grind

[Verse 2]
Nigga, y'all gon' respect Weezy, or else the tec squeezin' shots
I have your chest steamin' hot, and your sis' screamin', "Stop!"
I hang out on the block, nigga, with rocks and weed
On the corner 'til the mornin', see the cops and flee
And if we beef, we don't beef long cause we gon' creep all night
So I hope you don't sleep all night - we on your street all night
Say, aw aw, I don't want your boy to get me shoes
Cause I spit tools, and put him tissues in his shoes
And the bricks move every followin' week
So if you need to get it, too, then holla at me - got powder or d
And I shower your streets until your av pass out
More bricks than "The Three Lil Pigs'" last damn house
Stack crack and lay back, and just laugh at droughts
And issue work for half and just grab that south
For real, nigga - Weezy Wee tryin' to shine
From daybreak to nightfall I'm gon' grind

[Chorus]
Tell 'em, "Whaaat!!"
You see me hustlin' on the block all the time
Sittin' at the table, breakin' ki's down to dimes
Sooner or later this neighborhood gon' be mine
Nigga, I'm on the grind
I tell 'em, "Whaaat!!"
You see me hustlin' on the block all the time
Sittin' at the table, breakin' ki's down to dimes
Sooner or later this neighborhood gon' be mine
Nigga, I'm on the grind

[Verse 3]
Start from grams to ounces to quarters to halves to ki's
Takes seconds to minutes to hours to days and to weeks
Gotta grind, work, hustle, struggle, and get it
Gotta buy, cook it, cut it, sell it, and flip it
And I flight everyday and night from the corner to the avenue
And I'll sleep next week, man, I got yay, dope, and crack to move
Ask them dudes when Wheezy open shop, I ain't got a bag to lose
Especially if I don't like who sent 'em to me and I'mma tax a dude
Duck the Feds and drama like I duck my baby momma
Sometimes I play it sour - what you thought was yay was flour
I pull whatever for the cheddar - nigga gotta flash and floss
Drought come around, then it's jack the cost or jack the boss
Cock the gun, then I push rocks 'til I spot the sun
All day I hung the block, I see the cops and run
I'm tryin' to get rich cause I wan' shine
You can find me on the block, nigga, all the time

[Chorus]
I tell 'em, "Whaaat!!"
You see me hustlin' on the block all the time
Sittin' at the table, breakin' ki's down to dimes
Sooner or later this neighborhood gon' be mine
Nigga, I'm on the grind
I tell 'em, "Whaaat!!"
You see me hustlin' on the block all the time
Sittin' at the table, breakin' ki's down to dimes
Sooner or later this neighborhood gon' be mine
Nigga, I'm on the grind
I tell 'em, "Whaaat!!"
You see me hustlin' on the block all the time
Sittin' at the table, breakin' ki's down to dimes
Sooner or later this neighborhood gon' be mine
Nigga, I'm on the grind
I tell 'em, "Whaaat!!"
You see me hustlin' on the block all the time
Sittin' at the table, breakin' ki's down to dimes
Sooner or later this neighborhood gon' be mine
Nigga, I'm on the grind

[Outro]

Fire you can't put out tires are standin' out
The coupe look pigeon-toed I be in a different mode
I be with them different hoes, no I mean them different hoes
I mean them Weezy bumbaclot different hoes
And as far as terrific goes, they kiss that dick with no mistletoes
Diamonds and pearls and pussy hoes
Snortin' coke 'til they nose bleed
I'm sittin' high on them inches I'm in the nosebleeds
I'm on a paper chase until my toes bleed
Then I get on these beats and let my soul bleed
I put 'em in ya head and watch the holes bleed
My rag always red like when them hoes bleed
Now that's coldbleed I mean cold blooded
And I'm so southern that's why my leather so soft

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Birdman]
She soft as a bush nigga she purple like kush nigga

Know what I do nigga them teardrops is true nigga
We stay so fly ride Bentley coupes nigga
Rolls Royce Corniches and asses by the beaches
Blowin' on that puff and we drivin' foreign features
Higher than whoever nigga know we 'bout that cheddar, nigga
Know I got a tommy gun gave one to my young'n son
And we got it together
.47, .51, you gon' hear us when we come, daddy

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
You see the paper gon' come if not I'm gon' get it
I gotta die with money cause I wasn't born wit 'it
It was 9-27-82 baby due
Charity Hospital aka the city zoo
No pity due to no one nobody not all
Man, they dropped us in the game and everybody's trying to ball
And the small hand'll touch ya, the large hand'll cut ya
But until that day, I'll be a mothafuckin' stunna, nigga

[Birdman]
Ball 'til I fall I done did it for my dawgs
Ball 'til I fall I done did it for y'all
Ball 'til I fall I done did it for me nigga
Ball 'til I fall that's the way it's gon' be nigga
Up in the early I done did it for sunshine
Candy on the paint everytime I touch mine
Nine stay cocked cause I'm good wit' firin' mines
Alligator wit' the suede ridin' them 25's

[Hook]

[Intro]

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]

Sellin palm trees, in beaches in shorts sleeves
Fly your bitch down here bet ya she won't leave
Exspensive car keys and glasses, t-shirts, pants's
I keep money on me like dancers, see
Everybody got problems, and money is the answer
The teacher ain't pickin everybody with they hands up
What are we to do but get paid, get ya grass up
Number one fan of the money, join the fan club
These boys don't know paper like I know paper
Nigga I'm still on 2004 paper, I'm tryin to get some more paper
I ain't tryin to die with no paper, that's why a nigga stay....

[Verse 1]
Runnin' from the scene, Hammer in my jeans
Dead bodies behind me, the cops'll never find me
Arm & Hammer Clean on my way to the honeycombe
Hustle all night tell my bitch I'm never coming home
Be there in the morning, stop cryin' bitch
The sun is home, drop it on the living room table
Bitch the money home, I know you ain't gon' stay once the money gone
So while I'm rich I pull my dick and get my fuckin' on
Youngin' on some real "Gangsta Gangsta" shit
Blame it on the neighborhood I was sanctioned in
But I'mma make sure we get them acres
Tell 'em fuck computers, we good with paper
Tell 'em fuck the world cause I'm hood by nature
Feelin' that way is how the hood'll make ya
The hood is vacant, the streets are empty, yeah
Mr. Bush, rebuild the city, but

[Verse 2]
Yeah, over like yesterday floatin' to the floodgates
This is New Orleans, welcome to the blood state
A blood bath, and you ain't nothin' but tub bait
No political justice not even the judge safe
If his ass can't swim he get a closed case
We need our own space, I ain't talkin' about Jupiter
No luck, no help and we the fuckin' future
I'm a hoosier, usually the cool one
But when I need it, I turn into a looter
God forgive, but do he forgive the brutal
Even when it's for the better of your junior
Soon you see that life's just another movie
And the main character dies at the end, usually
There's nothin' that haven't been done that you can do to me
I been hit, I been shot nigga shoot at me!

[Verse 3]
Yeah, money on the mind, murder in the plans
Disturbin' if you may, but it's dinner for the fam
Hustler by law, support when I can
Hustle when I can, tell me nothing I'm a man
Smell my shit as I walk off the stand
Nuts to my feet with my heart in my hand
Pardon my G, but I'm one of a kind
Been shot two times, here to put it in a rhyme
Slow lane, move the Coupe like a 5
If I get pulled over, bitch I'm gon' do time
And I know my niggas love me, but they can't do mine
So I gotta be smart, get bread or get behind
Get lost or get in line
But the carpet's still fine
So keep tryin', the whole world turnin' back
But we keep tryin' until we get our piece, no piece
Keep Firin'

Bah

[Intro]
Killer, huh?
Callin' Lil Wayne, Wayne a killer
What? What? (Killer)
What? What? (Check)

[Verse 1]
Hold up, you now under the deep cover of the lil' slugger
Callin' me head busta, run with me K, blocka
Niggas done fled from a, me infrared, sucka
If him wan' play, busta, come make me dead, busta
Beanie' half-way out my nappy head
But I don't care, I just grab my clip, slap and spray
Anywhere, it don't matter where a nigga stay
Just believe me when I say, "Guerrilla warfare"
I swear, it be some more drama about these bags
Niggas in black drive Jags, camouflage rags
Niggas' domes get bust wide open with blood and sweat
Niggas ridin' off in Hummers, laughin', drinkin' Moette
You know me: Corlleon, standin' four feet
I'm totin' cannons, wearin' Rollie's
See, these lil' boys, they ain't really up on my game
But once I run into that nigga playin' with Wayne, man
See, when I spin-a you bend then I be on you block
But when me jump out with the chop-chop, my nigga, you drop
Now where your niggas at, comradie? They not with you now
I guess they heard that when I'm ridin' I make the crew stop
Now, is you 'bout what I'm 'bout?
If you 'bout what I'm 'bout, you 'bout drama
Thuggin' in broad day with four Glocks, a knife, and a chopper
I'm runnin' away, don't get in my way my nigga
Callin' me head busta, caller callin' me killer

[Chorus]
Them callin' me killer
Them callin' me head busta, Cash Money nigga
My nigga, when I'm out late call me what you want, full of blunts
Look out your window, see who in the front, me
Them callin' me killer
Them callin' me head busta, Cash Money nigga
My nigga, when I'm out late call me what you want, full of blunts
Look out your window, see who in the front, check

[Verse 2]
Now as the heat flame up
Them lookin'-a down the street, them think they see Wayne truck
Him whole block don't scare me cause me get me thing and bust
Them know that Hot Boys known to be dangerous
Now U.P.T. come down, chopper city in the ghetto, my man
Now who that be in the car with the chopper? Oh, it's Lil' Wayne
I get my K, cock, aim, and put holes in your brain
Give me that rag, you ain't no soldier, wipe the blood off my chain
Gettin' blisty, off in a black F-150
'Bout to do the old usual, hit your block, just spittin'
Heads spinnin' like a set of seventeens or somethin'
Respect me for who I be: seventeen head-bustin'
Because them

[Chorus]
Them callin' me killer
Them callin' me head busta, Cash Money nigga
My nigga, when I'm out late call me what you want, full of blunts
Look out your window, see who in the front, me
Them callin' me killer
Them callin' me head busta, Cash Money nigga
My nigga, when I'm out late call me what you want, full of blunts
Look out your window, see who in the front, check

[Verse 3]
Original Hot Boy, land-cruisin' with guns
I shall be the one who burn the block up
Never miss when I distribute anger up out my Cali'
Hundred shots automatic, leave ya hopeless in the alley
Now, when a nigga runs up, if the nigga love his life he would have his guns up
Just because of the simple fact that I'm a Hot Boy, and got boys that got toys to stop noise
See, when me ride off in the Hummer, leave him set empty
Now him catch three cause him want beef
Now, me tried to tell the stupid boy, "Don't mess-a with me."
Now look at him, open up his casket and see
Click-clack my mack, twist my Philly cap to the back
Jump in the black and scream, "War", and just, pow-pow
How you love me now? With five barrels to your eye
The scene gets wild, and everybody gon' die
What the dillio? Fill a four-four clip
You'll get flipped for runnin' off at the lip
Who behind the gun flame? Blunt hang, and twisted?
It's Mister Wayne, come splittin' when I spit

[Chorus]
Them callin' me killer
Them callin' me head busta, Cash Money nigga
My nigga, when I'm out late call me what you want, full of blunts
Look out your window, see who in the front, me
Them callin' me killer
Them callin' me head busta, Cash Money nigga
My nigga, when I'm out late call me what you want, full of blunts
Look out your window, see who in the front, check

[Outro]
Me!
See, them callin' me killer
Huh?
Because them callin' me killer
What?
Them niggas callin' me killer
Them callin' me head busta, Cash Money nigga
What?

Them callin' me killer (Killer!)
Them callin' me head busta, Cash Money nigga (Killer!)

[Chorus: Mannie Fresh]
Lexus, Benz, Impala's wit' the top down drivin' careless
Swervin' through from left to right, and I'm dressed so super tight

[Chorus]

[Lil Wayne]

Holding my coast by myself never folding
Throwing the SQAD 7 up lettin' em know it

Notice the stroke in my motion, strollin'
Toke and a poke and a smoke got me loaded
Put a purple ocean in my soda make potion
Pull a rover over by some hoes make noise
Roll ya body like a snake slow for all my boya'z
Wizzle hotter than ya hottest gat but so poised
Bodies flying in the air while I whip the Harley
I'm hardly seeing you playa you can't see me

And the rolls gold bezzle show clearly

[Chorus]

Snatch off that lingerie

[Chorus]

Birdman junior...

[Repeat 2X]
Do it
Do it, now, now, uh do it now
Now, now uh do it now gul

[Verse 1: Wayne]
Hot Boy Baby, stop for a woman with her clothes off
Get hed, then doze off
This bed is so soft, this dick is so hard
End all the bullshit as soon as I pull it out
Then I put it, push it, in and out
That's that good shit, that gushy, I work them out yea
She said her guy can't satisfy her
Now she cumma cumma cumma cumma cumma chameleon
She comes and gooooes, my ho
And I love her, love her, love her, I love her, I really do
But I don't hook or handcuff her, that's not somethin' I do, yea

[Hook: 2X]
Reel: I feel like fuckin' somethin', I feel like fuckin' somethin'
Wayne: I'mma step to the girl, I'mma let her know my name
She gon' look at her girlfriend like bitch I'mma leave you, yep!

[Verse 2]
I don't want no problems, I just wanna fix that problem
If your problem be that nigga, mama, I will be that nigga
You should have yourself a drink, I get through and
Your girls about to go peace, I get you in
The V.I.P. with me, now talk to your girls, V-I-P I be
Cause I do it, large
IPod, the coolet muthafucka that you prolly ever saw
To the bar we spar, lovetaps, later on we turn that to war, yea

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
OK ma, I hear you sayin' I can hit, that's good
Wat about this nigga I'm with? he good
That's my nigga Trill Reel, Reel show her wat you do...
That's how me move so, baby lets move slow
Mami that's too slow, keep up with the groove
We gon' get to wrestlin', messin' with your breasts
Since you come through in a dress, now I'm undoin' your dress
Yea, I got my 1,2, my 1,2 in effect
I'm the young dude, that's sprung, you come through and get wet
And yes I..know I..ease 'em when I please 'em
The people downtown never want me to leave 'em
Ohhh

[Hook]

Do it
I said do it

[Lil Wayne]
Hat to the front
Lookin' like I'm lightin' up a bat for a blunt
I'm stickin' to the script, tryna kick it like a punt
My life is like a movie and I do my own stunts
I'm the Birdman Jr., call me young Baby
Coulda been a killer but Cash Money saved me
Remember I was little but the cash money made me
Big dog bitch, no tramp, no lady
Young ass nigga had a thing for old ladies
But as I got older I began to like 'em younger
To heavens where I brung her, My wing she was under
She said "Daddy they, daddy they, daddy they, daddy they
Daddy they can't do it like you can"
I get chips like Vegas and I am not blue man
Too much ice on my wrist and now I got a blue hand
And if I sing Prostitute she gon' need some new pants
And if I sing Pussy Monster she gon' need a new man
Hello world, I would you all to meet me, her new man
I vow to stay on top of my Somers like Suzanne
And I hustle everyday, everyday, everyday, everyday
Everyday I'm hustlin', fillin' up my cup again
Wit that purple stuff again, I can't get enough of it
Point me in the direction of a swisher and I'm stuffin' it
With that purple stuff again, I'm on some same color shit
After you do Wayne, it's time to do Wayne's brothers bitch
I get money like a fuckin' Wayans brother bitch
I get good with Gorillas and stay away from the rattlesnakes
And the jakes, and the fake, and the hate
Interstate 10, no cops in sight
And I'm coming back with a whole flock tonight
Lord, don't let me get stopped tonight
Or I'mma have to shoot it out with the cops tonight
I swear, and tell the jack boys not tonight
Cause I ain't 'N Sync, but I will Pop tonight
Yeah, that's right, if you ain't got that price
Then go thataway, not a way we can even negotiate
Big money heavyweight, on my way to Heaven's Gate
So if that be them open gates, flow so appropriate
Don't associate me with the bullshit
One wish, I wish a motherfucker would trip
Like a engine, I come from under the hood bitch
But now a nigga gettin' paper like a booklet
They ain't help me with it, but I took it
And now they never get it, never get it, never get it, never get it
Never get it back, yeah that's my word
"Bling-Bling" in the dictionary, yeah that's my word
And for me Ja Rule made it just like Irv
Sometimes I still go through the hood just to kiss my curb
Cause I love that block nigga, Eagle and Apple
Old G's, young G's, leaders and barrels
But God found me like a needle in a barrel
And I'm so ready for war cause I'm a Jesus for the battle
Money on my mind, that's all I think of
Married to the game, never takin my ring off
M.O.B., yeah that's my theme song
Smokin' two L's, rockin' bells like ding-dong
Haha, yeah I got my wings on
Flyer than the rest, I don't rest I keep goin
I just I-G-nore 'em
Like anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway
Anyway it goes, I'mma get gold
And I could see the top, the way I'm climbin this pole
A nigga with the flu ain't rhyming this cold
And nigga I'm hotter than a "fire in the hole"
Steppin' out my shower like a lion in a robe
Eyin' these hoes, iron in my hol-ster
Surp, purp, sure
Let's elevate and get away, accelerate and never hate
Dedicate this, to the blue eyes and blonde hair
I'm on top of my green like a lawn chair
Don't worry, I'm straight like arm hair
Don't worry, I'm straight like combed hair
This world fucked my Pops and I was born here
From the cell to a jet, call it Con-Air
I told my niggas that we would see
Better days yesterday, and today is a better day
Celebrate

[Hook]
I've been standin' here waitin', Mr. Postman
So-o-o patiently
For just a card, or just a letter
Sayin' he's returning home to me, Mr. Postman

[Intro - Lil Wayne]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
That's right darling, aha
Yeah, It's ya baby, baby, ha

[Verse 1 - Lil Wayne]
I got her waitin' on me, she lookin' down the block
She see me walkin' up and she run to the mailbox
She say it feels she's up in a cell block
And I open her cell lock, I'm the (Postman)
Just come to make my mail drop, more masculine than him
I'm nastier than him, I'm passin' her and him
In something faster than them
And then he like, "Damn, there go that bastard again, he the (Postman)"
And she correct him, and I respect her
And he protect her, and she neglect him
And he caress her, and she molest me
He must be weak cuz me, I'm just the (Postman)
And when her man home, I'm the ghostman
Why you think she holdin that pillow close, man?
Why you think she won't open the bathroom door?
She's no whore, she want more of the (Postman)

[Hook] (x2)

[Verse 2 - Lil Wayne]
Girlfriend snatcher, I don't care if you're attached
If that's her, then that's her
And that's me to smash her
Now she hangin' up her high ass skirt, on the (Postman)
Hehe, yeah baby I got that comeback
I'm at your walls like a thumbtack
So Miss Humpback, I know what to do with all that
Fall back, I'll put you a sinner, in the (Postman)
That's big talk for a little guy
But I'm walkin' without reply
She got her legs up, she tryin' to walk in the sky
She callin' for God, and she callin' on I, she say (Postman)
I'm like, "Yeah baby, I'm right here baby
He's here baby!" She like, "Yeah baby!"
Heres a chain letter and some magazines
Keep it clean, he will never think it was the (Postman)

[Hook] (x2)

[Verse 3 - Lil Wayne]
Yeah, she love my gangsta, she feel my swagger
I'm there every week just to give her her package
I pick up her bills and I pick up her taxes
You might find a few stamps on your mattress from the (Postman)
She want young holly grove in a envelope
I'm her private note and you ain't gotta know
I'm her fantasy, she always got letters on the canopy
Waiting for the (Postman)
No postal service, I just got my social workin'
And your girl is lurkin', and this world is dirty
And your girl is nervous, to give me head in the convertible
I'm the (Postman)
Yeah, kind and curtious, she love that in me
She love me in her, and I love that plenty
It never fails, sorry homeboy
But you've got mail, I'm the (Postman)

[Hook fading until end]

[Intro]
Dynamic, articulate, perceptive, courageous, outspoken
Just a few of the adjectives that so in adequately describe

[Verse]
Ahem, Mr. D. Carter
From out the deep water
Thank the lord for my voice, the beat, and the recorder
Now pick an alphabet and you're z'in'
While I'm up tryin' to be the best mc'in
Now let me in, I got my key in
And with them alphabets, I never used p-e-n
But I gotta lotta paper
But a lot ain't enough, so I got an occupation
Gotta bring the bacon, straight to the kitchen table
Homie if your girl pregnant, you should kiss her naval
Cause you probably won't live, to see the motherfuckin' cradle
Your past left a scar, and the future's lookin' fatal
You can't be sorry, you gotta be a savior
Gotta be the bread winner, so go rob the bread maker
When they put your homey to sleep, it's gotta be a wake up
You move in the hood, then you gotta meet the neighbors, damn
Bitch get off me
I'm the little ass nigga, known as big homie
The killas is ballin', the niggas is targets
The snitches is talkin', but this is New Orleans
I love what I got, I'm just livin' the moment
I ain't dyin' just yet, I'll take a shit in the coffin
I already know how to piss in the toilet
I'm tryin to get the pot to piss in in the mornin'
I never fall back, I'd rather go forward
And when I come through you betta duck like Howard
Because I got power, just like a forward
I come through the lane, and straight dunk like Stoude-
Mire, Amare reminds me of I, uh
He's a Pheonix sun and I am fire
Dis-re-spect and I spit fire
To your neck and back like you are Khia
DJ White Owl
Hey
Now would you light that blunt
Promethazine please
Now bitch look at me like a set of t.v.'s
I'm just tryin' to live out my destiny, please
Let me do me, I got the recipe, feed
I'm all about my bread, like a sesame seed
Big dog talkin', check the pedigree, flees (HaHa)
And I ball like every team
And I got, every girl havin' sex with me dreamin'
My heart is in the dirty but the rest of me's clean
I jump for Hollygrove like a trampoline fiend
And I rock ya bells like a tambourine, bing
Jewelry shinin' like blush, Maybelline bling
Red Giants jersey if you know what I mean
Give me Plaxico Burress, number 17
One circle, three fingers is the theme
And young money motherfucka is the team

[Lil Wayne]
Young mula
Cash money mafia, (yea!)
Weed and syrup

[Lil Wayne]
It's weezy baby, (who?)
Strapped like the navy, (what)

Grand daddy purp got me trapped like mazes, (oww!)
Bunch of diamond chains lookin' like a bunch of lasers (yea)
Understand I'm sharper than a fuckin' hellraiser, (raiser)
Bad yellow bitch on my sidekick pager
You know it's goin' down like down goes Frazier, ya dig? (A!)

But I'm from the dirty, keep it dirty like I'm playin' rugby, (ha)
Bitch ride me like a old school huffy, (what?)
Let me see you work your mouth like a fuckin' guppie, (go head)
My leather softer than brand new pair of hush puppies
My top will leave if I decide to hit the punch button, (hit it)
It's young weezy, how could I ever quit stuntin'?
Get mad, I'mma get money

[Hook 2x]

Heavyweight, I sell snow by the ski slope... come and get some
And the cars got engines like speed boats
Throw dough away like tickets to a free show, (uh)
You outside getting' re-poed, (whoa)

And all the chicks come to me for wood like Home Depot

Cats love it, boosie broads deny it
They step to tha store to buy it, go home and bump it in private
And you know me, I'm low key
Nothin special, just a pinky ring, a Roley, a lil ice on tha bezel
And when I drive by, I can't help doin tha drive-by

Shoot at the driver side knock his body to the backseat
Stop, pause, make them Dominique Dawes
Flippin bitch niggas when the shotty's go off. (hey)

I got niggas that play all out skirts of the field
So get caught up in that place and your brain get spilled
Oh it's a game but it's a game of life or death
You lose and can't continue if you get dome checked
You get blues it's all what duck gonna be next
Come in that water and get wet

Cause I be coming with the top down
Letting them know how the chop sound

Assault rifle with a drum and beam totter
38 with a speed loader in my holster
Mac uzi achine with a strap around my shoulder
But if I pop my trunk I'm might just set off a damn explosion

Already was ballin, but now we ballin harder
Picture: bitches can't take me

And it's plain and simple
Won't change cause it's natural

Pull up at the Grammy awards in six Hummers
Leave the Grammy awards with six womens
And make her stop at the gas station for six rubbers

Don't try to end it or you wouldn't get better, what

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
La, la, la, la

Short, cute hot boy that rapper Cash Money
Standin out the roof of my car
And flash hundreds
Take your girl to the mall
Spend a G like that's nothin'
She lay on the floor
Open up the spot
Take off her drawers, and "let me see the cock"
"Don't stop" Lil Weezy, Weezy ain't nothin' nice
Baguettes in my Jesus Christ, nothin' but ice
When they see me at night
Behind tints I stay high
Snatch yo' wife
Run up in her with the K-Y
But it's on man
Ever since I was born Wayne
Nigga get out of line
I get dirty like John Wayne
I'm bout stuntin', flossin'
Whatever come wit it
And I don't shoot guns
Unless they have a drum wit it
At first they wasn't wit it
Thought that I was jokin
Now I got 'em all payin attention like they owe it (Whaa?)

[Chorus: B.G.]
Me and my click be sizzlin', hot steamin'

[Outro: B.G.]
(Lil Wayne Talking)
I never felt better, Never have, Never will, (Holla)
I mean all I see is money, I got a C-Note between my eyes, (Its Real)
Please feel me, Sqad Up nigga, (For Real)
I'ma dig deep folk, Dig deep dogg, (Its Real)
Now listen, Now what you is?

(Verse 1)
I am what you call a survivor, like trouble with drama
But I recover with power, and love it with honor
Discovered as a son of a problem
Remember smugglin powder throught the doors of my high school
To force up they nostril, 'til it got full
But now they pop for a pill
Lil one here's what's up, Drugs could kill
But drugs could heal
If ya, ahh, ill for that good feel
And it feels good when them fields pull
We wheels quarters through the real raw parts of the streets
My hearts in the streets, So watch what ya step
When ya run from the gunfire of Glocks and Tech's
Specials and Pumps, Vests is for chumps
Eat ya chests for lunch, munch
Young country dude, hunt ya down with tools
Repsect my presence, I step with weapons
You fall in seconds
Its all in the code of the streets, we go by it and stop from it
Real nigga talk, No frontin
Heh
(Chorus)
Do you understand the words that are comin out of my mouth?
If ya dont its because I'm speakin real nigga
Real nigga, This here is real nigga talk
Real nigga talk dogg, I hope you feel me
Let me talk to you dogg, You gotta feel me
I hope you feel me, You gotta feel me
Listen

(Verse 2)
Chrome's hidden inside of my tires
You should see the size of my tires
Ridin' on Mark McGwires, I spark the fire
Got me higher than a late flight
From L.A. to New York twice in the same night
Got some shit in my bag to make ya vein white, Cocaine pipe
Watch homie's brains get rain whipped
Thats the type of sight to make Wayne right
They sayin life is short but money is long, And money is life
So for now I'm runnin the lights, in the 600 with pipes
Hop out, Collar Polo, and under the stripes is something that bites
We will be thuggin for life
And can't nothin pursuede or change us
We gangstas, we live it, I'm in the post without a Pippen
But fuck it, I'm just shootin when I can't move
Who'da knew I can't lose
And truthfully through the loot that's Young Money Entertainment
You get it arranged then holla at me
(Chorus w/ minor variations)

(Verse 3)
I burn in the winter, stand up in the fall
Stand up in the stands, and stand up for my dogs
Them asses I will spall, the plan is too ball
But the stuff I got in my pants cuff
Is enough to make'em put my hands on the wall
Work, push on the strip, I'm pushin the whip
Fat back pockets, my cushion if I'm lookin to slip
I'm hookin ya lip, If ya play hookie with my chips
Put that ass kitchen, bitch, when ya cookin that shit
Dodge hoes, jukin and shit
Cause I can see beautiful women, but I'm not lookin for shit
I'm from the hood where you tooken for shit
So you gotta take the shit, and make ya shit
I had to bring home the bacon bits
Cause Pop's was fakin, and he left a nigga bakin shit
Now my heart ache and itch, from all the flagrant shit
I gotta take in, and thug out
Real nigga talk, bitch

(Chorus w/ minor variations)

[Verse 1]
Uh, Slick-dickie on my one and two
So sweet what I did with a Honey-Doo
No pun intended, no one offended
You just bet' not leave yo' girlfriend unattended
I holla at her, holla but don't scream
I ask her "Why sleep if we don't dream?
So let's stay awake, besides, dreams are fake"
She say "Ooh you deep?" I ask "How deep can you take?"
Hehe, my loveboat in ya lake
Baby can I stick my lovenote in ya gate
Hehe, read and weep
Sincerely fuckin' yours, Weezy F B

[Hook - Lloyd]

[Verse 2]
I prefer that you would just call me

And, I be runnin' this shit like the Flanker
Blackcard Banker, hanker in the backpocket
And I wear them skinny jeans, so you see my fat wallet
That's right I'm a big shot, call me " Little Cannon Ball
Mr. "Get up in your girl mouth", like some Ambersol
Hip-hop president, ain't my girl elequant

And my chucks are old, but I swear to you my flanel new

Bitch ass nigga, I'm gone like my Lam' roof, Young Money!

And I'm about to get mine
But these dying

You ain't got to worry about none of these other niggas
You needs to be worried about when Juvi comin to get ya
Look, I make a phone call to the big dog
Y'all bitches better handle y'all business before I hit y'all
Even though a nigga rich and I rock ice
I still bust a nigga head on the block aight?

[Chorus: Juvenile & Lil Wayne]
It's enemy turf that I'm on
So I'ma play it how it go

[Interlude: Lil' Wayne]
My big brother Juvi
Both hit tha blocks
Strapped up with the Uzis

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
What, What, La

Cause I ride or die
Cash Money Hot Boy, bless me when I'm gone
But until then, load up the chrome, cause it's on
I been bout it
Put a boot up in my lip and put my thirty up in a clip
I drop the top and then I dip I hit his block and make 'em flip
And I be full of that trash
I be the first one to jump out the jag bust at 'em fast
Watch the bullets chop off the head
And make 'em fall in the grass
One move they all die
Lil Weezy a small fry, but gorilla when it's war time
Y'all better learn
When this nigga shoot it'll be all hell
Well then let 'em burn
Hold 'em fo' ransom, hear me smart boy
Seven churn and I be damn if I let 'em go
If I don't get my dough
Then hell will be all blowin'
Til I R.I.P., C.M.B. I be

Nigga, I'm H.B. for real

[Chorus: Juvenile & Lil Wayne]
It's enemy turf that I'm on

So I'ma play it how it go
Cock the hollow points
And tote my black calico
My lil' brother Weezy

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
All I know is the streets
And how to strap up
When it's time shoot it
Cock yo' heaters
Tie up yo' bags
It's time to do it
Blaze the blunt
Shut off the lights
And cut down the music
Roll down the windows
Turn the corner
And let loose with the bbbbrrrrrr
If ya don't know now
Then ya never will learn
You can play with Lil' Wayne
And yo' block get burned
You must love to go swimmin
Cause tha water gets deeper
See I bust you wide open
And take 'ya daughter with me
Here come the beat boy
Shoot out the street lights
Time to bring on the heat boy
If you ain't really wit it
Then you better get back
I open yo' chest
And make it look just like a wet cat
This is a death trap
I'mma a guerilla and I mean it
Leave ya' head still in a beanin'
Lyin' on the cement
Calicoe steamin'
Red dot beamin', dressed up suspicious
Play with Lil Weezy, you'll be dinner for the fishes

[Chorus: Juvenile & Lil Wayne]
It's enemy turf that I'm on
So I'ma play it how it go

Strap -Up (Gun Cocks)

[Verse 1]
Alot of niggas better move out
Cause here I come with my click
With the tools out
All of a sudden all these cowards
Startin to spook out
It's warfare a buncha of niggas
Bout to lose out
It's time to load up them thangs
Hit the spot run in his house
And make 'em show up then thangs
Take 'em in the room go in his pockets
And then blow up his brains
No matter the weather
Rain, snow, sleet, or hail
I'mma slangin' that metal
So tell 'em niggas in yo' hood
To get it together
Cause I'm with tola, mario
And we down for whatever
Never underestimate or you goin under, see
Y'all can keep playin with Lil Wayne
But that lil' boy trouble
And plus dis shorty be full, wodie
Be scorin bundles, then start wildin'
Hit the block and let his toys rumble
And it go ratter-tatter
Ya be suprised how niggas scatter
When the M-1 shatter
And everybody on the block
They get bout' ten in they bladder

[Chorus]
Tell 'em lights off
Mask on
Creep silent
Your life's gone
We done left the block quiet
Tell 'em lights off
Mask on
Creep silent
Your life's gone
We done left the block quiet

[Verse 2]
Look, look
When it's time to ride
It ain't no time to play
It could be time to die
At any time of the day
And i'll be godammit
If I let a nigga steel me
It will not happen
Ima fire about a hundred and fifty shots at 'em
And got my Glocks rammin'
Leave a nigga spot damaged
That's how the beat made us
I chief three blunts
So I can get a head rush
Then come around the corner
And your whole day crush
I'm sick and tired
Niggas choose to test the water
They get hit and die
Some of 'em scared of man slaughter
So they stay inside
And watch they partners get lit up
And then they ask why?
That's cause you played wit' me
They could'nt of known im'a guerilla
Drama stayed with me
Ran in his home went to kill him
Took his head with me
You better get it right or keep it right
Or lose your whole town
Tell em' lights off
It's about to go down

[Chorus]
Tell 'em lights off
Mask on
Creep silent
Your life's gone
We done left the block quiet
Tell 'em lights off
Mask on
Creep silent
Your life's gone
We done left the block quiet

[Verse 3]
Massacre all these streets; block it off
Lil Wayne is in yo hood
With something like a rocket dog
And I'm after ya
I don't pass beef
I stop at all
That boy got a head on his shoulders
I knock it off
I'm highly intoxicated mixing krystelle and vodka
Somebody call the doctor
Cause my chopper done went blocka, knocka
Nigga out the way man
I'm sorry but us guerillas we can't stay tamed, say it man
Are you ready, ready
Ready for warfare Wayne, Turk, Juve, and BGeezy they all there
We all flare, don't care, dog they all tear
Give the guns to the one with the long hair
Dem block burner
It gets quiet they see the rims twenty four seventy
(Breathes)they breathe heavlily
Bullets they come steadily
You better stay off the block
Cause you might fall
You better stay off the block
Cause the lights off

[Chorus]
Tell 'em lights off
Mask on
Creep silent
Your life's gone
We done left the block quiet
Tell 'em lights off

[Verse 1: Lil' Wayne]
Got a early call from Kisha, Kisha wanted me to meet her
She said she thought it was time to make the relationship get deeper
Said cool then I'm gon' beep ya
What would be a good time to reach ya
She said what about ten but l thought eleven would be sweeter
Cuz she wanted me to see her, said I needed a teaser
But shit who got the keys to my Beamer
I rolled me up a blunt and got the Cristal out the freezer
I hopped in the two seater, left Nae-Nae with Macita
Vroooom speed up run faster than a cheetah
Only thing on my mind is how l'm gone get all in this cheap slut
Should I use a rubber cause I heard she was a freak but
They say she keep it cleaned up, but I don't want HIV bruh
I drop my top on da drop-top (I'm bout ready to meet her), her name's on my beeper
I called her on the Nokia
And told her come pick me up
As soon as I got in the house she got on her knees and grabbed my penis
Ate it up like some peanuts
I said "oooohhhh Kisha"
Chopped off like a millimeter
She drunk it like a 2 liter
She blow like a pro, oh no I got to keep her
Told her l'd be back about eleven I'm gone creep her
But don't go you to sleep, I got some more meat to feed ya

[Verse 2: Turk]
Now I'm hot, I wonder what's up with Kisha tonight
I'm gone give her a call, see if it's alright
For me to dip through, she said it's all gravy
First I got to get somebody to watch my baby
(Baby) it's all good, I'll be there in a minute
But she didn't know I knew Wayne was already hittin' it
Soon as I pull up I see my dog runnin out
He saw me peepin at him, but he didn't open his mouth
Soon as he pulled off
I knocked on the door
Sayin to myself look at this dog ass ho
Its cool what you do
You know I like my shit sucked
For you to swallow the cum and put ice on my nuts
Caught my nut, now I'm up
I'm gone holla at ya Kittie
I got studio tonight, me and da H B'eezeys
I can't be late, I'm gon' see ya when I could
Hit Juve on the hip, let him know it was all good

[Verse 3: Juvenile]
Ooohh Oooh there she go, on the way to the corner store
Lil Turk let me know, we done fucked the same bitch before
Say lil mama where you headed, she told me forget it
Hop in the back seat of my car and she spread it
Say baby slow down I don't wanna fuck ya first
I want you to suck on my dick until my nuts will burst
She was a fool with it
She said she had a good teacher she went to school with it
Cuz she knew what to do with it
I didn't want the bitch to have my car all smellin
So I took her in the alley with some K Y Jelly
Pull your shorts and your draws down to your knees
Put the rubber on the dick handle that please
I hit it she sucked it
Hit it she sucked it and sucked it
I got tired of the pussy and mouth and I said fuck it
Hey ho, I gotta ride
My baby moma beepin me and she stay way on the other side
I hit B.Geezy on the celly
And told him that the bitch was all good up in the alley
Not the telly

[Verse 4: B.G.]
This ho don't know I know she fucked three of my dogs
I caught her walkin out the alley down by the mall
She fucked Wayne, Juve, Turk, I know she ain't got no walls
But they told me she'd do a damn job on the balls
She provided the number later on gave her a call
Told her what I was thinkin and she was down with it all
Can't deny it she was a fool kept that dick standin tall
What she'll do a nigga, should be against the law
That's how Hot Boys play it when we finish we toss
Baby when you finish Manny Fresh down the hall
After this episode that ho won't be able to walk
After two or three steps that ho might just fall
Now you know then Hot Boys sad ha
Get in the bitch head, end up doing somethin bad ha
Kisha got did right yeah
Fucked the whole Cash Money click all in one night yeah

Hoes love my grill, hoes love my crib

Got a Cash Money Millionaires 'cross my back
You don't want funk with me.. I don't think you do, nigga

Catch me at tha shop, I will.. be.. there
And my prices stay low, I keep.. it.. there
And if you want it raw, I got.. it.. right.. here

Who am I? Lil' Wayne, man

Was taught that it's him or me
I pop at bustas quick

And always.. bustin' gats
Your girl legs.. pumpin' back
Now how you... lovin' that?

[Chorus: Juvenile]

But if you ain't scared, then throw your sets up

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Listen, listen

Raw and nasty
Tha AK, I pack it
Believe I'm 'bout that action
Slash a busta like a fraction
I'm on that yolla
Standin' on tha corner with one sleeve over my shoulder
Ride on your block, I see a dozen of weak jerks
Now it's time for your momma to order a dozen of T-shirts
For only half-a brick
I'll blast tha fifth
And I ain't gon' stop shootin' 'til I jam tha clip
Yeah, I'm a small creeper, what
But it's about to get ugly
Ya'll betta call people up
I'm about ta start shovin' my sawed-off between your guts
Wayne 'bout to (cugghh-gghh-gghh) ball people up
Ya'll betta duck
When it get real, they hide from me
But, all them bustas 'bout ta get killed, I'm tired of it
Man, I'm thuggin' 'til the day I-I die, cousin
Weezy Wee, let 'em burn, bring the fire truck in (Whoop!)

[Chorus: Juvenile]

[Verse 3: Lil' Wayne]
Nigga, let it be known
I'll come blow up your home
Take a few blunts to tha dome
And.. show up alone
Just me and my.. flame-torch
Wayne start.. danger
Walked with my head down like a stranger, and banged ya
Burnin' off that Hennesy
Some-a ya'll be feminine
Bounce in with a twitch
Leave 'em crawlin' out a ditch
God damn... son of a shhh!.. Don't speak
I cocked that, and let it go, tssss!.. Give 'em heat
Your cheese, I got.. ta.. get.. paid
I'm goin' all out, no matter what.. it.. takes
I.. was.. raised.. up on.. that.. paper
Kill-for-the-scrill was.. in.. my.. nature
Tote M1's and keep.. tha.. block.. hot
Sell raw coke to keep.. my.. Glock.. hot
Never add taxes to.. my.. price, man
And if a boy play, I ride.. at.. night, man

Huh, huh, huh, huh

[Intro]
Look, look, look

[Verse 1]
A young nigga screamin fuck the world and let 'em die
Behind tints, tryna' duck the world and smokin ride
Got my bandanna 'round my head and pants to my feet
And got my eyes fire red and Glock on my seat
I'm tryna' stay under intoxication
Cause I lost my father, and got a daughter, plus I'm on probation
I'm drinkin liquor like it's water, gettin pissy drunk
And stayin away from them lil' broads they tryna get me stomped keep a chopper in the trunk and my heat on my waistline
Duckin the law, cause I ain't tryna' do no Fed time
Sometimes I just wish I could be away
But I gotta take care of Ginae and keep Ms. Cita straight
So I just maintain the struggle and I keep tryin
But how can I when my closest people keep dyin'
I ain't lyin that the law tryna' bust my clique
But I scream fuck the world man, I'm too young for this

[Chorus]
Look, I don't curse, but in this verse man fuck the world
I lost my father to a gun and made a little girl
And I'm still thuggin' wit' my niggas tryna' keep it real
And I'm still doin' for my mother and I'm payin' bills
Look, I don't curse, but in this verse man fuck the world
I lost my father to a gun and made a little girl
And I'm still thuggin' wit' my niggas tryna' keep it real
And I'm still doin' for my mother and I'm payin' bills

[Verse 2]
Give me a cigarette, my nerves bad
The Feds said they heard that I know where them birds at
And my old lady say she saw me with anotha brizzah
And some a the boys shot up my block so now I gotta kill 'em
And teachers keep tellin' my momma that I'm gettin' worse
And now she trippin talkin 'bout I need to be in church
And my lil' girl whole family tryna lie in court
Tryna' put me, a child, on child support
And whole family deny me of what I do cause I'm a 'thug and stuff'
Plus, my niggas keep fallin to them drugs and stuff
That dope got these niggas meltin' away
Man they got clowns right around me, killin' they self everyday
We keep fightin' but they so strong
I know it's hard but don't give up baby hold on
Just keep ya fate, count blessings, and wodie keep ya trust
And grab ya nuts and let 'em know that we don't give a fuck
We don't give a fuck

[Chorus]
Look, I don't curse, but in this verse man fuck the world
I lost my father to a gun and made a little girl
And I'm still thuggin' wit' my niggas tryna' keep it real
And I'm still doin' for my mother and I'm payin' bills
Look, I don't curse, but in this verse man fuck the world
I lost my father to a gun and made a little girl
And I'm still thuggin' wit' my niggas tryna' keep it real
And I'm still doin' for my mother and I'm payin' bills

[Verse 3]
I mean the world just ain't gon' never change
So I just keep my head up and my nuts, let 'em hang
Dawg I swear it's very rough out here for the youngstas
Like everybody against me cause I'm a young thug
Dear Rabbit, why they have to kill Rabbit?
But I'mma keep you alive, nigga, I'm Lil Rabbit
That's why this lil' nigga be buggin like it's no tomorrow
I only can depend on macita and C-M-R
I try my best to make it through the night and live today
But I'm upset so I'm steady wipin' tears away
And police got me under surveillance when and wherever
Wrecking they brains, tryna' figure where I'm gettin that cheddar
I tell my family just leave me a-damn-lone
I can handle all'a my business, this lil' man grown
But I try to forget about it and just stand strong
But if everythang was cool I wouldn't write this damn song
Fuck the world

[Chorus]
Look, I don't curse, but in this verse man fuck the world
I lost my father to a gun and made a little girl
And I'm still thuggin' wit' my niggas tryna' keep it real
And I'm still doin' for my mother and I'm payin' bills
Look, I don't curse, but in this verse man fuck the world
I lost my father to a gun and made a little girl
And I'm still thuggin' wit' my niggas tryna' keep it real
And I'm still doin' for my mother and I'm payin' bills
Look, I don't curse, but in this verse man fuck the world
I lost my father to a gun and made a little girl
And I'm still thuggin' wit' my niggas tryna' keep it real

Hollygrove 17th the hood where I was raised in (What, what, what)
Niggas bustin' heads and, runnin', duckin' Feds and (What)
Rocks under they tongues and, kis under they beds and
Hood full of real niggas, 24/7 hustlers

Ain't no love for no busta, no fear for no coward
No respect for no slut, and no money without power
We keepin' niggas hotter (Ughh) nasty and sour
Pile up in the Eddie Bauer and "blocka" at every hour
Some niggas like that powder, foldin' up with that drain
Some like that weed or that dope and some shoot it up in they veins (Oh)
From the home of that 'caine, jackin' and crackin' brains
Broadcastin' live from Tha Block, it's Lil' Wayne (Who it is?)

[Chorus: Juvenile, B.G. & Lil' Wayne]
Nigga, you got that yayo? Well cook something, nigga

It's time to floss, bring the big bodies on dubs out
And they got quarters, halves and birds in that one house (I got it, I got it)
It's all good in the hood, hustlin' like it's legal
Soon as you get it hot (Skrrt!) there go them people
Break up the block and hit the cut by the corner sto'
End up in Ms. Taylor backyard, be quiet, she on the porch
This every day at the spot where niggas murder off top, boy
It's the spot where they got fire girls and hot boys
We don't know what be goin' 'cause we so blunted from trees
And we'll be round ya all day (Why?) 'til we "400 Degreez"
And you see when it get dark, nobody be on the porch
They got a nigga got on a scarf, he flippin' out off that raw
Betta stay in yo' car and make sure (beep beep) your door is locked
'Cause this ain't nothin' proper, 'cause Tha Block issss hot

[Chorus: Juvenile, B.G. & Lil' Wayne]

[Verse 3: Lil' Wayne]
See watch your step on my set, gotta walk like, talk like
We done shot out all the street lights so you can't see who we be like
And we like, to dress in all black up in my residence
Ain't got on no suits, cause we ain't tryin' to be presidents
And ever since the coke drought, niggas been on a trip y'all
So you better watch what y'all playin' with cause a nigga will try to flip y'all
They hit y'all, jam you up and put a gun to your jug
(Hah) Catch your breath, now (Chk) catch a slug
It's street smarts, plenty niggas that keep sparks
When the heat starts, ain't nobody got sweethearts
Darling we sharks, you could come try to cheap talk
We cut your week short, them lil' boys don't give a damn
Go all out for that cake, won't hesitate to kill a man
Run in his house and kidnap the nigga, him and his fam
Tie em up, put em in the vans then put a gat in his jaws
(Kiss) One move, blow his cactuses off

[Chorus: Juvenile, B.G. & Lil' Wayne]
Nigga, you got that yayo? Well cook something, nigga

I know it's hard tryna make it but it's gon' be alright (Alright Dog)

[Verse 3]
I know you know I'm thinkin' 'bout ya, you be on my mind
I know ya see me everytime, watchin yo' lil boy shine
And I know that ya see I put out my own CD
And picture this, your little boy even on TV
But I swear it's off the heezy, Weezy
Say it's cool, you can believe me, I like how they treat me
I'm doin' what ya say, don't let a nigga try me
And I don't let a fine, pretty broad get by me
Don't let nothin' pull me off track from my hobby
Oh yeah, and I don't leave my room sloppy
But the same thang make ya laugh, make ya cry
And everybody that ya love it's like they have to die
I pray to the Lord everyday and ask him why
And ask him to bless your soul everytime I pass by
I know he doin' it, and leavin all the love to me
And I'mma prove it, and show ya daddy, it's up to me

[Chorus: Turk & (Lil Wayne)]
It's up to you, Wayne, (I know) nigga, stay up and keep it real
It's all on you, man, my nigga, I know how you feel
Just be strong, cause everythang gon' be alright (Alright Dog)
I know it's hard tryna make it but it's gon' be alright (Alright Dog)
It's up to you, Wayne, (I know) nigga, stay up and keep it real
It's all on you, man, my nigga, I know how you feel

I know it's hard tryna make it but it's gon' be alright (Alright Dog)

[Outro: Lil Wayne & Turk]

Shawty I don't need no hook for this shit
I'm just tryina hit it-hit it like I can't
And I don't need no hook for this shit
I'm just tryina hit it-hit it like I can't miss
Shawty I don't need no hook for this shit
I'm just tryina hit it-hit it like I can't

(Evil Empire)

(Verse 1, Lil Wayne)
Ah-ah-ah-ahem
Ah-ah-ah-ahem
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah hahaha
Ok now shawty take yo clothes off
And I'mma hit it-I'ma hit it 'til we dose off
And when we wake up, I'mma hit it 'til we dose off
She say her pussy isn't stoppin
I'm like, if that's the case, I'mma beat it like Johnny Cochran
I'm a rocket like Houston, I'm leanin
Ain't nothin between me and you, but this bikini
Now can it I take it off ya?
Rub my tongue across ya
I do it so right, she call me an author
But I am just a Carter
Yeah, I'm just a Carter
Straight to the powder
Yeah, that's what I brought her
Man I swear, I'mma make her cheer like victory
Shawty shawty, you can get speared like Brittany, literally
(Hook, Lil Wayne)
And I don't need no hook for this shit
I'm just tryina hit it-hit it like I can't miss
Shawty I don't need no hook for this shit
I'm just tryina hit it-hit it like I can't

[Intro: Lil Wayne & (DJ Raj Smoove)]
Raj Smoove (Yeah)
The greatest DJ in the world (Yeah)
Ooh boy (Yes!)
We about to say a prayer for all our loved ones
I'mma call this one "Real Rap"
Anybody you lost, put 'em on your heart
Because this rap is real, you know?
Light it up for 'em
I hope you ain't too tired to cry
And I hope you know
You ain't never too alive to die, heh

[Verse: Lil Wayne]
Listen, I grew up where the people call them people on us
Think we slangin', but we just got beepers on us
Grindin' all day like we got sleep insomnia
Living like the videos, write a treatment on us
Stuck in the hood like they poured cement on us
Ghetto bird still shittin' on us
Government still quittin' on us
Lost a few homies, and the grief's still sittin' on us
So we got their names written on us
White folks still spittin' on us
And them bitchass police K9's teeth still grittin' on us
But we smoke, ashes still gettin' on us
Older bitches still hittin' on us
I remember well, Beezy rolled a L
Beezy ain't here — Where's Beezy at? Beezy got killed
And that was my nigga, I go way back with my nigga
But I know that's how it happened, my nigga
Shit is much deeper than this rappin', my nigga
But now they all rappin', my niggas
So now I must make it happen
So I'mma play the captain, sailboat flappin', my nigga
No fingers, I'm snappin'
Happy for my nigga Lil Tagus
'Cause even though we couldn't, the Lord saved him
Last time we seen him was when Katrina hated
Shit, found his body like a month later
Rest in peace, boy
He was a East boy, and so was Wessy West
He was a good nigga, so I know he blessed
And his daughter is a princess
This shit is harder than a bench press
But I'mma keep goin'
And I swear I got a lump in my throat
But I'mma keep on pumpin' the flow
So if I cry, don't stop the beat
I feel like my heart just stopped a beat
My nigga Lil Derek was quick to cop a ki
Either that or load the gat and go pop a G
And because of that he's just a name in a rhyme of mine
I pray his family and his momma's fine
So much shit just sit on this mind of mine
I think about it all the time, I drink about it all the time
I smoke back to back
'Cause if my thoughts got to me, I'd be in this rap
Or I'd be in the can
Thank God I had dreams of being the man
Yeah, and fuck a man with a badge
'Cause he ain't shit to a man on the edge
The 5-0 killed Naudy, good boy dead
Man, you would've thought they killed cornbread
Shot him up, face down on the lawn
Not to mention, with his handcuffs on
Not to mention, they had plain-clothes on
And the complaint goes on
But nobody do nothing about it
The jail house and the morgue is too fuckin' crowded
And hate is at an all time high
Everybody gotta hate, it's like a fuckin' iPod
Shit, and they tried to burn my Phantom up
But I got my gun license, haha, I got my hammers up
I'm ready to shoot like a camera —
Stay still motherfucker
I'mma have to write my will this summer
'Cause if they don't kill me, I'mma kill this summer
Yeah, and you can put that on my late Father
Or my late Grandmother, Miss Mercedes Carter
Or my Grandfather, Larry Balsock
The old man hustled 'til his heart stopped
And all I know of my real Pops is that he had money
No bank account, that brown paper bag money
Yeah, he might hit me off with a little brag money
But the nigga still wouldn't be a dad for me
But look how I turned out, I hope he glad for me
But that's why when I see him I acts mad funny
'Cause he's a joke to me
Don't message, don't call, don't talk to me
It's just me and my mama, how it's supposed to be
And I make sure she paid like she wrote for me
And I know she gets all hope from me
And I don't ever wanna see her mope for me
Hopefully, but, truthfully
There is a day that's due for me
But we gon' pray that it's as far as the future sees
You are listening to the future Weezy F. Baby
Amen

[Outro: DJ Raj Smoove]
Rest in peace to my cousin Kim Carbo
My nigga Vick

Pull up on the corner, windows down on the space ship
Ballin' so hard man, I deserve a Naismith award, applaud
Like I'm on stage bitch, married to the money (Evil Empire)
I just skipped the engagement
I'm fly, my ally is the bird game
The top flew off of my whip, bird brains
Third lane in the back of the first lane
I need Rihanna's "Umbrella" for this purple rain
Earth to wayne, call it Wayne's World
Money money, call 'em Wayne's girls
Young money gangstas
Runnin this shit like a flanker
Ain't a clique like mine
We click like 9's
And we get higher than six by nines
The stove ain't watch, cuz it's my time
Bathroom swagger ain't shit like mine
(Hook) 

[Jim Jones]

(Verse 2, Jim Jones)
Took ballin to a phenomenon (What else?)
I caught niggas snorin with no pajamas on (Section C)
Talkin slick, who am I to reply?
So fly, you would have to shoot me out of the sky (I got my target)
Mayday-mayday, they said he parachuting
The air got polluted when I had the Maserati (Vroom)
But now I'm gettin green, I'm thinkin higher than Ferrari (Yes)
You should call me god body (Learn ya lessons)
Fresh to def to the arm legga legga (And)
All white Nikes, check the bomb was venetta (And)
One jet, I can change the weather
Lookin all gully in my herm-ay skully (Damn)
Threw on a scarf, look with a different Louie (Whatever)
Niggas can't touch me like Jim had the cooties (He got the cooties!)
Stunt so hard that niggas wanna sue me
The rap money good, but wait 'til I get to movies!
(Hook) 

[NOE]

(Verse 3, NOE)
Listen, who kid? It's the new kid
The ber-berry boss, asterisk on the shoe, kid (Fly)
The Baltimore Buccaneer, the explorer
In Tom Ford linen and a crispy fedora
Caught throwin a tilt
Thought I was the man 'til I puff the open sex, her ass dropped on the silk
The nocturnal hustla, product of the evening
Gritty, runnin through New York City like the thieving
Time to up the ante
Pockets uncanny
Bulging Kim pussy pressed against the panty
Now I'm in Vermont, and done funny in Miami
Duckin rat packs like Sinatra and Sammy
Trust me, I've been underneath the tap
Doin time, pressin jeans underneath the mat
Waitin on feet up
Now I hate to speed up
My g, you wanna ride?
You gotta raise the front seat up
(Hook)
No one on the corner have swagger like us
Swagger like us
Swagger-swagger like us
No one on the corner have swagger like us

Swagger-swagger like us
No one on the corner have swagger like us
Swagger like us
Swagger-swagger like us
No one on the corner have swagger like us
Swagger like us
Swagger-swagger like us

(Verse 4, Twista)
T the best!
I styled it with that category
Others got a lot of stories
All these other rappers bore me
They say Twista, won't you take this to your laboratory
No ones in the category
Talk about your swagger for me
Nobody fuckin wit Twist'
I be havin to fill the irrelevant
And then I be killin 'em off with my ana'
It's like I'm a scorpion, like I'm an elephant
Fill 'em with venom and then I'mma stomp 'em into oblivion
Like I'm a million, like I'm a billion
Like I'm a trillion, I'm a gazillion, hey!
Hit 'em in the body with a millimeter then I gotta put 'em in the dirt
Put me in the middle of the money, cuz I know I gotta get it
So I know I gotta work
Grab them since '91, when I came at them differently
I am the first
They be comin and travelin with the dead bodies of rappers
And I am the hearse
Twiiiiistaaaa
I'mma get money killa, stay full of swagger
And that eat'cha beat'cha
Twiiiiistaaaa
I got that horror flow
Call it the creature feature

(Hook)
No one on the corner have swagger like us

No one on the corner have swagger like us

Ho I'm so fuckin' fly, my eyes are aviaters
I'm stuck at the top floor in the elevater
Cause I'm high, dumb high
Nigga, I could look into the sun's eyes
Young guy, but rich though
And I keep a rag on me like a 64, like a 64
You know I got that bounce

Okay I'm Terminater, you niggas Minnie Mouse

Have a real nigga feelin' like he's so fucked up
Have a fake nigga feelin' like he's so bucked up
There go the weed man, spitta back the truck up
There go the lean man, thugga we done lucked up
I mix the two dro by my bitch and then we rough fuck
I leave a Crego to the lot and pick a Jag' up
If you was in my shoes, nigga you could brag cuz
Weezy Wee got me, Baby he got me
Young Money, Cash Money, bitch that's my posse
40. cals with brokes, safeties just try to rob me
Million dollar man Ted DiBiase

Shit'll get ugly than New York from the Flavor Of Love

Chorus Repeat 9X

Now we lean (lean) out our minds (out our minds)
Rest In Peace to DJ Screw, we on the grind (on the grind)

You niggas haterholics
I'm just the recipe
So you can save the garlic
I'm like a set of keys
I'm bout to get it started
I smoke them Beverly
Hills, from California
Them bitches after me
So I put that paddle on 'em
She rode my dick
And said she shoulda put a saddle on him
I watch out for them snakes
Listen for that rattle, homie
And I ain't got a clique
I got a cattle, homie

Kickin' back just being boo
I'm talking foreign money
Like a European dude
Yeah I'm heavy, man
So you should reconsider
I hit you one time
Fuck up your equilibrium
I got rhythm
Yeah, I got soul y'all
I travel all around the world like a postcard
My flow cold
Fuck around and get a cold sore
I got this bitch on lock like a closed door
Weezy's real, them other niggas folklore
I'm connected, I got more hoods than a coat store
I'm successful, I got more shit than you can hope for
And I got through that water like a boat oar
Young, Carter the name
Baby boy rising like hot water and 'caine

[Bridge]
Whip it, stretch it, and flip it
Re-up, stretch it and flip it
Re-up, stretch it and flip it
Re-up, stretch it and flip it

[Verse 2]
Re-up
We up in the club, we up in the club
Money running like water, bitch get up in the tub
I'm up in the club, she up in the club, he up in the club
Now she can't leave so we fuck in the club
Am I lucky or what
Playboy rabbit
And I like big tongues, like skateboard fashion
I got more girls than the Playboy mansion
I bet I serve 'em up like my name Pete Sampras
And a nigga drink like the late Fred Sandford
And a nigga smoke like there is no cancer
And I know this world is so cold and deceivin'
But I keep my head up like my nose is bleedin'
Yeah, and until that chosen evenin'
I'mma be screaming Apple and Eagle
Yeah, that's right, Apple and Eagle
Hollygrove 17, I won't leave you
Nope, and this is just the preview
But I am already working on the sequel
Fuck with me wrong
I'll fuck with your home
Like a letter to the wife saying your husband is gone
Like Muslim I'm calm
But like Muslim I'll bomb
And beat the track up like a hundred arms
I'm funky like underarms
The engineer's recording a thunderstorm
My hunger forms
Then ring the alarms
Tha Carter 2 was nice
But the third times a charm

[Outro]
Weezy Fuckin'

[Intro: Raj Smoove]
We now return you to your regular scheduled programming
I'm bout to bring out the whole Young Money fam right now
We gon' set this shit off, my nigga Mac Maine for president
G-series out in the streets right now
Hit a nigga on MySpace or somethin' man
Holla

(Sample)
Day dreamin'
I fell asleep beneath the flowers
For a couple of hours
On a beautiful day

Day dreamin'!

[Hook]
You already know
What the fuck is poppin'
Baby I'm what's hoppin-a
I keep a Zip-Lock bag full of 'Dro
And I keep a bad bitch wit' me on the low
I'mma be a G until the day that I go
I can feel it in the air
The reaper's comin' slow

[Verse 1]
Shhh...
I can hear the reaper comin'
But I ain't scared, oh, no, no, I ain't runnin'
Now when I walk past, you might see an extra shadow
Angels on my shoulders are usin' me for a battle
Spiritual warfare, good versus evil
I even fought the demons as a semen
Yes I was brought there, cursed ever since my day of birth
Got a Heaven-sent flow, though it's Hell on Earth
So, with that in mind, I don't live for Prada
I'm trying to stack and mack, and got stigmata
Tryin'a get the same fan base as Big Poppa
Sometimes, when I flow, they say the southern Big's popped up
They tell me "don't get murked, or get locked up"
But I'm from Holly Grove, I can't give the block up (Holly Grove)
So til' the day they drop my box, fuck
I'ma ride with my Glocks up
You already know

[Hook]

(Bring it home mang)
I'm hitch hikin' on the highway of life
You might see me on the side of the road
(Who knew this nigga could sing?)
I asked the Lord to be my coat and umbrella
'Cause outside it's rainin' cold
It's so cold
It's so cold
It's so cold (America)
It's so cold

[Verse 2]
I say, Miss America, Land of the Free
You ain't never do nothing for a brotha like me
You sold me a dream of 40 acres and a mule
Then you turn that half-a-acre that I had into a pool
You get up on the news, lying about how the levy's broke
Now Weezy lost 2 Jags, and spitta's Chevy broke
Flooded out engines, messed up suspensions
You took everything we had, Uncle Sam, you Satan fan

[Hook]

[Intro: Lil Wayne & B.G.]
Say Weezy (Whats Hannin?)
Can they remember me?
Lil Weezy
Make 'em remember (Haaa!) ya, nigga
Let these niggas know your (Look!) background, nigga (Look!)
Let 'em (Look!) know your (Look!) background!
Let 'em know how you've been thuggin

[Verse 1]
All I was taught was murder murder
Kill drama, and nothin' less
I strap tha Smith-Wess, and bust.. it in they chest
I had ta hustle hustle hustle hustle
Grind and struggle for success
Hid grams in girls' breasts, stick bricks.. under they dress
Them niggas there with big Willy
Me, I'm full of that dilly
Hope when I catch them slippin'
Him and they daddy's trippin'
Shorty can hold it down
Shorty be totin' rounds
Smellin' like a pound on school grounds
Shorty, wow
Hair... all over my head
Bandana 'round my braids
Eyes bloodshot red
Briches down to my legs, guns up in my trench
When niggas play, they get drenched
My pockets is full of lint
So, nigga, stay off the bend, I'm young with bad nerves
Since I lost my father, I've been troubled hurt and disturbed
So Ion even hesitate to leave 'em on tha curb
And wet them niggas shirt, nigga, get 'em for them birds
Tell them niggas, Geezy!

[Chorus: B.G.]
Remember he? Tha little G, never die
Took one to tha chest, but Weeze Wee never die
Remember he? Tha little G, never die
Have B.Geezy on his side, so Weezy Wee never die
Lil' Weezy Wee... had ta steal, hustle, and jack
Weezy Wee roll with K's, Glocks, and MAC's
Tha little G, he was raised keepin' it real
That's my lil' nigga, I taught him to get it how he live, nigga

[Verse 2]
Look, look
At times I forgot tha bills
Ain't been home in two weeks
Macita lookin' for me
Tha word all over tha streets
Well, shiiit! I love my momma
But all I got ta offer is drama, and many problems
I lay back in tha cut
These niggas out and I rob 'em, they ain't spin around here
We all alone on my block like nobody live 'round here
The lights got cut off at my house, and now I'm lookin' for a win-dow
I can't see it, I don' dropped my pile on tha floor
They got some niggas stuntin' in Benz, hey man, them boys ain't riders
*gun cocks* Hand it over, partna, my feet done got tired (Break it off)
Well, picture this, I gotta call from this ole' nigga Beatrice
He said he got that work, and needed me to make it happen (Make it happen)
Well Nigga, shit you hold it down when something shakin, daddy (What?)
Within a week he changed his mind, and... received tha package (What?)
Oh well... back to tha drawin' board (Board)
Cowards start hollerin' cause (Weezy) they know I'm comin' for it

[Chorus: B.G.]
Remember he? Tha little G, never die
Took one to tha chest, but Weeze Wee never die
Remember he? Tha little G, never die
Have B.Geezy on his side, so Weezy Wee never die
Lil' Weezy Wee... had ta steal, hustle, and jack
Weezy Wee roll with K's, Glocks, and MAC's
Tha little G, he was raised keepin' it real
That's my lil' nigga, I taught him to get it how he live, nigga

[Verse 3]
Lemme tell 'em
You remember that there nigga use to be thuggin' it out (Out!)
Blunt in his mouth, would stayed masked up in the drought
Run in your house, "Lay down! Nobody move! (Move!)
Tell that slut go get your stash, and empty your pockets, fool!"
That's how it was... crime, struggle, drivin' for scrubs
Lots of thugs... make niggas count the ants in the mud
Some niggas choose ta come back for me, ride around my set for me
Might start jackin' because I got that SKS with me
!Okay! (!okay!)
Listen, all you ballin' niggas betta !relocate! (!'locate!)
Cause, see, ya'll got it
I gotta make my cheese !rotate! (!rotate!)
And Right now I'm doin' bad
So just give me with whatever you have, my stomach hurt, I need a bag
I'm street-livin'... week for week
No-sleep livin'
Look outside ya window in tha mornin', your jeep missin'
My heat sizzlin'
I'm ready to sweep these niggas
Geezy... make 'em remember Weezy, nigga!

[Chorus: B.G.]
Remember he? Tha little G, never die
Took one to tha chest, but Weeze Wee never die
Remember he? Tha little G, never die

[Pre-Hook: Dr. Dre] x2
I got my mind made up, come on; get in, get into it
Let it ride, tonight's the night, yeah

[Verse 1: LL Cool J]
Uh, you know you a freak
Before the album went platinum, ya hardly speak
And now you're skin grinnin, gassed off the chrome rims and
Twenty room mansion, I rest my Timb's in
Uhh, I feel it how ya shake it
Rings in ya belly, I can't take it
Toss up your Moët, money make it
Last week frontin, tonight butt naked
I got the flava, make em Zoom-a-zoom
The LL Cool J, give me room
Looked up in my eyes as I lowered the boom

[Dr. Dre] Twenty thousand freaks packed up in one room, uhh

[Hook: Dr. Dre] x2
All I wanna do, is Zoom-a-Zoom Zoom Zoom
(Mmmm, whatchu wanna do) Uhh, whatchu wanna do?

[Verse 2: Dr. Dre]
Once again it's on, can't be home
The crime got me in the zone; homies blowin up the celly phone
The world knew I had to come once mo'
And just to let y'all know, I do my thing and still blow
Nuff to burn ten mill' cells, confirmed
The most anticipated since Tyson's return
So come on everybody let's all get down
(LL Cool J: Cause what we have, is a brand new sound)

[LL Cool J]
All the mommies in the house gettin live tonight
They wanna (Zoom Zoom Zoom, Zoom Zoom-Zoom)
And all my dogs feel the vibe tonight
They wanna (Zoom Zoom Zoom, Zoom Zoom-Zoom)
Say what?

[Hook]
All I wanna do, is Zoom-a-Zoom Zoom Zoom
(Mmmm, whatchu wanna do) Uhh, whatchu wanna do?

[Dre] All I wanna do, is Zoom-a-Zoom Zoom Zoom

[LL] Dre, whatchu wanna do?

[Dre] Mr. Smith, it's on you, uh

[Verse 3: LL Cool J]
In other words, it's gon' be like that
You young boys is blind, I'm seein them cats
Evolutionary (what?) Revolutionary and legendary
I got a climax waiting for each and every cherry
I'm like a narcotic, niggas is microscopic
Dr. Dre and Cool J, is the topic
Forever, my lyrics is rough and energetic
Them cats is blazin? I don't get it, they cosmetic
If shorty wanna step up? I'll twist his neck up
You can't get no money battling me; that's like ripping your check up
What partna? Take ten paces and turn around
That quick, yo' whole ghost town is burnin' down (Woooof!)
What I spit, manipulates whole clicks
Make 'em conversate on how real niggas ride my dick
It's like a serum, I just can't hear 'em
All them new niggas poppin' new shit, I never fear 'em
As we proceed
To give you what you need
Satisfaction guaranteed
Work and die
(Yeah, yeah)

[Pre-Hook] x3

[Verse 1: Andy Samberg]
Imagine in your mind a posh country club
The stuffy old money where the poor get snubbed
The spread is bland, sauerkraut and boiled goose
There's no way these people will ever cut loose
But then I walk in the room, hold my boombox high
And what happened next will blow your mind

[Chorus: Julian Casablancas]
Everything got out of control
The music was so entrancing
Everyone got out on the floor
It was a bunch of old white people dancing

[Verse 2: Andy Samberg]
Now, picture if you will a bunch of businessmen
Stuffed in the boardroom like pigs in a pen
The ties around their necks are like a hangman's noose
In the middle of the table, there's a boiled goose
The old people smell makes you want to puke in the sink
These dudes'll never dance, yeah, that's what you think
I stride in the room all young and hip
Hold up my boombox and say, "Listen to this!"

[Chorus: Julian Casablancas]
Then everyone started to move
People rejoiced instead of financing
Your preconceived notions were shattered
By the super old white people dancing

[Verse 3: Andy Samberg]
The Big Apple, where people never dance
Spirits go down while profits expand
The cops or the dealers, who's got the juice?
The street vendors peddling their boiled goose
So many types of people, they'll never get along
'Til I bust out my boombox and play this song

[Chorus: Julian Casablancas]
The music washed away all the hate
And society started advancing
Every demographic was represented
It was a rainbow coalition of dancing

[Bridge: Julian Casablancas]
Woah, everyone was wearing fingerless gloves
Woah, I saw a Spanish guy doing the Bartman

[Verse 4: The Lonely Island]
Transport now to an old folks home
Where the elderly are tossed on their brittle bones
The orderlies are stealing, there's no excuse
Every day for lunch they eat boiled goose
So I grabbed my boombox and hit the turbo bass
And what happened next was a total disgrace

[Chorus: Julian Casablancas]
Everybody started having sex
The music was way too powerful
A bunch of old people fucking like rabbits
It was disgusting to say the least, oh

[Outro: Julian Casablancas]
A boombox can change the world
You gotta know your limits with a boombox
This was a cautionary tale
A boombox is not a toy

[Intro: Andy, Jorma]
(spoken)
The following song is brought to you by Chex Mix

(sung)
Some dude once said
That love is a many funny things
I know there's a perfect girl out there for me
'Cause I see her, in my dreams

[Chorus: Norah Jones]
Dream girl, you're a fantasy
You're the only one, out there for me
My love

[Verse 1: Jorma , Akiva, Andy]
Dreamgirl you amaze me all dressed in paisley
Love how not one but both eyes are lazy
When I first saw you, you were drivin' the bus
Thick skin, strong nose like a rhinoceros
Dreamgirl so beautiful, lips all crummy
Skin like asphalt, nose so runny
Thick thighs, no waist, not a care in the world
You not crazy girl, you just my baby girl
You're a vision in sweats with the neon patch
Half-eaten squirrel hangin' outta your mouth
Rainbow poncho, the female Tonto
Hear a loud noise, start b-buckin' like a bronco

[Chorus: Norah Jones]
Dream girl, you're a fantasy
You're the only one, out there for me
My love

[Verse 2: Jorma, Akiva, Andy, together]
You got your cell phone ring set to Sex and the City
You like a hot bowl of grits only way more gritty
Straight drippin' in turquoise, my Santa Fe queen
One short leg you got the Santa Fe lean
It's music to my ears when you scream in your sleep
And when you lift your skirt in public yo I can't help but peek
You like Cleopatra, with the eyes of a pig
Love to watch you in the back yard when you go out to dig
Girl how'd you get those mouse traps glued to your neck?
Little rascal, how'd you get screwed to the deck?
You put away slurpees like a trash can
Your smile's all stainy and you're not too brainy and—
I like that! Talking to your shoe like it's your friend
I like that! Yellin' at the walls of make-pretend
I like that! Tellin' you to stop it then you don't
You said you gonna stab me in my sleep, but you won't!

[Bridge: Norah Jones]
Last week thought I saw you on the street
Turned out it was a bag of trash
Just a big ol' bag of trash
I thought you looked like a bag of trash

[Verse 3: Jorma, Akiva, Andy, together]
Dream girl I pitch a tent when you stomp in the room
Like a hellbound turkey mixed with a baboon
You're sexy and you're spicy like a bowl of Chex Mix
And I always feel safe when I'm in your flesh mitts
Your teeth so clean coulda swore you were British
Never take the Chex Mix cause you always get skittish
Open clams with both feet cause you're ambidextrous
No point cause we know you eat nothin' but Chex Mix
Chex Mix number one food snack in the land
It's the cereal taste, that you eat with your hand
Chex Mix at your local grocer, buy a box
Your family will all say: Chex mix rocks!

[Outro: Norah Jones]
Chex Mix, you're the snack for me
You're the only one, I'll ever eat or buy
Chex Mix, you're delicious
You got sixty percent less fat than potato chips TM

[The Lonely Island]
Now let's take a trip down memory lane
Back to junior high school where it all began
Three bad little kids raisin' hell at school
We were just 13, straight actin' the fool
Every day after class Kiv's house was the spot
Makin' crazy prank calls, hopin' not to get caught
Best friends, blood brothers, yo, we one and the same
Till one fateful afternoon when everything changed
One day playin' Punch Out up in Kiv's room
The house started shakin' and we heard a kaboom
Looked out the back window saw billowin' smoke
Yo, your backyard is smashed, man this isn't a joke!
(Yo let's go check this out man) (Aight bet, let's go)
All the smoke and debris led straight to the basement
Yo, what the hell is that? Man it looks like a spaceship
We all ran for cover, as the hatch opened wide
And a little green dude stepped out from inside, he said

[Little Green Dude]
I'm from Mars, and I come in peace
I have something to ask, and it's not discrete
There's a mutated strain in our DNA helix
And you three kids are the ones who can heal it

[The Lonely Island]
But we're just thirteen man, what can we do?

[Little Green Dude]
Umm how should I put this? I think we should screw
(What?!) On my home planet we can no longer breed
I've been sent as a receptacle to store your seed

[The Lonely Island]
Storin' our seed? Yo I think he means sex
Man, I'm a virgin, we all are, bet!
I'm just gonna lie here and close my eyes
Aw, what should we do? Now he's spreading his thighs!
You'll be heroes on our planet, but why us three?
You're the chosen ones, you'll just have to trust me

[Interlude]
Yo, should we do it? Man I don't know
I say we put it to a vote (oh yeah) (yeah)
All in favor
Say aye...AYE~!

[The Lonely Island and Little Green Dude]
Okay, we're in
Cool
Who should go first?
I have three depositories to capture your burst
Wait, so at the same time? Yeah that's what I was thinking
Here's some wine coolers, let's get you boys drinking
We pounded the drinks and, started gettin tipsy
Then took our positions, and started gettin frisky
One in the front, and two in the back
Had it locked up like a Chinese finger trap
Keep pumping away, my wife and family thank you
I'm about to explode - yo son, me too
THREE-WAY CLIMAX, best friends forever
What a blessing to have lost our virginity together
Yeah!

[Little Green Dude]
Andy, Jorma, Kiv, you've saved my race
Your reward is one wish then I'll go back to space

[The Lonely Island]
We looked at each other, didn't have to talk
Knew exactly what we wanted, before he took off
Mr. Alien Sir, for what it's worth
We want to be the greatest fake MC's on Earth

[Little Green Dude]
Your wish is granted and thanks again
I may have saved my planet but I'm losing three friends
What happened today was both incredible and bad
Therefore your name is Incredibad!

Incredibad...

[N.W.A. parody]
STOP STOP STOP STOP, STOP!!
SA-PRIZE, EVERYONE! (sirens)

[Intro: Andy]
(Is anybody out there? Help me!)
Reach for the stars!
Woah, yeah

[Verse 1: Andy]
You stand on a distant planet
Skyline of red plateaus
Strange air and vegetation
You're a winner!
Welcome to the Space Olympics
The year 3022
Take part in a grand tradition
Your name echoes in the halls of the universe!

[Chorus 1: Andy]
Oh! Yeah yeah
Believe in yourself
Take your game into outer space

[Verse 2: Andy]
Every single galactic athlete
Needs a coded ID badge
Drug tests are mandatory
You're a winner!
The Athlete's Village is on Zargon
You all get a junior suite
We don't cover incidentals
So keep your ass out the minibar!

[Chorus 2: Andy]
You're the best in the world!
Brace yourself cause there's no gravity
You're in the motherfuckin' Space Olympics! Yeah

[Verse 3: Andy]
Let it be known by every nation
You'll only get one meal a day
There was a bit of a budget snafu
And food funding is insufficient!
We can't really enforce a curfew
As there is no light or sound
Just one of the many problems
With hosting a sporting event in space

[Bridge]
(Attention all athletes, there are minor scheduling adjustments)
Space Disc! Is totally canceled
Space Swords! Is totally canceled
Space Luge! Is also canceled
And all other events are pending!

[Verse 4: Andy]
Welcome to your Space Olympics
All the oxygen has run out
And someone who will not be named
Accidentally hit self-destruct
As you file to your escape pods
I'll distract the alien hordes
(You're in the motherfuckin' space olympics)
And as I stare death in the face
I know my sins will take me to hell

[Outro: Andy]
You do it for the love, my love
And there ain't no woman that could take your spot my love
Hey what's up man?
Aww not much, you?
Hey are you ready for the party tonight?
Yeah man already got a case of Santana champagne
So, should be good
Oh nice
Yeah that's... (YOO-HOOOO~!)
Aww shit
Oh man, don't make eye contact
(DING-DONG! NORMAL GUY IN THE HOUSE!)
Hey man
Hey
(OH IT'S GREAT SEEING YOU OTHER NORMAL GUYS)
Ohh yeah
Uh-huh
(WHAT ARE YOU GUYS UP TOOOOO?)
Ahh not much
(HEY WHAT ARE YOU OTHER NORMAL GUYS UP TO?)
Seriously nothing we're just standing here
(DO YOU GUYS KNOW WHAT I HATE?)
What?
(HANGING OUT WITH A WEIRDO!)
Yeah
(HANGING OUT WITH SOME LOSER WEIRDO)
Yeah we..
(IT'S MY BIGGEST PEEVE)
Yeah well I was just actually
(IT'S LIKE THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW WHERE WE'RE COMING FROM)
Right, we understand
(I CAN'T TAKE IT WHEN SOME WEIRDO SHOWS UP UNANNOUNCED)
Okay well I gotta get going
(THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH ANY OF US)
Okay man yeah
(NONE OF US HAVE ANY MAJOR PROBLEMS!)
Ohhh man
(HEY LET'S MAKE A PACT!)
What?
(LET'S MAKE A SUICIDE PACT!)
Ohh no, that's crazy
(I'll go first) *BANG
And the award for best comedy sketch goes to
The Lonely Island

[Intro]
You might like our penises

[Verse 1]
Hey girl, from over here your butt looks soft
Maybe if I could touch it, I could tell if it's soft
Tell me if it's soft, 'cause I'd really like to touch it
And then I'll show you my penis (You guys)
And then I'll show you my penis (You guys)
And then I'll show you my penis (You guys)
You, might, like, my penis

[Verse 2]
Hey pretty girl, did you go to college?
Did you get your B.A., with all that knowledge?
I like your boobies, in your shirt
Please let me show you my penis (Mmm)
Please let me show you my penis (Aoww)
Please let me show you my penis (Mmm)
You might like my penis

[Verse 3]
(Oh!) Look at our penises
(Oh!) Look at our penises
(Uh!) Look at our penises
(Uh!) You, will, like, our penises

[Outro]
I will look at your vagina

[Verse 1: Andy Samberg]
Lock eyes from across the room
Down my drink while the rhythms boom
Take your hand and skip the names
No need here for the silly games
Make our way through the smoke and crowd
The club is the sky and I'm on your cloud
Move in close as the lasers fly
Our bodies touch and the angels cry
Leave this place go back to yours
Our lips first touch outside your doors
A whole night what we've got in store
Whisper in my ear that you want some more
And I—

[Chorus: Andy Samberg]
Jizzed in my pants
This really never happens, you can take my word
I won't apologize, that's just absurd
Mainly your fault from the way that you dance
And now I jizz in my pants
Don't tell your friends or I'll say you're a slut
Plus it's your fault, you were rubbing my butt
I'm very sensitive, some would say that's a plus
Now I'll go home and change

[Verse 2: Jorma Taccone]
I need a few things from the grocery
Do things alone now mostly
Left me heart broken, not lookin' for love
Surprised in my eyes when I looked above
The checkout counter and I saw a face
My heart stood still, so did time and space
Never felt that I could feel real again
But the look in her eyes said "I need a friend"
She turned to me, that's when she said it
Looked me dead in the face, asked "Cash or credit?"
And I—

[Chorus: Jorma Taccone]
Jizzed in my pants
It's perfectly normal, nothing wrong with me
But we're going to need a clean up on Aisle 3
And now I'm posed in an awkward stance because I jizzed in my pants
To be fair, you were flirting a lot
Plus the way you bag cans got me bothered and hot
Please stop acting like you're not impressed
One more thing, I'm gonna pay by check

[Verse 3: Andy Samberg & Jorma Taccone]
Last week I saw a film
As I recall it was a horror film
Walked outside into the rain
Checked my phone and saw you rang and I jizzed in my pants
Speeding down the street when the red lights flash
Need to get away, need to make a dash
A song comes on that reminds me of you and I jizz in my pants
The next day my alarm goes off and I jizz in my pants
Open my window and a breeze rolls in and I jizz in my pants
When Bruce Willis was dead at the end of Sixth Sense
I jizzed in my pants
I just ate a grape and I jizzed in my pants
I went— Jizzed in my pants
(Okay, seriously you guys, can we... okay?)

[Bridge: Andy Samberg & Jorma Taccone]
I jizz right in my pants everytime you're next to me
And when we're holdin' hands, it's like having sex to me
You say I'm premature, I just call it ecstasy
I wear a rubber at all times, it's a necessity

[Outro: Andy Samberg, Jorma Taccone, both]
'Cause I jizz in my pants
I jizz in my pants, I jizz in my pants
Yes, I jizz in my pants, yes, I jizz in my pants
Yes, I jizz in my pants
I jizz in my pants, I jizz in my pants

[Intro]
(I'm being serious) YO!
It's the wild wild West
You came to the right place my man
Get ready, here we go
(NEW SHIT!)

[Verse]
Welcome my friends to the old saloon
Everyone in town is hangin' out
If you gotta drink well you drink it down!
Then we'll all go have sex with whores (BRAND NEW!)
I'm Buffalo Bill, I just rode into town
On my horse, you bet'cha, on my horse
That's the thing in the old West times
Everybody enjoys a good horseride
TRY TO CHEAT AT CARDS YOU'LL GET THROWN OUT
Right out the saloon door on your butt
Come back in and buy a round of whiskey
Guess what? All is forgiven! (DJ LEARY)
Flippin' the jib with Calamity Jane
And you're another guy that's probably an injun
This whiskey is warm and it tastes like piss
OH NO~! Mustache smells like piss!
So that's the story and I'm stickin' to it
The old wild West is no place for a lady
I'm the bartender but I'm also the Mayor
So just put that in your pipe and smoke it
(“DJ WAAAAAAAAAH”)

[Outro]
I'm Tiny Tim and it's almost Christmas
Sure is dusty here

[Intro: Andy Samberg]
Jah! Rastafarianism

Rudebwoy livin in the shanty dorms

Now chant down Babylon, midterm essays
Then puff from de chalice I fi make from a Sprite can
Last week I read a book about Selassie I
Then told my bombaclaat parents I was switching religions
(Excuse I!) Oh, hot stepper, you do so many dutty crimes
(Nyabinghi!) And plus you're fully skylarking all the time
Udda look ya now

[Chorus: Andy Samberg]

Bada-ding-ding-ding-ding-dong-ding-ding-dong, duck
Excuse I for my skanking, give thanks and praise

[Post-Chorus: Andy Samberg]
In a dub style!
Roller skates

"Murder She Wrote"
Yagga-yagga-yagga yow!

[Bridge: Choir]
Are you there Jah? It's me, Ras Trent
Are you there Jah? It's me, Ras Trent

[Outro: Andy Samberg]
Are you there Jah? It's me, Ras Trent
Please guide me 'pon your bike path of righteousness
Oh, stanahoy, stanahoy, stanahoy, stanahoy Jah!
Fussing and fighting and Zion and roots
Red Stripe, Shabba, ragamuffin and culture
Me night nurse never want to plant de corn
Skiddily, woah
Diddily, skittily, bittily bittly, woah

[Jack Black]
Well, he was the Sax Man from the state of Tennessee
First set in with the band at the ripe old age of three weeks old
And when he blew into that horn all the people gathered 'round
Club manager jumped right up
And said "Boy I gotta have that sound!"
Scream "Hallelujah Lord!", I said the Sax Man's got my soul
Everybody gotta move their feet
When the Sax Man started to blow
Now blow it Sax Man!

[*farting saxophone sounds*]

Mmm 'kay, he's a little shy, but his genius cannot hide
'Cause when the Sax Man starts to wail
He's gonna take you on a ride
Take it Sax Man!

[*two saxophone notes*]

Ow! Take it Sax Man!
Okay he'll be right with you folks!
All right, Sax Man, that's my fault, I put you on the spot
But now you're all warmed up and this-a next one's gonna be hot
Kick it Sax Man!
C'mon!

[*one bad note*]

What the fuck are you doing?

[*another bad note*]

Haha, okay! Why don't we have a little inspiration now?
You know this game, Sax Man!
Repeat after me
Here we go, and
Shibbidy bop bop, buda bop bah 

[*one note*]
Dip dip di-dip, dip dip di-dip dip 

[*two weak notes*]
Arrip da di-dip, bop ba-doo-doo day-day 

[*no sound at all*]
Fuckin' play something Sax Man! 

[*pause.. one weak note*]
Okay, movin' on!
Sax Man!
Sax Man!

[*one off key note*]

[Intro: Jorma and Akiva]
Hello?
Hi, do you want to go to a party with me?
No - the game's on
Oh, I almost forgot, I'll be right there

[Chorus: Jorma and Akiva]
We like sports and we don't care who knows
From shooting hoops, to the Super Bowl
We like sports and we don't care who knows
Football, football, football, tennis, hockey, golf

[Verse 1: Jorma and Akiva]
The game is starting, everyone is here
I got my snacks, my friends, and a beer
Just two normal guys hanging out having fun
Right guy number two? Yeah, guy number one
E to the S to the P to the N
Is all I watch 'cause I'm the man
If my team loses I'll be mean all night
If you tell me to relax we'll get in a fight
Watching sports with girls is a pain
They don't know the rules, there's no time to explain
Single, double, triple, homerun
For the celebration, I'll shoot my gun
I like my friend, he's a real guy's guy
He's not a loudmouth like that cunthole Steve

[Chorus: Jorma and Akiva]
We like sports and we don't care who knows
From Wimbledon to the Astrodome
We like sports and we don't care who knows
Football, football, football, tennis, hockey, golf

[Bridge: Jorma and Akiva]
Now when I say "Sports", you say "Nuts"
Sports, nuts, sports, nuts
When I say "Cheating", you say "Sucks"
Cheating, sucks, cheating, sucks

[Verse 2: Jorma and Akiva]
I drink whiskey 'cause I like the taste
You think it's bitter but I think it's great
I also drink whiskey and we smoke cigars
Don't believe me? Smell our cars
We're real men and we like sportsIf you say we're not then we'll see you in court
I'm team captain and I choose you
I'm the other team captain and I choose you too
We steal the ball and we're off to the races
Then scare the other team with our mad dog faces
Like what, what, what, what, what, what
What, what, what, what, what, what

[Chorus: Jorma and Akiva]
We like sports and we don't care who knows
From the pre-game jokes to the wrap-up show
We like sports and we don't care who knows
Football, football, football, tennis, hockey, golf

[Outro: Jorma and Akiva]
Throw me the baseball
Now toss me the pigskin
Now feed me the rock
Now give me the rock

[Intro: Chester Tam]
Ayo fam, check this out
I was just at the club right?
Heard these two dudes talkin'
One of them said to the other one
That they knew someone, who said you guys are wack!

[Chorus: The Lonely Island]
Who said we're wack? You said we're wack?
You take it back! Who said we're wack?
You talkin' smack? You're gonna get smacked!
(You sayin' that I'm wack, but it just ain't so)

[Verse 1: The Lonely Island]
Someone said we're wack, why would they say that?
I don't think we're wack, who said we're wack?
Who said we're wack? I can't believe that
They must be smokin' crack, to say that we're wack
Say that we're wack, you probably get smacked
If you said we're wack, did you say we're wack?
Who said we're wack? I'll paint your eye black!
Once I check my facts - who said we're wack?

[Bridge: Andy]
How could a person up and call a person wack?
How could the devil turn the blue sky black?
How many babies born will never reach their dreams?
And how could a person call another person wack?

[Verse 2: Jorma, Akiva]
I heard a rumor that somebody said we're wack
I think that's wack, to call someone wack
I am not wack, no matter what you say
What did you say? Did you say that I'm wack?!

[Outro: The Lonely Island, Akiva]
All the ladies in the house put your hands up
All the fellas in the house put your hands up
Now whoever said we're wack put your hand up
Now everyone else, put your hands down
Oh there he is, there he is!

[Intro: Andy, Akiva]
*bottle pops*
What is that, Cristal? (No!)
Dom P? (Hell no!)
(This is that Carlos Santana champagne!)
Oh shit, Santana DVX? That's my joint!
(Mine too, but a lot of these busters don't know about it)
Well let's tell these motherfuckers!

[Verse 1: Andy, Akiva]
As a kid, I used to lay awake and think
When was Santana gonna make a drink?
But now I'm all grown and my dream came true
Santana champagne, from here to you
From the heart of Napa Valley and the guitar king
Comes a sparkling wine, to make a blind man sing
Yo, it's the cham-pan-yah, from the man with the bandana
I can't stand a flute with anything but Santana
What's the first name in cham - it's Carlos
And to that man I propose a toast
In the 60's, he had lots of freebie sex
But now he's gettin down with the DVX

[Interlude 1]
Excuse me fellas!
Am I to understand that Carlos Santana has made a champagne?
(That's right motherfucker! Here, try it)
Alright {*pops bottle*} Aww Shit!

[Verse 2: The Lonely Island]
I feel alive for the first time
Each sip hits my lips like a landmine
Without Carlos in my life I was livin' a lie
He makes his guitar weep, but his champagne cries
He's a Southwest, tie wearin' bolo champ
Comin' straight out the box with a bolo champ'
Yo he a beast with the sugar and yeast, mix it in pots
Like the way his release mixed jazz blues and pop
And the salsa fusion, he's lady's shoe producin'
Plus he teamed with Rob Thomas for a music revolution
On the 7th day, it's been said God rests
But on the 8th day he made the DVX

[Interlude 2: E-40, The Lonely Island]
Gentlemen, gentlemen, what is all the hubbub about?
Carlos Santana?
That's right, I see bitches is enjoyin' my sparkling wine
We certainly are
Well be careful, 'cause this shit'll get you fucked up

[Verse 3: E-40]
Bitch! I'm like no other, one of a kind, my sparkling wine
Santana DVX make you wanna have sex (Ooh)
I'm rich bitch! I'm havin' my chips
Get laid all the time, by 70's chicks, uh
Won hella Grammys, bitches throw me they panties
I'm probably your daddy, I probably nutted in ya mammy
I'm a Bay boy, city life, been around the corner
Try to play me foul and my vatos gon' run up on ya
A legend, a boss, that's what I are
Ask about me pimp, 'tana be killin' the guitar
Old enough to know better but young enough to not care
I get active, might slap a bitch with my hair {*whip*}
Left coast up top I bang that shit
My sparkling wine'll pop Cristal on her lip
Can't stop, won't stop gettin' my bread
Pack arenas and coliseums now watch me shred

[Bridge: The Lonely Island]
{*guitar solo*}
Ooh, shred the Santana

[Outro: The Lonely Island, E-40]
A monkey drank a bottle and learned to speak
A squid drank a bottle and became a freak
A lion drank a bottle and forgot how to growl
A horse drunk a bottle, and fucked a cow!

[Intro: Jorma, Andy]
These days, a lot a cats is outta line
Seems to me, like they need to get punched
Yeah, but where you gonna punch 'em?
Yo, the choice is obvious

[Chorus: Jorma, Andy]
I'll punch you in the jeans, I'll punch you in the jeans
This is not a case of men vs. machines
You think that you're safe, thought you got away clean?
I'll roll up on you smooth and punch you in the jeans

[Verse 1: Jorma, Andy]
I got my fists clenched, gonna throw a haymaker
Rockin' your slacks from here to Jamaica
Shake in your boots, 'cause I'm the earthquaker
Bringin' those jeans 'round here was a mistake-ah
I gotta vendetta, it's against your jeans (Yeah)
Gonna put my knuckles up against the seams
They can be on your legs or on the clothesline
But when I see the zipper and cloth, it's go time!
And I'm zeroed in, I got the tunnel vision
Gonna cover you in shit like a ton of pigeons
Man I hate your jeans, I'm gonna bruise that denim
(It really doesn't matter as long as you're in 'em)

[Chorus: Jorma & Andy]
Yo, we'll punch your jeans, we've said it before
Best believe this is not a metaphor
Better watch your back, 'cause we're on the creep
And we won't stop 'til your jeans are six feet deep

[Verse 2: Jorma, Andy]
Man I'll murder your jeans, I'll feed 'em to the fishes
Here's what I'd do, if I had three wishes
Punch your jeans, on all three counts
It would bring me satisfaction in large amounts
Yo, If I had three wishes I would do the same
We see eye to eye in this jean-punch game
I'd lay 'em in a field where there's chemical sprayin'
But I'd punch 'em first, yo that goes without sayin', yeah
Acid washed pleats or a nifty cuff
It's just another jean for my fist to stuff
Throwin' fisticuffs, eat pants like bag lunches
Jeans pronounced dead, 'cause of death?, Hecka punches

[Chorus: Jorma & Andy]
Yo we'll punch your jeans, we've said it before
Best believe this is not a metaphor
You got somethin to say, we got the proper retorts
Beat your jeans so bad that they'll wish they were shorts

[Verse 3: Jorma, Andy]
Gonna revise your Levi's with physical harm
Put divots in the rivets with my physical arm
Gonna beat those jeans, wanna dip 'em in slime
Turn your 501's into 499's
When I punch a jean I like to imagine a face
The fly is the nose and the balls are the base of the face
You got taste and it shows, my man
God damn, your jean brand got me throwin' my hands
Gonna go back in time, find the man who made jeans
And choke him to death, if you know what I mean
Yo, I know what you mean, so keep your jeans on a hush
And break out, before you get bumrushed

[Chorus: Jorma & Andy]
Yo, we'll punch your jeans, we've said it before
Best believe this is not a metaphor
So take off your jeans, and reverse the curse
'Cause we the best jean punchers in the universe

[Outro]
It really doesn't matter as long as you're in 'em
It really doesn't matter as long as you're in 'em

[Intro]
Click, click
Click, click
Yeah
Click, click
DTP nigga!

[Verse 1: Infamous 2-0]
I started with ten mack tens and ten clips and ten pens
Got ten times richer in the span of ten years
Bitch, I'm ten times two on a scale of one to ten
I'll battle ten crews with the strength of ten men

[Verse 2: Fate Wilson]
At nine, I was into crime, sex, and drugs
Pushin' an '89 Box Chevy sittin' on dubs
Nine thugs all ski masks, black suited with gloves
Break the imprinted chest with at least nine slugs

[Verse 3; Ludacris]
Man I ate eight clips with eight tricks, watching eight flicks
You's 8-6 if you ate pussy with fake lips
I figure eight when my mind goes in circles
Did I do that? Or was it Mystikal and Urkel?

[Verse 4: Infamous 2-0]
On to 7 Ak 47, so what?
I got seven hoes stoppin' by at seven to fuck
Then put seven in your chest seven days a week
And add a foot for good measure you'll be seven feet deep

[Chorus: Infamous 2-0, Fate Wilson & Ludacris]
It goes 10-9-8-7-6-5-4
3-2-murder 1 lyrics at your door
These DTP niggas come ready for war
So don't start the fucking game if you won't settle the score

[Verse 5: Fate Wilson]
I got six hoes distributing on six blocks
It's blistering from cops tryna stop these rocks from distributing
Six gun shots left, one pint of Vodka before this pimp will hit
It's street justice, now it's six hole in your casket

[Verse 6: Ludacris]
Give me a high five and I'll put that nine lower than your esophagus
Then smack you so hard that you have to come with 2Pacalypse
Five stars, twenty rims, five cars
I'd add more but I had to subtract one from five bars

[Verse 7: Infamous 2-0]
I got four forty-fours on a rip on the floor
For you niggas talkin' shit, I'm finna show you what for
I did four months in the bing instead of a hearse
Now it's DTP for life, dog for better or worse

[Verse 8: Fate Wilson]
I fuck three best friends, ran on all three the same game
In these streets I'm a murderer, I got three alias names
I'm three times insane, three shots will cave your brain
On 3 fire and ready, cock back and aim

[Chorus: Infamous 2-0, Fate Wilson & Ludacris]
It goes 10-9-8-7-6-5-4
3-2-murder 1 lyrics at your door
These DTP niggas come ready for war
So don't start the fucking game if you won't settle the score

[Verse 9: Ludacris]
I'm packing two twenty-twos and twice the ammunition
But at Friday the 13th, what's up now superstition?
I'm a two timer with a couple of twins, double jeopardy
With a pair of two deuces in the two seater Benz

[Verse 10: Fate Wilson]
I got one motto get dough 'til you go
I got one main lady the rest of y'all is hoes
I'm numero uno with one more before I go
If you think I ain't the one bitch you too slow

[Verse 11: Infamous 2-0]
And all you zero ass niggas ain't nothin' to me
Because I chop up O's, move dro', and chop keys
0-6 is my clique along with PC
Pretty Rick, Calil, V-Slim and Shondrez

[Verse 12: Ludacris]
It goes 1 to 10 and 10 to 1
Ludacris, Fate Feeze, and that nigga I-20
It goes 1 to 10 and 10 to 1
Ludacris, Fate Feeze, and that nigga I-20

[Chorus: Infamous 2-0, Fate Wilson & Ludacris]
It goes 10-9-8-7-6-5-4
3-2-murder 1 lyrics at your door
These DTP niggas come ready for war
So don't start the fucking game if you won't settle the score

[Hook: Carl Thomas]
I'm tryin to make it through these hard times (hard, times)
I'm tryin to make it through these hard times
I'm tryin to make it through these hard times (hard, times)
I'm tryin to make it through these hard times
I'm tryin to make it through these hard times (hard, times)
I'm tryin to make it through these hard times
I'm tryin to make it through these hard times (hard, times)
Hard times (hard), hard times (hard)

[Verse One: Ludacris]
You never know how much you miss a person, until they gone
Like to hear it? Hear it go, I'm rehearsing, gotta sing my song
I know I've done some wrong, but I can't get right
Cause life is like a big fight
I'm stickin-and-movin, tryin to get my shit right
My family's been houndin me, friends they done turned against me
Kinda like they hearts was on a full tank, but now they empty
And they say I've changed, but like twins I'm just the same
It's because of my job, mo' money mo' prob in this dirty game
This industry FUCKED UP
That's right I said it, and it's fake as ever
Keep real niggas around me, stay Space Age 4 Eva
Po-ppa never went and jumped the broom, never got that one degree
But if you looked down from heaven, you'd still be proud of me
Your son was DUI, but my momma made it by
I didn't shed no tears when you left me
But the rest of the family cried
Trials and tribulations, ruined my concentration
Losin my patience, hard times for goodness sake'n

[Hook]

[Verse Two: Eightball]
As this Valium slowly starts to kick in
Them subconcious, subliminal thoughts, start tickin
This whole world around me, diseased, and crumblin
Babies doin dope cause daddy did it right in front of them
Everybody wanna blame music for they bad kids
Sittin up in the court talkin 'bout Eminem made me do what I did
My own hard times rolled in like the fog
Try to think of others, but I can't get past my own thoughts
My momma, in 1967, pickin cotton
While other blacks was gettin liberated, boycottin
My old man was a player, ain't no hidin that
He started tootin then he graduated to smokin crack
I never saw him, never needed to see that muh'fucker
He left me and my mother stuck down here in this fuckin gutter
I tattoed it on my arm so I can't forget it
It's in my mind and my heart so I'm forever with it

[Hook]

[Verse Three: MJG]
A drum machine, the old fo'-track, and a pack of new tapes
In the middle of, 1988, in a corner cafe
We made beats, and hung with old heads, and stayed out late at night
Do talent shows, fo'-way split the dough, that was our way of life
My momma stayed, home full time so she could raise me
Knowin without a, household father, things could get crazy
Sometimes I listened, sometimes I thought I knew it all
But nevertheless, momma was with me through it all
I graduated out of nothin, not out of school, it was like
12, 13, 14 years I'm thinkin cool
I might as well, be focusin on me tryin to get paid
Usin these rhymes I've been writin since in the 7th grade
Our team played, and had physical sex with minimum wage
It was just like a piece of pussy
It fucked me long as I stayed
But still I prayed, Lord I'm tryin now please help me out the water
It can't get no harder
Help me to get back up and get my shit tomorrow

[Hook] - 2X

[Chorus: Ludacris]
All this drinking gon' catch up
And all this smoking gon' catch up
But some niggas just really don't give a fuck
Some niggas just really don't give a fuck
And all this drinking gon' catch up
And all this smoking gon' catch up
But some bitches just really don't give a fuck
Some bitches just really don't give a fuck

[Verse 1: Ludacris]
Now let me be quite frank
'Cause I'm that crazy nigga Luda
Always got a drink
And I'm steady smoking buddah
I do the
Evil that men do when I get you
I'ma sit you down
Then take it to the mental's essential and clown
Every chance I get
Bitch I'm hit
Not by no bullet or no pellet
But the smoke from the canna-bi-as, shiyat
I might just be too high
Then I put my middle finger up when I'm ridin' by
And say hi to plenty liquors and I know it's a sin
And if ya tell me stop drinking I'll just do it again
So when I get old I'ma rock, roll, shake, and shiver
With some blacked out lungs and a fucked up liver

[Chorus: Ludacris]
All this drinking gon' catch up
And all this smoking gon' catch up
But some niggas just really don't give a fuck
Some niggas just really don't give a fuck
And all this drinking gon' catch up
And all this smoking gon' catch up
But some bitches just really don't give a fuck
Some bitches just really don't give a fuck

[Verse 2: F.A.T.E.]
Ayo, I do this for bluntheads and whinos
Stewart Ave. hoes
Niggas from G-Ro committed to slanging blo
Doublin' dough 24-7
Fuck po-po's I'm blowin' dro out the Ac Legend
Runnin wit 2 strike felons
And I pack 4-4's like Hank Aaron
Then'll smoke a L
Bust shells
And dare ya to tell
Walk up in the club
Pretty thug
Fucked up off headshots
Sippin' Courvousier watchin' hoes drop it like it's Hot
Shaking tits and twats
Placing big face 20's and cock
Loading clips and Glocks
Knowing we got the haters hot
The ballin' don't stop
Just drop more G's on drink and drugs
Live it up young nigga since it's gon' catch up

[Chorus: Ludacris]
All this drinking gon' catch up
And all this smoking gon' catch up
But some niggas just really don't give a fuck
Some niggas just really don't give a fuck
And all this drinking gon' catch up
And all this smoking gon' catch up
But some bitches just really don't give a fuck
Some bitches just really don't give a fuck

[Verse 3: Infamous 2-0]
Now with the help of Hen and Coke
I grab my pad and pen and wrote
Something that I knew was dope
And represent for my kinfolk
Pimp a ho until she broke
Wit mo lines than chopped coke
Ey yo it's 2-0 I'm Eastside's King
But I'm a writer with a twist of Amaretta
My shit even come out better
Grab a blunt put it together
What a nigga really need
Run up in the club and blow a motherfucker til he Bleed
Could it be an Icehouse put his lights out
Or the club get closed out
If it's hoes out I show out
Call Tauheed get Dro'd out
There's no doubt I love my life
Love the light
Love to write
Love the mic
So take a drag
Grab a bag and match up
Hennessey and bad weed
Believe me it catch up

[Chorus: Ludacris]
All this drinking gon' catch up
And all this smoking gon' catch up
But some niggas just really don't give a fuck
Some niggas just really don't give a fuck
And all this drinking gon' catch up
And all this smoking gon' catch up
But some bitches just really don't give a fuck
Some bitches just really don't give a fuck

Get off me, I don't think you wanna play
Get off me, but I'm on you all day
Get off me, I don't think you wanna play

[Verse 1: Ludacris & Pastor Troy]
You wanna rush me, you can't touch me, trust me
'Cause you way too dusty, and rusty, and musty
You betta shop that make you pop up from lock up
But you tell your folks to hold your jack up to back up (to back up)
I'm ready, so sit down or go ta' your room
It ain't nothin'
Ayy, ayy, watch out, watch out, boom
Call me the hit man, 'cause I make you wanna call time-out
Then I make your mom cry out, when I take your whole spine out
Then watch me take ya, and fake ya, and shake ya, and break ya
And see you on home to your maker
You should give up now for talkin' shit like that
But then you nothing, you garbage you betta' watch ya' back

[Chorus: Ludacris]
Get off me, but I'm on you all day
Get off me, I don't think you wanna play
Get off me, but I'm on you all day
Get off me, I don't think you wanna play

[Verse 2: Pastro Troy & Ludacris]
(Okay, okay, now)
Now it's the Pastor, jukin 'em, showin' my moves
I'm in that 2000 excursion
Ridin' on 22's, I hear da boom
But booms just get me more crunk
It's the DSGB forever
Ridin' on pump
I stunk, or did I say stunk, I meant stank (UN huh)
I think I'll take it please, or in another coffee break
You ain't, but you can pretend to be homey
I'm stiff arming these busters just as soon they get on me

[Chorus: Ludacris]
Get off me, but I'm on you all day
Get off me, I don't think you wanna play
Get off me, but I'm on you all day
Get off me, I don't think you wanna play
Get off me, but I'm on you all day
Get off me, I don't think you wanna play
Get off me, but I'm on you all day
Get off me, I don't think you wanna play

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Good luck, time to get hood stuck
Caldasac trap, Mr. Good Stuff, Ludacris give me 20 push-ups
Last summer, got da hook up, you know what I did
Who'd eva thought up they grew up on one of the BeBe Kids?
Diaper rash still on my ass and fiendin' for cash
Almost got signed with Puff Puff, but I think I'll pass
Now what we got 'round here is a 20-20 twins
And what's up in my hand, is a bottle of Gin
I love women so I'm in it to win it, in it to green
In it to get in it and get in it again
You got two booties so you wipin' yo chin and I don't blame you
I lay in da sand, y'all lay in da snow and make angels
My ice piece dangle, make my chest look older
Touch it and fall apart like yo high school folder
I'm a Trojan man, BHS hall supplier
Shady park resident and southside Rider

[Chorus]
Eastside, eastside nigga wha?
(Eastside, eastside nigga what?)
I'm talkin' 'bout da Westside, westside nigga wha?
(Westside, westside nigga wha?)

Southside, southside nigga wha?
(Southside, southside nigga wha?)

[Verse 2]
Get back, time to get hood jacked, gold chain, took dat
World of Ghetto fabulous Dopeboys and Hoodrats
Be careful what you look at 'cause you lookin' too long
You might go blind in my briefs 'cause my dick is too long
I'm gettin' neck while I'm singin' this song
And there is enough for everybody in da party while y'all hittin' da bong
But y'all be hittin' my schlong, you play the flute quite nicely
When teeth interrupt, you can watch as I get fiesty
Oh no, you suck again, request back up
Broads I seem to rack up when I pull da gold acta
Get slapped up, drove up da wall, put it in reverse
You can hope for the best, but expect the worst
You at a place like some D's on a Hurst, it's quite funny
Phat Rabbit, playboy bunny
It seems as if that's what I need, filthy south and Ds
That's why I roll in from da Southside breeze, give it to me now

[Chorus]
Eastside, eastside nigga wha?
(Eastside, eastside nigga what?)
I'm talkin' 'bout da Westside, westside nigga wha?
(Westside, westside nigga wha?)
Northside, northside nigga wha?
(Northside, northside nigga wha?)
Southside, southside nigga wha?
(Southside, southside nigga wha?)

[Verse 3]
You pick time to get hood sick, hit 'em wit a good lick
Clean out yo house from da couch to da toothpick
EastSide Ruthless, WestSide leave 'em clueless
My Northside mackers got these broads actin' foolish
And do this for a living while you stuck up in yo cubicle
Nightlife runnin' dis streets, it sounds beautiful
Women break a cuticle, ballas break bread
Southside, I represent it 'til I'm dead, what wha?

[Chorus]
Eastside, eastside nigga wha?
(Eastside, eastside nigga what?)
I'm talkin' 'bout da Westside, westside nigga wha?
(Westside, westside nigga wha?)

[Chorus]
I hate it when it's too many niggas, not enough hoes
Too many rookies, not enough pros
The game got switched on some Ludacris shit
So all y'all can suck my dick, bitch
Too many niggas, not enough hoes
Too many rookies, not enough pros
The game got switched on some Ludacris shit
So all y'all can suck my dick, bitch

[Verse 1]
I got a whip like Miracle Ludacris lyrical fool
We dirty south shut yo' mouth we rock jewels
No holds barred but obey the block rules
Cock tools put chlorine in record pools
Are there anyone like ya (hell naw)
I treat humans like students (fail y'all)
So turn ya books to page 69 and start suckin'
When Organized drop the tracks then start duckin'
When Ludacris get in the bed, start fuckin;
(You wanna be startin' some'n) Get out the booth
And lemme tell y'all the truth, we kick down do's
Save all the H20 for front rows
Live in the bank and watch for stank hoes
Stay chromed out and that's on or off road
If you know what I mean, proceed to stay clean
Light skinned nigga turn red but get green
Inhale some of that 'dro but blow steam
Love a combination, big ass and tight jeans

[Chorus]
'Cause it's too many niggas, not enough hoes
Too many rookies, not enough pros
The game got switched on some Ludacris shit
So all y'all can suck my dick, bitch
Too many niggas, not enough hoes
Too many rookies, not enough pros
The game got switched on some Ludacris shit
So all y'all can suck my dick, bitch

[Verse 2]
(Boy, you done lost yo' mind) No, I've lost my virginity
And I shot click like that fool shot Kennedy
What's the remedy Hennessey Coke
If you cut all your money you'd still be half broke
Ashes to ashes, smoke or get smoked
We come by the masses, you come and get choked
If you take me for a fool, I'll take you for a joke
Tired of fast food so they cooked up dope
So now we eatin' lobster, shrimp and things
And watch for imposters that's been in the game
We invented the game and y'all just got hip
(Man, what's that smell) Probably your upper lip
'Cause I love to walk around like my shit don't stank
Even if it's cigars and that purple color dank
Chillin' in the gump with no trace of Tom Hanks
So put this in yo' jaw like weiners and beef franks

[Chorus]
'Cause it's too many niggas, not enough hoes
Too many rookies, not enough pros
The game got switched on some Ludacris shit
So all y'all can suck my dick, bitch
Too many niggas, not enough hoes
Too many rookies, not enough pros
The game got switched on some Ludacris shit
So all y'all can suck my dick, bitch

[Verse 3]
I put too much sugar in my Kool-Aid
And party like a kid with a high top fade
Arrive to a show and I like to get paid
Arrive to a hoe and I like to get laid
Ride up on my back like rugs and floormats
I'm on the right page but what's my format?
I wave to the ocean 'cause I'm where shores at
And women go nuts just like my bozack
Did you know that? Man, I'm the gift of change
Electric stoves so give me the keys to the Range
Shagadelic, beautiful but strange
Went to Magic City saw Nikki and Blue Flames
Rearrange, same broad different night
Pass the E&J and let a nigga get right
The bomb threaten dude that's on yo same flight
The highlight's that I live a high ass life

[Chorus]
'Cause it's too many niggas, not enough hoes
Too many rookies, not enough pros
The game got switched on some Ludacris shit
So all y'all can suck my dick, bitch
Too many niggas, not enough hoes
Too many rookies, not enough pros
The game got switched on some Ludacris shit
So all y'all can suck my dick, bitch
'Cause it's too many niggas, not enough hoes
Too many rookies, not enough pros
The game got switched on some Ludacris shit
So all y'all can suck my dick, bitch
Too many niggas, not enough hoes
Too many rookies, not enough pros
The game got switched on some Ludacris shit
So all y'all can suck my dick, bitch

[Intro]
Yeah, come see this nigga
Come see this ol' light-skinned motherfucker
I seen him and I'm addicted
Disturbing tha Peace is the clique
Please tell these fake-ass niggas who you are

[Verse 1]
I be that nigga named Luda
Alert! alert! it's the ATLien intruder
College Park waterboy, spit in the c-cooler
I Jam 'til they Def, they call me Slick Dick the Ruler
Women, indeed! Keep yo' eyes closed
'Bow blows, come on out them clothes, hoes
Low-pros, low blows, watch out for the po-pos
And I chose to be that number-one contender
Southern offender, fucking up your whole agenda
When I walk, you try to run; when I run, you try to hide
You skate at the snap of my fingers; call me Golden Glide
It's you and I, do or die, who am I?
I got a pocket full of family stones, cats think I'm Sly
Oh, why try? You one of them niggas that like to cheat death
And I'm one of them niggas
That rip out Excursions 'til there's no seats left
You shit out wheat Chex, and fart out deep breaths
While we toss darts at the bottom of y'all V-necks

[Interlude]
Who, that nigga 'Cris?
Aww, that nigga's aight
That nigga can't fuck with me, though!
Let me get on the mic
Nigga, who the fuck are you, nigga?

[Verse 2]
I be that nigga Bronze Bridges
Players wanna ball but go on strike 'cause of my pitches
They think I want they bitches
But I don't want no pigeons; yeah, pigeons can scrub my dishes
And y'all don't want no scrubs 'til y'all pull out y'all extensions
Y'all in school detention and'll never come out
Man, I'll cut your achilles tendon and put a sock in your mouth
'Cause we the shit in the South, Fate know what I'm talking about
You see we Jack and we Daniel, y'all Earl and Ralph
4-Ize, twirl it out, lick it dry and tend it to flames
Not even Joshua can come to war with these games
These bitch niggas is lame and comin' down with the rain
You all wet behind the ears but it's a drought in your brain
And that's the simple and plain mayne, three-W dot, shhhh...
Man, that dude Luder's got some hotter-than-hot shhh...
Well sh-sh-sh-shut the fuck up
Before you get cu-cu-cut-cut the fuck up

[Interlude]
Hold on man, hold on, lil buddy
Y'all talkin 'bout shorty, man?
Shorty up at the radio station, man?
Shorty be popping, man!
I'm saying, let the name be known!
Who y'all talmbout?

[Verse 3]
I be that nigga the Lova-Lova
I'm nastier than thinking about your parents sex each other
No glove, no love; better tell your dick to run for cover
So when lightning strikes, you'll be safe on a few rubbers
If you know what I mean!
Not everybody's Mr. and Mrs. Clean
Some get burnt like Freddy Krueger, sweet dreams
Girls "backin' they ass up," now they 400 Degreez, ha
Hot girl, trying to give to niggas up on the block, girl
Have you screaming, "Stop, girl!"
I rock worlds with my nine inch Louisville slugger
Still wonder why they call me Lova-Lova?
Self-explanitor-ium, ass valedictorian
I bring 'em Back to the Future like a '85 Delorean
The Luda drug emporium; on the counter prescriptions
You like my diction and my doctor/nurse convention
I place the stethoscope quite close to your titty
And have your buttcheeks red, man, like Uncle Quilly

[Outro]

Ahh, ahh-ahh, ahh
Ahh, ahh-ahh, ahh

[Verse : Ludacris]
I be that nigga named Luda
A.K.A. L-O-V-A, L-O-V-A
Fuck that shit, nigga what you wanna say one time
Southside let's ride (say what)
And if you love what you do, do what you feel
Then I know you gonna mark my words
I drop shit like birds
And it's about the time for yo' ass to get served
Just lay it on down, just lay it on down
While we relax to the tight raps, and the fat tracks
That a nigga Timbaland put down
Oh yes, let's get it on down to the nitty grit
Don't have time for the petty shit
Cause I got mo' dick, than a lil' bit
And time flies, when I'm havin' fun
I can make a ho get like Forrest Gump and just "run baby run"
I guess that they can't handle this
The brother's just too scandalous
If you don't wanna get freaked
Get up out my way just like in an ambulance (say what)
Gitty up gitty up ride on to the real, lay in death to the fake
And tell your boyfriend just to chill, don't player hate!
Kick back relax and just take off yo' shoes
While I gotta tell you what I wants to do (uh oh)
Yeah

[Chorus: Timbaland]
Let me touch it (let me touch it)
Let me feel it (let me feel it)
Let me grab it (let me grab it)
That fat rabbit (fat rabbit, fat rabbit, fat rabbit)
Let me touch it (let me touch it)
Let me feel it (let me feel it)
Let me grab it (let me grab it)
That-that rabbit (ohhh, c'mon)
Let me touch it (let me touch it)
Let me feel it (let me feel it)
Let me grab it (let me grab it)
Fat rabbit (fat rabbit, fat rabbit)
Let me touch it (let me touch it)
Let me feel it (let me feel it)
Let me grab it (let me grab it)
That-that fat rabbit (uh oh)

[Verse 2: Ludacris]
Fatter than fat, fat like a dub sack
Showin' them where that love's at
So open up yo' eyes, and get a surprise like in Cracker Jacks
Punan' Don happy, givin' up that nappy dug out
Get the cut up, then I cut out
Why you standin there wit yo' butt out (whoo)
And it's always in the back of my mind
Whatever the place, whatever the time
Even in College Park after dark I'ma get that sunshine
Closer than close, closer than most, then I'm all up in ya
But beginners give me a thigh, breast, and leg like Mrs. Winter
And let dinner be served
Can I get it on a platter, shatter your bladder
And put so much light in yo' life I'll make the roaches scatter
The wetta the betta, I'm ready to get ya
Gotta have that rabbit like that cheddar
So I can freak you like I just met ya
Hot like a sauna get comfy like in a Cadillac
Nick nack paddy wack, give a dog a bone Jack
Kick back relax and just take off yo' shoes
While I gotta tell you what I wants to do (uh oh)
Yeah

[Chorus: Timbaland]
Let me touch it (let me touch it)
Let me feel it (let me feel it)
Let me grab it (let me grab it)
That fat rabbit (fat rabbit, fat rabbit, fat rabbit)
Let me touch it (let me touch it)
Let me feel it, girl (let me feel it)
Let me grab it, girl (let me grab it)
That-that rabbit, girl (ohhh, c'mon)
Let me touch it, girl (let me touch it)
Let me feel it, girl (let me feel it)
Let me grab it, girl (let me grab it)
Fat rabbit, girl (fat rabbit, fat rabbit)
Let me touch it, girl (let me touch it)
Let me feel it, girl (let me feel it)
Let me grab it, girl (let me grab it)
That-that fat rabbit, girl (uh oh)

[Verse 3: Ludacris]
Yo' love is supa-cala-fragalistic
You don't know how bad I missed it
If it broke then don't fix it
Yo stuff is butta like a biscuit
Reminisce like Mary, I gotta pop that cherry
Kinda like that coochie, you wanna be my hoochie?
Better than my adversary
Don't be so scary
I, never thought that you could act up
Make a nigga wanna back up
Keep it tight through the night while I wet this track up
So we can slip and slide, make you wanna dip and dive
Trippin while we rip and ride, 'til I get you to cum inside
Got you where I want yo' ass
In the case of an emergency, break the glass
Keep yo eyes on the present and erase the past
And be happy if we got mo' blunts to pass
Get done up and run up
In the guts 'til yo' butt don't shake like it used to
I wake 'em up like a rooster
Take it slow, not faster than a turbo booster
No worry, no hurry - no pain, no gain
Better keep yo' eyes on strain
Cause ain't a damn thing changed, mayn
Sit back, relax and just take off yo shoes
While I gotta tell you what I wants to do (uh oh)
Yeah

[Chorus: Timbaland]
Let me touch it (let me touch it)
Let me feel it (let me feel it)
Let me grab it (let me grab it)
That fat rabbit (fat rabbit, fat rabbit, fat rabbit)
Let me touch it (let me touch it)
Let me feel it, girl (let me feel it)
Let me grab it, girl (let me grab it)
That-that rabbit, girl (ohhh, c'mon)
Let me touch it, girl (let me touch it)
Let me feel it, girl (let me feel it)
Let me grab it, girl (let me grab it)
Fat rabbit, girl (fat rabbit, fat rabbit)
Let me touch it, girl (let me touch it)
Let me feel it, girl (let me feel it)
Let me grab it, girl (let me grab it)
That-that fat rabbit, girl (uh oh)

[Bridge: Crowds]
Let me touch it, let me touch it
Let me feel it, let me feel it
Let me grab it, let me grab it
Fat rabbit, fat rabbit
Let me touch it, let me touch it
Let me feel it, let me feel it
Let me grab it, let me grab it
Fat rabbit, fat rabbit
Let me touch it, let me touch it
Let me feel it, let me feel it
Let me grab it, let me grab it
Fat rabbit, fat rabbit
Let me touch it, let me touch it
Let me feel it, let me feel it
Let me grab it, let me grab it
Fat rabbit, fat rabbit

{*scratch*} Gim-gim-gim-gimme some mo', HEY!

[Verse 1: Ludacris]
Ha! I do it all night, my whip is all white
I done had a couple drinks and I got a little buzz so I'm feelin alright
But the night's just gettin started, haters get disregarded
Roll up them sweets, creep-creep let's hit these streets and get retarded
I pop a bunch of bottles, my bitch be poppin too
Keep talkin out yo' face, and she might be poppin you
She might be pop lock and droppin down to the flo' wit it
Meanwhile all my dogs chasin paper, that's right we go get it
So get it right (get it right) kill the lights (kill the lights!)
I'm feelin like I might just pop a pill tonight (pill tonight)
Cause the feeling's right (the feeling's right), pass me a Miller Lite
Then grab that girl with the Coke bottle shape, she's my type (woo!)
I'll take her home (take her home) and do the do (do the do!)
I know the Kama Sutra, think what I'll do to you
Stick to you like super glue, maybe even like bubblegum (okay!)
Don't go to sleep woman (why not) no matter how many times I cum

[Hook: Ludacris & (Shawnna)]
I do it all night, I do it all night
I do it, I do it, do it all night
I make 'em say OHH! {*scratch*} OHH, OHH, OHH!
{*scratch*} Gim-gim-gim-gimme some mo', HEY!

(I make 'em say) OHH! {*scratch*} OHH, OHH, OHH!
{*scratch*} Gim-gim-gim-gimme some mo', HEY!

[Verse 2: Shawnna]
Ayy, ayy
I do it all night, and I ride them logs high
Baby lil' crib good, I'mma ask his shawty what that mouth like
Tell me if it's out of sight, tell me if he's slow and long
Then he made his tongue above his nose, I said "You know you wrong"
But I'm really like sho' you right, tell me where you wanna go tonight
Anywhere, any place, I can see it in your face you are the prototype
To the ceiling I'm so so high, so-so feelin like I'm so so right
Please tell me why the 'dro so fire, I can't stop zonin and I don't know why
Ay look - beep beep get up out my lane, y'all hoes can't do it like me
If you're thinkin I'm 'bout the game, take a look at my U-N-I-T
That's right I'm back on deck, but don't get it twisted the strap on deck
The mac on deck, the pack on deck, and e'ry damn day keep a rack on deck
And that's on Jeff, that's on we, that's on Hoover and that's on me
That's that wood that match them seats, and that's in the Caddy and that's on 3's
No matter what they said I been gettin my bread, get my paper, get my check
But anybody wanna try to ask I've been gettin some heeeead

[Hook: Ludacris & (Shawnna)]
I do it all night, I do it all night
I do it, I do it, do it all night
I make 'em say OHH! {*scratch*} OHH, OHH, OHH!
{*scratch*} Gim-gim-gim-gimme some mo', HEY!

(I do it, I do it, do it all night)
(I make 'em say) OHH! {*scratch*} OHH, OHH, OHH!
{*scratch*} Gim-gim-gim-gimme some mo', HEY!

[Verse 3: Ludacris & Shawnna]
How many women can I fit up in my Cadillac?
So high I can't SEE, feelin like I got cataracts
Some in the middle of the night say I get drunk and don't know how to act
I don't know how to act
He don't know how to act
And I don't know how to stop, and I don't know how to quit
Blowin on a couple zone, now we need another fifth
And I mean I'm out my mind, not I mean I'm out my body
See we do this all night, is you comin with me shawty?

[Hook: Ludacris & (Shawnna)]
I do it all night, I do it all night
I do it, I do it, do it all night
I make 'em say OHH! {*scratch*} OHH, OHH, OHH!
{*scratch*} Gim-gim-gim-gimme some mo', HEY!

[Intro]
Awww yeah, welcome back to Battle of the Sexes Radio
Where it is 12:45 in the A.M. and Disturbing Tha Peace is our in-studio guest
Our hotline is lit the fuck up with people with relationship issues
Caller number one, you're on the air

Yeah man, y'all tell me if I'm crazy cause this girl in here trippin
Y'knowmsayin? I'm a real man, I take care of her
I take care of my kids, I pay all my bills
I mean I ain't gon' lie, I may check a lil' female from time to time on the side
Y'knowmtalkinbout, but what man don't? So how can I break this down to her?

Ludacris, how do you feel about this particular situation?

[Verse 1: Ludacris]
Yeah, get your money right ladies, learn to sign your own checks
But don't call me after midnight, unless we havin sex
Don't ever assume nothin, a man gon' be a man
A groupie gon' be a groupie, a fan gon' be a fan
These tricks gon' keep trickin' so hustlers gon' keep hustlin
Long as there's new coochie then dogs gon' keep fuckin
So don't be all up in my phone replying to women's pages
I thought your momma told you, you should never talk to strangers
Don't ever ask no questions that you really don't want the answers to
Stop poppin off at the mouth or like Nino Brown I'll have to cancel you
Handle you, stop the ride, leave you on the avenue
Half of you, always seem to want some nigga to pamper you
And that'll do for him but not for me, I'll probably baffle you
And if he wants to act a fool I'll show him what the gat'll do
Run along, go find somebody to snitch or go chit-chatter to
Then your name will follow with, Ay! Whatever Happened To..?
(Exactly, that's just what she need to hear)

[Interlude]
You damn right playa, aight thank you for callin man
Next caller
Yeah I hear you but let's talk about the fake-ass brothers
With the 24's but can't pay the note on they lease
And my nigga with his iced-out chain
But I can't get him to pay his damn child support
That's why we makin mo' money, ownin our own property and ride just as nice
So now, I guess if we want to, we can bail y'all too now, huh?
Interesting, Shawnna you wanna speak on this one?

[Verse 2: Shawnna]
Uhh, yo, get your mind right niggas get a bitch that can keep up wit'chu
I'm tired of thinkin to myself why in the hell did I ever fuck wit'chu
I'm stuck wit'chu, sick of yo' childish games and all the stuff you do
I'll probably mention yo' name but true to the game I've had enough of you
I've seen yo' type befo', throwin yo' funds all over the flo'
He flashin his chains and flashin his dough, he drinkin the fifths and drinkin the Mo'
But what you don't know this nigga broke, he can't even afford to smoke
And back in the hood all the hustlers and G's know he's a joke
That's why I cheat a nigga, just when he eat it I tell him beat it nigga
Real bitches true to the game, that's how you G a nigga
DTP stay in the zone, like we on PCP
Chrome on the SS, Shawnna blow there recently
Y'all niggas ain't on my level, I do it so hood
Pineapple and Belve', we feelin' so good
Lightning is so wood, I get my own stack
That's why I leave him 200 and never call back
(That's right Shawnna, pussy rule the world!)

[Interlude]
Yes it does, next caller what's up?
Man what's up, this is Marcus
I wanna know do y'all got somebody to talk to these triflin-ass women?
Like me, I'm a good man, but all these good men get treated like shit!
All friends callin at 3:30 in the mornin
Marcus don't wanna talk about no numbers
Marcus wanna talk about that ass, and I ain't havin it!
Y'all got somebody to talk to these women?
Cause they need to be TAUGHT!
I-20 you better talk to 'em!

[Verse 3: I-20]
Yo, get your money right ladies, tell the man to get gone
But you don't you show up to my crib with your period on
This is lesson one baby, listen, how should I begin?
Um, ain't no such thing as a plutonic friend
You're lying to yourself if you don't think you want mo'
So don't you call me insecure when he show up at your do'
You all claim to have substance, self-respect and some class
But half naked in the club and steady shakin yo' ass
Screamin I ain't done enough to touch you under your skirt
But who the hell are you to tell me what my money is worth?
I run the streets, and you trippin I don't make you feel safe
I stay at home and you complainin that I think we need space
I'm not sayin that it's fair but it's the way that it is
Ain't no nigga tryin to marry you with four or five kids
It may sound a little harsh but it's straight from the heart
A nigga didn't write the scripts so I'm just doin my part, yeah
(Preach my brother, preach! I hope you women out there heard that!)

[Outro]
And you better believe they did, it's millions of people listening
But that's our show for this evening ladies and gentlemen
I gotta go get a piece of ass my damn self, alright? (c'mon baby)
Check us same time, same place tomorrow
"Battle of the Sexes Radio" signing off
Good niiiiight

[Intro: I-20]
Yeah, nigga, got that Ludacris
Got that UGK, that Disturbing the Peace Click
And you know what I'm tired of?
These flashing-ass, flossing-ass niggas
So if you see one you know what you do?

[Chorus: Ludacris]
Stick 'em up, stick 'em up, bitch, stick 'em up
Put ya hands up where I can see 'em, see 'em, see 'em
Stick 'em up, stick 'em up, bitch, stick 'em up
Target niggas, wouldn't wanna be 'em, be 'em, be 'em
Stick 'em up, stick 'em up, bitch, stick 'em up
Put ya hands up where I can see 'em, see 'em, see 'em
Stick 'em up, stick 'em up, bitch, stick 'em up
Target niggas, wouldn't wanna be 'em, be 'em, be 'em

[Verse 1: Pimp C]
Uh, I want the money and the power they hittin me every hour
For the silk resin powder chasing them dirty dollars
I'm from Texas nigga it get hectic nigga
People depending on me I can't neglect it niggas
Cause the game is deeper than just working off the beeper
If the paper ain't right then we calling a sweeper
To clean up the problems and straighten the mess
So nigga come wit ya pistol and nigga come wit ya vest
This ain't the east or the west the bamma weed or the stress
I'm Young Pimp from Port Arthur and we done passed the test
And we smoking the best everywhere that we go
And when our records come out them bitches sell out the sto'
Stayin throat on the 'dro and keep that thang on the flo'
Want my money up front when we come for the show
Y'all can play wit ya paper but I'm dyin for mine
So while y'all buying them watches I'mma stay on the grind
Fuck Nigga

[Chorus: Ludacris]
Stick 'em up, stick 'em up, bitch, stick 'em up
Put ya hands up where I can see 'em, see 'em, see 'em
Stick 'em up, stick 'em up, bitch, stick 'em up

Put ya hands up where I can see 'em, see 'em, see 'em
Stick 'em up, stick 'em up, bitch, stick 'em up
Target niggas wouldn't wanna be 'em, be 'em, be 'em

[Verse 2: Ludacris]
Hallow laid hollow sprayed I'm the hollow man
I get to the hollow point wit my hollow plan
Hollow bullets I pull it I'm about to live in vain
And then I drill em refill em make sure they feel the pain
It's mighty strange how your peephole is my fuckin gauge
Catch you in concert and then wipe you off the fuckin stage
I feel a ghetto rage let's turn the ghetto page
My bitch will stick you wit ghetto metal stilleto thangs
And I got a ghetto aim with diamond 'bezeled rangs
So while my index is working my pinky's blinding thangs
I hit em at close range I spit em at most brains
You think you real rich nigga we gonna make some chump change
You think it's a fucking game you think it's a blood sport
You gasping for breath and I'm puffin on one of these Newports
And I see a red dot aimed at yo head
Then bright lights oh no po-po and guess what they said
They said

[Chorus: Ludacris]
Stick 'em up, stick 'em up, bitch, stick 'em up
Put ya hands up where I can see 'em, see 'em, see 'em
Stick 'em up, stick 'em up, bitch, stick 'em up
Target niggas wouldn't wanna be 'em, be 'em, be 'em
Stick 'em up, stick 'em up, bitch, stick 'em up
Put ya hands up where I can see 'em, see 'em, see 'em
Stick 'em up, stick 'em up, bitch, stick 'em up
Target niggas wouldn't wanna be 'em, be 'em, be 'em

[Verse 3: Bun B]
Say nigga you think it's a joke? Trill niggas be going for broke
Twist this whistle loc and them muthafuckin pistols smoke
And it's just a matter of time, before you labeled a busta
I dust the nigga that couldn't catch up, and cut the mustard
Now I got confidence, I don't need no condiments
All I need is common sense, to see through your incompetence
Nigga, keep your compliments, they don't flatter me, fuck with me
And that'll be the day, bitch, we don't play, you know where the gat'll be
Huh, right on the side of me (side of me), right where it's 'posed to be ('posed to be)
Bitch niggas die for me (die for me), just for getting too close to me (close to me)
So kiss your rosery beads and sing a silent one, cause
I promise if you get it, it's gone be a violent one
Coroner catching his breath, like he's got asthma
When they cut on the blue light, and see all that fucking plasma
Millenium murda master, nigga I ain't new to this
So when you see that Bun-B, Young Pimp, or that Ludacris, just

[Chorus: Ludacris]
Stick 'em up, stick 'em up, bitch, stick 'em up
Put ya hands up where I can see 'em, see 'em, see 'em
Stick 'em up, stick 'em up, bitch, stick 'em up
Target niggas wouldn't wanna be 'em, be 'em, be 'em
Stick 'em up, stick 'em up, bitch, stick 'em up
Put ya hands up where I can see 'em, see 'em, see 'em
Stick 'em up, stick 'em up, bitch, stick 'em up
Target niggas wouldn't wanna be 'em, be 'em, be 'em

[Outro]

[Hook: Monica]
I can't live with ya, can't live without you
I say I can't live with ya, can't live without you
Ooh I can't live with ya, can't live without you
I can't live with ya, can't live without you

[Verse 1: Ludacris]
One day I love you, the next I can't stand you
Huh, it's too much for me to handle
I made my mind up thinkin I'm on the right track
So then I leave you, but then come right back
And I don't like that, I swear I'm so confused
Don't know what I want or what's the right thing to do
But the right thing is you, you're my destiny
Even at my worst you still bringin out the best in me
But then you testin me, know how to push my buttons
Fussin, fightin, yeah we always gettin into somethin
So mad I make you cry, then we make love
A never-endin cycle, make up to break up
It's time to wake up, I need to smell the coffee
Play with these other women, or get 'em all off me
And you wonder why your man'll just doubt ya
Can't live with ya, can't live without ya

[Hook: Monica]
I can't live with ya, can't live without you
I say I can't live with you, can't live without you
Ooh I can't live with ya, can't live without you
The one thing that I know, is I can't seem to let you (go)
You got me to the point of walking out the (door)
And then I find myself coming back for (more)
I don't know what to do
Cause I can't live with ya, and can't live without you

[Verse 2: Ludacris]
One day I love you, the next I can't stand you
Huh, it's too much for me to handle
One minute naggin me, always harrassin me
Next minute squeezin me, huggin, kissin and grabbin me
Just when I think it's cool, you back startin shit
Findin the smallest things just to start an argument
Goin through my phone, KNOW you shouldn'ta took it though
I hope your stupid ass find what you're lookin fo'
Stormin out the house mad, throwin breakin shit
Callin your girls, exaggeratin and fakin shit
Pack your clothes like you really 'bout to leave this time
KNOW you messed up but actin like it's me this time
It's a revolvin door, that keeps spinnin 'round
Are we gon' be together, or are we finished now?
And you wonder why your man'll just DOUBT ya
Can't live with ya, can't live without ya

[Hook: Monica]
I can't live with ya, can't live without you
I say I can't live with you, can't live without you
Ooh I can't live with ya, can't live without you
The one thing that I know, is I can't seem to let you (go)
You got me to the point of walking out the (door)
And then I find myself coming back for (more)
I don't know what to do
Cause I can't live with ya, and can't live without you

[Verse 3: Monica]
When the going get tough and the fightin be rough
Now some folks may call it hood but I guess we call it love
I be askin for your touch then I don't give you my trust
First I hate you with a passion then I can't need you enough
I be, wantin to spend my whole life wit'chu
And I be, talkin 'bout how you and me are through
And my mind says yes but my heart says no
And my mind says walk but my feet won't go away yeahhhh
See I be tellin you to go
But deep inside I want you to stayyyyy
Uh, and you know how to make me smile
But at times you ruin my dayyyyy
Ooh, we gotta get better
Gotta get it together
And you wonder why your girl just doubt ya
Can't live with you, can't live without youuuuu

[Hook: Monica]
I can't live with ya, can't live without you
I say I can't live with you, can't live without you
Ooh I can't live with ya, can't live without you
The one thing that I know, is I can't seem to let you (go)
You got me to the point of walking out the (door)
And then I find myself coming back for (more)
I don't know what to do
Cause I can't live with ya, and can't live without you

[Verse 1: Ludacris]
Now I been ridin up in my Bentley coupe, stuntin with the top down
Fo' 24-inch rims so heavy they hold the block down
24 karat necklace so heavy it hurt my neck
Three things you can't take away from me - money, power and respect
I got it and hold onto it, you knew that I never let it GO!
You prostitute it, but money I never let it HO!
Speakin of hoes, oh yes we meet 'em and we G 'em dude
And we may see 'em but we wouldn't wanna be 'em dude
I put my fist UP, I got the power girl
I wash my nuts off, go take a shower girl
It's been a hour girl, it's time to GO
And if my neighbor see you while you walkin out my do'

[Hook: Ludacris]
Hey ho, they be sayin' hey ho

They be sayin' hey ho, they be sayin' hey ho
If men sleep around, we some playas, but for women they be sayin'

[Verse 2: Lil' Kim]
Nowww, can't nobody do it like Kim, only woman that can do it like men
VVS's be them gems - ho, now count that!
My-my-my money comin in, bendin them corners on them rims
Gold-plated checkbook, tell me how do ya bounce that?
I, bounce into position like I invented the Kama Sutra
But money make me cum, go and ask Luda!
And women cheat better than men, we don't disturb 'em
My motto is "What they don't know won't hurt 'em"
We just do it like you do, see the roles done switched
If I'm a ho, you's a ho, if I'm a bitch, you's a bitch
Know that I'mma stay rich so fellas do what ya do
Cause y'all don't fuck us, niggas we fuck you!

[Interlude: Ludacris] + (Lil' Kim)
HEY HO! (Now we sayin) HEY HO!
(Now we sayin) HEY HO! (Now we sayin) HEY HO!
(Now we sayin) HEY HO! (Now we sayin) HEY HO!
If men sleep around we some playas but for women they be sayin
HEY HO! (But now we sayin) HEY HO!
(But now we sayin) HEY HO! (But now we sayin) HEY HO!
(But now we sayin) HEY HO! (But now we sayin) HEY HO!
If men sleep around we some playas but for women they be sayin

[Verse 3: Lil' Fate]
She likes the night lights, bright lights, big spendin
Lil' Fate been big pimpin pimpin
So don't be mad at my raps and try and look at me funny
Cause you know that most you ladies tradin sex for money
So if you comin out the pocket then you might get laid
That's how the rent, car note and cell phone get paid
I bet the snakes all show, once you cut that grass
And I'm a pimp, so it's time that I exploit they ass
You see it's hoes after the party, it's hoes after the show
It's hoes up in the lobby, it's hoes out on the stroll
(Hey ho!) Here's some No-Doze, no dough, no sleep
Ho, on your feet, if you don't work you don't eat!

[Hook: Ludacris]
Hey ho, they be sayin' hey ho
They be sayin' hey ho, they be sayin' hey ho
They be sayin' hey ho, they be sayin' hey ho
If men sleep around, we some playas, but for women they be sayin'
Hey ho, they be sayin' hey ho
They be sayin' hey ho, they be sayin' hey ho
They be sayin' hey ho, they be sayin' hey ho
If men sleep around, we some playas, but for women they be sayin'

I know you got a man, man, man
But tell me what your man, man, man
Gotta do with me, me, me (uh-oh, uh-oh-oh)
Gotta do with me, me, me (uh-oh, uh-oh-oh)
(I know you got a girl, girl, girl)
(But tell me what your girl, girl, girl)
(Gotta do with me, me, me - uh-oh, uh-oh-oh)
(Gotta do with me, me, me - uh-oh, uh-oh-oh)

[Verse 1: Ludacris]
Hahaha, listen
I know you got a man but your man ain't Luda (Luda)
So please don't let him fool ya
Cause the nigga don't really know how to do ya
Who's your daddy rollin all up in the Caddy
Sunroof top with the diamond in the back? (back)
Comin to get some of the bomb in the sack
Like a bomb in Iraq, I'mma come and attack
Every inch, of yo' body after the af-terparty
And then on to the hotel lobby ridin me like a Ducati
Faster than a, Bugatti I'm like, whoa kemosabe
Good golly shawty a freak, well she been practicin Pilates (woo!)
I'm probably just trippin, tongue sk-skippin like the track, broke
But if she think I'm frontin just wait 'til she see my backstroke (hah!)
I'll be yo' side piece, but what's our future plans?
Cause I be on ya like DAAAAMN!

[Hook: Flo Rida & (Ester Dean)]
I know you got a man, man, man
But tell me what your man, man, man

[Verse 2: Flo Rida]

Damn d-do yo' thang, look shawty I gotta respect yo' antonym
Damn d-dere yo' boyfriend, I just wanna be yo' toy friend
Yo' other other man, not yo' l-l-lover man, a undercover man
How many rubberbands it would take for you lil' mama to be apart of my plan?
What do you need in advance? I can see both of us showin in France
I got the back of yo' thong in my hand, Louis Vuitton, no more Donna Karan
Couple of stacks, s-so what is you sayin? Like Denzel Washington, "My man"
I don't wanna hear no mo'-mo' 'bout him, what he gotta do with me?
You a grown-ass woman, I'm a grown-ass man
So we both know a lot about the birds and the bees
Hold up shawty let's conversate, conjugate, constipate
Get stuck on each other, you comin up out of yo' lingerie
Hey, I know you got a man

[Hook: Flo Rida & (Ester Dean)]
I know you got a man, man, man
But tell me what your man, man, man
Gotta do with me, me, me (uh-oh, uh-oh-oh)

(Gotta do with me, me, me - uh-oh, uh-oh-oh)

[Verse 3: Ludacris]
Not a, not a, not a damn thang
He wouldn't know what to do if he tried and I ain't hatin
You need some room to breathe and I could be yo' ventilation
You need a lil' love and just a lil' stimulation
A hug, a lil' kiss and then a lil' penetration
Give it to you like you never had it befo'
And you ain't never gonna think about his ass again
Lips, hips, eyes, thighs, yeah I'm gonna have to give that ass a ten
And they can get a five, even though one of 'em kinda fine
But ain't none of 'em got nothin on you, you
So let's go somewhere to dine and sip some expensive wine
Later on tell me what we gon' do, do
We gon' bump and we gon' grind, so good it should be a crime
And next time tell yo' friends to come too, too (woo!)

[Hook: Flo Rida & (Ester Dean)]
I know you got a man, man, man
But tell me what your man, man, man
Gotta do with me, me, me (uh-oh, uh-oh-oh)
Gotta do with me, me, me (uh-oh, uh-oh-oh)
(I know you got a girl, girl, girl)
(But tell me what your girl, girl, girl)

We could roleplay, you the artist I'll be your manager
You could be the nurse I'm the doc (doc fill me in)

Do my ladies run this motherfucker?
(Hell yeah!)

[Verse: Ludacris]
Luda!
On your mark, get set, put the music in the deck
And turn it up and let the system go
You done heard a lot of people in the past
But you never heard a nigga like this befo'
Ain't nobody better let the records show
If they outta order let a tec just blow
Over the border, I be in Mexico
Throwing it up like an anorexic ho
Anybody thinkin' like they just don't know
Tell 'em that Luda gotta electric flow
Come and see me live and I wreck a show
Sucka niggas better find the exit row
Extra cheese and the extra dough
And I'mma keep goin til the record's broke
So if you don't mean what you say when you spit it on a track
What the FUCK YOU RAPPING FOR?
Women wanna get me and I can't say no
So I get 'em fast and I sex 'em slow
But every now and then it get hectic
They holdin' on tight to a nigga and I gotta let go
Gotta go sign on the X with O's
Wrist gotta shine and my neck just glow
It's a man's world
And all you women I just want the rest to know

[Hook: Ludacris]
Now I heard the ladies
They aight but they ain't hittin' on nothin'
Do my fellas run this motherfucker?
(Hell yeah!)
Now I heard the fellas
They aight but they ain't hittin' on nothin'

Okay oh, okay now e'rybody with me drunk as FUCK, break it down and "roll it up"
Yeah, e'rybody get they killers wit 'em, rep yo' side and throw it up
Po' it up and it's goin down, light another blunt and it's goin 'round
Puff puff pass, you could toast yo' glass, later we'll screw and slow it up
If you make it fast I can make it last, and I'm a nigga that's makin cash
Eight figures in the bank and I'll pull yo' rank, what you think wit your hatin ass?
Hee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee - heh, you think you fly I know you not
Hee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee - you tote yo' knife I tote my Glock
Big body Cadillac, women in the back seat, speakers steady pumpin as I pass these losers
Yo' car too small, I can't fit my women in a PT Cruiser
Get your cake up, get your weight up, way up to the top 'til you can't go further
These snitches is after my riches and yes I smell bloody murder
When I cock back better drop that, can't block that lock that, fools better stop that
Otherwise you could pop back, but after dumpin' a round you'll be wonderin where the cops at
Where the cops at? Cause I'm drunk as FUCK, tell 'em I'm far from sober
Cause if the po'-po' happen to pull me over - I'mma just tell 'em

[Verse 2: Lil Scrappy]
E'rybody with me, bitches lookin tipsy, goons posted up case a hater try to tempt me
Pull out the roach, roll up the dough, money I'mma throw again holla at my folk
All I need is a bitch right now, to blow me away then take me down
I need another fuckin Conjure round, hot wing, Gucci, out to the lounge
You might just see me but I can't dig deep nigga with gold teeth
Nigga then O-D on VSOP, and if not now slowly but surely
Shake 'em like LeBron, shoot 'em like Kobe, if they say chill I just pay the police
In the club chillin with G-S-U-P, but after go down it's in D.T.P
That's a rock, got you pissy and you dizzy, wanna hit me
But not really, please don't mix me, I'm a boss, my dogs bite quickly
If nobody's out here with me I'mma do this shit myself
Smoke and drink off for my health like I don't need nobody else
Scrap's so true to smokin crucial, swishin on swishas with Luda
I'm, in the Playas Circle, this G shit you hoes ain't used ta
I got my own kush pack and got my own liquor
"Ay what you call that?" I call it Cleveland Now nigga!

When I put a little kiss inside your thigh
Put a little bass inside your ear
When I whisper and tell you that daddy's here
Daddy's here, the heat is on
And I love you with your little Vickie Secrets on
Even though I'll never let you keep 'em on
Cause you pressed my button and the freak is on
Let's make it a night to remember
And bend that mattress that yo' sheets is on
Sheets is on, yank 'em off
And every little kiss I'mma make 'em soft
Yo' undergarments, take 'em off
Take 'em off so you can

[Verse 1: Ludacris]
AOWWWW!
I never used to snore in my sleep 'til this rap shit started
Warm thoughts fill the hot-headed and cold-hearted
Your whole paycheck, you burp it and then fart it
And y'all think I'm gon' stop? BLOW IT OUT YA ASS!
In one year I got rich, now life's movin so fast
But bein broke with no food is just a thing of the past
Plus I'm the new phenomenon like white women with ass
And y'all prayin that I flop? BLOW IT OUT YA ASS!
In New York I buy clothing, in Cali I get green
In Atlanta I get sleep, in Texas I sip lean
All these rappers wanna know what I'm gettin for sixteens
Try 80, want a discount? BLOW IT OUT YA ASS!
See in just six months I infiltrated the system
If you find somebody better, then I'm sorry I missed him
Niggas hate givin me props cause I might use it against them
C'mon, get Ludacris out! BLOW IT OUT YA ASS!

[Hook 2X: Ludacris]
If you mad I'm on top, then wish me gone
If you mad I'm on the road, then wish me home
And if you mad that I'm right, punk wish me wrong
But after your three wishes - BLOW IT OUT YA ASS!

[Verse 2: Ludacris]
It's time to saddle up the Tontos cause I'm the Lone Ranger
I eat dinner with Jews but don't talk to strangers
I'm just a few albums from filling your disc changer
If you ever think of stoppin me - BLOW IT OUT YA ASS!
I'm a hustler by nature but criminal by law
Any charges set against me, chunk it up and stand tall
Next year I'm lookin into buyin Greenbriar Mall
You probably own a lot of property! BLOW IT OUT YA ASS!
C'mon and take a look, he's got gigantic balls
Plus his money keeps flowin like Niagara Falls
We all know Jesus saves and Ludacris withdraws
I'm 'bout to go on vacation - BLOW IT OUT YA ASS!
Shout out to Bill O'Reilly, I'mma throw you a curve
You mad cause I'm a THIEF and got away with words
I'mma start my own beverage, it'll calm your nerves
Pepsi's the New Generation - BLOW IT OUT YA ASS!

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Ludacris]
My black people show me love when I'm up on the block
And Latinos always waitin for my CD's to drop
White people love the flow, they say, "Dude, you fuckin rock!"
Yo' fans are my fans, right? BLOW IT OUT YA ASS!
So find my album in the stores and look for the white steam
Rip it open, play it and yo' momma might scream
It's hard, other albums are softer than ice cream
Yo' scans are my scans, right? BLOW IT OUT YA ASS!
Now Luda's throwin up A's, and I'm lightin up L's
Around the globe gettin paid, you home bitin yo' nails
DTP, the only label that practice fightin ourselves
We probably gettin on your nerves, huh? BLOW IT OUT YA ASS!
I been eatin and gettin FAT while y'all dyin of hunger
I get drunk in the winter, stay high in the summer
Watch out, my album's puttin up McDonald's numbers
You over 6 million served, huh? BLOW IT OUT YA ASS!

[Hook]

[Outro]
BLOW IT OUT YA ASS!
WHOO!

[Verse 1: Ludacris]
I got five kisses, where you want 'em at?
Either of yo' lips, yo' ears, yo' neck, yo' stomach or yo' back
Yo' inner thigh, right on yo' kneecap or yo' belly button
These other guys be out here talkin but they steady frontin
They don't know what they want, that's why I tell you put yo' trust in me
Share all yo' secrets, yo' desires and yo' fantasies
I ain't gon' tell nobody baby, I'm an only child
I'll keep it to myself cause all I wanna do is see you smile
Knowin that you got someone to talk to, ain't that what you want?
I'll be yo' lover, yo' provider and yo' confidant
And I won't judge you cause I know that ain't nobody perfect
But you got some perfect imperfections and that makes you worth it
I wanna see yo' body in all of the positions that you like it in
We could do it slow or have some drinks and it gets enticin when
You like it rough and I give it rough and start to pull yo' hair
Cause ecstasy's yo' destination and I'mma take you there
Tell me a secret baby

[Hook: Ne-Yo]
Tell me somethin that nobody else knows
Girl don't think about it, just soon as the door cloooose
Tell me a secret baby
Tell, tell, tell me a secret baby
Oooh, show me somethin that nobody else sees (ayyy)
Tell me all the things that you would do if it was you and me
Tell me a secret baby
Tell, tell, tell me a secret baby

[Verse 2: Ludacris]
It ain't nobody in the universe that competes with you
Imagine the possibilities and all the little freaky thangs that we could do
Blindfolded handcuffed to the headboard, never let you go until you scream my name
Maybe you think I'm playin but this is really far from a motherfuckin game
Ain't a damn thang change still nasty as I wanna, be
And I got just what you been lookin for baby girl you wanna, see
It'll turn you on and it's gonna be on soon as I take it off
Just give me yo' body, it's guaranteed that I'mma break it off
Off off off, off until the sunrise
And I'm not here to disappoint, just give me one try
One kiss, one pinch and you could take or leave it
But before you make up your mind just tell me one secret
Ne-Yo, holla at 'em

[Hook: Ne-Yo]
Tell me somethin that nobody else knows
Girl don't think about it, just soon as the door cloooose
Tell me a secret baby
Tell, tell, tell me a secret baby
Oooh, show me somethin that nobody else sees (ayyy)
Tell me all the things that you would do if it was you and me
Tell me a secret baby
Tell, tell, tell me a secret baby

[Verse 3: Ne-Yo]
Said we can talk about your fantasy
And ain't nobody gotta know but me
Baby c'mon and make this move if you're gonna
Baby we grown, we can do what we wanna, hey
Said you can tell me what you like to do
Baby girl you never know, I may like it too
Baby c'mon and make this move if you're gonna
Baby we grown, we can do what we wanna, ayyyyy

[Hook: Ne-Yo]
Tell me somethin that nobody else knows
Girl don't think about it, just soon as the door cloooose
Tell me a secret baby
Tell, tell, tell me a secret baby
Oooh, show me somethin that nobody else sees (ayyy)
Tell me all the things that you would do if it was you and me
Tell me a secret baby
Tell, tell, tell me a secret baby

[Outro: Ne-Yo]
Whoa-ohhh-ohhh-ohhhh
Whoa-ohhh-ohhh-ohhhh
Oooh-ooooh, oh yeah
Mmm, tell me a secret yeah
Whoa-ohhh-ohhh-ohhhh
Whoa-ohhh-ohhh-ohhhh
Oooh-ooooh

[Ludacris]
Yeah
Gotta feel me on this one
Ain't none of this shit happen overnight
We talking about a long time coming motherfucker

[Hook 2X: Dolla Boy] + (Tity Boi)
It ain't clean on these streets(uh, uh)
It's mean on these streets(yeah)
Blocks up, hats down
Fiends on these these streets
(So please pay attention when you coming around
Cause the blocks got it's eyebrows down, ya heard me)

[Verse One: Ludacris]
I'm still back for the first damn time
So grab a hold of your seat while I OPEN YOUR MIND
And take you back from when I dropped down from heaven
And I came on my moms and I had a MIC as my fucking weapon
When I was three I was just a little G
But if you looked in my eyes you would see the future of a real MC
And when i was nine I wrote my first ryhme
Soon rapping became one of my favorite pasttimes
Everywhere that I went spitting and dabbling
Showing my ass growing up and started traveling
From one city to the next luda landed in the ATL
Where the pimps and the players dwell
I made a tape did shows and got EX-PO-SURE
And kept learning as my black ass got OLDER
No matter what I just kept at my trade
I made mistakes but still stayed sharper than a GINSUI BLADE

[Hook] X2

[Verse Two: Ludacris]
Age 14, my talent show, a beast out of cage
Would have won, but got disqualified for JUMPING OFF STAGE
But I didn't care cause this game started to open it's arms
When I was at Banaker High School pulling fire alarms
So I could get a crowd around me make a name for my BLOCK
People told me keep flowing they didn't want me to STOP
Back when big nose John was my human beatbox
Skipped out on school hit open campus and look out for street COPS
Now I'm known around the town as that "Nigga who raps"
From the hill of Maze high to them G roll traps
And I was still making demos perfecting the craft
Some said I wouldn't make it they would giggle and laugh
So I picked up a couple books from DONALD GOINES
About the busimess of this shit and how to FLIP A FEW COINS
By the age of eighteen I was destined to MAKE IT
My bank account read DISTURBING THE PEACE INCORPORATED

[Hook] X2

[Verse Three: Ludacris]
Age 18, I'm struggling just to survive
But I got a gig working for change at 97.5
Now I'm rapping on the radio increasing their NUMBERS
Still Ludacris, but Alias was Chris LOVA, LOVA
Late nights I'm in the studio using they tools
Me and Poon was smoking weed and breaking all of they rtules
And I was krunk, ALL THE BIG WIGS WAS HEARING MY SONGS
But nobody did SHIT and they was taking too long
Three years went past and I saved enough cash
To make my own record company and put my self on BLAST
The album was independent it was just for the streets
I sold one thousand copies in my first fucking week
Then went on to sell fifty, put the cash in my hand
All the record companies biting, but I chose Def Jam
The main reason that I made it and I love the A town
Was because the BLOCK had it's EYEBROWS DOWN, ya heard me

[Hook] X2

[Outro: Ludacris]
Yah, Ive' been waiting a lifetime to get what the fuck I got
It's real man
Hardest working nigga in show business
Believe that
Shout out to Lil fate, I dub, Chaka Zulu
Yah Woo
The people's music I used to play some happy and some jealous
Cause I'm showered with cash and they can't remove they umbrellas
The people's music I used to play some happy and some jealous
Cause I'm showered with cash and they can't remove they umbrellas
Uh
{*music fades*}
You hear it raining don't ya
You hear it rain
Gangsta whitewalls, TV antennas in the back (the back, the back...)

[Hook]
I wanna (diamond in the back)
I wanna (sunroof top)
I wanna (diggin' the scene with a gangsta lean)
I wanna (diamond in the back)
I wanna (sunroof top)
I wanna (diggin' the scene with a gangsta lean)
I wanna (diamond in the back)
I wanna (sunroof top)
I wanna (diggin' the scene with a gangsta lean)
I wanna (diamond in the back)
And I wanna (sunroof top)
I wanna (diggin' the scene with a gangsta lean)
Diamond in the, diamond in the, diamond in the...

[Verse 1]
It's hard growin' up lookin' at drug dealers wit' all this paper
Wonderin' how I can get me some
My family's strugglin', I'm buggin', sittin' on my porch
So confused, chewin' on some bubblegum
I was always taught to use my manners with the misses
But please, stay away from the hoes and snitches
And I was always reached for the sky, I dont know why
Ima little bitty kid wit' a whole buncha gangsta wishes
When I grow up, you just wait, Ima be so straight
And everything's gonna be so marvelous
No more borrowin' from the neighbors, no more haters
No more blowin' Nintendo cartridges
Ima have it made in the shade, Ima be so paid
And my fam, get 'em off that payin' them bills
Matta fact Im schemin' my way on up out this hood, I'll be good
When I ditch these trainin' wheels

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I'm sick and tired of ridin' public transportation
Been patient waitin' on my set of wheels
I'm willin' to do what it takes, whatever the stakes
In order to get myself some dollar bills
It's too many holes in my socks, and I'm ready to box
Anyone tellin' me I need better shoes
And I ain't the only one trippin', or makin a fuss
My older cousin need some cheddar too
He thinkin' 'bout comin' up on the lick, to get it quick
It involves that local corner store
I overheard him say he knew who works there
And whatever they do, dont let the owner know
I hope he come back with enough to let me borrow some change
At least for the summer
And if he dont let me borrow nothin, but ask me what I want
Ima tell him I wanna...

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Why can't I walk with a limp mama? won't be no drama
For goodness sakes, Im just a kid
Had to get my whoopin' in fo's, I was just a po'
Like there no remorse for what I did
Gotta learn the hard way, when runnin' them streets
How some just creep, really just to eat a meal
"I coulda swore it was mine," what I used to tell the po-pos
What I left to rob and steal
Man, I gotta earn for a livin', ain't nobody givin' me nothin'
Find somethin' I love to do
Hmm, what about that pimpin'? It's good tippin'
Tax free, and I know a lot of people that love to screw
Yeah, it's just a way of the world, with boys and girls
I'm adjustin' to my environment
This government cheatin' us, so I'll cheat 'em back
Why can't work feel like retirement?

[Hook]

Gangsta, gangsta, gangsta...
Hey! Thank all y'all for coming out tonight
It was a beautiful night tonight at The Shizznit
Where pimping ain't dead, these hoes just scared
Thanks Snoop Dogg, Ludacris, all the players from the LBC
It was a beautiful night tonight
Oh, look at these fools, Ay! Security! Come get these niggas!

[Verse 1 - Luda] + (Snoop)
Fresh off the streets, just finished a show in Long Beach
Ready to relax, kick up my feet
Maybe smoke a blunt or two, that's what I wanna do
Broke out and called up the homeboy Snoop (What happenin' nephew?)
Oh, nothing just called, looking for some women how can fondle my balls
(Well you hit the right dogg, I can help you with that
Gimme 15 minutes, and I'll hit you rite back)
Off to the hotel, I was ready indeed
Slapped the button in the 'llac to control the speed
Put one up in the air, the cops just stared
Waved my hands out the roof like I just ain't care
Got to the tele and I slid through the door
On to the elevator, hit the penthouse floor
And what would happen next only time could tell
Cuz I got up to my room, and I was mad as hell (Aaah! Damn!)

[Hook]
Who let these hoes in my room? (These hoes)
Who let these hoes in my room?
Who let these hoes in my room? (Did you let 'em in?)
Who let these hoes in my room? (These hoes)
Who let these hoes in my room?

[Verse 2 - Luda]
Now it was five bap hoes and they look like trash
But one was midget, so we'll just say four and a half
I was stuck speechless, couldn't believe my eyes
What'd I do to deserve this unpleasant surprise?
And I was thinking to myself, "This is just my luck"
Then my nigga bust in like "What the fuck!?"
(Oh shit it's Snoop!)

[Snoop] + (Luda)
Who in the hell let them booger bears out they cell (Not me)
And what they doing in ya' room? Nigga make 'em bail (Yeah)
Got some fine bitches, dime bitches on they way (Okay)
And told security, "Let 'em in, with no delay" (Ha Ha!)
So when they get here, they'll probably be like half naked (woo!)
Don't mean to trip out, but bitch y'all got to dip out (Dip Out!)
Catch the elevator up one floor
Presidential with the sliding key for the door (Oh No!)
What the fuck going on?
Shit, all around the world Luda, then it's the same song
Them bitches was so ugly, I told 'em to go home

[Hook]
Who let these hoes in my room?
(Man who let these hoes in my room?)
Who let these hoes in my room? (Oh no!)
(Did you let 'em in?)
Who let these hoes in my room?
(Well who let 'em in then?)
Who let these hoes in my room? (Get out!)

[Verse 3 - Luda] + (Snoop)
Now, these chicks wouldn't leave, they was ready to clown
One was 5'6 and weighed three hundred pounds
(No she didn't come through with a thong on
She did for the hell of it, big fat whale of it)
You can't separate me, I'mma separate you
Bitch ya' pussy smell like Pepe Le Pew
(You filthy, nasty, sick in the head
Sitting in my dressing room with dick on ya' bread)
She said "I want you to climb in this underwear, silly"
But I was turned off by her tupperware titties
(Fake bitches, break bitches, make bitches
Kick rocks, when they fucked up in they face
Tick-tock, you gots to get up out my space
Hey Ludacris let's get the fuck up out this place, let's bounce)
Then it got to my head, and something reminded me
I know who let 'em in, it was Bill O'Reilly (Faggot)
(Ya' white bread, chicken-shit nigga!)

[Hook]
Who let these hoes in my room?
(Who let these hoes in my room?)
Who let these hoes in my room? (Did you let 'em in?)
Who let these hoes in my room?
(I need to know, who let these hoes in?)
Who let these hoes in my room?

[Snoop Dogg]
Ay, ay y'all gotta go
Y'all gotta get the fuck up outta here, ugly ass bitches
I dont understand how these bitches always get in my dressing room
You know what I'm sayin'?
Soon as I get off stage
It's 7 or 8 ugly ass bitches posted up in my dressing room
And security act like they don't know who did it
I know you feel what I'm sayin', all my nigga around the whole world
We need to form a society or something
Fat, gorilla, monkey mouth bitches
Can't get in our motherfucking dressing room or backstage
And if they do, we kindly put our foot up their asses
And re-direct them bitches to security dressing room, you dig?
Sick of these ugly ass bitches being my dressing room
(*Man coughs*)
(*Man talking*)
Ah yeah, we sending this one out
From everybody I mean to everybody from the H-Town to the A-Town to worldwide
So get your lighters, get your drink
And I tell you what I'm so fucked up, and screwed up
If anybody try to blow my high, you know what I'mma tell 'em

(Chorus)

[Man] Ludacris

[Fuck you!] Fuck you!

[Fuck you!] Fuck you!

[Fuck you!] Fuck you!

[Fuck you!] Fuck you!

[I'm screwed up]

[Ludacris]
I feel better than I've ever felt before, Ah!
Intoxicated but maintaining self-control, Ah!
I took a swig, I had a jug, chug-a-log, I'm loud and clear
I had some bud, I lit it up, and then I made it disappear
Cause my magic tricks, are so fabulous
This shit's hazardous, got amateurs smoking canibus
If you mad at this, damn it then
(Chorus)

[Lil' Flip]
I made a, call to my dog, time to split the blunt and break it up
Three-wheel motion, purple potion, I gotta shake it up
I tried to kick the habit, but it keep calling me
Abracadabra, here's a magic trick, I smoked up all the weed
Zig-Zag's and golden wraps got my mind gone
Drugs don't affect my work, I still get my grind on

(Chorus)

[Ludacris]
I'm leaning like the Tower of Pisa, the syrup squeezer
Come close to my stash, and get treated as if I'm Ebeneezer
I'm throwed, blowed, matter-of-fact let's call this the thrower potion
I'm screwed up, so no wonder things are in slower motion
I gots to have it,can't kick the habit, I've tried to shake it
The drug experiment stage if you mistake then

(Chorus)

[Lil' Flip]
I'm from Screwed Up Texas, we drive reckless, and then we peel off
You ain't had shit until you smoke Sweet Tooth and Jack Frost
Hit it twice but don't cough, you gotta take it man
If it's a record for smoking I'm 'bout to break it man
Me and Luda puffing budda, we in a black Cougar
On Zap Judas, you try to jack us we grab rugers
(Chorus)

[Ludacris]
How can I say it plain?
That I'm off that Mary Jane
And if it's true what they say
Then I don't know how many cells is left in my fucking brain
But I'mma keep on writing and lighting
Minds of these hungry rappers
And tell the hood that I've hired niggas and fired crackers
On the Fourth of July, opens your eyes I'm joking stupid
I love all races but if you hating my music then

(Chorus)

[Lil' Flip]
I love my
I get patient we never have to take a piss test
Fuck a 9 to 5 cause I'm always getting rest
I wake to breakfest and head
You wake up to breakfast in bed
Should I drive my H2? Hmmm?
I'mma take the Lexus instead
Pimping ain't dead but I'll leave you niggas
Dead from all this pimping
I'm riding spinners like a pimp
That's why I'm limping
(Chorus)

[Ludacris]
Off substances that's controlled
That's how this story goes
I popped the cap, broke the ice
And Lil' Flip done broke the mold
I'm so cold I think I, see dead people
Nah, that's just my homies passed out in the Regal
Believe it, the potency is so strong, if you notice me
I'm calm, cool, and collected and if you, disrespect it

(Chorus)

[Lil' Flip]
We doing this for them players that bank screw music
We don't pass out after 8 blunts, because we used to it
Me and Cris like cheech & chong
So hurry, break out the weed and the bong
Cause if it ain't Grade A trees, we gotta leave it alone
And to my homie screw, you know I gotta hold it down
And if they want it then they gotta come and take the crown

(Chorus)

(*Man talking*)
Hahahahahaha So there you have it
Sending this one out to all my drinkers and all my smokers
United and lighted we stand inebriated we fall
And if you wanna pass the sobriety and breathalyzer test
Here's a quick Luda tip some packets of mustard in your car
Keep mustard god damn it and whoever said the south can't rhyme

(Chorus)
(*female moaning noises mixed in with the beat*)

[Hook]
HEY, we gonna be havin some fun and (ca, ca, ca)
Cause two is better than one and (some, some, some)
Somebody kill the lights
We doin freaky (freaky) (freaky) freaky shit tonight (YAY)

[Verse 1]
Double the pleasures, like double the fun
How many licks does it take the center of a Ludapop, double the tongue
Who knows, plus I gotta undress 'em, caress 'em, bless 'em
Steady keep 'em guessin, if that doesn't impress 'em
Then slowly move on to the second lesson
WHOA! panties droppin, body rockin, Magnum's poppin
It's eight cheeks and fo' titties, y'all better hand me somethin
Hey ladies (whoa) on your mark get ready get set go
Play for hours in and out the shower
This dick powered we in CONTROL

[Hook] - 2X

[Verse 2]
Six hands grippin the sheets, thirty toes that curl
What in the world is goin on, to the break a, break a dawn
With that man and them girls
Cause three hearts are beatin fast, but only two people screamin
We comin together for one cause, other than hear ourselves breathin
Get in the game and start workin it out and diggin it out
Now lean to the side, throw a dick in your mouth
You gotta get in the groove, you got nothin to lose
So don't move 'til you figured it out
And keep makin that face, while I'm rubbin them spots
And we can take turns, while the other one watch
And see how good she be takin them shots
And wake up the hood, 'til they callin the cops, mayn

[Hook] - 2X

[Verse 3]
Now I'm ready to rock, so you can get your tools and you can start the ignition
I'm grabbin perms, wigs, weaves, ponytails and extensions
Not to mention it's gonna get HOT, better come ready to SWEAT
I make women cum harder than jacuzzi jets
And I'm willin to bet that I be keepin it wet, cause I feel ya
Little bit of ring in the neck it won't kill ya
Put me on the top or the bottom and I'll drill ya
Givin how you wanted to get it to fulfill ya
And I'll pill ya back to back
So get ready for the mack attack
That got me thinkin they some acrobats
The way they puttin it from sack to sack, cause the mack is back
And I'm gone

[Hook] - 4X

[Intro]
Hey, yeah! I want all you proud sistas to stand up
I want everybody to stand up and be counted tonight
Brothers and Sisters if you know you got your thing together
I want you to stand on up, now I got somethin' to tell ya'
I told ya' how to think about it, now I want to tell how to get the thing together
So come on now and get up to it yall

[Verse 1]
The incredible, untouchable nigga spittin' venom out his body wit' the dopest flows
And wonder why the line's around the corner
Cuz the little motherfucker has the dopest shows
So one time for my independant women and all the single mothers who be gettin' that cake
Two times for my dawgs pullin' triggers
And my niggas in the kitchen that be flippin' that weight
East coast, west coast, midwest, dirty south
Then we took it all around the world
I got fans in retirement homes, to teenagers, to little bitty boys and girls
Droppin' lyrical bombs up in ya' hood
Non-stoppin', I'mma hit 'em till the block explode
Hip hop, R&B, Pop-tart, what you want?
I even got a little rock 'n' roll
The most creative, original, got 'em takin' subliminal
*Boom boom* cuz they can't get what I gots
They want it so bad, four million dollar pad
And enough to retire off two albums, gone, wave ya' white flags, I'm hot!
And everytime I rhyme I'm puttin' rappers in the ground
Wit' lines that got 'em hooked like dope
They gotta make up they mind, because they runnin' outta time
And I'm about to make 'em choke
Better turn your stereo louder, listen up and let me preach
Let's get arrested for Disturbin' the Peace! (C'mon)

[Unnamed male]
Man! This Disturbin' Tha Peace shit gettin' on my nerves
Boy I tell you the truth, know what I'm sayin'?
While he doin' shows, I'm in these skreets, know what I'm sayin'?
While he on tv, I'm in these skreets
And then my broad, my kid walkin' around singin' it
Boy, if they sing another verse, boy I swear
Know what I'm sayin'? I'm on another level though
I gotta car wash, I gotta shop on O' National
I got my own record label, you heard of us
The Posse Family Cartel, you know what I'm sayin', we real
Who this nigga thing he is?

[Verse 2]
I'mma house hold name, wit' game spittin' outta my mouth at all times
I spit it out and about, and spit outta the south,until they recognize the danger signs
So feel a tingle in yo' s-spine, by the way I talk
And it's pimpin' in my blood, you can tell by the way I walk
Ooh lawd, more styles than a barber shop, call the cops
People in the way wanna baller block
Little do they know that I'm callin' shots
And I'm not to be fucked with
If you see me comin' 'round the corner, then duck quick, perpetrators can suck dick
I tried to tell 'em, but they dont wanna listen
I tried to shine 'em, but they dont wanna glisten, while the high hat keeps on tickin'
And the kick drum keep on pumpin', I'm dumpin' on the closest fools
Cuz rules were made to be broken, but you can't make broken rules
Hear what I'm sayin' or heard what I said
Hear what they playin', cuz thru this music I'mma still be heard if I'm dead
Call ya' producers, cuz I'm hurtin' these beats
I said it once, I'll say it twice, biatch, Disturbin' Tha Peace
C'mon
Yeah, folk
The King of the kings has spoken
ATL shawty! Hood to hood, block to block
We bouta let our nuts hang!
Disturbin' Tha Peace!
We dont die, we multiply
We makin Def Jam history
Thanks for gettin' the CD shawty!

[Intro: Chimere]
Ooh, hey yeah
Do you know how to leave, ride...ride

[Verse 1: Ludacris]
Ya see, it started off in St. Paul from the street of Old Nash
And it feels so good to escape and just kick it and laugh
My clan had to bring the ruckus 'cause we had the cream
All you can eat over at Ryan's or some fish at Gaseen's
And I had to fix a good bag and make decisions and haste
'Cause soul food ain't the motherfuckin' thang to waste
So let's get looney up on the set 'cause I got five on the fire
Will slide to East Point and make our way to Black Rirer
Lookin' like OutKast on the spot smokin' blunts and
Hit the liquor store got up, got out and got something
That eightball, so I can do some space age pimpin'
My blood stay young off 45's Colt and chicken
Camels and Rolls filled with d's and Vogues
And playas mackin' them hoes, in dyke clothes
Comin' up slammin' Caddy doors
In Southwest, we'll take it to yo chest
And we got it locked like some niggas on house arrest
'Cause we ridin'

[Chorus: Chimere]
Ridin' on that midnight train to Georgia, ride
Ridin' on that midnight train to Georgia, ride

[Verse 2: Ludacris]
It's just one of those days when I can kick it like this and like that
It's a free day, my folks got rowdy way back
I right off of Cascade or Ralph David Abernathy
I shall proceed and continue to keep my roots nappy
'Cause afros in all seasons, they keep me warm
Some livin' that thug life so how long will they mourn
I still ride, that's why I bounce my way to bank-bed
I'm so bad that I'll knock you out, that's what my mama said
Sippin' on brandy, sunny days with my best friends
Today you see and then you cruise through the West end
They should've said it was Six Flags Over Georgia
Then underground, my Tuesdays would be packed when I got older
If I told you one, I told ya ass a thousand times
I got em' all in check when it comes to bustin' rhymes
Don't sweat the technique 'cause I just move the crowd
My mob's deep of alcoholics, people label us loud because we ride

[Chorus: Chimere]
Ridin' on that midnight train to Georgia, ride
Ridin' on that midnight train to Georgia, ride

[Verse 3: Ludacris]
See I felt my bones jump as I crossed the road
I heard the squad was wiped up so I flipped my mode
On my way to D-E-C, baby can't you see
That Decatur is totally to B-I-G for thee
Lost Boyz ridin' around in Jeeps, Lex Luth's, and Beamers
Yo cars get scooped just like Regina carpet cleaners
It's Stone Mountain Cats puttin' it down
They played Kurupt so I just gave all my dogs a pound
Now my conflict was crucial off some hay I smoked
I should be gettin' it 'cause life is too got damn short
And now my mind's playin' tricks and my boys actin' ghetto
Back to the C-P, I put the pedal to the metal
God bless the child that's just got his own
Since I was a juvenile makin' cash money at home
I'm from a boy to a man, I've reached the end of my road
It's Ludacris signin' off till the next episode, let's ride

[Chorus: Chimere]
Ridin' on that midnight train to Georgia, ride
Ridin' on that midnight train to Georgia, ride

[Verse 4: Ludacris]
'Cause it's the A-T-L
Where all the pimps and the playas just dwell
We get the cash and the ass then bail
We leave a trace but never leave a trail
Say it again
Where all the pimps and the playas just dwell
We get the cash and the ass then bail
We leave a trace but never leave a trail

[Outro: Chimere ad-libs]

[Intro: Ludacris]
Yeah, uhh

And how long will it take it to get back back back back..?
Yes indeed, I'm a little off track track track track..
Off this weed, and I'm full of that 'gnac 'gnac 'gnac 'gnac..
Get on in that stankin Lincoln, crank it up, and riiide

I mighta had to pay some extra buuuuuuuucks
But I really don't give a fuuuuuuuuuuck
Cause a brother feels great great great great..
But I'm barely awake wake wake wake..
All bent out of shape shape shape shape..
So stomp on yo' brake brake brake brake..
If you tokin good then all the smokers, let me see, your flame
Don't know what you got but my bag'll, put yo' stuff, to shame
All the different kinds and other flavors, they don't mean, a thang
You can't compare it don't stare cause I got the ultimate Mary Jane

[Hook: Sleepy Brown]
Get your lighters, roll that sticky, let's get higher (let's get higher)
Got that blueberry yum yum and it's that fire (it's that fire)
Get your lighters, roll that sticky, let's get higher (let's get higher)
Got that blueberry yum yum and it's that fire (it's that fire)

[Chorus]
They wanna know why I hit like that, spit like that, shit like that
Maybe 'cause I get like that, kick like that, rip like that
They wanna know why I rhyme like that, shine like that, climb like that
'Cause the world is mine like that (yours like that) mine like that
They wanna know why I hit like that, spit like that, shit like that
Maybe 'cause I get like that, kick like that, rip like that
They wanna know why I rhyme like that, shine like that, climb like that
'Cause the world is mine like that (yours like that) mine like that

[Verse 1]
Uh, you can get your whole crew, even niggas that owe you, and ain't paid you shit
You can drink some cold brews and throw on them old shoes and jump in the whip
You can come and find us, and be right behind us and insert the clip
You hear something go "clack" "clack" "clack", somebody went down, but it wasn't us
You can sell about two mil, get hooked with a good deal and start stackin' dough
You can ride your mobile, get 20 inch big wheels and collect some hoes
You can even start eatin' good and smokin' good but you pressin' your luck
And you say wha', somebody went bankrupt shit but it wasn't us

[Chorus]
They wanna know why I hit like that, spit like that, shit like that
Maybe 'cause I get like that, kick like that, rip like that
They wanna know why I rhyme like that, shine like that, climb like that
'Cause the world is mine like that (yours like that) mine like that
They wanna know why I hit like that, spit like that, shit like that
Maybe 'cause I get like that, kick like that, rip like that
They wanna know why I rhyme like that, shine like that, climb like that
'Cause the world is mine like that (yours like that) mine like that

[Verse 2]
You can go to the drawing board and just start from scratch all over again clean
Or you can tell a bunch of officers that I'm the one to catch but my niggas are the police
You can try to blame me and even try to frame me but I'll make the bail
Now somebody's goin' to jail, shit, but it wasn't us
You do track after track, and your walls get plaque after plaque
CD's on rack after rack, no mo' sellin' sack after sack
You could've had that good life, good kids and a good wife, it was yours to earn
But the record stores gettin' returns, shit, but it wasn't us

[Chorus]
They wanna know why I hit like that, spit like that, shit like that
Maybe 'cause I get like that, kick like that, rip like that
They wanna know why I rhyme like that, shine like that, climb like that
'Cause the world is mine like that (yours like that) mine like that
They wanna know why I hit like that, spit like that, shit like that
Maybe 'cause I get like that, kick like that, rip like that
They wanna know why I rhyme like that, shine like that, climb like that
'Cause the world is mine like that (yours like that) mine like that

[Verse 3]
You could be goin' on worldwide tours and see your face on every magazine
Or you can flip through channel after channel and see that ass on the TV screen
You can pay for expensive videos and have whole lot of big bootie hoes
But when the shit start comin' to a close, shit, but it wasn't us
You can use your back-up plan, and even call up your back-up man and start thinkin' quick
You can call up the back-up hoes, even call up the back-up pros and tell 'em to suck a dick
Then you tell just to get deez, then you tell 'em just to pay the fees and to pay their dues
Now they catchin' those STD's, shit, but it wasn't us

[Chorus]
They wanna know why I hit like that, spit like that, shit like that
Maybe 'cause I get like that, kick like that, rip like that
They wanna know why I rhyme like that, shine like that, climb like that
'Cause the world is mine like that (yours like that) mine like that
They wanna know why I hit like that, spit like that, shit like that
Maybe 'cause I get like that, kick like that, rip like that
They wanna know why I rhyme like that, shine like that, climb like that
'Cause the world is mine like that (yours like that) mine like that

[Hook]

[Hook 4X: Clive Reville]
In this life, one thing counts
In the bank, large amounts

[Ludacris - over end of Hook]
This life, that's all that everybody care about man, money
That's all everybody want nigga that's gon' solve all your problems
It's the BEGINNING of yo' problems, man listen here, look

[Ludacris]
Now everybody wants a piece of my pockets
And it don't help when I'm screamin on these records that I'm rich
Callin people from my number, now I block it
Cause ain't nothin worse than gettin haunted by a stalkin-ass bitch!
Oh yeah! Cause good game, I talk it
And yet you so true, some women'll have you feelin blue like Crips
I lay my feet upon the path and I walk it
I spread my wealth out or someone close'll have me layin in a ditch!
I've had my friends steal from me (yup) snatch my credit card
Out my wallet, hit the town and leave outstandin bills for me
They say I got the cash fo' it, and I can't recall
One single member of my family that never asked fo' it
They be kickin down doors, and bustin out floors
Can't get me on the phone so they'll surprise me at my shows
And everybody needs a loan plus they say they won't blow it
All I hear is, "C'mon cuz - you know I'm good fo' it!" Man..

[Hook]

[Ludacris - over Hook]
And I got one of the biggest families y'all ever seen in y'all life man
Imagine that - fourth and fifth and sixth cousins
Callin me and shit I don't even know who these..
I ain't never met these people in my life!
Momma I KNOW you ain't givin these people my number
I know you so you wouldn't do it, but y'all my family
I guess it's only right for y'all to ask me
If if you had it, knahmsayin, maybe I'd ask YOU
It's crazy man, but look here

[Ludacris]
Now don't get me wrong, cause bein rich is such a beautiful thing
But mo' money, mo' problems, people drive me insane
Not givin no handouts no mo', some take advantage and flee
My goal's to set my friends up to make some paper like me
Put 'em in position to make they wishes come - true
So they can have multiple accounts that gain interest overnight
Given a million dollars what you gon', do?
Map your life out for your kid's kids, or would you spent it overnight?
Now see me I'll do both, I got unlimited funds
My daughter's life was set before her stankin butt turned one
And it don't help that I got fo' or five retirement funds
So if I choose before I'm thirty I can lay in the sun
My dividends can show and prove the REAL meanin of fun
That's why I live by the sword but you can die by my gun
The IRS'll never sweat me or even put up a fight
Cause I'm sure I've paid more in taxes than you've made in yo' LIFE, because

[Hook]

[Ludacris - over Hook]
Don't play with that IRS man, I'll swear, ain't nothin more embarassin
Than havin them come take all yo' shit out yo' crib man
Don't think it can't happen to you man, I'm tellin you man
Just like games on the street collect tax
The government markin income towards collectin tax
It happened to some of our heroes, Redd Foxx, Willie Nelson
Peabo Bryson, knocked out one of yo' cribs, you don't even know it man
(Whattup J.D.?) Women don't like a nigga who got the IRS all on they ass
I'mma tell you like this

[Ludacris]
And women these days don't want a man without a nice paycheck
So we splurge, even though our lives ain't in the right place yet
Buyin jewelry and some cars just to impress these whores
Meanwhile your child's poor like, "Daddy what you left me for?"
Yeah but it all comes back, that's why I named my daughter Karma
Who's teachin me the lesson of life and makin me smarter
I sweep her off her feet cause I'm her knight in shinin armor
And I'll have your FUCKIN HEAD if anybody tries to harm her (kill yo' ass)
Gotta teach her about the game that most us niggas'll spit
And about these scandalous-ass women that get money through gifts
They'll suck a cold hard wood for some cold hard cash
Or ride a brother good then put a foot up on the gas
Of that brand new ride..
Pick up her friends while you slip and she slide..
Drop top Benz, gold diggers inside.. crazy what the world'll do for money
Thinkin that everything will be alright, cause

[Hook] - repeat to fade

[Ludacris - over Hook]
Yeh! They don't call it the root of all evil for nothin people
Listen to my words, believe what I'm tryin to tell you man
"Money can't change ME!" That's what e'rybody say man
But you know what, money really can't change me
I don't think it did, shit if it did somebody come tell me right now
Everybody talkin 'bout, "If I get rich I don't need all those cars
I only need one or two cars," BULLSHIT! Hahaha
I can't lie, I'm guilty of splurgin too man
'Til I learned the difference between assets and liabilities
Really important man, I swear
Sometimes I wish I didn't have all this money man
... nah I'm just playin, I'll work through my problems

[Hook 2X: Ludacris]
If you a lame motherfucker, get yo' ass out!
I'm from the A, I came to party 'til I pass out!
So if you with me and you tipsy throw your fist up!
If you got diamonds and they shinin throw your wrist up!

[Ludacris]
Hey hey
It's Luda Luda get it right I'm Mr. Money Machine
And I'm steady lookin for two women I can come in between
You can catch me chillin up in the cut but I'm always ready for ac-tion
I'm stunt, like Jackie Chan and lay low, like Rebbie Jack-son
Ma-xin and rela-xin, haters, do they really wanna test me mannnn
I got an arsenal waitin, do they really wanna catch me mannnn
No, I, don't, think, so
I've, got killers on the pay-roll if there's a, problem then say-so
I, make dough until there's none left
I run with plenty gangs that's holdin thangs
And rearrange your frame in one breath
So to keep on breathin I suggest you take this beatin
'Tis the season for bleedin and we've been lookin for a reason

[Hook]

[Ludacris]
Hey hey
Come holla at me, I'm a star, I got the hood on smash
You know me! My whole car smell like a woodshop class
I point 'em out like her, her, that girl with the mouth
Plus you and your friends
Let me show you some whips that don't come out 'til the year of 2010
So I'm flockin 'em in, 'til the droptop is rockin again
Boy I got it locked, if you think not, then you'll get popped in the chin
And I'm clockin these ends, my record sales are blockin 'em in
Gotta thank those blessed to walk the streets to those that's locked in the pen
My entourage is game faces, mean muggin, mean muggin
Now the media is convinced that we thuggin, we thuggin
Momma told me grow up to be somethin, be somethin
I went diamond with this album so we buckin, we buckin

[Hook]

[Ludacris]
I'm so far ahead it's only RIGHT for you to hate on me mayne
When I'm pushin 90 by myself up in the H.O.V. lane
They tryin to figure how many mo' women that I can take on my plane
Bein one of the few rappers responsible for changin the game
Now desperate artists tryin to sue but they just makin some claims
Can't get in the spotlight for NOTHIN and it just makes 'em insane
That's why some of the niggas resort right back to bakin that 'caine
And sellin it off to junky monkeys who keep bakin they brain
As they grow older they'll be feelin a lot of achin and pain
So right at the head they might as well just be aimin that thang
And you ain't helpin the process out by always cakin these dames
But it is hard givin up the place where they be shakin they thangs

[Hook]

[Hook 2X: Nate Dogg]
It's gonna get in ya, child of the night
(baby I got) and the hood rolls on
How do I begin to, do this shit right
(baby I got) get my hustle on

[Verse 1: Ludacris]
Look here!
Now I'm a man of many talents and a man of my word
But on my path to see the light sometimes my vision gets blurred
It's all a part of growin up and seein life at it's worst
Then tryin to iron out my wrinkles, puttin family first
It seems like the whole world is out for sinkin my boat
But with God as my navigator I'll be stayin afloat
And I admit to bein caught by many foolish distractions
Then I'm forced to pay the price as the result of my actions
I'm battlin with MYSELF and every DAY it's a war
Curiosity killed the cat, why I'm Curious George?
Gotta keep my nose up outta thangs that ain't none of my biz
And just cause somethin looks good don't really mean that it is
Get through the agony and anger, the pain and strife
And take the necessary steps to try to change my life
I got some questions for you Lord cause my mentality's hood
So why is everything that's bad for me feel so good?

[Hook: Nate Dogg]
It's gonna get in ya, child of the night
(baby I got) and the hood rolls on
How do I begin to, do this shit right
(baby I got) get my hustle on
It's gonna get in ya, child of the night
(baby I got) and the hood rolls on
How do I begin to, do this shit right
(baby I got) get my hustle on

[Verse 2: Ludacris]
Now I'm a only child, so excuse some of my selfish ways
I got spoiled when I was young, spoil myself today
Oh but I feed at least a thousand stomachs and how I've done it
Is from the ground up a hundred miles and runnin
Dodgin and duckin everybody tryin to hammer me down
A self-made millionaire, baby look at me now
Can't tell me nothin still hungry as the day I began
Cause all I ever really needed was a pen in my hand
And a, pad in my lap, didn't matter in fact
Me and my momma lived in one room, and what's badder than that
Was a young man forced to grow up at the age of 12
Tryin to get in where I fit, streets givin me hell
But yet I give it right - back, so how you like - that
Continue doin wrong 'til I was on the right - track
Tell me 'bout heavy money I might give it a PUSH
But a, bird in the hand is worth two in the bush
Come on

[Hook: Nate Dogg]
It's gonna get in ya, child of the night
(baby I got) and the hood rolls on
How do I begin to, do this shit right
(baby I got) get my hustle on
It's gonna get in ya, child of the night
(baby I got) and the hood rolls on
How do I begin to, do this shit right
(baby I got) get my hustle on

[Interlude: Ludacris]
No matter how much older we get man, we all still children at heart
We all make mistakes, it's all good

[Verse 3: Ludacris]
Now I've tried plenty of times to get rid of my bad habits
Livin life on the cuttin edge, takin a stab at it
And learnin from my mistakes, try not to make 'em twice
Just admittin when I'm wrong, tryin hard to make it right
And baby, nobody's perfect in this world of ours
There's plenty people gettin stitches in this world of scars
But over time, pray to God that he can heal your wounds
Try to love and love again until they seal your tomb
Cause life is short if you don't know this it'll pass you by
That's why my head is in the clouds tryin to pass the sky
Never blinkin for a minute, keep my eyes on my foes
They wanna catch me in the open, bring my life to a close
Meanwhile that's why I'm bringin so much life to my shows
I've seen smiles I'm makin changes turnin glitter to gold
Don't let these devils play you down or belittle your soul
Just be happy with yo'self and it's so simple to grow
Come on

[Hook to fade with adlibs: Nate Dogg]
It's gonna get in ya, child of the night
(baby I got) and the hood rolls on
How do I begin to, do this shit right
(baby I got) get my hustle on

[Hook: Bobby Valentino]
(Oh yeah) The fancy cars
The women and the caviar
You know who we are
Cause we're pimpin' all over the world
The fancy cars
The women and the caviar
You know who we are
Cause we're pimpin' all over the world

[Interlude: Ludacris]
Sing it, hoes (The world, the world, the world)
All over the world, baby
It's only right that I share my experiences with y'all
Cause I've been places you'll never imagine (That's right)
But I'ma start it at home
When I see a girl I like, I walk straight up to them and I'm like

[Verse 1: Ludacris]
Uh, hey girl, how you doin'?
You are the woman that I'm really pursuin'
And I would like to get to know ya, can you gimme ya name?
If you jot down ya number, you'll get mine in exchange, hey
See I'm the man of this town
And I hope you wouldn't mind if I showed you around
So when you go to certain places you'll be thinkin of me
We got people to meet and many places to see, hey
Mm, I'm really diggin' ya lips
But be careful where you walkin' when you swingin' them hips
I'm kinda concerned that you'll be causin' a crash
With your traffic jam booty, heads pausin' so fast, hey
I wouldn't trade you for the world, I swear it
I like ya hair and every style that you wear it
And how the colors coordinate with your clothes
From your manicured nails to your pedicured toes (Woo)

[Hook: Bobby Valentino]
(Oh yeah) The fancy cars
The women and the caviar
You know who we are
Cause we're pimpin' all over the world
The fancy cars
The women and the caviar
You know who we are
Cause we're pimpin' all over the world

[Verse 2: Ludacris]
Yeah, you hear the song so dance
Don't always think I'm tryna get in your pants
Um, cause see me, my pimpin's in 3D
I'm takin' you places you only see on TV
Tryna show ya how you livin' is trife
How many guys you know can bring the Travel Channel to life?
One day we on the Autobahn swervin', drivin'
Next day, we in the sun on the Virgin Islands
If you with me ain't no time to sleep
Especially at Wet Willies on Miami Beach
But I drop you off and pay you no attention
If make it to Atlanta's Brina Brothers convention
Then jump in the car and just ride for hours
Makin' sure I don't miss the homecoming at Howard
Hawaii to D.C., it's plenty women to see
So if yo ass don't show up, it's more women for me, hey

[Hook: Bobby Valentino]
(Oh yeah) The fancy cars
The women and the caviar
You know who we are
Cause we're pimpin' all over the world
The fancy cars
The women and the caviar
You know who we are
Cause we're pimpin' all over the world

[Verse 3: Ludacris]
I'm in New York at the Puerto Rican Day Parade
Then at night, I'm in New Orleans drinkin' hand grenades
Outnumbered by the dozens at the Jazz Fest
In Mardi Gras, all the women tryna show me they chest, ay
I'm in Jamaica spendin' massive bucks
While the ladies all beggin' me to mash it up
I had sad beginnings when I rapped with no fans
Now it's all happy endings on my lap in Japan, hey
I used to think that it was way too cold
'Til I went to Canada and saw some beautiful hoes
Now I hit the Caribana every year in Toronto
Then fly to Illinois to get a taste of Chicago
Uh, oh yet and still
You wouldn't believe your eyes if you went to Brazil
(But where the best at?) Ain't no need of even askin' brah
The best women all reside in Africa, and that's real (Woo)

[Hook: Bobby Valentino]
(Oh yeah) The fancy cars
The women and the caviar
You know who we are
Cause we're pimpin' all over the world
The fancy cars
The women and the caviar
You know who we are
Cause we're pimpin' all over the world

[Interlude: Ludacris]
Sing it, hoes (The world, the world, the world)

[Outro: Katt Williams]
Pimpin' pimpin' pimpin'
Ladies and gentlemen as we ride out
Can we have all the real pimps
Please put both of your pinky fingers high in the air?
Now ladies, look around with me
Let's see if we can weed some of these niggas out
Cause it ain't no way that all these niggas could be pimpin'
Now if you happen to see a nigga
With two sweat patches up under his arms
Look like he been swimmin' in shoulder height water
Please tell that nigga, "Put your hands down"
If you smell like you been at work all day and Drakkar
Please put your hands down
Now look up at the pinky fingers that are still in the air
If you see him ashy around the knuckles
Like the nigga wash half of his hands
And lotion three quarters of his body
Please say, "Put your hands down"
If your spinnin' rims spin counter clockwise, you are not pimpin'
If you are dancin' on the dancefloor
And you look to your left and your right
And there is not a woman in sight
Guess what? You guessed it - you are not pimpin'
If your vodka and cranberry is really really dark like blood
That's because you didn't order Vodka buddy
That's why it's three dollars a glass, a-put your hands down
Now look down, look down
I need, I need everybody to pull up your pants leg one time
Okay, you see the nigga with the white socks? Not pimpin'!
Sorry, unless you part of the Beat It entorauge
If your shoes have a buckle on 'em, you're not pimpin'

[Intro]
Yeah, baby! Hehe, yeah
(Woo!) Back again! (That's right)
Luda!
Hahahaha (Feel this)
It gets meaner and meaner each time, baby
Feeling real good, too (Holla at 'em, man)
What up, Uncle 'Face? (Yeah!)
Haha, haha
I'm a bull in this industry, man (Tell 'em)
Some would rather run down and get one cow (Nah)
I think I'd rather walk down and get 'em all—you know what I'm talking 'bout, right? (You know what's up, right?)
Look—

[Verse 1]
I'm never going nowhere, so don't try me
My music sticks in fans' veins like an IV
Flows poison like Ivy—oh, they grimy!
Already offers on my sixth album from labels tryna sign me
Respected highly; Hi, Mr. O'Reilly!
Hope all is well—kiss the plaintiff and the wifey
Drove through the window, the industry super sized me
Now, the girls see me and a river's what they cry me
I'm on the rise, so many people despise me
Got party ammunition for those tryna surprise me (Surprise!)
It's a celebration, and everyone should invite me
Roll with the crew or meet the bottom of our Nikes (Bow!)
Explorer like Dora—these Swipers can't swipe me
My whole aura's so mean in my white tee
Nobody light-skinned'ed repping harder since Ice-T
You disagree, take the Tyson approach and bite me!

[Hook]
Whoa! Don't slip up or get got ("Why not, man?")
I'm coming for that number-one spot (Alright, woo!)
Rappers swearing they on top (Nuh-uh, uh-uh)
But I'm coming for they number-one spot (Alright, man)
Scheme-scheme, plot-plot (Say what?)
I'm coming for that number-one spot! (Woo! Hey)
Keep it going—it won't stop ("What you doing, man?")
I'm coming for that number-one spot

[Verse 2]
Yes, indeed! Ludacris: I'm hotter than Nevada
Ready to break the steering column on your Impala
If I get caught, bail-out; po'-po'—I tell 'em, "Holla"
In court, I never show up, like Austin Powers' fa-zha
"Father, father," and hey, I love gold
But can buy anything I want from the records I've sold
Jacuzzi's hot, Cristal is so cold
Neighbors catch contacts from the blunts that I've rolled
A pig in a blanket, a shmoke and a pancake
Drop albums nonstop, once a year for my fans' sake
I crush mics until my hand breaks
Then shag now and shag later 'til these women can't stand straight
The Luda-meister got 'em feeling so randy
I'm double-X-L, so I call 'em my "eye candy"
Brush my shoulder and I pop my collar
'Cause I'm worth a million gazillion fafillion dollars

[Hook]
Whoa! Don't slip up or get got ("Why not, man?")
I'm coming for that number-one spot (Alright, woo!)
Rappers swearing they on top (Nuh-uh, uh-uh)
But I'm coming for they number-one spot (Alright, man)
Scheme-scheme, plot-plot (Say what?)
I'm coming for that number-one spot! (Woo! Hey)
Keep it going—it won't stop ("What you doing, man?")
I'm coming for that number-one spot

[Verse 3]
Causing lyrical disasters, it's the master
Make music for Mini-Mes, models and Fat Bastards
These women trying to get me out my Pelle Pelles
They strip off my clothes and tell me, "Get in my belly!"
Stay on the track, hit the ground running like Flo-Jo
Sent back in time, and I've never lost my mojo
Ladies and gentlemen, ahh, boys and girls
Ludacris sent down to take over the whole world

[Hook]
Whoa! Don't slip up or get got ("Why not, man?")
I'm coming for that number-one spot (Alright, woo!)
Rappers swearing they on top (Nuh-uh, uh-uh)
But I'm coming for they number-one spot (Alright, man)
Scheme-scheme, plot-plot (Say what?)
I'm coming for that number-one spot! (Woo! Hey)
Keep it going—it won't stop ("What you doing, man?")
I'm coming for that number-one spot

[Intro]
Heads up! (woop, woop) Heads up! (woop, woop)

And an-and another one
O-o-oh!

[Chorus]
Yeek yeek! (woop, woop) why you all in my ear?

Get back motherfucker, you don't know me like that!
(Get back motherfucker You don't know me like that)
Yeek yeek! (woop, woop) I ain't playing around!
Make one false move I'll take ya down
Get back motherfucker, you don't know me like that!
(Get back motherfucker You don't know me like that)

[Verse 1]
Who-o-o!! S-s-so c'mon, c'mon!
Don't get swung on, swung on!
It's the knick knack paddywhack, still ride in Cadillacs
Family off the street! made my homies put the baggies back
Still stacking plaques! (yep!) still action packed! (yep!)
And dough!! I keep it flipping like acrobats!
That's why I pack a mac, that'll crack 'em back
'Cause on my waist there's more Heat than the Shaq Attack
But I ain't speaking about ballin, ballin
Just thinking about brawlin till y'all start bawlin
We all in together now, birds of a feather now
Just bought a plane so we changing the weather now
So put your brakes on, caps put your capes on
Or knock off your block, get dropped and have your face flown
Cause I'll prove it! scratch off the music!
Like hey little stupid! don't make me lose it!!

[Chorus]
Yeek yeek! (woop, woop) why you all in my ear?
Talking a whole bunch of shit that I ain't trying to hear!
Get back motherfucker, you don't know me like that!

Yeek yeek! (woop, woop) I ain't playing around!
Make one false move I'll take ya down
Get back motherfucker, you don't know me like that!
(Get back motherfucker You don't know me like that)

[Bridge]

I came (I came) I saw (I saw)
I hit 'em right dead in the jaw (in the jaw)
I came (I came) I saw (I saw)
I hit 'em right dead in the jaw (in the jaw)

[Verse 2]
See I caught 'em wit a right hook, caught 'em wit a jab
Caught 'em wit an uppercut, kicked 'em in his ass
Sent him on his way cause I ain't for that talk!
No trips to the county, I ain't for that walk!
We split like two pins at the end of a lane
We'll knock out your spotlight and put an end to your vain
Put a DTP pendant at the end of yo chain
Then put the booty of a Swisha at the end of a flame

[Chorus]
Yeek yeek! (woop, woop) why you all in my ear?
Talking a whole bunch of shit that I ain't trying to hear!
Get back motherfucker, you don't know me like that!
(Get back motherfucker You don't know me like that)
Yeek yeek! (woop, woop) I ain't playing around!
Make one false move I'll take ya down
Get back motherfucker, you don't know me like that!
(Get back motherfucker You don't know me like that)

[Bridge]
Hey! You want what wit me?!
I'm a tell you one time, don't FUCK wit me!
Get down! Cause I ain't got nothing to lose
I'm having a bad day, don't make me take it out on you!
You want what wit me?!
I'm a tell you one time, don't fuck wit me!
Get down! Cause I ain't got nothing to lose
And I'm having a bad day, don't make me take it out on you!

[Verse 3]
Man! Cause I don't wanna do that
I want to have a good time and enjoy my Jack
Sit back and watch the women get drunk as hell
So I can wake up in the morning wit a story to tell
I know it's been a lil while since I been out the house!
But now I'm here, you wanna stand around running your mouth?!
I can't hear nothing you saying or spitting, so wassup!
Can't you see we in the club?! Man shut the fuck up!!

[Chorus]
Yeek yeek! (woop, woop) why you all in my ear?
Talking a whole bunch of shit that I ain't trying to hear!
Get back motherfucker, you don't know me like that!
(Get back motherfucker You don't know me like that)
Yeek yeek! (woop, woop) I ain't playing around!
Make one false move I'll take ya down
Get back motherfucker, you don't know me like that!

[Intro]
Whattup? Hey shawty, what it is?
Whattup? Hey shawty, what it is?
Whattup? Hey shawty, what it is?

[Chorus]
Lil' buddy what you want? Some violent shit!
Two-step and lay back, still wilin' shit
Whattup? Hey baby, I got the potion
Take a sip of this and put your back in motion
Lil' buddy what you want? Some violent shit!
Two step and lay back, still wilin' shit
Whattup? Hey baby, I got the potion
Take a sip of this and put your back in motion

[Verse 1]
Man I'm like a needle in a haystack, so face that
Go back to the drawing board, connect dots, but can't trace that
Matter fact, erase that, 'cause on this great track
Get your face slapped, and I'm straight so don't take that
Try somethin' different and shit, so listen and shit
Speakin' about what hip-hop is missin and shit
I'm about to fill a void, Ludacris born in Illinois
Raised in Atlanta, tote hammer since I was a little boy
Ain't nobody like me, so they wanna bite me
Fight me, step to me now but it ain't likely
People swear they sight me, just cause he's light-skinned
With braids in his hair don't mean that nigga looks like me
Trick get your mind right, livin' in the limelight
So picture what they'll do for my jimmy and a Klondike
Bar, bar, hardy-har
Tell yo' momma I'm a ghet-to su-per-star

[Chorus]
Lil' buddy what you want? Some violent shit!
Two-step and lay back, still wilin' shit
Whattup? Hey baby, I got the potion
Take a sip of this and put your back in motion
Lil' buddy what you want? Some violent shit!
Two step and lay back, still wilin' shit
Whattup? Hey baby, I got the potion
Take a sip of this and put your back in motion

[Verse 2]
Only standin' five eight but still a big shot, plus I got a big
Clean everyday, stay fresher than what's in a Ziploc
Tell your man to kick rocks, when I make my pitstops
I'm in, then it's hard to get me out like I'm a slip knot
Born to be a leader and not, no not a follower
Only hang with chicks that got mo' twists than Oliver
Not much of a hollerer, but I'd like to borrow her lips
Bringin out the best in me 'specially if she a swallower
Freaky deaky yellow man, and I'm sayin hello man
To all the lovely ladies that like to jiggle like Jello man
Bigger booty, small waist, put 'em in a small place
And if it ain't no ass where I'm at, then I'm in the wrong place
Bail like a bondsman, but keep 'em dancin'
Got pop potential, stay black like Bob Johnson
Who the hell is that in that fancy car?
Tell yo' momma I'm a ghet-to su-per-star

[Chorus]
Lil' buddy what you want? Some violent shit!
Two-step and lay back, still wilin' shit
Whattup? Hey baby, I got the potion
Take a sip of this and put your back in motion
Lil' buddy what you want? Some violent shit!
Two step and lay back, still wilin' shit
Whattup? Hey baby, I got the potion
Take a sip of this and put your back in motion

[Breakdown]
And jump down turn around, pick a bale of cotton
Jump down turn around, pick a bale of hay
Oh lordy, pick a bale of cotton
Oh lordy, pick a bale of hay
Jump down turn around, pick a bale of cotton
Jump down turn around, pick a bale of hay
Oh lordy, pick a bale of cotton
Oh lordy, pick a bale of hay

[Verse 3]
Still working like a slave, learning tricks of the trade
In a ghetto state of mind, say I'm rich and I'm paid
Pickin' records like cotton in the thick of the day
Till I'm spoiled and I'm rotten in a sinister way
Life no different than those on minimum wage
More money but still locked in a similar cage
Either losers of tomorrow or we winners today
Digest that and there's really nothin' missin' to say but

[Chorus]
Lil' buddy what you want? Some violent shit!
Two-step and lay back, still wilin' shit
Whattup? Hey baby, I got the potion
Take a sip of this and put your back in motion
Lil' buddy what you want? Some violent shit!
Two step and lay back, still wilin' shit
Whattup? Hey baby, I got the potion
Take a sip of this and put your back in motion

[Intro]
Yeah
We gon' send this one out
To everybody that put more into they cars than they do they relationship
Let's ride

[Chorus]
Two miles an hour so everybody sees you
Two miles an hour so everybody sees you
Two miles an hour so everybody sees you
It's get out, put my pedal to the floor, and let's roll
Two miles an hour so everybody sees you
Two miles an hour so everybody sees you
Two miles an hour so everybody sees you
It's get out, put my pedal to the floor, and let's roll

[Verse 1]
Yes, seven cars, eight cribs and ain't a damn thing changed
I'm still pumpin' ten kickers, still grippin' the grain
Still candy in the paint, still ridin' them things
And most my folks would say I'm happy, but I still feel pain
Until I jump in my ride, that's my only escape
Me and my automobiles got these neighbors screaming, "Give me a break"
It's a pity how we turn our city into obstacle courses
Don't be mad 'cause I can't hold my five hundred horses
Lamborghinis and Porsches, Ferraris and Vipers
I'ma wipe the seats with your drool, then rub the hood with a diaper
Television on the gas tank, the fuel make the ass stink
I mean to be rude, my bass tubes are in a glass tank
Go strap your seatbelts on, go put your money up
Go put your life on the line, go put your honey up
Go spread the word, run and tell all the boys
It's time to play, or better yet, it's time to bring out them toys
We going

[Chorus]
Two miles an hour so everybody sees you
Two miles an hour so everybody sees you
Two miles an hour so everybody sees you
It's get out, put my pedal to the floor, and let's roll
Two miles an hour so everybody sees you
Two miles an hour so everybody sees you
Two miles an hour so everybody sees you
It's get out, put my pedal to the floor, and let's roll

[Refrain]
Assign your name in the street (Sign your name in the street)
Assign your name in the street (Sign your name in the street)
Assign your name in the street (Sign your name in the street)
Assign your name in the street (Sign your name in the street)

[Verse 2]
Yo, one of my ways of releasin' tension while I'm releasin' some steam
Even if I just put a fresh coat of wax on, I'm makin' sure the slippers is clean
The twenty-sixes is mean, shut down the block, you could picture the fiends
My system supreme, you could feel the knock, just picture the scene
The chickens just scream, whole crew ballin', they sick of my team
We gettin' the cream, I'm through hollerin', I'm livin' my dream
I'm Black with a scheme, won't stop until that fat lady sings
And, yeah, it's actual and factual what my faculty brings
A car show for wherever we slide and wherever we glide
You can keep your rules and regulations, man, 'cause we don't abide
And we lookin alive, Mercedes Benz, six or the five
In a Beamer, Lexus, or Ac', we don't know how to act when we drive
And I fiend for the ride, I lay back and lean to the side
Onlookers and turnin' heads is all that's seen through his eyes
I'm breezin' on by, and no doubt, it's easy to fly
But it's even better when you slow down or ease to the side
And go

[Chorus]
Two miles an hour so everybody sees you
Two miles an hour so everybody sees you
Two miles an hour so everybody sees you
It's get out, put my pedal to the floor, and let's roll
Two miles an hour so everybody sees you
Two miles an hour so everybody sees you
Two miles an hour so everybody sees you
It's get out, put my pedal to the floor, and let's roll

[Verse 3]
I'm ridin' up in GTOs and 442s
Grand Prixs, SS's 'cause we so, so cool
Ridin' Regals or the 'Lacs, we in Chevelles and Verts
Skylarks, motorcycles, ATVs with the works
Malibus and Camaros, T-Birds and Novas
Escalades, Navigators, Expeditions and Rovers
H2s and Denalis, pickup trucks with the beams
Crown Vics, Monte Carlos, even Cutlass Supremes
Are going

[Chorus]
Two miles an hour so everybody sees you
Two miles an hour so everybody sees you
Two miles an hour so everybody sees you
It's get out, put my pedal to the floor, and let's roll
Two miles an hour so everybody sees you
Two miles an hour so everybody sees you
Two miles an hour so everybody sees you
It's get out, put my pedal to the floor, and let's roll

[Refrain]
Assign your name in the street (Sign your name in the street)
Assign your name in the street (Sign your name in the street)
Assign your name in the street (Sign your name in the street)
Assign your name in the street (Sign your name in the street)

[Quik] Gotta keep it a secret (woo!)

[Luda] Ay man let me ask you somethin man

[Luda] You ever have one of them days where you felt like

[Luda] you mighta got rid of all the bad seeds in your life?

[Luda] Y'knahmean like you just got your paycheck

[Luda] Paid off a car note or somethin

[Luda] Just jumped out the shower feelin fresh than a muh'fucka

[Luda] Witcha good shoes on, y'knahmtalkinbout?

[Quik] You mean like, paid off a Cadillac car note?

[Luda] Like a Cadillac, like you ready to throw a party

[Luda] Like call e'rybody you know, don't even plan it, just do it

[Quik] In Compton we call that "spur of the moment"

[Luda] Well let's do it, spur of the moment, whattup?

[Ludacris]
Well you can bring the drinks a little mo' my way
More I say, on another hot sunny Cali-for-nye day
Just touched down, called up my 8-1-8
Fo' a date with some other bust downs
And I cruised up the block, car losed up the top
I take the breeze, quick break the trees
Feel good as we flippin through the Robb Repo't
My baby momma ain't trippin on child suppo't

[DJ Quik]
Because she can't support that garbage, she should come pay homage
When we pair 'em, we gon' share 'em, when I'm finished we all switch
I ain't really got the time, yo I'm chillin with Luda-
-cris stop and twist the buddha got me feelin like this is it
If we gon' party, we gon' sip, we got a bar
We all in shape, we gon' go far, you can't stop the car
We on the freeway, if you get out you burnt
You woulda thought you woulda learned me when my hair was all permed
I think y'all bullshittin with it dawg

[Hook]
It's on tonight, get licked, get gone tonight

[KJ] And for once, in my life, everything's gonna be, alright
G'd up, my mind is freed up

[KJ] From the day, through the night, everything's gonna be, alright

[DJ Quik]
Arabian Spruce, Seagram's bumpy and juice
We used to bag and then truce, we used to sag and get loose
Not the kind of cats that would jump in your bag for your jewels
But to put some money in it for your drink and your shoes
We get the News like MTV, every ten to the hour
We play Mario Brothers, we eat the 'shroom and get power
Now eat your sour powers, and use your dental floss
What does bein mental cost? If you ain't knowin you already lost

[Ludacris]
So stay with me, and let's get tipsy
Rememberin the days on the block sippin whiskey
Runnin 'round grinnin, runnin 'round sinnin
Gettin lit, then I wonder why my head kept spinnin
But I'm all grown up now, less throwin up now
Record blowed up, so my hood throwed up
Now let's break loose cause your boy's arrived
And tonight we gon' celebrate bein alive riiiiight

[Hook]

[Ludacris]
It's just one of those days, without a care in the world
You ain't gotta look mean, I know you care for your girl
But she's lookin this way and I'm gonna come get her
Fresh haircut, so I'm feelin quite chipper
Can't nothin go wrong cause my strap's on my back
And if fools wanna scrap then my tool will attack
But forget the click-clack, ain't no need for the steel
Just a straight house party and some meat on the grill

[DJ Quik]
If it's Los Angeles, watch a boss handle biz
I'mma put this on my kids, stupid it's an outfit
If you ain't been around the world keep yo' mouth zipped
Cause I do wind-age and elevation
You see I'm not normal and I'm not a homo
I'm mo' apt to shoot a porno with you in cornrows
And call it "More Hoes: Volume 5, Volume 6"
And show it in the back of my truck, at the picnic

[Hook] - repeat 2X

[Intro: Ludacris]
Ooh.. You feel that?
As I take you to them dirt roads deep down in your southern roots, where nobody said life was gon' be easy
And we travel through this emotional rollercoaster called life, and we have our ups and downs
Just keep in mind, when you hit rock bottom, there ain't nowhere to go but up, baby
Just all about how you deal with it... ya feel me?
Listen here...

[Hook: Ludacris + Trick Daddy)]
When life seems hopeless, it make a nigga lose focus
Empty beer bottles and roaches
Helps to get it off my chest, 'cause I'm so stressed
And all I hear is "FUCK THE WORLD!"
When life seems hopeless, it make a nigga lose focus
Empty beer bottles and roaches
Helps to get it off my chest, 'cause I'm so stressed
And all I hear is "FUCK THE WORLD!"

[Verse 1: Ludacris]
Man, ever since life's been a gamble, my life's been in shambles
Double-edge sword, burnin' both sides of the candle
But Cris, you can't handle the truth
Don't wanna face reality, so Lord accept my apology
Please, like when police say freeze
And I ain't do shit but I'm down on my knees
It's a crooked system, but gin straight take the pain away
I charge the game and put my problems on layaway
A black man but I feel so blue
So I smoke green and purple till my dreams come true
Then my eyes turn red, the sky turns grey
Children slangin' white in the hood, we call it yay
Drinkin' Ol' Gold down my yellow brick road
Then rewrite my script until my story's untold
See, I got a little money and my life sped up
Now I'm fallen and I can't get up

[Hook: Ludacris + Trick Daddy)]
When life seems hopeless, it make a nigga lose focus

[Verse 2: Trick Daddy]
I had a dream about a dope fiend
And it's strange 'cause he can barely write or read but seems to get folks just about anything
Curious about him, I wanted to talk to him
Said he was too busy fo' that, but I was more than welcome to walk with him
So as we walked, he talked and I just listened
He said there's a big difference between crackers and niggas
He said white folks look out fo' the white folks, but uhh
Black folks blame otha' black folks when it ain't enough black roakz
When you ooh to make a long story short
We need pay more attention and do things that's way more convincin'
And he told me, you know, I wouldn't sell you somethin' that wasn't workin'
And I, damn sure wouldn't waste my time, tellin' ya somethin' that'll hurt you
But you'll fall for anything, if you don't stand for somethin', that's for certain
But niggas don't be listen, and that shit be hurtin'
Not all of us, but some of us, and if we don't hurry up
They gon' to bury each and every one of us

[Hook: Ludacris + Trick Daddy)]

[Verse 3: Ludacris]
Sometimes I can't deal with my daily issues, just bein' sober
Life's a bitch and I can't control her
I wish I could and sometimes to cry on we need a shoulder
The government stand us up to run us over
And in the hood, they don't seem to understand, goddamn
What's really got me wonderin' if it's part of a bigger plan
Man I smell something fishy goin' on
It's way beyond blowin' away the smoke from all of Swishers goin' on
It ain't much I can do about it (No), but preach the word
Tell my people to spend ya money wisely, don't be absurd
Buy some things that appreciate, (Like what?) like a home
Wake up, and open ya eyes to what the fucks is goin's on
'Cause they constantly gettin' rid of us (Yup), one by one
Whether it's drugs or diseases or it's, gun by gun
I ain't no saint either, I feel I'm even doin' wrong
By usin' what's in this chorus just to get through this song

[Hook: Ludacris + Trick Daddy)]

You know, y'all going to mess around and keep on complainin' about slavery, when uhh, that was over 40-50 years ago, you know, black folks need to move on
Stay strong and umm, ya'll keep playin' wit a cracker they gon' have yo ass, somewhere tied up wired up on them back roads of south Florida, Georgia
And they made the laws so them shits can't do nothin' for you
Can a church get a amen?
God for the thugs, too
Amen

Never scared to be different

What did you expect from the 5th LP
Gone for a minute now I'm back again
Back to back, back to break backs again
Put 'em in the back seat of the 'Llac again
And rip off the Magnum packagin
What's happenin, I'm lookin for some girls gone willllld (gone willlld)

And I'm gonna make 'em dance, so I

Take 'em to a level that they mighta never been befo'
We gon' hit the do' and then hit the flo' you'll get hit below
I got somebody I want you to get to know - ME!
Fearless like Jack the Ripper
Hip-Hop needs help so I'm back to flip her
Flip and run 'em back cause I'm back to stick her
And throw up on the track like it's full of li-QUOR!

[Hook: Ludacris]
You're feelin kinda warm, like you was havin (sex)
You're wetter than a storm, like you was takin (X)
Your mood intensifies, it's time for a surprise
So baby close your eyes, are you ready for what's (next?)

[Ludacris]
You lookin at rap's most consistant
Man, whatever they can't do, I can
What they wanna be in the future, I am
A hip-hop mogul's right where I stannnnd
God damn I'm good!
Stretchin out the limits of music, I should
Do it like I know and how only I could
Do it like a pro and how only I woullllld
Still I'm lookin for some girls gone willllld (gone willlld)

Get 'em in the zone, then I'll
Get 'em all alone, 'til I
Make 'em wanna bone, then I'll
Take 'em to a level that they mighta never been befo'

I got somebody I want you to get to know - ME!
L-U to the D-A-C

A gift to read minds, got E.S.P
Hottest thing on the go since PSP's

[Hook]

[Ludacris]
Wow, MC's I bake 'em
Put me in a circle of homies and I'mma break 'em
Mighta took your brain a minute to process
Could take the whole game a minute to top this
Just figured out that I'm ahead of my time
With a flow so fast I'm ahead of my rhyme
Your clock is off-beat, better set it to mine
With a six-year run havin a hell of a time
Cauuuuse I'm always lookin for some girls gone willllld (gone willlld)
I'm just tryin to make these girls all smilllle (all smilllle)
And I'm gonna get 'em high, 'til I
Make 'em touch the sky, then I'll
Make 'em wonder why, why
Why am I so fly, cause I
Take 'em to a level that they mighta never been befo'
We gon' hit the do' and then hit the flo' you'll get hit below
I got somebody I want you to get to know - ME!
A millionaire with extra paper
If you haven't heard, go and ask a neighbor
I'm like hot sauce with extra flavor
So put it on your tongue for your mouth to SAVOR!

[Hook]

[Hook: Bobby Valentino]
Baby, I gotta, get you up out of
Your clothes, your clothes, your clothes
It's somethin about the way you move
I just cain't let go, let go, let go
Baby, youuuuu've got me open
Baby, I just wanna make you mine
By the end of the night, end of the night
By the end of the niiiiight

[Ludacris]
It's inevitable and incredible, listen, it's Luda!

By the end of the night you gon' be wantin to marry a nigga
Cause I make 'em erupt like volcanoes, you just shake and you shiver
Get 'em up, get down, turn around and put your face in the pillow
Cut 'em up like Jason, just face it that boy Luda's a killer
Half man, half gorilla, beatin all on my chest
Pleasin all of your flesh, squeezin all on your breast
Givin you reasons to rest, and ain't never say no to papi
Wake 'em up like Folgers cause I fold 'em like origami
Hey mami let's get it poppin' like Orville Redenbacher
The way you move once you started nothin could ever stop ya
Sweeter than Betty Crocker, and I'm ready to belly flop ya
Just mention today but for now I forever gotcha

[Hook]

[Ludacris]
(Whoo!) Verse two, it's like this

Gotta get 'em up out of them clothes, if I throw a couple dollars then pose
We could drink a couple bottles and go, and ride off in the Impala on vogues
And Rolls, gold is all on my neck, all on my wrist
So just let go of yo' ho, don't hog her to death, lend her to Chris
Just for a little while for a little bit
Just wanna see her smile and get the bigger fish
She said that you had a little dick
Now how in the hell can she benefit from somethin like that?
I be up in that cat, make her put a hump in that back
Black, I swing low and sweet chariot, meet me at the Marriott
Key access, I'll be at the very top
Don't hesitate to stop the elevator either
I'll show you the ups and downs, you'll be my elevator diva

[Hook]

[Ludacris]
All I need is a couple hours baby, for real

Come up out that Prada, Chanel, Chloe, Loius and Gucci
Escada, Dior, Fendi, that Masconi and Juicy
Rockin Republic, True Religions and Citizen's jeans
Your Jimmy Choo's are so sexy but Giuseppe's is mean
La Pearla lingerie, ya panties and bra matchin
Put down your clothes and I'll put you UP on the latest fashions
Cause with cameras and action, I'm a deadly assassin
I love your clothes but what's underneath I love with a passion

[Hook]

[Ludacris - over Hook]
Gotta get you outta them clothes baby
Somethin about the way you move
I cannot let go, whoo!
You know you got me open
I just wanna make you mine, haha
By the end of the night, you gon' be mine
Luda! And Valentin' the dream

[Bobby Valentino] + (Ludacris)
Don't leave your girl round me (guard your women fellas)
Said don't leave your girl round me (Disturbin' Tha Peace)
Don't leave your girl round me (yeah, whoo!)
True playa for real, for real, for real, for real
Don't leave your girl round me
Said don't leave your girl round me
Don't leave your girl round me
True playa for real, for real, for real, for real

[Intro]
Can the church say Amen? (Amen reverend)
We gon' do another off in right now
We gon' do another one in fifteen minutes
And we gon' do one mo', right after that
Yes, women you lookin' so very beautiful here today
Some of you with the same thang on from the club last night
The Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away
Oh Lord Jesus I wish you'd taketh away Sister Mary's wig
Oh you disrespectin' the House of God with that thing
It don't even look real; aww, it's testimony time
Oh who is that? Young Chris Bridges
Boy I'm glad you finally grew into them ears
Go on and testify

[Ludacris]
Lord, please forgive me for the mistakes I've made
And thanks for keepin' my momma safe when she wrecked my Escalade
See I could replace a Cadillac but I can't replace my momma
I'm sorry for the hip-hop beefs, we sorry for the drama
But you gotta understand us rappers ain't never had nothin
And one's loss is another's gain so we gotta grab somethin
Lord, got so many questions I need the answers to
And sorry for the thangs I put my baby's mama through
I feel that women are really the strongest human beings
But why do you make 'em so emotional, and other minor things
I guess it's your way of sayin' we gotta love 'em and gotta praise 'em
Cause without 'em we'd be nothin', plus our kids they gotta raise 'em
While we, out and about and seein' what life has to offer
But if you offer a new life then what we need is better fathers
Either I'm smarter cause of my daughter or I'm just too dense
I'm 28 years old, it just now started makin' sense
And I've been...

[Hook One]
Searchin' so long, I was lost in the clouds
I'm tryna' stay strong, and make you proud
It took me some time, but now I see
That He resides, in me yeah, yeah

[Ludacris]
Lord, forgive me for anytime a fan said I was bein' rude
I'm only human, I'm not always in the best of moods
But thanks for givin' the gift of rap to write my feelings down
And sorry for cursin' sometimes but feelings make me shout 'em out
Forgive the people that wanna blame everything on rap music
If they didn't live it they can't relate or even adapt to it
Forgive those who don't think I'm great and wanna see me go
Forgive Oprah for editin' most my comments off her show
Don't get me wrong, I know some people got a image to hold
But those who criticize the youth might just be gettin' too old
We still travellin' through life, findin' what's right or wrong
I know some folks may not agree or even like this song
But I'm just speakin' MY truth, cause I heard it sets you free
And my conversation's with God, even though he speaks through me
I'm smarter cause of my daughter, and I'm NOT too dense
I'm 28 years old, it just now started makin' sense
And I've been...

[Hook One]

[Ludacris - over Hook One]
I've been searchin' so long
I admit that I've been lost in them clouds
I'm just tryna' stay strong baby
You know I'mma make you proud
I know life is full of contradictions
I'm tryna' become a better man
Prayin' for redemption, each and every day

(Hallelujah, as the choir sings)

[Hook Two: sung by choir]
Searchin' so long (so long) lost in the clouds (in the clouds)
Tryin' to stay strong, and make you proud - make you proud!
Took me some time (took me some time) now I see (oh now I see)
He resides, in me (yeah)

(Ladies and gentlemen, we have a special guest in the house tonight, came with some words of encouragement, Bishop Eddie Long)

[Hook Two] - repeat 2X, minus ad libs

[Outro: Bishop Eddie Lee Long]
What you just heard is real life
It's real life for you, it's real life for many
It's about where you been, yet at the same time you
Ay, you find yourself, in the midst of conflict and turmoil
Yes I'm talkin' to you, in the midst of conflict and turmoil
Cause you realize HEY - it's, time to change right now
And in the middle of that I wanna say this
The Bible says that when I was a child, I spoke as a child
I understood as a child, I fought as a child
Hey, but when I became a man
I put away those, childish things
Did you not know that your environment has shaped you?
Where you were born, in the projects, in the ghettoes
In the upper downtown, wherever it was
The people around you, the things around you
Cause you to do strange things because, you were seeking to learn
But what you learned, was on the streets, and not in the book
God called you a prophet
When you open up your mouth, everything of God comes out
And it commands attention, it commands change
I'm talking about the power, that's inside of you
And in the midst when you're, starting to understand
That I caught the wrong message, and now it's time
I'm hearing from God, what amazing experience, as you hear from God
He said, "Is there forth any man be in Christ, he is a new creation"
Old things are passed away, somebody needs to hear that and behold
Everything becomes new, and when everything becomes new in you
It's time to stop the killing
I said it's time to stop the stealing
It's time to stop disrespecting our women
It's time for us to come home and raise our children
It's time for us, to really mould our communities
It's time for us, not to get hooked up in religion
But to get hooked up in relationship, with God
And the amazing thing about it
Is wherever you find yourself right now, you can confess
And you can tell God "I'm sorry;
I had the wrong cue, I was doing the wrong thing
I was going after things that I thought were right, but it wasn't right
And now that I'm getting it right, I'm asking you to forgive me
And I may have done the things, that they said I did
But I'm not, who they say I am; I am who you made me to be
And I'm changing in that, and it takes a few moments
But every time I fall down, I'll get right back up
And every time I make a wrong turn, I'll get myself back in line
Because I recognize, I have been called, for such a time as this!"
You can't resist the change
And you're not condemned by your yesterday
If you can grab hold of your now, and move in your destiny
Move, change, and be, now!

[Hook Three: sung by choir]
Searchin' so long, lost in the clouds
Tryin' to stay strong, and make you proud - make you proud!
Took me some time (took me some time) now I see
He resides (He resides) in me (in me yeah)

[Small World: repeat 4X]
Uhhuhh no way no how, get like blaow, blaow, blaow kapaow

[Ludacris - over Small World]
Yeah, you ever hear somebody sayin somethin
And you think they talking bout you, you not quite sho' knahmsayin
But it ain't no way they talking bout you
Introducing the new members of Disturbing Tha Peace
Small World - from Norfolk, Dolla Boi - from Playaz Circle
Here we go what?

[Hook: repeat 2X]
Who the fuck you talking to?
Not me, couldn't be me, nah not me
Who the fuck you talking to?
Not me, couldn't be me, nah not me

[Small World]
3, 2, 1 - what's begun, is the start
But bitch we be saying we "we just getting started it since one"
Y'all been monitoring, pondering bout it
How bout I pull it out and kapaowee, I'll heat 'em up as hot as Maui
Big Small World, Norfolk is the gang, extended clip in the jeans
Put 'em in a box like Bisquick
I'm a laker wit clips, get 'em in the lake wit clips
Truth is ya a clipper with clips ain't cha bitch
I'm bout my loot and dollars, I'll shot you for looting dollars
But you lootless and dollarless, fuck it I shot for Luda n Dolla
I crash parties, blast with proposed toast
I'mma have a problem like Scrap, if you blabbin like show hosts
Muffle your damn lips, or there'll be mixtures of blood and dandruff
If you don't get my damn drift
Creep to ya grave and leak D.T. Piss
This yo' highness at his least tempered
Keep it pimpin' and watch

[Hook]

[Dolla Boi]
I been having a bad day, the same ol shit
We don't give a fuck about who you is
The same ol clique, and the same ol biz
The same ol flip , wit the same ol whip
The same 4-4, with the same ol clip
Half the bullets gone, the otha half you can get, bitch
R.I.P. Rick James "I'm rich beyotch!!"
You talkin' to much, nigga you a snitch bitch
And we don't do it like that
We do 3 quarter drops and we bring a brick back, black
Don't act get ya whole trap splat, ack
Unload 'em reload 'em, we back black
And when dem gats letting off
Red dots, loud noises like planes taking off
Dolla Boi I got the game in a cross, make me bang at cha boss
For dem things coming soft, nigga

[Hook]

[Ludacris]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Now if a bad bitch wants dick, then it's dick I give her
Ludacris nigga, I stand and deliver
Never back down, won't shake nor shiver
Fuck with me and get found in the Chattahoochee river
This 7 inch shank, will put a stop to his ticker
But shotties to the body make him drop much quicker
Yeah I appear to be a nice lil' nigga
Fuck with anything I love, I'm a stone cold killer
Eating off of 'Sace, sleeping on chinchilla
8 figga nigga, I'm a multi milla
See me in the street, it can't get no realer
Giving back to my hood with a pocket full of scrilla
My neighbors say my house can't get no bigga
I do good ass bidness, with a bad ass temper
Please tell ya bitch, stop playing with my zipper
Or I'll "brrrrr-stick her, ha ha-ha stick her!"

[Hook]

[Intro]
You have a call from an inmate in a correctional facility
Inmate, state your name
It's Darren
This phone call may be monitored and recorded
Press three if you accept the charges
If not, hang up

[Chorus: Ludacris]
To my cousin Darren Ransom (Stay up, homie)
To my brother Chris Butler (Stay up, homie)
If you locked in the box, keep makin' it through
Do your time (Do your time), don't let your time do you
To my brother Mikey Mike (Stay up, homie)
To my cuz J.B. (Stay up, homie)
If you locked in the box, keep makin' it through
Do your time (Do your time), don't let your time do you

[Verse 1: Ludacris]
You lookin' at a man that would die for his daughter (Yeah), just to let her breathe
And I'd definitely die for Jesus 'cause he died for me (Okay)
Give my eyes to Stevie Wonder just to see what he's seen
But then I'd take 'em right back to see Martin Luther's dream (Woo)
I'd dream that I could tell Martin Luther we made it (Uh-huh)
But half of my Black brothers are still incarcerated
Locked up in a cell block, lost from the shell shock
Some sold they soul, others used to sell rocks
Look up in my mailbox (Yeah)
I get letters from my cousin every week, said he wanna hit the streets
But he never struck a deal 'cause his mouth will never squeal
Put some money on his books and help him out with his appeal
Send some pictures of the fam and nasty pics of Shawnna (Okay)
And if you ever have to leave, I got your mother and your daughter (Got you)
Born in this way of livin' and our youth was stuck
To be safe, it's safe to say the justice system's fucked up

[Chorus: Ludacris]
If you doing 25 to life (Stay up, homie)
I got your money on ice, so (Stay up, homie)
If you locked in the box, keep makin' it through
Do your time (Do your time), don't let your time do you
All my peoples in the pit (Stay up, homie)
And until you hit the bricks (Stay up, homie)
If you locked in the box keep makin' it through
Do your time (Do your time), don't let your time do you

[Verse 2: Beanie Sigel]
Until I went to jail, you couldn't tell me I ain't seen it all
That box a motherfucker, it could stress a nigga bald
Especially when you broke and home base ain't acceptin' your calls
And you don't hear your name when it's mail time
Got them damn jailhouse barbers pushin' back on your hairline
Fuckin' Sinequans'll have you stuck in that pill line
Your bitch missed the V-I this weekend
The food in your locker keeps shrinkin', your celly feet stinkin'
The canteen ran out of menthols
Can't see how grown men wash other men drawers (Ugh)
Niggas play the phone room reckless and get hit with new indictments
Talking about old connects and new prices (Uh)
Stress'll take a young nigga, give him an old face (Or)
Stress'll take a dumb nigga, give him a new case
That's shit I used to tell my walkie, Lil' Itchy
All he did was smoke weed and drink coffee, I know he miss me

[Chorus: Beanie Sigel, Ludacris, Pimp C]
To my man Lil' Neal (Stay up, homie)
To my man Steve P (Stay up, homie)
If you locked in the box, keep makin' it through
Do your time (Do your time), don't let your time do you
To my man Paul Selene (Stay up, homie)
To Abdul McKeith (Stay up, homie)
Until I see you in the streets, keep makin' it through
Do your time (Do your time), don't let your time do you (Uhh)

[Verse 3: Pimp C, C-Murder & Ludacris]
If your people locked up, you need to send 'em some shit
'Cause it's never too late to stop being a bitch
A magazine and some pictures is a nigga's whole world
When I was down, them niggas fell off, so I'm ridin' with the girls
'Cause they got more heart than them fake-ass dudes
Ain't send no letters, no books, and no money for no food
'Cause commissary is so very necessary
It's so close to being slavery, in Texas, nigga, it's scary
I reached out to C-Murder right before I came home
And when them hoes let me go, I make sure that his books was on
And three months later, that nigga came home too
Ain't no limit to this shit 'cause now his dreams comin' true
I'ma keep ridin' with Bun 'cause UGK will never stop
And I'ma stand up for my partners 'til they let them off a lot (Yeah)
Bitch, and I'm as trill as you can be
They scream, "Free Pimp C" but now see the pimp free (Here I go, C-Murder)

[Verse 4: C-Murder]
Wake up (Wake up), roll call, another day gone by (Gone by)
Now put a "X" on November 25 (25)
I'm still alive, open the death row bars (Chk-chk)
Now this dead man walkin' parkin' million dollar cars (Damn)
It's slavery, hard labor, catch the feel (Catch the feel)
Redneck on the hearse while you walk, it's real
With a shotgun, burnin' at the back of your dome
300 years left, my dawg ain't never comin' home (Damn)
One fight, dude got stabbed, he lost an eye (Uh-huh)
Almost died, in Camp Jay nigga, ride or cry (Ride or cry)
Cream had suicide attempts, Precious took his own life
White boys can't handle the pain at night (Yeah)
You gotta fight for your shoes, or get your ass took (Shoes)
And walk around with lipstick and a pocketbook (Pocketbook)
You all in, bitch, sit down when you piss (Haha)
Sweet-ass, you a ho, watch, I'll blow you a kiss, mwah

[Chorus: C-Murder & Ludacris]
To my cousin Jimmy Watson (Stay up, homie)
To my homeboy Mack (Stay up, homie)
If you locked in the box, keep makin' it through
Do your time (Do your time), don't let your time do you

[Chorus: Pimp C & Ludacris]
To my nigga Pharaoh (Stay up, homie)
To my nigga Z-Ro (Stay up, homie)
If you locked in the box, keep makin' it through
Do your time (Do your time), don't let your time do you
To the king Larry Hoover (Stay up, homie)
To my partner Shan-O, you gotta (Stay up, homie)
If you locked in the box, keep makin it through
Do your time (Do your time), don't let your time do you

[Chorus: Ludacris]
To the homeboy Shyne (Stay up, homie)
To my nigga Mystikal (Stay up, homie)
If you locked in the box, keep makin' it through
Do your time (Do your time), don't let your time do you

[Karma] Daddy is that your car on TV?

[Ludacris]
You better believe it is baby
Now go in the other room
It's about to be some grown folks talkin here, okay?
All right

Yeah, things ain't always what they seem or cracked up to be (okay)
Like all these fakin ass rappers in this industry (tell 'em!)
Talkin 'bout what they got and they ain't got a damn thang
How you own three cars but you don't own your own name? (woo!)
Get your business right boys, the first class is in session (okay)
Get a entertainment lawyer in the music profession (hey!)
Start up your own company, trademark the name
That's gon' run ya about a grand so start savin your change (DTP!)
Open a bank account quick and then follow these steps (uh-huh)
Sign yourself TO yourself and start signin ya own checks (woo!)
Hit the booth and start recordin at the speed and need
Whatever gets your juices flowin, could be speed or weed (what else?)
Get it mixed and mastered (hey) pressed up and plastered (okay)
Sell it to your whole hood out the trunk, ya bastard!
Show all the non-believers what you destined to be (hey!)
And in just a couple years you could be rich like me!

[Hook: Ludacris]
But I can't hold my tongue - I'mma tell it like it is
This biz ain't all fun - I'mma tell it like it is
Give it to you straight, no chase - I'mma tell it like it is
Look you straight in yo' face and I'mma tell it like it is
I can't hold my tongue - I'mma tell it like it is
This biz ain't all fun - I'mma tell it like it is
Give it to you straight, no chase - I'mma tell it like it is
Look you straight in yo' face and I'mma tell it like it is

[Ludacris]
See mostly all your favorite artists got some serious problems (yup)
Their money could be the problem but money can't solve 'em (nope)
Some get addicted to drugs and flat out lazy (woo)
Some taste a little fame and go flat out crazy (woo!)
I'm close cause those close wanna live off my fame (yup)
And that type of shit ALONE'll drive a nigga insane (crazy!)
Not to mention all the vultures, the scandalous promoters (okay)
Crabs'll try to sue you, magazines'll misquote ya
Most of these label heads, they don't care nothin about ya (nah)
If you stop sellin records they'll act like they don't know ya
It's hard mixin business with pleasure so don't play
Me and my crew argue and fight like every other DAY (for real!)
Rappers ain't above the law but our life is so fast
That we got a special task force of police on our ass (true that)
All that, and this is really just the start of it (just the start of it)
Hip-Hop! You really wanna be a part of it?

[Hook: Ludacris]
Woo! I can't hold my tongue - I'mma tell it like it is
This biz ain't all fun - I'mma tell it like it is
Give it to you straight, no chase - I'mma tell it like it is
Woo! Look you straight in yo' face and I'mma tell it like it is
Hey hey, I can't hold my tongue - I'mma tell it like it is
Man this biz ain't all fun - I'mma tell it like it is
I'mma give it to you straight, no chase - I'mma tell it like it is
Hey! Look you straight in yo' face and I'mma tell it like it is

[Ludacris]
Let's go!
What's worse than havin no money is havin it and losin it (yup)
What's worse than havin some money is grabbin and abusin it (yup)
We never took no money from Chingy, thought I was cool with him (nah)
I wish his ass well but I don't want NOTHIN to do with him (woo!)
Some don't own they publishin; me? I never fool with 'em (nah)
I'm down for my artists, try my best to stay true to 'em (believe it)
Cause outside my label competition is irrelevant (DTP!)
Unless I'm still in competition with my president (what up Jay?)
And believe that I'm supportin the Hova
Cause the industry's shady, it needs to be taken over (okay!)
But the first rule to accumulation of wealth (what's that?)
Is don't trust nobody but your GOD damned self!

[Hook: Ludacris]
Woo! I can't hold my tongue - I'mma tell it like it is
Man this biz ain't all fun - I'mma tell it like it is
I'mma give it to you straight, no chase - I'mma tell it like it is
Look you straight in yo' face and I'mma tell it like it is
I said I can't hold my tongue - I'mma tell it like it is
This biz ain't all fun - I'mma tell it like it is
I'mma give it to you straight, no chase - I'mma tell it like it is
Look you straight in yo' face and I'mma tell it like it is

[Karma] Daddy are you finished with grown folk talk?

[Ludacris]
Yeah baby you can come back in here
Come give Daddy a kiss, you know I love you right?

[Karma] And I love you, always!

Stop moving so slow (I got mouths to feed)
Hurry up and let's go (I got mouths to feed)
Rain hail sleet snow (I got mouths to feed)
So you already know I'm 'bout to get to that paper
Stop moving so slow (I got mouths to feed)
Hurry up and let's go (I got mouths to feed)
Rain hail sleet snow (I got mouths to feed)
So you already know I'm 'bout to get to that paper

[Verse 1]
Listen, look I gotta feed my family by all means necessary
Cause paychecks are coming up shorter than February
Can't get a real job, I never finished school
Can't get no new clothes, I wore the same tennis shoes
But now the game's changed, I'm all about the hustle
And even Hogan Knows Best, I'm all about the muscle
I'm all about my team, I'm all about my green
I'm 'bout supply and demand, I'm 'bout to serve the fiends
And I'm a workin dream, I keep the circuit clean
See I'm the fucking future, I'm a working machine
Don't trust a soul I'm the only one watching my C.R.E.A.M
So I stay in heavy rotation like a washing machine

[Hook]
Stop moving so slow (I got mouths to feed)
Hurry up and let's go (I got mouths to feed)
Rain hail sleet snow (I got mouths to feed)
So you already know I'm 'bout to get to that paper
Stop moving so slow (I got mouths to feed)
Hurry up and let's go (I got mouths to feed)
Rain hail sleet snow (I got mouths to feed)
So you already know I'm 'bout to get to that paper

[Verse 2]
Motherfucker I'm a monster in this game, I turn 20 into 50
50 to a hundred and a hundred to a Bentley
A Bentley to a building and a building to a 'scraper
Can't keep up with the news but I get that Daily Paper
And you's a daily hater cause my foot game is major
After a while, crocodile, see you later alligator
My baby need new shoes, her momma need Giuseppe's
Mercedes need new shoes surrounded with Pirellis
A finger to the world, paid my dues and I'm ready
To pack up all the tools and just cruise in the Chevy
Million dollar deals making moves on my celly
Cause I owe it to my girl to put food in her belly

[Hook]
Stop moving so slow (I got mouths to feed)
Hurry up and let's go (I got mouths to feed)
Rain hail sleet snow (I got mouths to feed)
So you already know I'm 'bout to get to that paper
Stop moving so slow (I got mouths to feed)
Hurry up and let's go (I got mouths to feed)
Rain hail sleet snow (I got mouths to feed)
So you already know I'm 'bout to get to that paper

[Verse 3]
Wake up and smell the coffee, it's time to make the doughnuts
A kid who had a kid, my kid made me a grown-up
You ever threaten mines I won't resist to put the chrome up
My guns'll be like gang signs (always getting thrown up)
Atlanta put your zone up, we true to these streets
I got 12 hungry artists, whole CREW gotta eat
So hell NO I don't sleep, I'm like an Energizer battery
Got 19 employees, I gotta pay they salary
My momma quit her job and I retired my pops
Got killers on the payroll, I hired some cops
I accept responsibility, they all pay rent
So if it don't make dollars then it don't make sense

[Hook]
Stop moving so slow (I got mouths to feed)
Hurry up and let's go (I got mouths to feed)
Rain hail sleet snow (I got mouths to feed)
So you already know I'm 'bout to get to that paper
Stop moving so slow (I got mouths to feed)
Hurry up and let's go (I got mouths to feed)
Rain hail sleet snow (I got mouths to feed)
So you already know I'm 'bout to get to that paper

[Intro: Voice]
Satisfaction, satisfaction, satisfaction

[Ludacris]
Satisfaction

[Hook: Voice]
Yeah, blow me a shotgun
B-b-b-blow me a shotgun
B-b-b-blow me a shotgun
It gives me (satisfaction)

[Verse 1: Ludacris]
Can you handle it
808 bang in the back with the woofer like boom boom boom boom
With my foot on the pedal and my hand on my strap
Got the engine like vroom vroom vroom vroom
What's up, you ain't never heard a nigga rap like-like this before
I got an addictive flow that'll give you (satisfaction)
I'mma make you satisfied, even if it kills me
Even if it takes the slower minds, a little bit of time to feel me
Recollect the 15 million I sold, or the 30 times I went gold
And if you take 2 puffs of this dro, it'll give you (satisfaction)
I've sold the most and no one's close, but I'm not meaning to brag
It's different strokes for different folks like Angelina and Brad
Some keep the heat in the stash, put 30 keys in their Jag
And if cops ain't peepin your tag then you're gonna feel some (satisfaction)
Pumpin' out albums like Reverend Run is pumpin out children, here's another one
So catch me on more 24's than Kiefer Sutherland
I'm bound to be the greatest, I'm determined to win
Until then I can't get no (satisfaction)

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Smoke]
I'm the one that went to the gunfight with a knife, and won
Left with his pistol and left him dead, the guy he tried to run
Just because my verse 2nd don't mean I am not the one
When I'm done I'm guaranteed to give you (satisfaction)
I might not be the best in the world, but the best the world ever seen
I'm Albany Georgia's Dougherty County ding-a-ling king
And when I'm digging deep in the spleen, I'mma make the cream and she scream
Baby get me hard like a Snickers bar I give her (satisfaction)
Yessir there ain't not other way so motherfuck what you say
Y'all had this spot, we took you off the top like a toupee
Of course we kick and pushed in this fiasco like Lupe
Back that ass up like Juve, cause the south we givin them (satisfaction)
Ever since I signed with Luda and them, my chances of losing is slim
Y'all talk that smack but copycat and do a movie like him
Yessir my mob got that goodie as if my group had a Gipp
We gonna continue to give them a double dose of (satisfaction)

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Shawn Jay]
Yea Fleetwood drop the bomb, when I rhyme it's TNT
That's why my money long as the line at the DMV
When they askin who was that that was snappin I'm that answer dude
Like Snickers bring no nuts no (satisfaction)
I hustle and flow, I done been by my cheese since I was knee high
Weed what you need, hit me I'mma drop off peaches like I'm T.I
Earvin Johnson gimme that rock and magic cap of Shawn Jay
Dope sold money for (satisfaction)
I been the nigga they can't fuck with, hot but the flow cold
Flip rocks by the boatload
O.G. no see see me get tipped off getcha no dough
Zip-loc full of dro
Tote big Glocks on the hip cocked try to play the big shots
Get popped with the four four
Don't be the reason they moppin the floor for payin me that (satisfaction)
Fool for a dollar let me get that pop, man I need this cream
Where my cake give me my candles, I got sweet sixteen
Now the kid with the cocaine flow got DTP on his necklace
Now Luda tell them what you think about your invest (satisfacton)

[Hook] - 2X

[Intro: R. Kelly]
Woo!, Kel, 'Cris
And clubbin on some smooth shhh...

[Verse 1: Ludacris]
Ludacris can't hide or deny that I wanna get you down to them Vickie Seeecrets
And your body I won't misguide mistreat or misleeeeead it
Hate it up, love it, they can't cut it, so strut it
Number one shaker, like Vick's vapor I wanna fuckin ruuuuuub it
Louisville slug it hit em with a right left, its goooooone
Tell every last one of ya girls how good it was and its gone be onnnnnn
Soul Train, wood grain, from me
No pain, no gain, its so plain to see
They be like "I've been feelin kind of stressed can you blow my back out?"
And I'm like "Yea but don't trip if I happen to yank a track out"
When I get done its smooth sailin once I pull that 'Lac out
Next destination I move forward like Jerry Stackhouse
And 1, have fun, when you chillin with Ludi
Slow grind and slow jams while I'm feelin yo booty
We'll hold hand and hold times when I'm up in that coochie
You so fine I'm so sad that you feelin so wooooozy

[Hook: R. Kelly]
Got you feelin woozy baby (baby)
And that's how's it gonna be when I take you from the club to the crib
On dubs and I get you in the bed with me (in the bed with me)
Your so pretty and so sweaty and so sexy and so ready
Girl I'm surprised you this naaasty
But its cool cuz I always wanted to go down on a girl that reminds me of me (yup)
So get upstairs, get yo clothes off and get them sexy legs in a 'V' (yup)
Your vision blurry as if you were seeing two of me (two of me)
You so fine I'm so sad that you feelin so wooooozy

[Verse 2: Ludacris]
Being with YOU, make me feel like I just hit the lotto
Other girls I give 'em a shoulder colder than Chicago
But in ya center I heat it up in the morning like Alonzo
And I'd get it, I'd bit it, I'd split it, I'd hit it up in a Tahoe
Bravo, make make make it clap I'd break break break ya back
Then tuck tuck tuck you in so you can take take take a nap
Then back to makin dividends I'm in the wind
Somewhere hot, I stay on islands longer than Gilligan
Sippin on a pina colada, little mama I'mma make ya holla
How does it sounds when you makin love on a million dooooollars
I can only imagine lets make it real baaaaaby
Like D'Angelo "How does it feel" baaaaaby
I know I talk a lot shit but I can back it up (up up)
Like BBD flip it, rub it down, smack it up (up up)
You so bad when you call me for duty
You so fine I'm so sad that you feelin so wooooozy

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Ludacris]
Don't get caught up in the gossip, them chicks is jockin girl
They just jealous, everybody hates when Cris is rockin ya world
Hey girl, hey friend, how you doing, where you been
Enough of that talkin, lets begin, break it in, shake and spin
Take it in, say amen then I'll make you say goodness graciouuuus
Look me in the eye and make them nasty faaaaaaaces
I'm so glad that your body's so juicy
You so fine I'm so sad that you feelin so wooooozy

[Hook]

[Outro: R. Kelly]
Giiiirl, said your body is what I want (wooooozy wooooozy wooooozy)
I'll be making you scream and mooooan (wooooozy wooooozy wooooozy)
Girl lets get on up out this club (wooooozy wooooozy wooooozy)
Oooh get you to my hoooome

[Intro: Ludacris & Sample]
The time has come for bad things to end
The time has come for life to begin
Yes!
The time has come for the war of the gods
It's that time
I'mma take the subtle approach first
'Cause I'm just gettin started
Let's go!
Look:

[Verse 1: Ludacris]
I'm the best and there's nothing that you can do about it (nope!)
Never needed a publicity stunt, let's tell the truth about it (yeah!)
Even in the core of the streets, you can't sway the youth about it (nah!)
But keep running yo mouth
And I swear I'mma knock a tooth up out it (blaow!)
I never claimed to be nuthin but who the fuck I am
Never sold cocaine in my life, but I'm still the fuckin man (right!)
Understand, nuthin you did makes you better nigga
You claim the streets, but the streets respect that cheddar, nigga
Luda got twice as much yo life you can charge it to 'em (ching!)
I fit four of your houses inside my daughters room (woo!)
And still have room for young Karma to play
Givin back to the children of tommorrow, for good karma today
So you can say whatcha wanna say, and you can talk that talk
But real niggas ain't doin no talkin cause we walk that walk
Album for album, you can see I got a multimillion plan
So call yourself whatever you want except The Multimillion Man
Nigga!

[Hook: Ludacris & Sample]
Lucifer, oh Lucifer
Whatever you want except the multi-million man, nigga
God of evil, you're the god of hate
Call yourself whatever you want except the million man, nigga
Lucifer, oh Lucifer
Call yourself whatever you want except the million man, nigga
The darkness is waiting, fire and light
How many, man?

[Verse 2: Ludacris]
How many times is you gon rap about busting your gun? (huh?)
How many times is you gon trap without busting your gun? (gon' bust it!)
Only shots you ever took were subliminal to the general
Disrespecting those doing real time with real criminals (woo!)
And I ain't never did a day in my life
But it should be illegal to walk a day in my life
I paid the price and the cost to be the boss
So you can rest your mouth
I'm universal, Luda never limits hisself to the south
I give a damn about ya hootin and hollerin, it ain't botherin me!
I hear you talkin but you ain't made it to three!
You know where I live, but you ain't made it to me!
You ain't made, nigga
I'm havin a house party, kid, come get played, nigga
You got played, my record label never jerked me
So shoot me, stab me, but words will never hurt me
I feed off your energy (woo!), my powers with God
So it's even better if you make ya diss record real hard

[Hook: Ludacris over woman singing]
Lucifer, oh Lucifer
Make the record real hard
God of evil, you're the god of hate
Make the record real hard
Lucifer, oh Lucifer
Ya diss record real hard
The darkness is waiting, fire and light

[Verse 3: Ludacris]
See, even without all that bass and treble, I'm as hot as the devil
But I work for the top floor, homie, get on my level
I been stripped away ya powers 'cause I gave you my blessing
So it'll take more than majority vote to win this election
Man, mixtapes are not my resume, it's too hot
And I warned them I was coming, I got that number one spot
So unless you using tampons, quit acting stuck up
And do like your records say, or shut the FUCK up

[Hook: Ludacris]
Do like your records say, or shut the fuck up
Do like your records say, or shut the fuck up
Shut the fuck up
Ch-ch-ch-ch-shut the fuck up

[Coda: Sample]
Lucifer, oh Lucifer
God of evil, you're the god of hate
Lucifer, oh Lucifer
The darkness is waiting, fire and light

[Intro: Ludacris]
Drop! 2 Fast
Drop! 2 Furious
I'm too fast for y'all, man
Drop! 2 Fast
Drop! 2 Furious
I'm too fast for y'all, ahh!

[Hook: Ludacris]
You just came home from doin a bid
Tell me whatcha gon' do? Act a fool!
Somebody broke in and cleaned out your crib
Boy, whatcha gon' do? Act a fool!
Just bought a new pair and they scuffed your shoes
Tell me whatcha gon' do? Act a fool!
Now them cops tryna throw you in them county blues
Boy, whatcha gon' do? Act a fool!

[Verse 1: Ludacris]
Talkin' about gats, traps, cops and robbers
It's 9-1-1, please call the doctor!
Evacuate the building and trick the pigs
Since everybody wanna piece, we gon split ya wigs
See some fools slipped up and over-stepped they boundaries
You about to catch a cold, stay the fuck around me!
Ya peeps talkin 'bout "What kinda shits he on?"
You disappear like "Poof, bitch be gone!"
You think twelve gon' catch me? Gimme a break!
I'm super-charged with the hide-away license plate
It seems they wanna finger print me and gimme some years
They'll only get one finger while I'm shifting gears
I got suede on my roof, wood grain on the dash
Sheep skin on the rug, Golden Grain on the stash
Hydraulics all around so I shake the ride
We go front, back and side to side, what?!

[Hook: Ludacris]
Some punk just tripped up and made you spill your drink
Tell me whatcha gon' do? Act a fool!
Now your car just stopped on a empty tank
Boy, whatcha gon' do? Act a fool!
If you got late bills and you lost your job
Tell me whatcha gon' do? Act a fool!
If you about to get drunk and you ready to mob
Boy, whatcha gon' do? Act a fool!

[Verse 2: Ludacris]
Let's take it to the streets 'cause I'm ready to cruise
Just bought me and my cars all some brand new shoes
And the people just stare so I love to park it
And I just put a computer in the glove compartment
With the pedal to the floor, radar in the grill
TV in the middle of my steering wheel
It's my car's birthday, so we blowin' them candles
More speakers in the trunk than my ride can handle
Got my name in the headrest, read it and weep
NOS tank in the back, camel hair on the seat
And when I pull up to the club, I get all the affection
'Cause the women love the paint and they can see their reflection
I'm about to take off, so F what ya heard
Because my side mirrors flap like a fuckin' bird
And the fools, we gon' clock one and we'll pop one
'Cause my folk ridin shotgun with a shotgun

[Hook: Ludacris]
You just got hustled for a wad of cash
Man whatcha gon' do? Act a fool!
Now your friends just smoked up your brand new stash
Say whatcha gon' do? Act a fool!
Now them gulls up the block still runnin they mouth
Boy, whatcha gon' do? Act a fool!
If anyone talk bad about the Dirty South
Tell me what I'm gon' do? Act a fool!

[Verse 3: Ludacris]
I got my eyes wide shut and my trunk wide open
Did donuts last week and the streets still smoking
See, I'm off that anti-freeze and my car is tipsy
Off the off-ramp, doin' about a hundred and fifty
Rollin through East Point, on way to Ben Hill
Slide a five to the junkie to clean my windshield
Got the whole crew ridin' and we startin' shit
I even got a trailer hitch with the barbeque pit
Now all you wanna do is get drunk and pout
Plus your new name is Fire 'cause we stomped you out
And yeah, we blow trees and beez that's fantastic
So girls, hold ya weave while I'm weaving through traffic
I kicked to fifth gear and teared the road apart
You'll be like lil John Q and get a Change of Heart
It's one mission, two clips and some triple beams
I'm about to blow this whole shit up to smithereens!

[Hook: Ludacris]
The pot holes in the street just bentcha rims
Tell me whatcha gon' do? Act a fool!
Man, that ain't sticky, that's just sticks and stems!
Boy, whatcha gon' do? Act a fool!
Catch ya man with another bitch up in ya bed
Ladies, whatcha gon' do? Act a fool!
If the bottle's all gone and your eyes are red
Boy, whatcha gon' do? Act a fool!

[Outro: Ludacris]
2 Fast (2 Fast), 2 Furious (2 Furious)
2 Fast, act a fool!
2 Fast (2 Fast), 2 Furious (2 Furious)
2 Fast, act a fool!
2 Fast (2 Fast), 2 Furious (2 Furious)
2 Fast, act a fool!
2 Fast (2 Fast), 2 Furious (2 Furious)
2 Fast, act a fool!
2 Fast (2 Fast), 2 Furious (2 Furious)
2 Fast, act a fool!
2 Fast (2 Fast), 2 Furious
2 Fast, act a fool!

[Ludacris]
HEY! I be that nigga named LUDA give a round of applause

Down for whatever goes down, I'm strapped down to my drawers
So if you up for some stitches then I'm down for some scars
Down to make 'em GET DOWN, stop playin and pause
There's two things I'll never break and that's my word and my balls
So here's a temporary fix for your permanent flaws
This album helps you to RELEASE cause life is irkin us all
Enough to make you wanna break shit, no longer will I take shit
From ANY of these clowns cause I'm TIRED of this fake shit
I'm ready for some action, ready with a passion
Like pots with the steam I'm ready to get it crackin
It's six years and countin if you think I'm a joke
Me gettin served is like Bill Gates and Oprah goin broke
It's 'bout time they gave it to me, I'm the reignin champ
Your favorite rapper went to Ludacris' trainin camp
Beotch!

[Outro]
Yeah shawty! (That's right)
On the real I feel you on that
Man I'm tired of all these fake-ass niggas homes
(Hell yeah shawty) Ay ay, this your boy Lil' Black

Stop fuckin with homes man, feel me?

I JUST WANNA KNOW WHAT HE SAID ABOUT OPRAH!
DON'T NOBODY TALK BAD ABOUT OPRAH!
YOU JUST LOST A FAN

Man Joe, I'mma tell you what the bid'ness is

If you ain't fuckin with my guy, What is yo' life about?
Kick rocks, SKEEZER please!

Yo God, man Chris can kiss my ass
He remember me, I was at the club right there with him
He he coulda got me in
I mean I went to Benjamin Banneker high school with him
I knew him before all the fame
That's how you gonna do your people man?
That's how you gonna do your folk?
Yup! Tch man I used to cook for this nigga
See he done come over to my house the other day
Talkin 'bout, he don't eat beef and he don't eat pork
And my homegirl was over there and she was like
"Girl he look so tall on TV!"
I said, "Girl I told you he was short"
Maaaaaaan, I don't give a damn
I looooove that nigga!

[Verse 1: Ludacris]
Luda!
I done killed so many niggas in the booth I sell rappers on eBay
Soldiers couldn't cause more disaster on D-Day
Haters better cover up they jaw like Freeway
Cause every hit record's been instant like replays
Hold the line, I got yo' momma on 3-way
Tell her Luda's got more records than the DJ
Tell her she should blow me like candles on yo' B-day
Cause I've signed more lines than she's passed on the freeway
More checks than you ever could imagine
More wood up in my whip than in a forest full of cabins
And yes I stay high on that purple like Aladdin
And women say I talk mo' game than John Madden
How'd it happen, how'd they let me in the booth?
How they let these rappers lie, how DARE I tell the truth!
I'm the truth, and these other boys phony
It's a movie so act like you know me

[Hook One: Ludacris] {w/ scratches by DJ Jaycee}
I'm a lyricist to the death, so I got what you need
Ludacris, I'm the last of a dyin breed
And we almost extinct, so I'm sayin it loud
Say it with me {*"MC means move the crowd" - Rakim*}
Say it with me {*"MC means move the crowd" - Rakim*}
Say it with me! {*"MC means move the crowd" - Rakim*}
{*scratches: "M-MC means move, means move... m-move... move the crowd"*}

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
I got it baby!
And I'm an MC, I move the crowd like Moses
Like the Red Sea I wear red like roses
Go against me and you'll be dead like roses
Spittin at your head full of bread like toasters
Never had a holster, I keep it on my lap
And hip-hop ain't dead, it just had a heart attack
But you see I keep it pumpin, yeah I got that heart back
So just call me Little Carter, or Little Cardiac
Precious like an artifact, valuable like a quarterback
Hannibal like they call me Jack, throwback like a Starter hat
Now how did he thought of that? I mean how did he think of that?
I mean how did I think of that? Now like a rental, bring it back
I mean how did I think of that? I surprise myself sometimes
Someone should throw me a surprise party for every rhyme
Every time I do it, I do it dirty like swine
For the dirty and fine, hip-hop, I'm alive!

[Hook Two: Lil Wayne, Ludacris] {w/ scratches by DJ Jaycee}

[W] I'm a lyricist to the death and I got what you need

[W] Weezy F, the last of a dyin breed

[W] And we almost extinct, so I'm sayin it loud

[L] Say it with me {*"MC means move the crowd" - Rakim*}

[L] Say it with me {*"MC means move the crowd" - Rakim*}

[L] Say it with me! {*"MC means move the crowd" - Rakim*}
{*scratches: "M-MC means move, means move... m-move... move the crowd"*}

[Verse 3: Ludacris]
This is music Musclemania, my verse is on steroids
Private planes, I'm on the jet, son, like Elroy
Flying through the sky at amazing speeds
We on that Superman kush or that amazing weed
The new Bentley came out, my team said, "Luda, get it!"
20 thou' says that I'm the only nigga wit it!
New Era on yo' brain like a A-town fitted
And I'm not E-40 but I'm so Sick Wid It
That my flow got the flu, hoes I got a few
But I'm stingy with the dough, I'm like "No not for you!"
What the fuck was you thinkin, off what I'm thinkin
Me and Wayne on that lean, what the FUCK was you drinkin?
Stinkin like a dead body off in the woods
So I snatched her like a weave comin off in the hood
And if you down for no bad, then we up to no good
And it's important that you make it understood

[Hook One]
F is for all the Fatties wearin my shit!
(Do you want me to..) uh, yeah, what?
(Uhh, Trackmasters, FB, Entertainment)
Yeah, this how we gon' do this (uhh, uhh, ooh!)

[Ludacris]
Yo, girl you taste like a Cinnabun
So sweet from the thighs to the cheek
Sex on the beach, check the size of my meat; call me the butcher
Ludacris King Ding-a-Ling sheet smusher
Sweet street pusher, give me that gusher
Nasty stuff - look up - I took her
Ran out of liquor (time to re-up!)
Here comes her nigga (who gives a fuck!)
Rap fame and plat' thangs they can't hang
I mack dames and pack thangs and act strange
Jang-a-ling dang-a-ling oh no they can't stop
Take it to the floor back up and then drop
Effervescent.. time time's of the essence
Make 'em undress in less than three seconds
So whores keep steppin whores keep slobbin
Sex as a weapon, clothes that I slept in
Streets keep mobbin, thieves keep robbin
Get two in yoor butt, three to your noggin
Creepin and crawlin, I'm incogneg'
Can't catch the balls then you in the wrong league
Let a dog breathe, watch a pimp walk
Shut yo' ass up when you hear a pimp talk
Friskier dreams, Krispier Kremes
You lookin mighty fine in them jeans

[Hook]
All you brothers want a, fatty girl, fatty girl
Fatty girl - who me?
You know I got a, fatty girl, fatty girl
Fatty girl - what's she mean?
Ever since I got a, fatty girl, fatty girl
Fatty girl - fat as a bitch!
Fatty girl, fatty girl
Fatty girl..

[LL Cool J - overlaps Hook]
Uhh.. uhh.. hot.. fire.. hot
(Step up and represent player) International baller baby

HEESHY! Young birds in the Coupe goin
HEESHY! (Papi tell me if you don't feel me)
Easy; I feel greasy when you squeeze me
(Cut de blood claat talk and do what ya wan' please me)
I'm talkin down home smothered in gravy, Cool J be
Havin young ladies bustin like 380's
Lubricated silencers, crushin all challengers
Gats that be claimin they Glocks but really Dillingers
Get it? Glock Dillinger, I'm big you small
More nuts on your face than graffiti on the wall
Hair like Brillo, cuttin up my pillow
Got 'em sayin (hello!) naked in a tub of a Jello
Still no competition, still flow nigga listen
(I'm not supposed to do this type of thing I'm a Christian)
Amen! It's like a scene out of Player's magazine
Let them other cats holla, L'll make you scream

[Hook]

[Keith Murray - overlaps Hook]
Aiyyo welcome home Murray!

Yo, this is in thought of those broads who got the goods
To the chicks who don't - ehhhh it's still all good
Some broads got an automatic thickness for eight
You'll soon get it, just stay workin hard at it
Goodness gracious, good God almighty
You got a badonkadonk, girl don't hurt nobody!
Toes all painted, feet all out
It's an aphrodisiac for the mall without a doubt
Juicy chunky stanky funky
Gut slappin ball slappin cater to your every fantasy
You got your tongue clitoris tits and belly pierced (all that?)
Necklace around yo' waist toe rings - girl do yo' thang!
I mean, in them jeans yo shape is BEAUTIFUL!
And I'm "For You, By You" like FUBU (bitch you know the name)
Whoo-wee Jesus JoJo K-Ci and Mary
Girl you don't know what you do to me (lord have mercy!)
Ain't no doubt about it, when she walk by
Tongues hang out, eyes pop out the socket (BING!)
Cats cringe and point like pssh
Ummph you can see that thang from the front
We gas those up like, full service
And, keep 'em drunk like Kathie Lee Curtis
And when you shake it, you rock my world
I done died and went to heaven, you got a fatty girl!

Cuz I just popped ya, you can't take the pressure
You might as well quit, cuz you just can't last

And your spine in the Dirt, so put on a Skirt

Just bruised and beaten, all black and blue
And it's been like that since Madden '92

You better come harder than hard, rougher than rough
Put up your guard, get ready to crush

She's lookin' for a prize, man you killin me
Actin like you don't see the dollar signs in her eyes
You wanna nail done, and I help, too

[Verse Two: Lil' Fate]
You gotcha way with a beauty
A treat with a brain
When she look at you she only see "ching-ching"
Be around your neck, reel around your arms
A championship ring, she must be a bowla hard
She turns on the leader, as soon as you need her
Unless you bite the bait, you look mighty thico
When money talks she ticks like F.B.I
Ready to handcuff the right guy
Look you in the eye, and tell a boldface lie
Schemin on the way to money yo, well ya tried
Guess its a game now, gotta watch who you trust like her because, its only out for your books, yes sir
She's all about being paid
At the end of everyday its a fine new grade
What more can I say? But the wires up front
Better watch out, she'll leave yah with insufficient

She's dangerous, super fast
Better watch out she'll take ya cash

Oh yeah. For the growin... just won't stop
Will be rottin in your eyes
She's a...Gold digga, gold digga, gold digga yeah

So where's her cash sack?

Oh yeah she's a superstar chick
But don't do it unless you got miles of risk
She's a pimpstress running more games than the olympics

[Intro: Ludacris]
Hold on man, Mr. Barack O'Drama
Can I address the current state of affairs real quick?
I got some shit I need to get off my chest

[Verse: Ludacris]
I'm back on it like I just signed my record deal
Yeah the best is here
The Bentley coupe paint is drippin' wet, it got sex appeal
Never shoulda hated, you never shoulda doubted him
With a slot in the president's iPod, Obama shouted him
Said I handled my biz, and I'm one of his favorite rappers
Well, give Luda a special pardon if I'm ever in the slammer
Better yet put, me in office, make me your vice president
Hillary hated on you so that {​​censored}​​ bitch is irrelevant
Now Jesse talkin' slick and apologizin' for what?!
If you said it, then you meant it—how you want it, head or gut?
And all you other politicians tryna hate on my man
Watch us win majority vote in every state on my man
You can't stop what's 'bout to happen, we 'bout to make history
The first Black president is destined and it's meant to be
The threats ain't fazin' us, the nooses, or the jokes
Get off your ass, Black people, it's time to get out and vote
Paint the White House black and I'm sure that's got 'em terrified
McCain don't belong in any chair unless he's paralyzed
Yeah, I said it, 'cause Bush is mentally handicapped
Ball up all of his speeches and just throw 'em like candy wraps
'Cause what you talking, I hear nothing even relevant
And you the worst of all 43 presidents
Get out and vote, or the end'll be near
And the world is ready for change 'cause Obama is here
Yeah!

[Hook: Ludacris]
'Cause Obama is here
The world is ready for change 'cause Obama is here
Yeahhhh, 'cause Obama is here
Say world is ready for change 'cause Obama is here
Hey!

[Intro: Kanye West] + (Ludacris) + (*Shawnna*)

[Verse 1: Ludacris]
How you ain't gone fuck?, bitch I'm me
I'm the goddamn reason you in V.I.P
CEO, you don't have to see ID
I'm young, wild, and strapped like Chi-Ali
BLAOW, we ain't got nothing to worry about
Whoop ass, let security carry them out
Watch out for the medallion, my diamonds are reckless
It feels like a midget is hanging from my necklace
I pulled up with a million trucks
Looking, smelling, feeling like a million bucks, ahh
Pass the bottles, the heat is on
We in the huddle all smoking that Cheech & Chong
What's wrong? The club and the moon is full
And I'm looking for a thick, young lady to pull
One sure shot way to get them out of them pants
Take note to the brand new dance
Like this

[Hook: Ludacris & Shawnna]
When I move you move (just like that?)
When I move you move (just like that?)
When I move you move (just like that?)
Hell yeah!, hey DJ bring that back!

(When I move you move) just like that?
(Hell yeah!, hey DJ bring that back!)

[Verse 2: Ludacris]
Go on with your big ass, let me see something
Tell your little friend he can quit mean mugging
I'm lit and I don't care what no one thinks
But where the fuck is the waitress at with my drinks?
My people outside and they can't get in
We gon' rush the back door & break them in
The owner already pissed cause we sort of late
But our time and our clothes, got to coordinate
Most girls looking right, some looking a mess
That's why they spilling drinks all over your dress
But Louis Vuitton bras all over your breasts
Got me wanting to put hickeys all over your chest
Ahh, come on we gon' party tonight
Y'all use mouth to mouth bring the party to life
Don't be scared, show another part of your life
The more drinks in your system, the harder the fight

[Hook: Ludacris & Shawnna]
When I move you move (just like that?)
When I move you move (just like that?)
When I move you move (just like that?)
Hell yeah!, hey DJ bring that back!

(Hell yeah!, hey DJ bring that back!)

[Bridge: Ludacris]
Stand up! stand up!
Stand up! stand up!

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Now, uh, me and Luda wasn't good at computers
So we dropped out of school cause we tried to fuck the tutor
Her ex man drove a Mercury Cougar
I hit him with this maneuver he just couldn't recooper'
We got vouchers to stand on these couches
James Brown couldn't tell me, "get down!"
We got foreign cars and houses
We got porno stars and spouses
You trying to stab one like Jack The Ripper
Trying to get two like Jack "The Tripper"
My nigga Tone been locked for a minute
He come home from the street he gone want those strippers
And I'm a big tipper I don't even be tripping
This my first real Rolex, it don't even be ticking
This my first pair of earrings I can wear in the shower
Without'em clouding up in a half an hour
So that basically mean my paper getting mean
Four G's in a paper denim jeans
The pink rocks red hot like Anthony Kiedis
You see these, these is the sweetest Adidas
We FIRE, y'all RETIRE
All ugly people please!, be quiet!
Hov ain't get a beat from me in a minute
He heard "Just to Get By" and I was rehired
I got a track right now that could save my ass
It ain't a song it's a video, call Dave Meyers
Y'all drop 20 G's on the Sprewell rims
I give that money to another to get some real spins

[Hook: Ludacris & Shawnna]
When I move you move (just like that?)
When I move you move (just like that?)
When I move you move (just like that?)
Hell yeah!, hey DJ bring that back!
(When I move you move) just like that?
(When I move you move) just like that?
(When I move you move) just like that?
(Hell yeah!, hey DJ bring that back!)

[Outro: Ludacris] + (Shawnna)
Stand up! (uh) stand up! (yeah)
Stand up! (uh) stand up! (uh)
Stand up! (just like that?)
Stand up! (just like that?)
Stand up! stand up!

[Ludacris] + (The Game)
I just touched down in killa Cali, strapped up my boots
Got scooped up by Game so I hopped up in the Coupe
(Ahh, whattup nigga?) What the hell is goin on?
I'm tryin to ease back and get my head in the zone
(Then where the fuck you tryin to go?) Nigga this yo' city
Anywhere, I'm just tryin to see some ass and titties
So fool mash the gas, the night is young
All bullshit aside I'm tryin to have some fun
Hit the hop in Lakewood, or ride down Slauson
Or the casino, they say it's just like Compton (ha ha)
Really doesn't matter, long as shots don't rang out
(Nigga I stay strapped, I don't wanna pull the thang out)
Well keep the heat heat right up under the seat
And let's roll to Roscoe's and grab somethin to eat
But check your rearview mirror, I swear somebody's followin
Rollin in that dark blue SS Impala and
All up on the bumper, man I'm just sayin
Tell me you know this nigga (nah, they better stop playin)
He sped up around and drove right in front of us
Could be one-time just tryin to bust one of us
'Til he smashed the brakes and we almost hit him
Throwin signs out the window like somethin was wrong wit him
Before we jump out and get ready to clown
(Nigga call up the homies, it's about to go down)

[Hook: Ludacris] + (The Game)
Keep one eye open cause the streets don't sleep
(If the streets get hungry then the streets gon' eat)
That's why I keep some heat and a couple of rounds, nigga
(Call up the homies, it's about to go down)
Call up the homies, it's about to go down?
(Yeah, call up the homies, it's about to go down)
Yeah that's why I keep some heat and a couple of rounds
Nigga call up the homies, it's about to go DOWN

[The Game] + (Ludacris)
Somebody tell Luda I'm on the way now (aight)
Just stepped one size 12 Air Force 1 in the A-Town (ha ha ha)
And you know where I'm headed
To the Lennox Mall to get it done head to toe NWA style (do it)
Keep it gangsta from the waist down
And this chrome trey-pound got me feelin Atlanta +Brave+ now (right)
Disturbin' Tha Peace, I'll let the lead spray
I'm startin to love this place, they even got Red Clay (okay)
Hit a different strip club e'ry day (yeah)
And I don't make it rain, it's a hurricane on the way (ha ha ha)
And I got the A-Town pump
It'll make your whole body do the A-Town stomp (woo!)
Then it's off to the Waffle House
And pancake mix ain't the only thing comin out her mouth
And her 42 D's comin out her blouse
Her baby daddy comin in (Game, get out the house, and)

[Hook]

[Ludacris]
Yeah, I'm in a real-life movie, so this is take three
When Luda step foot out in Phoenix, A-Z
Superbowl super hoes, rappers on stroll
So I put the call in to Willy Northpole

[Willy Northpole] + (Ludacris)
Woo, big homie I got ya, stick to you like a cactus
Welcome to the Bird City, Chris, take off your jacket
I know you kinda used to big booties in the club
But ain't nothin wrong to have a lil' sauce in your blood
I see a couple thugs with some bitch tendencies
My town, but I still got Phoenix enemies (yup)
Haters wanna stop 'em and I really wanna pop 'em
But it's hard to fight back when you got an album droppin (connects)
We in South Phoenix, niggas Africa bang
Matter fact, Chris, tuck in your Africa chain (what?)
Cause I see some niggas starin at us with a lame frown
I'mma call up the homies (it's about to go DOWN)

[Hook/Outro: Ludacris] + (Willy Northpole)

[Ludacris]
OWWWWWWW!!!

[Verse - Ludacris]
I never used to snore in my sleep till this rap shit started
Warm thoughts fill the hot-headed and cold-hearted
Your whole paycheck, you burp it and then fart it
And y'all think I'm gon stop?! BLOW IT OUT YOUR ASS!
In one year I got rich, now life's movin so fast
But bein broke with no food is just a thing of the past
Plus I'm the new phenomenon like white women with ass
And y'all prayin that I flop?! BLOW IT OUT YOUR ASS!
In New York I buy clothing, in Cali I get green
In Atlanta I get sleep, in Texas I sip lean
All these rappers wanna know what I'm gettin for sixteens
Try 80, want a discount? BLOW IT OUT YOUR ASS!
See in just six months I infiltrated the system
If you find somebody better, then I'm sorry I missed him
Niggas hate givin me props cause I might use it against them
C'mon, get Ludacris out! BLOW IT OUT YOUR ASS!

[Hook - Ludacris] (2x)
If you mad I'm on top, then wish me gone
If you mad I'm on the road, then wish me home
And if you mad that I'm right, punk wish me wrong
But after your three wishes - BLOW IT OUT YOUR ASS!

[Verse - Ludacris]
It's time to saddle up the Tontos cause I'm the Lone Ranger
I eat dinner with Jews but don't talk to strangers
I'm just a few albums from filling your disc changer
If you ever think of stoppin me - BLOW IT OUT YOUR ASS!
I'm a hustler by nature but criminal by law
Any charges set against me, chunk it up and stand tall
Next year I'm lookin into buyin Greenbriar Mall
You probably own a lot of proper-ty! BLOW IT OUT YOUR ASS!
C'mon and take a look, he's got gigantic balls!
Plus his money keeps flowin like Niagara Falls
We all know Jesus saves and Ludacris withdraws
I'm bout to go on vacation - BLOW IT OUT YOUR ASS!
Shout out to Bill O'Reilly, I'm a throw you a curve
You mad cause I'm a THIEF and got away with words
I'm a start my own beverage, it'll calm your nerves
Pepsi's the New Generation? - BLOW IT OUT YOUR ASS!

[Hook]

[Verse - 50 Cent]
These niggas be frontin, they hate it when we stunting
They see us in Caddy's and coupes and Benz's and it's nothing
They act like they got something, we don't deserve - something
Nigga hate it, like it or love it or - BLOW IT OUT YOUR ASS!
It's simple, top of the charts, number one wit a bullet
Disturbin Tha Peace and G G G G Unit!
Got it locked boy, get ya shot boy
You don't like that we're on top boy, okay - BLOW IT OUT YOUR ASS!
From NY to ATL, we get it crunk bitch
Semi-auto on my waist, I don't play that pump shit
Motherfuckers think that I blew up real fast
But I've been underground a long time so BLOW IT OUT YOUR ASS!
I got candy paint, on my '65
Impala holla at my shorty if you ready to ride
Whacha mean your ass ain't got money for gas?
Then get the fuck out, you're mad? so what, BLOW IT OUT YOUR ASS!

[Hook]

[Outro - Ludacris]
Yeah! History has been made!
Ludacris and 50 Cent! real recognize real
If you're feeling a little awkward about the situation
Don't hesistate to just BLOW IT OUT YOUR ASS!

[Ludacris]
Ha ha ha ha ha, yeah, ahhhh

[Hook: Jamie Foxx]
Sim-p-ly marvelous
(That's what you are, that's what you are, that's what you are)
More than outrageous (ooh ooh)
That's what you are
Beyond incredible, yeah yeah
(That's what you are, that's what you are, that's what you are)
Now that's contagious (ooh ooh)
Ooooh that's what you are (hey)

[Ludacris]
Luda! I must admit that you are truly somethin special
So hop up in my vessel, let's wrestle like I'm The Rock (Rock)
Deep in your ocean I'mma find your buried treasure
So hop up on the dresser, throw your legs up to the top (top)
Stretch it out like calisthenics
Bet it that Luda wet it and get it and have somebody call the medic (medic!)
My head is in the right direction
My quarter's in your jukebox, girl you are my #1 selection
I play you over and over, put your head on my shoulder
Slide down and give me head in the Rover (Rover)
And I'm a soldier, see it ain't no limits to the things we could do
And I made this record for you
So that we could break it down to the nitty-gritty one time
And when it comes to the sexin I get busy with mine
So you get busy with yours, I guess we destined to see
Baby girl, you are destined to be

[Hook]

[Ludacris]
Yeah, uhh
Uh, so supernatural, wonderful and miraculous
You got me buggin off yo' attractiveness like WHOA (whoa)
So precise, so fine in yo' position
That my unanimous decision is to never say no (no)
You got me strung like a guitar
Playin the sweetest melody is definitely heavenly by far (far)
Further than the moon - and I never fake it
But I take it when you get naked cause your body's like BOOM! (boom!)
How could I resist it? I'll be there in an instant
When you call like tornadoes you got me twisted
I know you missed it, so I'mma give it good
You'll go ballistic, because I give it hood
Just like a nigga would, and like a nigga should
If you hear screamin then Luda's up yo' neighborhood
Good gracious, yeah I do it right
And all night, you are

[Hook]

[Jamie Foxx]
Yeah, it's courageous how you drop the phone and rush over
Crazy how you make me high when I'm sober
Just when I thought, I've seen it all
You put it down on meeeee
It's contagious how your lips make me lose composure
Addicted to the kisses, your blow got me swoll up
There's only one, my champion
That's what you are to meeee, yeah
Ooooooh yeah

[Hook] - 2X w/ ad libs

[Intro: Ludacris sample]
I'm the MVP, I'm stupid with this rap shit!

[Hook: Ludacris w/ DJ Premier scratches]
"Here I am"
"I'm the man" "Word!"
'DTP's about that bomb shit!"
"LUDA!"

[Verse 1: Ludacris]
When Premier puts the needle on the record then I put it on blast
Your flow's garbage, I throw it in the trash
I'm the MVP, I'm stupid with this rap shit
Rewind the verse, make the track do a back flip
Your speakers poppin on a handstand
They sneak dissin niggas, throwin little jabs like Bam Bam
But I'm a bad man, they amateurs like at Apollo
I wipe em off the stage like Sandman
God damn man, what the hell you smokin on?
It's Ludacris, I got more cheese than provolone
And the chrome is home, so I'm never home alone
And only keep friends with two X chromosomes
So I command all these rappers, put the mic down
Throw a grenade in your mouth, nigga bite down!
Because I'm back with Premo on the track
Takin it to the essence, showin niggas how to rap

[Hook: Ludacris w/ DJ Premier scratches]
"Here I am"
"I'm the man" "Word!"
'DTP's about that bomb shit!"
"LUDA!"

[Verse 2]
Still hungry as the day I began, I heat the booth up so much
The engineer caught a muthafuckin tan
I'm the truth when it comes to it (true!)
I hold hip-hop for hostage, since 2000, I put a gun to it
And I run through it, like a Jamaican Bolt
And everyday's a vacation on Jamaican smoke
Cloud your whole block, talk shit and hear the fo' pop
One, two and it don't stop
And my delivery's invadin your vicinity
Hennessey is my remedy, taking shots like Kennedy
And I been a G for a long time
To these streets, I'm connected like I'm online
On time for whatever
And every time an album drop, I drop BIG like Voletta
I'm ahead of the competition, they wishin that I just fade off
My career for your life, let's trade off

[Hook: Ludacris w/ DJ Premier scratches]
"Here I am"
"I'm the man" "Word!"
'DTP's about that bomb shit!"
"LUDA!"

[Verse 3]
Eight years in the game, ain't a damn thang changed
So I brought it back to one of the tracks
Of where the damn thang came
And he goin down in history, cause he don't sleep
And he the first southern rapper on a Premo beat
I ate the kick and the snare, the samples always taste fine
And I shoot a hot 16 from the baseline
I'm on point like CP3
And I'll be goin down in rap as the MVP

[Hook: Ludacris w/ DJ Premier scratches]
"Here I am"
"I'm the man" "Word!"
'DTP's about that bomb shit!"
"LUDA!"

[Ludacris]
A lady in the street but a freak in the bed
Lady in the street but a freak in the bed...
Lady in the street but a freak in the bed
Lady in the street but a freak in the bed

[Hook: Ludacris]
See she makes her own money, pays her own bills
Always stays fly, keeps it so real
But behind closed do's she a nasty girl (yup)
Behind closed do's she a nasty girl
She got a crazy little figure, nice round ass
Walks so proper, talks with such class
But behind closed do's she a nasty girl (yup)
Behind closed do's she a nasty girl

[Ludacris]
Yeah, I met this girl named Keisha, she was so sweet (yup)
Nails stay manicured, pretty little feet (woo!)
Shoes so sexy, body so hot
Hair lookin like she just came from the shop
Legs so smooth, clothes so tight
Style so sexy, makeup just right
Never too much, never too little
Black lace bra, Vickie Secrets in the middle
Eyes so innocent, smile so bright
Works in the mornin but she'll party all night
All for her man, all cause she bout it
All cause she crazy in love and don't doubt it
Product of her birthplace, know about the streets
Clean in the workplace, dirty in the sheets
Keeps her own toaster, makes her own bread
Lady in the STREET but a freak in the bed, cause

[Hook]

[Plies]
Okay, okay, haha
I got a college girl who go to church e'ry Sunday
Had her sneak out of choir rehearsal to put it on me
But she's so innocent, when she ridin, mami
One thing about her, she get her own money
Gave it to her yesterday while she was doin laundry
Favorite chore of mine, it's my lil' bunny
Bow-legged and classy, such a real woman
Sex all night, go to work e'ry mornin
Text me from work and told me she was horny
Text her back and told her, "Me too mami"
When you get off work, daddy gon' punish
You my nasty girl forever I promise

[Hook]

[Ludacris]
I got a doctor girlfriend that tells me, "Come home soon!"
She plays like my house is her emergency room
Tells me to undress and to lay on the sofa
Checks all my vitals like a doc's supposed ta
All white coat, all white heels
And nothin underneath so it's an all night deal
I'm her number one patient and delighted to be
And when she needs her medicine I give her vitamin D
But wait! I got a lawyer girl that's so wild
And every single night she wanna take me to trial
Said she needs some evidence, and to show her the PROOF
So I put her on the stand and I give her the truth!
Cause I'm hung like a jury (jury)
Judge Luda preside over your body and I'm never in a hurry
You may proceed, let the games begin
And if I call a mistrial we gotta do it again

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Hip hop nation, this is Spiz-ike Lee
Been sleepin for too long, wake up..
Wake up - WAKE UUUUUUUUUUP! {*rooster crows*}

[Ludacris]
WAKE UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUP! {*rooster crows*}
I see the sunshine GAZING through the window pane (yeah)
Blazin like indo flame; it's to WAKE UP!! Come to yo' sense manye
Snow is all around you, but you don't play in the winter games!
Cartridges surround you, but you ain't playin Nintendo games!
Load 'em up and fill 'em up, to the top before you cock and aim
Tryna get from the bottom to the top like the stock exchange
Shower, shit and shave and hit the corner for a block exchange
Amazing what my people'll do for some pocket change
But maybe this ain't the life that you chose (chose)
This is the life where you stay strapped and pack a knife or end up with a blooded nose
Street survivor or survivor of the streets! (streets!)
And only the strong survive, there's no survival for the weak! (weak!)
Catch a sneak peak of death if you ain't on ya Ps and Qs
They carry banana clips and niggas'll peel you for ya shoes
It's the blues, but not on Hill Street - you could call it "kill or be killed" street
"Lost a pint of blood, let it SPILL" street
STOP AND WAKE UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUP!!!!! {*rooster crows*}
WAKE UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUP!!!!! {*rooster crows*}

They say my folks'll do WHATEVER for the fortune and the fame
And it'll take a FORTUNE to get rid of all the pain, but I'm sayin
Use your brain homie, do the right thang! (Lemme talk to 'em)
Use your brain homie, do the right thang! (Lemme talk to 'em)
You say the only family that you got is in a gang
And the only way to make it is by sellin cocaine, but I'm sayin
Use your brain homie, do the right thang! (Lemme talk to 'em)
Use your brain homie, do the right thang! (Lemme talk to 'em)

I've been in his ear since we were drinkin beers
Years we've spent together, used to break up get-togethers
With a fight every night gettin' cheddar, movin white
Our thang, so we had to "Do it Right" like Spike
Holdin 40s, gettin green on acres, these broads were our mules
That's when we used to serve in front of Com'wealth School
Fuel for cars and jewels, chains and tools
It was organized crime but we remained confused
Mom in the pews, singin, "Lord, protect 'em"
You might not a-gree with our views, but you had to respect 'em
Diamonds in the rough, but were we reflectin
A system that's abrupt, the streets in oppression
One morning in the mirror, I seen my reflection
A young man with good spirits but needed direction
I guess my man's death was my resurrection
Cause now I hear him sayin from heaven, "Wake up!
Wake up! Wake up! Wake up! Wake up!
Wake UP! WAKE UP! WAKE UP! WAKE UP!"

I woke up this morning and got a call
My partner said he had news about a girl named Baby Doll
She got four baby daddies; four kids by four different men
And she just found out she's pregnant, I said, "No, not again!"
Man, when she gonna learn she don't wanna spend her life in court?
Lookin for back payments and fightin for that child supports
Chasin checks, chasin her ounce of respect, chasin paper
Chasin entertainers or rappers and ballplayers
Not carin about a condom, I say, "Help her Lord, PLEASE"
'fore she stuck wit mo' babies or ends up fightin some di-SEASE
You know that you a momma, and, mommas, we can't lose ya (no!)
Treat yourself better; you carry seeds to the future (whoo!)
And the future looks dim if we don't get ourselves together
We gotta sacrifice, some do WHATEVER for the cheddar
So make the right decisions 'til you ready to give birth
And know that you the most precious gift we have on this earth
Babies, stop and WAKE UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUP!!! {*rooster crows*}
WAKE UUUUUUUUUUUUUUP!!!! {*rooster crows*}

You say you want a family but it's hard without a man
And the only way to make it is to get him fo' his change, but I'm sayin

[Intro: sample]
Everybody's breaking-breaking up
Let's stay together-gether-gether
Let's stay together-gether-gether-gether
Everybody's breaking-breaking up
Let's stay together-gether-gether
Let's stay together-gether-gether-gether

[Ludacris]
Yeah, tell y'all a lil' story right quick, right
Luda!

[Verse 1]
First the Fat Boys break up, now every day I wake up
Somebody done called it quits
Shit I thought Bobby and Whitney'd stay together forever
If they made it that long; I guess the drugs weren't that strong
And now it's Russell and Kimora, even Jordan and Juanita
And to top it off, Brad left Jen for Angelina?
What the hell is goin on in this world, this just can't be!
If Will and Jada can do it then why can't we?
Hillary's still with Bill Clinton, how do they do it?
He got his dick sucked and the whole damn WORLD knew it
Now Paul McCartney's losin half of his life
All because he got divorced from his wife
Somebody said it's cheaper to keep her, but not in K-Fed's case
Cause Britney even had to pay for K-Fed's case
Nick and Jessica, Trina and Wayne
And if you broke up wit'cha girl I know ya feelin the pain, because

[Hook: sample] + (Ludacris)
Everybody's breaking-breaking up
Let's stay together-gether-gether
(United we stand, divided we fall)
Let's stay together-gether-gether-gether
(United we stand, divided we fall, c'mon!)
Everybody's breaking-breaking up
Let's stay together-gether-gether
(United we stand, divided we fall)
Let's stay together-gether-gether-gether
(United we stand, divided we fall)

[Verse 2]
First it was Shaq and Kobe, then Iverson and Philly
T.O. and McNabb, even Game and 50
I guess sometimes you gotta let the past be the past
But I'd give a hundred thou' to see Jay with Dame Dash
B.G. with Lil Wayne, Juvenile and Turk
Mannie Fresh with Baby, how can we make it work?
Krunchie with Three-6, Diamond with Crime Mob
Lauren Hill with the Fugees, Remy with Terror Squad
Lil' Kim back with Cease, and Snoop with mo' Dre
Dre with mo' Big Boi, CD's with mo' play
What's Tribes with no Quest? Salt with no Pepa
Even the Eagles broke up and got the fuck back together!
Sellin millions of copies, and gettin that cash
And Raz B said Chris Stokes was gettin that ass
I don't even understand it, what the hell went wrong?
Maybe folks'll wise up and take heed to this song, because

[Hook]

[Ludacris]
I can't take it, no!

At first Wu-Tang broke up, now O.D.B. is gone
Then I'm hearin Cam'Ron don't talk to Jim Jones?
Who'da saw that shit comin? Certainly not me
Or the Dogg Pound break up, or Goodie Mo-B
Then Shawnna almost jumped ship from D.T.P
If Chingy left and came back then damnit, why can't she?
We gotta think it's all for one, and one for all
HIP-HOP! United we stand, divided we fall
So why is

[Hook] - repeat to fade w/ ad libs

[Intro]
This song is rated M for mature!

[Hook: Ludacris]
Yeah, press the start button (woo!)
Tell these hoes to press the start button (what!)
Punch in your code and press the start button
And let the muh'fuckin games begin, biatch!
For any ONE of these flows just press the start button
Yea, tell my foes to press the start button
For a Ludacris show, just press the start button
And let the muh'fuckin games begin, biatch!

[Ludacris]
Hey, look here
Picture perfect, I paint a perfect picture
Eyes low cause Igloo done rolled the perfect swisha
Hit you with the weaponry, tell your soldiers to back down
I'm Raw like W.E., you'll get SmackDown!
How you want it? I'll clobber my opponents like Blanka
Boy, you Street Fightin with a monster
A-Town mobster, blowin smoke like rastas
Pullin out guns like in Contra, mo' toys than Tonka
I'm a fuckin problem, rob 'em
It's Grand Theft Auto, his burner's right beside him
Hollow points headed to your dome
Hollow points headed to your home
Your head of lettuce shredded from the chrome
It's ludicrous, parents think I'm a weirdo
I'm a God of War, you a Guitar Hero
So let's box like Tyson, you'll get Punched Out
Welcome to Luda's world, now bring the blunts out!
Hahhhhh!

[Hook] w/ ad libs

[Ludacris]
I'm Liver than NBA, Luda's Super like Mario
That Playstation 4 shit, you older than Atari ho!
Flows that'll make MC's Go! like Diego
Call me the Master Chief, my life is like Halo
Fightin off haters, I'm the best, ask Khaled
I'm at the Call of Duty, plus my Metal Gear is Solid
My Resident is Evil, full of Southside riders
I hope you're packed, man, I got six Virtua Fighters
That'll blitz ya like Madden '09
Or hit you with the Mac and .49s
Then later sit back and blow pine
Like it's somethin to do, it ain't pretty
The Final Fantasy, they think they live in SimCity
But I'm a MechWarrior, try me and I'll damage ya
Holdin a Soul Calibur, or shoot you like Galaga
And my Creed Assassins ya, so clear the room
Before the shotgun helps you meet your Ultimate Doom, boyyyyy

Whether 25 thousand or 25 mil'
Survival of the fittest, either kill or be killed
Get ya game on playa, get ya game on (what?!)
Get ya game on playa, get ya game on
Doesn't matter if it's 25 bricks or it's 25 bucks
Survival of the fittest, either stick or get stuck
Get ya game on playa, get ya game on (what?!)
Get ya game on playa, get ya game on

[Chorus: Chris Brown, Sean Garrett & Ludacris]
I know what them girls, I know, I know what them girls

And it's me they wanna kill 'cause I give them what the girls like

I know what they feel 'cause I'm breathin' on they heels
And it's me they wanna kill 'cause I give them what the girls like
(Hahaha, Luda!)

[Verse 1: Ludacris & Sean Garrett]
Relax and take notes, while I put you up on game
Get a sweeter connect then if I put you up on 'caine
But you should grab yourself a seat and a whiskey double
Because the girls of the world ain't nothin' but trouble
They like a little danger and might not admit it (yeah)
But they on for the chase and they want us to come and get it
Plus they love a young thug that's overflowin' with swag
And keeps his woman all draped in new Louis Vuitton bags (hey)
And Louis Vuitton pumps, look at her walk to him (yeah)
I like open-toe straps, but SG, talk to 'em
I got a whole bunch of girls I'm tryna bring by the crib tonight (yeah)
Better wear your cape 'cause the bringin' that kryptonite (okay)

[Chorus: Chris Brown, Sean Garrett & Ludacris]
I know what them girls, I know, I know what them girls

And it's me they wanna kill 'cause I give them what the girls like
I know what them girls, I know, I know what them girls
I know, I know what them girls, I know, I know what them girls like (I know what you like, baby)
I know what they feel 'cause I'm breathin' on they heels
And it's me they wanna kill 'cause I give them what the girls like
(Yeah, we gon' take this to verse 2)

[Verse 2: Ludacris]
Now some of them want a family (Yeah), a sense of security
A necklace, bracelets and all other types of jewelry
So shop 'til you drop, or 'til it makes you psychotic
Here's a triple-black card, it ain't trickin' if you got it (Hey)
Others will stay content if you just making 'em laugh
Send 'em to the spa, get 'em massaged and bubble-bathed
So later on, they can dance and throw a drink in they hand
And try any and everythin' they never did with they man, me!
So get loose and slide off your damn garments (Hey)
Show 'em who's the boss, they take orders from the sergeant (Yup)
There's places on your body that I'm just tryin' to find
So in the sack, talk to me, tell me what's on your mind (Woo)
And I got plenty more to learn if you's investin' in me (Okay)
They don't love for who I am but who I'm destined to be
And for that, I give you everything up under the sun
'Cause in the end, all the girls just wanna have fun

[Chorus: Chris Brown, Sean Garrett & Ludacris]
I know what them girls, I know, I know what them girls (Hahaha)
I know, I know what them girls, I know, I know what them girls like
I know what they feel 'cause I'm breathin' on they heels
And it's me they wanna kill 'cause I give them what the girls like (I know what you feel, yeah)
I know what them girls, I know, I know what them girls
I know, I know what them girls, I know, I know what them girls like
I know what they feel 'cause I'm breathin' on they heels
And it's me they wanna kill 'cause I give them what the girls like

[Bridge: Ludacris]
They wanna talk to you (Yeah), so shut up and listen
If you can't take the heat, then get the fuck out the kitchen
'Cause a ride-or-die man for his ride-or-die chick
Gets that ride-or-die puddin' for that ride or die shit (Whoo!)
I say they wanna talk to you (Yeah), so shut up and listen
If you can't take the heat, then get the fuck out the kitchen
'Cause a ride-or-die man for his ride-or-die chick
Gets that ride-or-die puddin' for that ride or die shit (Whoo!)

[Chorus: Chris Brown, Sean Garrett & Ludacris]
I know what them girls, I know, I know what them girls (Hahaha)
I know, I know what them girls, I know, I know what them girls like (Yeah, ayy)

HOUSTON, DALLAS COME INTO THEY HOOD

[Verse 1: Ludacris]
I keep a fresh pair of Ones on my feet
And double deuces on the Chevy
3's company, the double 4's on my belly
5 hot amps speakers shake like jelly
So many wires in my trunk look like a bowl of spaghetti
Assault and batteries, but my trunk stay "Ever-ready"
Assault and battery if you scared you never ready
And yeah I went green, and 26's on the hybrid
Smoked so much green that I can't open up my eyelids
Wake up in London, go to sleep on Atlanta time
Still my paint got more candy then your valentine
For five mill, I bought a lake front crib
Bentley Car cover lookin' like a laced-front wig
Of course they hating cause they still riding the MARTA train
Re-name the yacht but put the plane in my daughters name
Now that's Karma, so call me Daddy Warbucks
If you got money, I got more bucks

[Hook: Ludacris] + (T.I.) + {Woman}
Cause I got {big bank}, all these haters wanna grill me

[Verse 2: Ludacris]
LUDA! I'm a freak like a scorpio
Custom hood scoops make the coupe look like Pinocchio
I'm rich bitch, I should drop cash
The inside of the Lac' look like a wood shop class
And these women gimme love like it's tennis time
So many shoes that my closet look like finish line
So many acres that my crib look like Bermuda
So many diamonds, the safe look like Kay Jewelers
That Spider about to drop, my team said, "Luda get it!"
Now 50 thou says that I'm the first nigga with it
First round draft pick, later for you imbeciles
The car is all black like it got traded to the Timberwolves
And I keep a little bit of that green up in the lining
But as the weather change, my weed adjust to different climates
(Okaaay) Green in the summer time, orange in the spring
Now it's black with that purp I call my whip the "Sac Kings"

[Hook: Ludacris] + (T.I.) + {Woman}
Cause I got {big bank}, all these haters wanna grill me

D.C AND B-MORE, COME INTO THEY HOOD

[Verse 3: T.I.]
I'm fly enough to fly away, trouble I don't shy away
From it, I annihilate suckers in they driveway
In church on Sunday morning prayin' 'bout what happened Friday
But them the consequences for coming at pimpin' sideways
Nowadays guess it pays to change
In cahoots with corporations, making major change
With magnificent watches and amazing chains
Plush pad in Atlanta and L.A.'s the same
I'm balling til I'm bored with selections and assortments
Of automotives worth a small fortune, of course it's
The '72 Chevelle hardtop, '69 drop
60K a piece; you can barely pay your lease, peep!
Dude wanna talk new school tell him go ahead
Drop-head double R-Maybachs and koenigsegg
Swag out the ass, stack cash to the hairline
Fuck another car, it's time to try and buy a airline

[Hook: Ludacris] + (T.I.) + {Woman}
Cause I got {big bank}, all these haters wanna grill me
(But fuck that I'm about my money if it kills me)

(Oh no!) I caught him with a blow to the chest
(Oh no!) My hollow put a hole in his vest
(Oh no!) I'm 'bout to send two to his dome
(Oh no!) Cry babies go home
(Oh no!) I caught him with a blow to the chest
(Oh no!) My hollow put a hole in his vest
(Oh no!) I'm 'bout to send two to his dome
(Oh no!) Cry babies go home

[Verse 1]
I got people scared as fuck like when condoms break
Or how your heart deals with eatin' eighty pounds of steak
So put your belly on a plate and watch your weight
You frosted like a flake and Ludacris feels grrreat!
Who want come face me, face come want who?
And women give me face till they're face turns blue
They can't breathe, dick to mouth recessatation
A tight squeeze which stops the length to conversations
I play stations, duck cops and lose agents
I'm Doctor Love, I close curtains and fuck patients
When I kick and rip and flip an indespensable rhyme
My black ass is so hungry I'll take a bite out of crime
And it'll hurt if I swallow, but even more if I choke
Neighbors called the fire station off the blunt that I smoke
You see I crush cowards, funerals I'll send flowers
And I'm on the overpass flick pennies at rush hour

[Hook]
(Oh no!) I caught him with a blow to the chest
(Oh no!) My hollow put a hole in his vest
(Oh no!) I'm 'bout to send two to his dome
(Oh no!) Cry babies go home
(Oh no!) I caught him with a blow to the chest
(Oh no!) My hollow put a hole in his vest
(Oh no!) I'm 'bout to send two to his dome
(Oh no!) Cry babies go home

[Verse 2]
You see I'm ambidextrous I slap ass with both hands
Delete your first steps, but I'll save the last dance
I just bought some new guns my mama said "it ain't worth it"
But I'm at the shooting range just cause practice makes perfect
Bullseye, I stunt growth and stop lives
You run with niggas that's more chicken then pot pies
Bok bok bok I'm shakin' your tail feathers
I got big balls, I'm a Sac King like Chris Webber
Luda' will take you back to Duck Hunt and Double Dribble
When niggas sold quarters and dimes and smoked nickels
My cars got big TVs and satellites
I got a Wheel of Fortune cause I flipped O's like Vanna White
And the survey says? (Kill a mutha fucka now)
Could it be off with his head? (Or shoot a mutha fucka down)
Ground round, ground chuck your ground beef
Bullets gather round then I shoot rounds around teeth

[Hook]
(Oh no!) I caught him with a blow to the chest
(Oh no!) My hollow put a hole in his vest
(Oh no!) I'm 'bout to send two to his dome
(Oh no!) Cry babies go home
(Oh no!) I caught him with a blow to the chest
(Oh no!) My hollow put a hole in his vest
(Oh no!) I'm 'bout to send two to his dome
(Oh no!) Cry babies go home

[Verse 3]
I kick niggas in they're ass reboot 'em like laptops
And they wouldn't even box if I gave 'em a flat top
You punks pucker and pout, bicker and babble
Now they all lost for words like I beat 'em in Scrabble
You see I'm from a small town called "Fresh out a cop's ass"
Where Mr. Head-Potatoes are skinned they get mashed
I smell puss from fifty yards
Y'all not playin with full decks as if I jacked out ya Jacks and left fifty cards
Catch me in Vegas spinnin' the green
I re-up with more chips than a vending machine
Then you can catch me in Rome, mackin' some broads and stickin' 'em
And you'll be at home picking your boogers and flicking 'em
A drug dealer's dream, so fresh and I'm so clean
I'm a grown ass man and you're sweeter than sixteen
So go and kick rocks peons you're just rookies
Headed down stairs to get you some milk and cookies

[Hook]
(Oh no!) I caught him with a blow to the chest
(Oh no!) My hollow put a hole in his vest
(Oh no!) I'm 'bout to send two to his dome
(Oh no!) Cry babies go home

(Oh no!) My hollow put a hole in his vest
(Oh no!) I'm 'bout to send two to his dome

(Oh no!) My hollow put a hole in his vest
(Oh no!) I'm 'bout to send two to his dome
(Oh no!) Cry babies go home

[Unnamed woman #1, Unnamed Man #1]
The royal penis is clean, your highness
(Thank you, king shit)

[Unnamed Woman #2]
Yeah, motherfuckers! Welcome to the United States of America! Time to roll out the red carpet on y'all bitch asses! Hailin from the filthy, dirty South, where the Kings lay: Ludacris; Disturbin' Tha Peace family. Recognize royalty when you hear it. The throne has been taken, so kiss this nigga's earring. Luda, throw some grapes on these peasants!

[Ludacris]
These bitches throwin' rose petals at my feet mayne!
They wanna spoil me, treatin' me like royalty;
What I'm 'sposed to do? It's such a sweet thang
Work that track, whip 'em like Kunta
That's why they stay down, they loyal citizens of Zamunda
By way of A-T-L; if you disagree
Don't even look at me ho don't pass go just go straight to jail
With no probation or bail, but this ain't Monopoly
It's Jolly Green Giants cause we smoke so much broccoli
Uh-oh, Spaghetti-O's! Luda's oodles of noodles
And testing me, is like pitbulls put up to poodles
My rap career goes back further than your father hairline
It's ludicrous - I pack more nuts than Delta Airlines
I'm fly, even when I get high I work cash
And even got my coach bumped up to first class
I'm boss to all employees - and I'm here to teach the principle
Cause I've been saved by mo' bells than Lark Voorhies

[Unnamed Man #2]
Man fuck that nigga 'Cris man, for real man. I'm tired of this shit man. Man I try to rap for the nigga, I try to get on a nigga tracks; he ain't hearin my shit. Man, for real!

FUCK YOU NIGGA, MAN FUCK YOU!

[Ludacris]
Fuck you too! What you wanna do?! Scrawny nigga
But I got a arsenal of automatics down to twenty-twos
Know how to use 'em, fight dirty as SHIT
I throw a grenade and all-in-one bury a CLIQUE
You see y'all got it all wrong like women in tuxedos
And comin up shorter than five Danny DeVitos
I'm on a cool ranch, get laid more than Fritos
With five strippers, four wives and three amigos
I go scuba divin in Bays at Montego
I find gold links and snatch 'em, like I'm Deebo
But I'm the light-skinte-ted version, of Mandingo
I've seen more Beatles and Jagged Edges than Ringo
I used to run numbers in line they caled me BINGO
Cause I'm big, you a little star, you just twinkle
Old asses like sharpeis, y'all all wrinkled
And I stay with more BULLETS, than yo' Billboard singles

[Unnamed Man #3]
Ho, that is just too much! You just gotta give applause! He is definitely all f'real - yaseeI'msayin? Ha ha I be fuckin with him all the time, yahhmean?

Man, I done sold him a QP last week of the flava, yaseewhatI'msayin?

[Ludacris]
YE-AH, can I get a little hit of that, little nigga with a bigga sack
C.P. set a bigger trap look at that Godby Road and Old Nat
Where they kick it at? And a lot of people just don't know
Shady Park you heard just don't go
Quick to flip the bird up po'-po'
Makin the way for that rodeo, that rodeo show!
Gotta hit 'em with a reload, I gotta put 'em with the people
I gotta make a nigga stop, drop, roll - oh no where the beat go?
Bring that, shit back, didn't wanna hear that, clik-clak
Tons of fun with guns
Fuck all the lil' chit-chat get back get that get that
Who knows, who goes there? Motherfuckers it's Poppa Bear
Stop and stare; pourin out a lil' gasoline and then drop a flare
I'm on, FIRE! And you know I can't stop 'til I re-TIRE!
Oh no, we stay swoll, rollin on Vogue TIRES!
Right down the avenue, passin you rapidly stackin
In the back of the Cadillac and packin emergency action
Camera, LIGHT LIGHTS, throwin a punch and then FIGHT FIGHT
Packin a lunch and then BITE BITE, A-T-L stay TIGHT TIGHT

[Unnamed Man #4]
I'm just tryin to save ya shorty! I'mma let you know it's real down heah! When you ride down that 285 and you go past Cascade, get ready to go past that Campbellton Road 'fore you get it to Camp Creek, shorty, just shake; 'cause dat where dem real niggas at!

[Intro: Ving Rhames]
He's a hustler, unbound by law
A self-made millionaire
With a wreckless disregard for the haters
Ludacris, on "Southern Gangsta"...
A true entrepre-negro
CEO of Disturbing Tha Peace Records
He expanded his empire into multiple profitable businesses
Including his Thai food restaurant, Straits
Internet sites, WeMix.com
And my favorite, MyGhetto.com
The MVP of this rap shit

[Verse 1: Ludacris]
Luda! I'm a hustler, BALLER, gangsta, CAP PEELER
I stay strapped like your neighborhood trap dealer
I got rifles that blow ya below ya bible belt
And mac-11's that leave you wetter than Michael Phelps! (woo!)
But you'll be swimmin with the fishes
Softer than bitches washin dishes, fool what's the BUSINESS?
I'm already rich, so talk mo' figures (yup)
Spit 30 large for cigars of you ho niggas (oww!)
I got gangstas that'll rearrange ya whole face
And put your casket on ice, now that's a cold case (ha!)
Never forget where you come or that block'll bang you
I keep my ear to the STREETS like a cocker spaniel
I cock and blast you into outer space
Break every bone in ya, you so out of place
Boom without a trace, you a bluff to block
I got some red beams, let's play connect the dots!

[Interlude: Ving Rhames]
He's the biggest boss, comin outta the M-I-yayo
Straight from the "Port of Miami"
To keepin it "Trilla"
Involved in many heated acts of violence
This goes deeper than rap shit
He's worth eight figures
So young niggas, boss up
I present to you, Rick Ross, the boss

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
I got a letter from the government, the other day
I opened and read it, it said "We were hustlers"
Had a Lexus at 18, picture that
Got a Chevy with pictures on it from pitchin crack
Bitch I know Haitians, we speakin Creole
Bitch I'm a D-boy, still slingin kilos
I got twenty cars, why exaggerate?
It cost me five grand just to fill the gas tanks
Love the marble floors, got the Greek pillrs
Frontin at awards, real street niggas
I used to serve shake, now I serve steaks
Three squares on a row, call it 3rd Bass
Get the Gas Face, chopper in your laugh face
Shoot his ass, aim defense is the last case
Keep Jewish friends, the newest Benz
You in a pool of blood, let me see you swim

[Interlude: Ving Rhames]
Hailing from College Park, Georgia
Authorities figured they must have been some sort of mob
Or illegal organization
According to authorities, they made a quarter mil' a week
Selling mid-grade, they were some high-rollin hustlers
Tity Boi, and Dolla Boy
Playaz Circle, A.K.A., the Duffle Bag Boys

[Verse 3: Tity Boi & Dolla Boy]
Uhh, I'm so sick I wrote this verse in a hospital
It's an election year, I support strippers
We roll like bicycles, icicle flow
White liquor, my nigga stay on line with the blow
I'm on time with the flow, not a minute nor second late
Ain't no such thing as second place
And every day I live heavyweight, you niggas featherweight
Fairytale tellin niggas really need to take a break
And the estate got a lake for a backyard
The pool room product put it all on my sacks card
For real? (Yeah, for real) I'm ill, I deal, I did, I will
I got dogs like Cujo, me and Tity two chains ridin in a two do'
Bitches catch kudos (you know)
Yeah we move weight like sumos
And kicks it with them bitches like judo
SOUTHSIDE!

[Outro: Ving Rhames]
Playaz Circle, Rick Ross, Ludacris
This has been another episode, of "Southern Gangsta"
Thanks for tunin in, what's next for Luda?
Well, anything's possible, in the Theater of the Mind

[Hook 3x]

[Ludacris, Infamous 2-0 and Three 6 Mafia (Ludacris solo)]
Go to sleep, ho! (Go to sleep!)
Go to sleep, ho! (Go to sleep!)
If you're tired, be quiet and go to sleep, ho! (Go to sleep!)

[Verse 1: Ludacris]
Maaan, I tell a ho to go to sleep (go to sleep)
They turn around and frown, gotta make them six feet deep
Cause we knock them unconscious with that nonsense
Read in between that fine print, think about lyrical content
Then about where your time spent
Mess around get your guys hit; a-ten hut
I send Three Six -- oh shee-ot, nigga what?
If you're tired, you're tired; if you snooze, you lose
But'chu you won't wrap up ya bandages, or heal your wounds

[Verse 2: Infamous 2-0]
Nigga, I got shotties and semis -- I love 'dro and Henny
All brown and skinny, but I've fucked up so many
I got QP's and halves - if we beefin', I blast
You sleepin' I laugh, ask 'Cris, I'm off the rip
I had this ho who talked too much; I had to off the bitch
2-0, Mr. Crayola; niggas know what I mean
Cause I slang brown, white, yellow, purple and green
And all you faggot motherfuckers gotta know the routine

[Hook 4x]

[Verse 3: Crunchy Black]
Bitch it's me again, kickin' in your fucking doors
I look for dividends - I ain't looking for you hoes
You bitch can't comprehend; let me put one in your, bro
Let me put one in you, bro, so you niggas can go to sleep
So, lay down bitch; give me all that you dreamed for
Gimme me fancy cars, gimme bling-bling-bling, boy
It don't mean a thing, boy; for me that ain't gon' swing, boy
Them god damn toys; do you know what I mean, boy?

[Verse 4: DJ Paul]
Now if you warring and running from the Three Six niggas
This forty-five gon' give a reason to sleep, nigga
Or busting massive rounds from SK
My last trip to A-T-L I fucked your cascade
I'm stripping bitches and I'mma baller fucker with a limp
They call me infer-stripper, sexy, red ho's pimp
And quick to sink her on the nigga cause this what it's about
We rob that trick and stick his dick off in his fucking mouth
We Memphis niggas

[Hook 4x]

[Verse 5: Juicy J]
North, north, south, south, Westwood, Orange Mound
Nigga we be smokin' life; never Ch-Ch-Charlie Brown
Memphis niggas in this bitch; pockets full, ya know we bail
Hooked up with my nigga 'Cris, then we head to A-T-L
Playas wild, throwing 'bows, telling chickens, "Fuck you ho!"
Nigga rollin' optimo, snorth that white shit up they nose
Man, this town is like my town, so we stayed and hung around
Juicy J be high as fuck; catch me in the lost and found

[Verse 6: Lil' Fate]
Better use common sense, checkin me off a bitch I can still fuck
End up get'n hisself and his clique wet up by tongue licks behind handcuffin a slut

Niggas in the back of the club posted up, waitin for a nigga thats new so they can tuck
Ass in, ain't no askin, its no tolerance on bitch pro-tect-in'
She wit me comments will only get you placed eternally restin'
So abide by the code of the streets, If you got a bitch better keep her on a leash
Cuz Lil' Fate’ll creep in ya home while ya gone have you comin back findin nut on ya sheets, Go to sleep

[Hook 4x]

[Intro: Faizon Love]
It's two a.m. in the morning and its uhh
Light showers and you're probably hookin up with that girl
That's been, two-wayin you all week
Her baby daddy's out of town so uhh, you can fuck around
It's okay to check in that Motel 6
$59.95, not a cent more for that dirty-ass ho, yeah
Stop by that convenience store and pick up them rubbers--Magnum, I hope
This is Faizon Love and uhh, I love hoes

[Hook: Jagged Edge]
Cut up! Know we like that, get that cut up

Get that cut up! Oh-whooooooo, cut up
Freaky thangs, we be bout 'em

[Ludacris]
I'm kinda hopin that maybe you wanna kick it in the L.A.C
So later on we'll be rollin'
Drop tops, I'm hittin' yo' hot spots, I'm top notch
My niggas never listen but I told 'em
When I catch you at the game runnin game at the A.U.C
Then later on we'd be bonin'
Fat cats, I'm ready to tap that, so back that
No wonder why you wakin' up swollen

[Twista]
I'm feelin you Luda', smokin my buddha, coochie recruiter
Comin at the fatty in a platinum Caddy so back it up fast
Hit it a hour and a half, watch the spectacular splash
On the back and leave it drippin down the crack of her ass
Call me Mr. Magilla-cutty, chasin' booty soft as silly putty
Killa for money, still a thug get bump
From slow pokin, to locomotion, hittin bunnies, for threesomes getcha buddy
When I'm feelin scummy I love to cut

[Ludacris]
Thick skin so, butter soft I'm rippin the buttons off yo' blouse
Smell the aroma of a dingaling king Ludacris when I'm in yo' house
Check the ratio of men to women and women to men when down south
Hot fellatio, hot jalapenos, holla while they in yo' mouth
So we love that c-c-c-c

[Hook: Jagged Edge]
Cut up! Know we like that, get that cut up
Freaky thangs, we be bout 'em
Get that cut up! Oh-whooooooo, cut up
Freaky thangs, we be bout 'em

[Twista]
Now I got the feelin' we can cut the hell out each other
And I hope we be the same thang - freaks
We can get the mattress goin 'eh-err, eh-err'
Handlin' business while I bang bang - skeet
Wash the dick off and kick off another session again
I can break 'em off in the shower, kitchen floor or the outdoors
The pieces from the East is the shit
And the flesh in the West is the best
But Twista love them Chicago and South hoes

[Ludacris]
Come up out yo' negligee, freak 'em on a regular day
Cum six times, but it's seven today
Ludacris in the back of your Cheverolet
Ahh, ahh! What's my name?
So magical I come and touch the game
You motherfuckers really lust to gain
Nothin' but hatin and a look of disgust
Always a must, stay "Adrenaline Rush"
Wonderin why they don't be bustin' the same

[Twista]
I'm clutchin my thang
Stuffin in it, strokin it down, beat the stuff up
Uh-uh shorty, don't run from it
She give me the booty I'm breakin' it off
I can tell her style by the way that she walks
Fatty flickin' like it was dubs on it
Peep how this player got skills, get 'em out the gator high heels
Pullin' rubbers and swishers up out your Prada bag
Wanna smoke 'dro I got a bag, take a proper drag before I tap it
I love the chicks that got a lotta ass, so we love that c-c-c-c

[Hook: Jagged Edge]
Cut up! Know we like that, get that cut up
Freaky thangs, we be bout 'em
Get that cut up! Oh-whooooooo, cut up
Freaky thangs, we be bout 'em

[Ludacris]
Bubble, bubble, bubbles is in the bathtub
Makin' you stutter from the b-body butters and backrubs
It's killin me thinkin about the bottles that pop
The models that swallow willin', up under my pillow stayin strapped up
If it tickles in the middle from Mr. Pickles you try to escape
So give me the rope you gettin' wrapped up
Rooty tooty so fruity and fresh, I'm fresh and fruity
Ya duty's to figure the booty's gettin slapped up

[Twista]
I love them chicks that be thick as a loaf of bread
Long as I can still grab her legs, and push 'em up by her head
How I dip up in it we can make a video
But I got the radio bumpin Jagged Edge by the bed
When you wanna get up witcha cutty buddy
Come on and dip off through the hideout with Twist'
But after we do what we gon' do get ya purse and get together
Because now you gots to ride out, bitch

[Ludacris]
Oh 'Cris, can you do it again, that's what they askin' me
Hit skins, causin' catastrophes
Get pinned, by me and my family
Sip gin, fulfillin' your fantasies
In your condition I'm wishin you'll take a lickin'
And keep on tickin' from thicker thighs
Finger lickin' never get sick and tired, just take a look in her eyes
And you can tell she's a figure five, so we love that c-c-c-c

[Hook: Jagged Edge]
Cut up! Know we like that, get that cut up
Freaky thangs, we be bout 'em
Get that cut up! Oh-whooooooo, cut up
Freaky thangs, we be bout 'em

[Bridge: Jagged Edge]
Cut up, gettin brains, in the Range
We love to cut up cause we like them freaky thangs
I like it when you let me try, anythang
Cause girl I ain't got nothin but time
Let a nigga get a little cut up girl
Cut up, gettin brains, in the Range
We love to cut up cause we like them freaky thangs
I like it when you let me try, anythang
Cause girl I ain't got nothin but time
Let a nigga get a little cut up girl

[Outro: 4-Ize]
I come from the eighth planet in the 19th galaxy
Where the royal penis is clean, yo' majesty
Can it be, Sheila E, Apollonia, Vanity, all mad at me?
I'm the Prince dick of insanity
I'm good lovin, body-rockin
Knockin boots all night long, we not stoppin
I don't care if the kids watchin
I stir it like motherfuckin coffee and brown sugar
Girls dem sugar
World class lover, Kama sutra
Porno music producer
Tallywhacker is a rock hard stormtrooper
With a purple helmet, made for crushin pink cookies
Goonie goo-goo, we cut bigfoots and wookies
And fat women, because they need love too
So go on big girl, whatchu gon' do?

[Intro: I-20]
What the fuck's up? DTP in this muthafucka!

[Verse 1: I-20]
Bronson, muthafucka, give me more than three feet
DTP in the club, we comin' more than three deep
Your whole crew is weak and my squad is real cash getters
Stayin' more to crunk, our shit bump like bad clippers
How many try to hustle with Dealer then went broke
Infamous, I'm a value meal, I come with the coke
I gotta enough guns for beef, if you want it that way
I'll push your wig back like finger weaves or bad toupee

[Verse 2: Ludacris]
I lick a load of you niggas, leave kids in the hallways
Catch 'em at they locka (hoo-ahh, blocka blocka)(gun shots)
See 'em on Broadway and tap they ass
Catch 'em in the swimming pool and overlap they ass

[Verse 3: Fate Wilson]
I'm from the southside, College Park
G Road, niggas gone
Ride when the beef starts
Don't hold back, let the heat spark
Bust through his vest, bust through his chest
Sleepy hollows laid the niggas to rest, uh

[Chorus: Ludacris]
Fuck That!
Get the fuck back!
Luda make your skull crack
Tuck that
Bitch, your whole town's on my nutsack

Put it in your weed, nigga, puff that

[Verse 4: Shawna]
What you know about projects, hoes, and murda
Whole lotta game, whole lotta keys and burners
Whole lotta dope fiends, trying to scheme the workers
Whole lotta feds, got them niggas scared to surface
Type of bitch that got the brown in my sock
Find me on tha block tryin' to cop a piece of the crop
Watch me, pull up on me real sweet in a drop
But if you fuckin' with my paper, feel the heat from the Glock, nigga

[Verse 5: Ludacris]
We pop bottles, bottles, right over you head, niggas
Put nozzles, nozzles, right over your leg, niggas
Our motto, motto, is kill 'em instead, niggas
We make 'em loose weight, when we Jenny Craig, niggas

[Verse 6: I-20]
All of ya'll is half nice, half thugs, and half assed
The only time Im goin' half, is half on a half
But I use a full clip, cuz I'm a full fledged killa
Part-time MC, full-time drug dealer

[Chorus: Ludacris]
Fuck That!
Get the fuck back!

[Verse 7: Fate Wilson]
We them filthy niggas from the South, A-Town representas
Strong armin' mafuckas, like a Russian sickle
You got issues with us talkin' shit on mixtapes
Ill catch you at a show and beat you with a mixtape
You best pump brakes, 'fore I pump shells and blood ooze
I leave niggas like burps (burp), excuse
Just keep on pissin' me off, like a weak kidney
And you will find your family reading your obituary

[Verse 8: Ludacris]
These people tryin' to scrub the red off
Stains they don't get off
They wanted to bring the pain, so this thang 'bout to set off
Barretas for getting cheddar, you're better off dead off
Yes, you can do it, cut his fuckin' head off

[Verse 9: Shawna]
I got a letter from the government, the other day
They told me that the bitches caught a shipment of my yay
They on their way, three minutes to get the k
Two minutes to get the weight, one minute and I'mma spray

[Chorus: Ludacris]
Fuck That!
Get the fuck back!
We make your skull crack
Tuck that
Bitch, your whole town's on my nutsack
Cuff that

[Outro: Ludacris]
Bang bang kill a man let his brains hang
And when I'm in the court, plead guilty insane
They put me in a ward, I'mma have to maintain
But when I hit bricks won't a damn thing change

[Outro: Fate Wilson]
Bang bang kill a man let his brains hang
And when I'm in the court, plead guilty insane
They put me in a ward, I'mma have to maintain
But when I hit bricks won't a damn thing change

[Verse 1: Fate Wilson]
Okay, I remember the days
High rights, low lefts, even stevens and fades
Troops, Lottos, and BKs, those was the days
Hi-tec boots spray painted witcha names
T-shirts airbrushed that read the same
Thick herringbone chain, one gold with yo' initial
Harris Photos, group shots, can you remember?
Barry him told his bitch go to the prom and die
Didn't lie shot his-self in the head with the 4-5
When she disobeyed, had North Clayton crazed
Just to reiterate dog those was the days
Fo' the invasions of haters, man crews from all around
Used to get down at True Flavas, bumpin Key Lo
Rockin Damage, Cross Colour and Paco
While playboys stepped in talent shows
Prom night, tux and Kangol was so cool
Fuck them new model cars we ridin' old school (old school)

[Hook: Keon Bryce]
We were tryin so hard
Hard to survive
Cause even though we were young
We had to stay strong
No matter what we went through
It was me and my crew
And that's how it went
When we were kids

[Verse 2: Fate Wilson]
In 3 months we stayed in Jamestown
Hamwood and Diplomats
Played with Transformers, G.I. Joe's and Thundercats
We was lovin' that
Before they started jackin jacks
For notes from Red Oaks had folks scared to come through
College Park after dark, Crown Victorias police unmarked cars
Be aware, Wayne Williams was out there, but we ain't care
Kids was gettin stabbed and ditched out there too busy playin
Double dare ya touch shorty on the ass, that's a bet
Want your Kool-Aid and sugar, smack your hands and say "sweat"
It's mine now place it in my Louis Vuitton pouch
Thump a nigga on his knuckles make him say ouch
Slouch socks, box Chevy Caprice
Hot Niss, cut da whole Disturbin' Tha Peace
Wit no conscience, broke niggas call 'em non cents
No comments, it's Lil' Fate payin homage to College Park

[Hook: Keon Bryce]
We were tryin so hard
Hard to survive
Cause even though we were young
We had to stay strong
No matter what we went through
It was me and my crew
And that's how it went
When we were kids

[Verse 3: Ludacris]
I had a Long John but no Silver, no gold or plat
I was simply red from the years I been holdin' back
With two sides to a book I lick stamps and light matches
And set fires in garbage pails and cabbage patches
A child of the corn been wild since I was born
Climbin' over barbed wire, clothes got torn
Shoes got muddy and my clique turned cruddy
Wherever I go they went they my buddies
I brush teeth, brush naps and calm streets
Dreamin' of Cadillacs, wood wheels and plush seats
Cats with gold teeth and raps with such beats
Macks with no grief and some sacks of green leaf
When I loaded my cap gun I was ready for action
Starin' at beer cans and a moment to crack one
Wanna hang with the big boys and play with the big toys
And be with the people makin all that got damn noise, man

[Hook] - repeat 2X

[Intro: Ludacris]
Oooh-Oooh!
Oooh-Oooh!
Oooh-Oooh!
Oooh-Oooh!

[Hook: Ludacris] + (Sleepy Brown)
I gotta big weed stash, pocket full of cash
Just seen a big ol' ass (It's Saturday!)
Sticky, icky, icky
Sticky, icky, icky, icky
System on blast, cops just passed
Just seen a big ol' ass (It's Saturday!)
Sticky, icky, icky (Oooh-Oooh!)
Sticky, icky, icky, icky (Oooh-Oooh!)

[Verse 1: Ludacris]
Grease don't pop on the stove no more
Moved on up
Double shot Hennessey fill my cup
Luda choke smoke in a big black truck
Should I wild out? (WHAT THE FUCK?!)
Act like my rims ain't clean
How you gonna act like my neck don't bling?
Haters get sprayed like Afro-Sheen
But they don't ever really wanna pop them thangs
Cane, cane sugar man, Luda don't go
And I stop at a light, pulled up so slow
But I'm out for the night, so pass that 'dro
So daddy come home in a Cadillac brome (Cadillac brome?)
Now, don't it sound absurd?
Claim College Park where they flip them birds
Trick car alarms, then bend them curves
Chop chop, chunk it up, fat man herb

[Hook: Ludacris] + (Sleepy Brown)
I gotta big weed stash, pocket full of cash
Just seen a big ol' ass (It's Saturday!)
Sticky, icky, icky
Sticky, icky, icky, icky
System on blast, cops just passed
Just seen a big ol' ass (It's Saturday!)
Sticky, icky, icky (Oooh-Oooh!)
Sticky, icky, icky, icky (Oooh-Oooh!)

[Verse 2: Ludacris]
It's illegal but the plants in my backyard grow
That's my bud
Smoke 'til ya drop out, that's my luck
Keep a couple rolled and I hit the club
In the back door (NIGGA WHAT?!)
Act like I don't make clouds
How you gonna act like I don't get loud?
How you gonna act like I don't rock crowds?
And leave a lot of people with a gap-tooth smile
If I recollect right then you sound like dirt
But I guess what you don't really know don't hurt
With a vest and a pump, hear the shotgun squirt
My folks on the block, man, they got that work (They got that work?)
Don't it smell so good?
In Southwest where they rep that hood
Protect your chest, they up to no good
And come through flossin', they wish y'all would

[Hook: Ludacris] + (Sleepy Brown)
I gotta big weed stash, pocket full of cash
Just seen a big ol' ass (It's Saturday!)
Sticky, icky, icky
Sticky, icky, icky, icky
System on blast, cops just passed
Just seen a big ol' ass (It's Saturday!)
Sticky, icky, icky (Oooh-Oooh!)
Sticky, icky, icky, icky (Oooh-Oooh!)

[Verse 3: Ludacris]
Worldwide hustlers get that dough
Work that tip
Get rid of evidence, move that brick
Keep a D-Eagle with an extra clip
Think it ain't so? (SUCK A DICK!)
Act like I just do rap
How you gonna act like I just ain't strapped?
How you gon' act like I don't push 'Lacs?
Black El-Dorado, fifth wheel on back
Itchy finger trigger, man, Luda don't squeeze
With a mac, with a Glock, I'mma make 'em say please
In the back, on the block so the cops say "freeze"
And I'm so high, I think I got a nose bleed (You got a nose bleed?)
Don't it smell so sweet?
In Decatur, where we pack that heat
And rob neighbors in the night, creep, creep
I'll see you later when we in them streets

[Hook: Ludacris] + (Sleepy Brown)
I gotta big weed stash, pocket full of cash
Just seen a big ol' ass (It's Saturday!)
Sticky, icky, icky
Sticky, icky, icky, icky
System on blast, cops just passed
Just seen a big ol' ass (It's Saturday!)
Sticky, icky, icky (Oooh-Oooh!)
Sticky, icky, icky, icky (Oooh-Oooh!)

[Preacher]
Sister Martha, so glad to see you
So glad your parol came through
Oh yea so glad everybody came out this morning
We reading from the book of hush, today
Verse sixty-nine, come on somebody, come on somebody
Good to see all of you came out this morning
Even though some of you just leavin' 112
Smellin like booty, and Hennessy, come on
Courvoisier double shots, ha-hah, it don't matter!

[Hook]
Keep it on the hush, don't say nothing
Ain't gone be no talking, while I'm doing my thang
Keep it on the hush, don't say nothing
Ain't gone be no talking, while I'm doing my thang

[Verse 1: Ludacris]
Im loving the way your legs go so far back, you're one of those flexible girls
I figure your daddy always said you was one of the best in this world
But nevertheless in this world, I'm just professional girl
I teach 'em a lesson, have 'em stressin and confessin to girls
How good it was, and how good it could be, if they just tried it
Taking my double dosage skip the daily dick diet
T-ried it, they so excited, and can't hide it
Im trying to do my thang, but you gotta be quiet

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Ludacris]
Now even when I just come in your house and cover your mouth because your momma is home
You grippin' the sheets and making a effort not to holler and moan
You got to keep it on the hush, cause we in no rush
You tellin' me its the little things that mean so much
And its an illusion thinkin' that you can match what I can do best
So if ya man call, tell him to put some hair on his chest
But he don't even have to know, we keepin it on the low
You walking it like a dog, and stay working it like a pro, so..

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Ludacris]
I'mma taste ya neck, and begin to nibble around your earlobes
Down to your belly button, then I'm un-snappin' your bra thinkin' your titties are tryna tell me somethin
Hard nipples, colder then ice-sicles
Workin' it with my tounge, you can just tell me if it tickles
Freaky deaky kinda sneaky, Ludacris and the gang
Disturbin' the peace, we runnin' the streets and steady slangin' them thangs
But you gotta keep the noise down, in order to keep the boy down
Its joy all around, and you know how it sounds, if you just..

[Hook - repeat til fade]

[Preacher]
As the crime scene evolves, the doors are open, the doors are open

Look at you sister Johnson in the front row
With thongs on, your legs open tryna tempt me
Keep it on the hush, i'll be over at about seven o'clock
Keep it on the hush, shhh
{Chorus: Ludacris, Chimere}
It ain't no one to trust but me
And I got to make sure that I take care of my family
And it ain't no choices 'cause it's cold outside (It's cold outside)
And to my niggas on the block
On the grind and hustlin' tryin' to sell some rocks
You hear the voices say it's cold outside (It's cold outside)
I'm hidin' out and smokin' herb
'Cause my boss is gettin' on my motherfuckin' nerves
But I got to take it 'cause it's cold outside (It's cold outside)
See rappin' is my only way
My mama told me just to save it for another day
But I got to make it 'cause it's cold outside (It's cold outside)

{Verse 1}
Man, I can hear that wind blowin'
You say it don't get cold in CP
Well niggas it's been snowin'
Even though some might disagree
When business is still slowin'
Even if we subject to change
Come up out them diamonds and rings
Even all them dollars and change
Nigga we home-grown
And to those that couldn't take the pressure
Nigga they long gone
Skeet 25 lighters on dressers
Or you'll get zoned on
They be puttin' them bodies in bags
They be cuttin' them bodies on slabs
Then go to somebody and brag
Got to keep a straight face
Better keep inside what you know
Got to find a safe place
Better stay in silence or go
Or end up a waste case
Pick figure it's more stuff to do
Pick nigga it's more folks than you
Pigs never come close to a clue
I put my life on it
Want to disrespect give me your neck
And I'll put a knife on it
Some say it's slippery when wet
But my Roll got ice on it
It's all about supply and demand
It's all about me buyin' some land
You folks just don't understand
That, uh
{Chorus: Ludacris, Chimere}
It ain't no one to trust but me
And I got to make sure that I take care of my family
And it ain't no choices 'cause it's cold outside (It's cold outside)
And to my niggas on the block
On the grind and hustlin' tryin' to sell some rocks
You hear the voices say it's cold outside (It's cold outside)
I'm hidin' out and smokin' herb
'Cause my boss is gettin' on my motherfuckin' nerves
But I got to take it 'cause it's cold outside (It's cold outside)
See rappin' is my only way
My mama told me just to save it for another day
But I got to make it 'cause it's cold outside (It's cold outside)

{Verse 2}
Man, I see the clouds comin'
Y'all see a man on the moon walkin'
I see a crowd runnin'
And the APD steadily talkin'
'Cause we done found somethin'
And it's not as good as it seems
Oh, I wish I could get some cream
And get up out of the hood with some dreams
I'm peepin' hard crimes
See the system's fucked up
And they givin' out some hard times
Heard one of these wannabes lucked up
And one of my people snortin' hard lines
Locked up and they didn't do a thang
Locked up because of the pressure and pain
Locked up because they wouldn't do the same
And I see the case closed
I can't ask no questions, and it's over
'Cause they say so
I ain't learned no lessons, but these snitches
Better lay low
Or we gonna be choppin' some heads
And we gonna be rockin' some beds
And we gonna be droppin' some eggs
We walk a long road
Tryna find the essence of self
But I picked the wrong clothes
'Do rag with a gat under my belt
'Cause life's throwin' strong blows
But I keep a little hope and some dreams
And I try to stay focused and clean
But I got a little dope and some green
'Cause, uh
{Chorus: Ludacris, Chimere}
It ain't no one to trust but me
And I got to make sure that I take care of my family
And it ain't no choices 'cause it's cold outside (It's cold outside)
And to my niggas on the block
On the grind and hustlin' tryin' to sell some rocks
You hear the voices say it's cold outside (It's cold outside)
I'm hidin' out and smokin' herb
'Cause my boss is gettin' on my motherfuckin' nerves
But I got to take it 'cause it's cold outside (It's cold outside)
See rappin' is my only way
My mama told me just to save it for another day
But I got to make it 'cause it's cold outside (It's cold outside)

{Verse 3}
I can see them shamed faces
Man, y'all look at me like y'all grew up
In the same places
Scams and dirty work came up on
A day to day basis
Now they got to re-up and re-bag
And they got to re-up and re-slab
Then they got to be up and be bad
This game'll never end
Excuse my French, but God dammit
I got some clever friends
They might get set back by some wench
But that bitch'll never win
It's all about the way of the world
It's all about the way of them girls
It's all about them diamonds and pearls
We waitin' too long
But the DEC and Southwest Atlanta
Is too strong
We might bring that soap out and wash up
And throw them suits on
Comin' in the court with some pride
'Cause we ain't got nothin' to hide
Just didn't know what laws to abide
I play the cards dealt
And I bought a full house and I watched
The woman's heart melt
See my mama's cooled out and she's cryin'
'Cause it's heart-felt
It's all about supply and demand
It's all about me buyin' some land
You folks just don't understand
That, uh
{Chorus: Ludacris, Chimere}
It ain't no one to trust but me
And I got to make sure that I take care of my family
And it ain't no choices 'cause it's cold outside (It's cold outside)
And to my niggas on the block
On the grind and hustlin' tryin' to sell some rocks
You hear the voices say it's cold outside (It's cold outside)
I'm hidin' out and smokin' herb
'Cause my boss is gettin' on my motherfuckin' nerves
But I got to take it 'cause it's cold outside (It's cold outside)
See rappin' is my only way
My mama told me just to save it for another day
But I got to make it 'cause it's cold outside

[Intro: Harve ‘Joe Hooker’ Pierre]
Born Again, pain

[Verse 1: 2Pac & Harve ‘Joe Hooker’ Pierre]
The motherfuckin' dust kicker, who can you trust?
Do you have the heart to see a nigga, before you bust?
My name is spoken on the tongues of so many foes
Bustin' motherfuckers out the box, I ain't even go
Now how the hell do you explain, my claim to fame?
From doin' flicks to bustin' tricks out the fuckin' frame
Got these bitches on my jock, niggas on my block
Jealous ass suckers got 'em duckin' from my smokin' Glock
And bustin' niggas asses to stay alive
Skinny ass player watchin' bigger motherfuckers fry
They ask me how I’m livin?
I’m a hustler, buckin' busters 'til they die
Now it's on in the ghetto you ain't heard?
Niggas got they AKs headin' for the 'burbs
Aimin' at them skin head bitches let it rain (House of pain, oh)
Givin' 'em a wet welcome to the house of pain

[Chorus: Harve ‘Joe Hooker’ Pierre]
House of pain (Joe Hooker), house of pain, house of pain
Welcome to the house of pain
House of pain (Woah), house of pain (Woah), house of pain
Welcome to the house of pain

[Verse 2: Stretch & Harve ‘Joe Hooker’ Pierre]
Yo, I’m hunting down this nigga and he knows so he’s stressin'
He better count his blessings, and get ready for this lesson
'Cause Stretch about to teach him, when I reach him with the MAC
And lay that ass down on this motherfuckin' back, jack
Slack is somethin' that a nigga don't take
His moms run the church, so I'ma see her at his fuckin' wake
Make way, the nigga paid me the other day
I'm walking with my son, and the nigga had somethin' to say
Hey, the nigga tried to diss, boy, he got it twisted
He should've watch Americans Most, I'm listed
For killin' mothafuckers like him
So I'ma bring him to the House of Pain and kill him with a grin
Flim-flam, goddamn, I'm not the one
Before I'ma choke him and smoke him
I'ma smack him with my fuckin' gun
Son you've made your last mistake and I don't know your name (House of pain, whoa)
But welcome to the house of pain

[Chorus: Harve ‘Joe Hooker’ Pierre]
House of pain, house of pain, house of pain
Welcome to the house of pain
House of pain (Woah), house of pain (Woah), house of pain
Welcome to the house of pain

[Verse 3: Notorious B.I.G. & Harve ‘Joe Hooker’ Pierre]
The country bud got me chokin'
I'm on a mission to the point that motherfuckers think I'm smokin'
Yeah, that sick nigga Biggie with the 8 shot fifth
With the extra clip for that extra shit
Don't you know that killing is thrilling?
All the blood spilling is all a part of drug dealing
A born gangster, my daddy was a thug
Had a .38 with the hollow point slug
So when he licked shots, niggas dropped
Quicker than a bootlegger sells his liquor
A little nigga tryna squeeze .22's in my Reebok shoes
Payin' dues, while kids was on their one's and two's, huh
Now I'm much older, colder, fuck a holster
Got the MAC-11 swingin' from my shoulder
It's a damn shame I got to put my momma through this strain (House of pain)
I'm livin' in the house of pain

[Chorus: Harve ‘Joe Hooker’ Pierre]
House of pain, house of pain, house of pain
Welcome to the house of pain
House of pain (Woah), house of pain (Woah), house of pain
Welcome to the house of pain
House of pain, house of pain (Woah), house of pain
Welcome to the house of pain (We might die in here)
House of pain (Woah), house of pain (Woah), house of pain
Welcome to the house of pain

[Outro: Harve 'Joe Hooker' Pierre]
Woah, woah (This is a tribute)
Woah, woah (Bad Boy)
Woah, woah (House of Pain)
Woah, woah
Woah, woah (Ch, lost)
Woah, woah
Woah, woah
Woah, woah
Woah, woah

[Intro: Sebastian]
Oh
Two Step
Oh

[Verse 1: Timbaland]
Let me talk to you, girl
I'm in your part of town
I call your phone and you're nowhere to be found
You do this every time
You be MIA every single time
The part that kills me
You'd rather chill with your friends instead of me
Huh, but I ain't gon' be no clown
I guess I'll call you next time I'm in your town
Then you say to me

[Pre-Chorus: Keri Hilson]
So what? I was out with my friends
I'm a grown woman
It's the weekend (Oooh)
So what, if I don't answer my phone
What if I'm not alone?
I'm with him
What's it to you?

[Chorus: Keri Hilson]
I need to get out
You, you, you, you, you
Are killin' me
You're killin' me
You're killin' me
And I just wanna get out
You you you you you
Are killin' me
You're killin' me
You're...
What you wanna do, do, do?
What you wanna do, do, do?

[Verse 2: Keri Hilson]
Tell me
I cannot escape no matter what I do
Can't get away from you
Call me everyday and that was never cool
Gettin' on my nerves, I think it's time you knew
Oh, they gave you my number cause
In the train you was cuter plus
You looked sad and lonely (Ooooh)
But that's all it was, put you in the game and
Here y'go complainin'
What's up with you?

[Chorus: Keri Hilson]
I need to get out
You, you, you, you, you
Are killin' me
You're killin' me
You're killin' me
And I just wanna get out
You you you you you
Are killin' me
You're killin' me
You're...
What you wanna do, do, do?
What you wanna do, do, do?

[Verse 3: Sebastian]
Like "Whoa" lil' mama
It's the second time I'm callin' your number
I ain't chasin', I ain't even no runner
But you know I push the Hummer in the summer
Huh, how you hard to be reached?
I can put you where you hard to be reached
Black sand on the balls of your feet
You can scream "Ain't nobody gone be 'sleep"
This your own private beach (Haha)
And when it comes to sex
Just a little bit of love and a little bit of that
Baby, push your back where your ribs is at
Share a bowl of crunch berries, how real is that? (Haha)
I'm just jokin' of course
I'm tryin' to put your sex game back on course
If you feelin' dry like you don't get moist
If you ever get a minute holler at your boy

[repeat 2X]
Take to the heaaaaaaaaaaaad
And buy another round

Are you down?

[Pharrell - whispering]
All that huffing puffing that you do
You got somethin on your mind
All that rocking that you do
You got somethin on your mind
I can tell by the way you move
You got somethin on your mind
It seem like you got somethin to prove
You got somethin on your mind

[Interlude]
We got a connection, some synergy
Ain't no other woman please, it's just you
Somewhere intersection, I feel energy
It's like tingling, it must be true - that's because

[Chorus]
You're my temple, get on my knees
And I come to you, yes I come to you
It's just that simple, your lovin heat
Like the sun would do, is why I run to you

[Pharrell - whispering]
{UHHH~!} Yeah
I like bush (take your panties off)
You're in motion in the mirror as a rainbow dandelion
I suspect you know what it does when I see yo' pantyline
All that lotion in your hands
You got somethin on your mind
And all that fixin in your pants
You got somethin on your mind

[Interlude] + 

[Chorus]

[Pharrell]
Yeah, I know you had, your ups and downs
But look at you girl, you're on top now

(You such a nasty girl, oooh what's on your mind?)
Take to the heaaaaaaaaaaaad
And buy another round
(Let me in your nasty world, let me show you what it like behind)
Are you down?

[Verse 1]
Yo
The first time I heard Digital Underground I was in the first grade
My homie, Lace, brought it over and he dubbed it on a mixtape
I would do the Humpty Hump and perform to his verses
12 Years later, I learned that Shock G and him were the same person
I loved Hammer I can't front he taught me how to dance
Along with Bell Biv DeVoe I had Jay-O's and a pair of zebra pants
But this was the foundation
What would come to be a life long passion, journey and drive an MC
Some people ask me what it means
I dont know where to start
Its the deepest connection between my soul and my heart
When I first stepped to do a cypher in a jam at the park
I got served No for real I got served
But see I learned something observed others
And watched an urge hungered
Verse studier earned a turn on that block
I dont care who you are or where you're from or what you believe in
But if you love Hip Hop I bet
Its more or less for the same reason
This is it when you spit you exist in that moment
And if you're sick with that gift you then rip it when you perform it
Then all the shit that you live begins to lift off your shoulders
And the audience well they get to experience where your soul is
The most amazing feeling rocking a crowd to your anthem
To the front to the back with their motherfucking hands up
Cause I'm an MC won't be the first won't be the last
Just another B-Boy and I'ma die in my stance

[Hook]
If you got a pen and a pad put your heart down
If you got a record and can crab lay your scratch down
If you got a marker and a can bomb your art now
If you got a floor and you're fast kick that ill style
If you got a pen and a pad put your heart down
If you got a record and can crab lay your scratch down
If you got a marker and a can bomb whole damn town
But If you live for hip hop dont ever put your hands down

Dont put your hands down Keep that shit up
We're gonna rock it like this
It goes front back front back front back front Come on
It goes front back front back I said front back
To my people you know it
It goes front back front back it goes front back
Okay, bring it down

[Verse 2]
Now I don't know if it's the clothes, the hoes or the cars
That make people rap like they're trapped inside these bars
This shit ain't complicated, man, just be who you are
Too busy searching for the light, missing the fact that you're a star
Now who's got passion? Stand the hell up
'Cause I wanna hear somebody rapping who's got it inside their cuts
Now you can get intricate, displaying your fancy cadences
But if you're not speaking the truth you might as well not be saying shit
I said "Who's going to teach the kids?"
You wanna blow up and get famous so you can get some new rims
All the money in the world can help you look like a star
But money can't buy you the heart to go and put inside your bars
And I like nice shit too
Believe me, I got a closet full of Nikes and whole bunch of Velour suits
Fitted white Tees and an Icy earrings like the whole youth population of hip-hop
But look beyond it when I record to these beats
But if I don't speak me
What's the difference between my lyrics and what you hearin' on MTV
People fear that if they're steering away from the mainstream
Then their album won't sell, well, I could give a fuck
I'm just gonna freestyle and spit what's inside my gut
And if you want to you can go and label me conscious
But just remember there's a kid at a bus stop beatboxing
Whose life's will be affected by what's inside of his Walkman

[Hook]
If you got a pen and a pad put your heart down
If you got a record and can grab lay your scratch down
If you got a marker and a can bomb your art now
If you got a floor and you're fast kick that ill style
If you got a pen and a pad put your heart down
If you got a record and can grab lay your scratch down
If you got a marker and a can bomb the whole damn town
But if you live for Hip Hop dont ever put your hands down

[Pharrell]
First day of school, guess who
I would bump into?
The creme de la creme, that's you
But they treat you like, doo doo
So then you had to use, my wit
And think a-bout it
That's when I had to admit
They were right, you're the shit

[Chorus]
I don't care who gets you
I don't care what they don't see
I don't need God to remix you
It's less for them, but mo' for me!
Oh you're so perfect, oh don't ignore me girl
Them other girls just service, they do nothin' for me girl
Oh you're so perfect, don't you ignore me girl
Ain't no need to be nervous, this'll workout surely girl

[Pharrell]
Let's take it slow to begin
Don't worry I got the blueprint
Get to know you, then we win
Friends turn to love, the end
I know it's always, somethin'
But they ain't talkin' 'bout, nothin'
This is my car, jump in
Cinderella, no pumpkin

[Chorus]
I don't care who gets you
I don't care what they don't see
I don't need God to remix you
It's less for them, but mo' for me!
Oh you're so perfect, oh don't ignore me girl
Them other girls just service, they do nothin' for me girl
Oh you're so perfect, don't you ignore me girl
Ain't no need to be nervous, this'll workout surely girl

[N*E*R*D]
Yeah, why?
Ahh c'mon cheer up baby
You know I make you laugh
Meet Tina, Tonya, Tracy
We're havin' a bubble bath
The girls are blowin' bubbles
They naked in the field
The smoke comes out the flowers
Mm-hmm, you know the deal

[Chorus]
I don't care who gets you
I don't care what they don't see
I don't need God to remix you
It's less for them, but mo' for me!
Oh you're so perfect, oh don't ignore me girl
Them other girls just service, they do nothin' for me girl
Oh you're so perfect, don't you ignore me girl
Ain't no need to be nervous, this'll workout surely girl

[Pharrell]
Oh you're so perfect, oh don't ignore me girl
Them other girls just service, they do nothin' for me girl
Oh you're so perfect, don't you ignore me girl
Ain't no need to be nervous, this'll workout surely girl

[Chorus]
I don't care who gets you
I don't care what they don't see
I don't need God to remix you
It's less for them, but mo' for me!
Oh you're so perfect, oh don't ignore me girl
Them other girls just service, they do nothin' for me girl
Oh you're so perfect, don't you ignore me girl
Ain't no need to be nervous, this'll workout surely girl

Talking on the phone (talking on the phone, you)
Gotta get your own (gotta get your own man)
Leave my man alone (leave my man alone and stop)
Callin' him on the phone (callin' him on the phone)

[Verse 2: Kelly Price]
Don't hang with girls, cuz they too slick

You don't know what, what I've been through
I'll get him first, then I'll deal with..you

[Chorus: Kelly Price ]
Talking on the phone (talking on the phone)
Gotta get your own (you gotta get your own man)

Tongue tactic

[Verse 4: Alien & Kelly Price]
What I need right now

To come meet me in space
Now could y'all sing that for me one more again
The first verse

[Verse 1 repeat: Kelly Price]
I trusted her, my home girl from school (yea yea)
Introduced her to my man, they became cool (uh)
She told me that, that he loved me so (wah wah wah wah)
I shoulda known she liked him all along (yo)
They were

[Chorus: Kelly Price ]
Talking on the phone (talking on the phone)
Gotta get your own (you gotta get your own man)

[Verse 5: Alien & Kelly Price]
How do y'all like space?
Can you dig it? (wah wah wah wah)
Now if you like space for all my martian people out there
I need all y'all to put y'alls hand up
If you can feel me
Cuz need Kelly to sing the second verse for me on the space version

[Verse 2 repeat: Alien and Kelly Price]
Don't hang with girls, cuz they too slick
They smile in my face, all on my man's (ohh...ficky ficky)
You don't know what, what I've been through
I'll get him first, then I'll deal with it (what she doin' girl)
You

[Chorus: Kelly Price]
Talking on the phone (say what)
Ta-ta-ta-talking on the phone (can you feel it)
Ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-talking on the phone (say what, yea)
Ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-talking on the phone (yea, say what, yo yo yo yo yo)
Talking on the phone (I'm feeling quite good right now)
Talking on the phone (but I think it's time for me to take my spaceship to another planet)
Talking on the phone (cuz right now I don't think the world is ready for Timbaland)
Ta-ta-talking on the phone (I'm on that next level, can you dig it)
Ta-ta-talking on the phone (can you dig it)
Ta-ta-talking on the phone (I don't think so)

[Outro: Alien]
Come to the light, Kelly!

[Timbaland]
Do you like it?  Uh, uh, uh, what
Do you want it?  Uh, uh, uh, what
Do you like it?  Uh, uh, uh, what
Do you want it?  Uh, uh, uh, say what, here we go
Do you like it?  Uh, uh, uh, what, here we go
Do you want it?  Uh, uh, uh, what, here we go
Do you like it?  Uh, uh, uh, what, here we go
Do you want it?  Part two, part two

[Bassey]
Why you always askin' me why I talk like that?
What, you think you betta, nigga, cuz your pockets are fat?
Excuse me?  But wasn't I the one that you meant?
You talkin' trash to these niggas about to dent up they whip
You know me and I don't think I have to explain
You that same crotty nigga that fucked that bitch in my Range
It was the same, life, it was talked up a good game
Between that money and that pussy that she claim to fame

[Timbaland]
Look at you, talkin'-tellin' all the bullcrap lies
It was you who made me put my hands on your thighs
Never ever was the one that humped that girl on your Rover
You forgot your baby cousin humped that girl on your Rover
It's Timbaland, baby, I don't get down like that
Don't try to explain, get yo ass to the back
Never ever disrepsect the man that put you on his team
Now baby dove, get the keys to your Beem'
1	

[Timbaland]
	Why you talkin' big trash to me?
	

[Bassy]
	Cuz you always playin' games, Timothy
	

[Timbaland]
	Why you tryin' to make me mad, ba-be
	

[Bassy]
	Cuz you always playin' games, Timothy
	
	

[Timbaland]
	Why you talkin' big trash to me?
	

[Bassey]
	Cuz you always playin' games, Timothy
	

[Timbaland]
	Why you tryin' to make me mad, ba-be
	

[Bassey]
	Because you always playin' games with Bassy

[Bassey]
I done met many players that act like you
Think because they spend some money that I'm ready to screw
Instead of talkin' 'Hit me up around the 1st and the 5th'
Cuz you rot in a crumbed out six, you think I'm whipped
Got numerous niggas that be rottin' my shit
And the last thing I need is a nigga for kicks
I stay dibbed and forever spend the louchie on Gucci
Fuck the money and diamonds cuz nigga, I'm still shinin'

[Timbaland]
Look at you, girl, talkin' trash
Talkin' trash, actin' grown, show your ass
Don't try to get on my track and clown
You my queen, my mistress, my Jackie Brown
Why you tryin' to start trouble in my can?
Now hot and angry and I'm getting amped
Keep on givin' me the cold shoulder
Now I got to get the keys to the Roller
You gone

Repeat 1

[Bassey]
It was all for the paper, that's right, all for the love
Only wanted most what ghetto girls dream of
I need the Hummers and the yachts, Don P on the rocks
Cardierre wrist wear with the shivel on top
Then you lace me, now you hate me, now you tryin' to replace me
Had a woman when you dated me, I guess I was crazy (know you was crazy)
Tried to play me but your game's a little lazy
Cuz I hooked up and got with your man, nigga scrammed

[Timbaland]
Girl, what you know about Cardi and wrist wear?
When you don't even wear Vic's Underwear
Think before you start talkin' shit
Remember, I'm the man with the diamonds and whips
I ain't tryin' to beg, but a legend like those speedos
I ain't gon get mad if you hump one of my people
I keep tellin' you this is me you talkin' to
Talkin' trash won't get you nowhere, baby boo
Repeat 1
Repeat 1

[Verse 1: Timbaland]
I would love to see you go
I wonder if you know
That you, and I
Can lose, control
We on the other side of the globe
You didn't come this far to say no
Let's walk (let's walk) let's race (let's race)
Let's ride (let's ride) the flow

[Pre-Chorus: Timbaland]
We got the laser lights flashin' everywhere

[Chorus]

(repeat)

[Verse 2]

Magoo whats up my *nigga*
Do you want this girl with this fine figure
Get with her
After that then we trick her
Then get her drunk off the Thunderbird Liquor
Then video tape her like that man did on Slipper
If she acts up dismiss her (what what what)
I hope she don't think we acting hard
Cus we in with the mayor and that big boy Sarge
Ain't that large
They will say it will be that
With Timberland and that Maganoo sound now
You must go through initiation
Bad situation
Like a brother on a plantation
Time is wasting
Catch me on location
On your funky radio station
Da Funk Da Funk
(repeating funk through the chorus)

Chorus

[Verse 3]

1,2 1,2 where ya gonna run to
When I come through when you start acting brand new
I'm like a maniac when I do my track
I doubt it if my beats will be whack
Play like Sylvester and leave me Stallone
Cus I'm gonna find your girl and make her moan (what)
Make her get on and on (on and on on on on and on)
Now I got this far
I'm a smooth black brother so I paid off the star
Hot now I'm gone with the quickness
It's a damn shame I am so relentless
I'm the crazy thriller
I slap the F off Farina and then took his Miller
I like (I like)
Cus I'm right
Old tight (won't tight)
Riight

Chorus almost to the end
"Da Funk" is repeated till the end

[Verse 1: Chris Daughtry]
Traveled all around the world to be with you
You never know where the open road will lead you to
I crawled before I walked and still got nowhere fast
The other side still has the greener grass
Oh-oh-ohh... you win some and you lose some, yeah
Oh-oh-ohh... and things look so much smarter from up here

[Chorus: Chris Daughtry]
I hear it's such a long way down
And the climb back up ain't as easy as it sounds
I hear it's such a long way down
And the climb back up is just somethin' I can do without
Somethin' I can do without

[Verse 2: Timbaland & Chris Daughtry]
C'mon
I walked until I didn't have no energy
I bought until I didn't have no bite left in me
I died so that I didn't have to live in the past
But the other side still had the greener grass
Check it
Oh-oh-ohh.. you win some and you lose some, yeah
Oh-oh-ohh... and things look so much smarter from up here

[Chorus: Chris Daughtry]
I hear it's such a long way down
And the climb back up ain't as easy as it sounds

And the climb back up is just somethin' I can do without
Somethin' I can do without

[Verse 3: Timbaland & Chris Daughtry]

[Verse 1: Timbaland]
What's somebody like you, doing in a place like this?
Say, did you come alone, or did you bring all your friends?
Say what's your name, what you drinkin'?
I think I know what you're thinking
Baby, what's your sign?
Tell me yours, I'll tell you mine
Say, what's somebody like you
Doing in a place like this?
(One, two, three, c'mon!)

[Chorus: Timbaland & Katy Perry]
I'll never be the same - if we ever meet again
Won't let you get away - say if we ever meet again
This free fall (Ahh) got me so (Ohh)
Kiss me all night, don't ever let me go
I'll never be the same - if we ever meet again

[Post-Chorus: Timbaland]
Ohh, ohh
Say if we ever meet again

[Verse 2: Katy Perry]
Do you come here much? I swear I've seen your face before (Before, yeah)
Hope you don't see me blush, but I can't help but want you more, more
Baby, tell me what's your story?
I ain't shy and don't you worry
I'm flirting with my eyes, wanna leave with you tonight
Do you come here much?
I gotta see your face some more
Some more, 'cause baby...

[Chorus: Timbaland & Katy Perry]
I'll never be the same - if we ever meet again
Won't let you get away - say if we ever meet again
This free fall (Ahh) got me so (Ohh)
Kiss me all night, don't ever let me go
I'll never be the same - if we ever meet again

[Bridge: Katy Perry & (Timbaland)]
If we ever meet again, I'll have so much more to say
(If we ever meet again)
If we ever meet again, I won't let you go away
(If we ever meet again)
If we ever, ever meet again, I'll have so much more to say
(If we ever meet again)
If we ever, ever meet again, I won't let you go away
Away-ay-ay-ay

[Chorus: Timbaland & Katy Perry]
I'll never be the same - if we ever meet again
Won't let you get away - say if we ever meet again
This free fall (Ahh) got me so (Ohh)
Kiss me all night, don't ever let me go

This free fall (Ahh) got me so (Ohh)
Kiss me all night, don't ever let me go
I'll never be the same - if we ever meet again

[Outro: Sebastian]
Just when the night can't get no less
Porn star startin', what is this?
Vixens fightin' for their stress
I put in like Mr. West, yes
You gon' finish dear
And your body's so superb
Me and you the best in here
But yo' girl, face and ear
Face and ear, face and ear
Face and ear, face and ear

[Intro: Timbaland]
Gotta meet somewhere, baby, hey, hey

[Verse 1: Timbaland]
We fuss, we fight, yo' fault, my fault
We was on the same team, at least that's what I thought
We both participated only I got caught
Now we hardly conversate and baby we don't talk
It was fun at first, you can't say I'm wrong
Now you wanna talk about it? Too late, I'm gone
You mad at me 'cause I don't wanna play yo' games
I ain't perfect, but I'mma do my thing (we gotta meet in the middle)
Huh, you here I'm dere
Tell me what's the sense of me tryin' if you don't care?
This relationship is headed to who knows where
That means one of us got to chose


Because you hurt me, and I hurt you
You complain about the things that I don't do
And I don't wanna take the blame, neither do you
Because we got too much to lose

[Chorus: Timbaland]
We gotta meet in the middle, meet in the middle
We gotta gotta meet in the middle
We gotta compromise, baby, don't analyze
We need to see eye to eye, so let's meet in the middle
We gotta meet in the middle
We gotta gotta meet in the middle
We gotta compromise, we gotta work it out this time
We need to see eye to eye, so let's meet in the middle

[Verse 2: Timbaland]
Hey, hey, we got somethin' we can't enjoy
I'm sick of you tryin to play with me like I'm your toy
Mmm - you tried to run game, I saw
We got a lot of issues you got yours (We gotta meet in the middle)
Huh, you can't talk that shit
You can't travel to the future if you walk backwards
Once you walk out the door, you can't walk back in
We gotta find a way to solve it, think about our kids
'Cause they in the middle - you wanna sing that song?
You won't need to cop a plea to say okay, I'm wrong
Thangs are gettin heavy, but I still stay strong
I try to talk it over wit'chu when I coulda been gone

[Pre-Chorus: Timbaland]
Because you hurt me, and I hurt you
You complain about the things that I don't do
And I don't wanna take the blame, neither do you
Because we got too much to lose

[Chorus: Timbaland]
We gotta meet in the middle, meet in the middle
We gotta gotta meet in the middle
We gotta compromise, baby, don't analyze
We need to see eye to eye, so let's meet in the middle
We gotta meet in the middle
We gotta gotta meet in the middle
We gotta compromise, we gotta work it out this time
We need to see eye to eye, so let's meet in the middle

[Verse 3: Brandy]
I told you once, I told you twice
And now my shoulder's cold, like a block of ice
You playin' games like you rollin dice
Hey what you know about a sacrifice? (Baby, I've been in the middle)
I've been givin' you more than a little
Had the ball then you double dribbled (I guess love is a riddle)
You never listen, I don't ever get my point across
I washed your dirty drawers, you out with dirty broads
You did me dirty dog, 'cause youse a dirty dog
It's a curtain call, and I ain't mad at all
I gave you more than you deserve, I was worth it all
Bottom line hope you find what you searchin' for
You hurt me so I hurt you
And I complain about the things that you don't do
And I don't wanna take the blame, neither do you
We got too much to lose

[Chorus: Timbaland]
We gotta meet in the middle, meet in the middle
We gotta gotta meet in the middle
We gotta compromise, baby don't analyze
We need to see eye to eye, so let's meet in the middle
We gotta meet in the middle
We gotta gotta meet in the middle
We gotta compromise, we gotta work it out this time
We need to see eye to eye, so let's meet in the middle

[Outro: Brandy]
Meet in the middle
We gotta gotta meet in the middle
And compromise, analyze
Eye to eye, meet in the middle
Meet in the middle
We gotta gotta meet in the middle
And compromise, gotta work it out this time
Gotta see eye to eye, meet in the middle

[Chorus: JoJo & Timbaland]
Talkin' 'bout my baby; 'cause we always breakin' the mold

Get up under your skin, I know it ain't right
How I ask you, to give up everything
Boy, just stop what you're doin' and come and follow me
Around - baby, thank you for the second chances
And everything you did to help advance this

[Verse 3: Earl Hayes]
You know my girl get the keys with the M's on it
She have the Range night, then a Benz mornin'
Bought plenty of ice for them shinin' on your friends moments
I'll give her anything she want if it look good on her
And we be chillin' like a bottle sittin' on the rocks
Shoppin' bags full of Cartier forget-me-nots
But money can't buy you love, baby that's a fact
But you can rent some love, with a couple stacks
Man I ain't gotta lease nothin I own one
And every time I hit she say it's a home run
When asked how can we be serious at so young?
I just say I'm in it for the long run

[Chorus: JoJo & Timbaland]
Talkin' 'bout my baby; cause we always breakin the mold
Talkin' 'bout my baby; we don't need no secret code
The way you love me down got me goin' around
I think, I think, I think I'm losin' control
The way you love me down got me goin' around
I think, I think, I think I'm losin' control
The way you love me, yeah, yeah
The way you love me, yeah, yeah
The way you love me, yeah, yeah
I think, I think, I think I'm losin' control

All I wanna do is, all I wanna do is, make up
All I wanna do is, make up
All I wanna do is, make up
All I wanna do is, make, make up
All I wanna do is, make up
All I wanna do is, make, make up
Put the, put the past behind us

All I wanna do is, make up
All I wanna do is, make, make up
All I wanna do is, make up

[Verse 1: Sebastian]
Broken promises, broken wedding vows
If God is lookin' down, hoping that he crack a smile (Crack a smile)
How can I support a child?
Last time I had a job, it's been awhile
The question that remains so freely
Why does that have happen to me? (To me)
To wash away the pain I'm drinkin'
I'm thinkin'

[Chorus: Chad Kroeger]
I'm waitin' for the day that
Together we can find another way back
With everything we've got at stake
Let's worry about today and put tomorrow in a bottle
If there's some way that we can take back
The wrong that we've created, we can change that
Don't turn your head the other way
You're born to save today, put tomorrow in a bottle

[Post-Chorus: Chad Kroeger & Timbaland]
Let's put tomorrow in a bottle
Let's put tomorrow in a bottle
Let's put tomorrow in a bottle
Let's put tomorrow in a bottle
(Pack it up, seal it up, close the deal)
Let's put tomorrow in a bottle
Let's put tomorrow in a bottle
Let's put tomorrow in a bottle
Let's put tomorrow in a bottle
(Pack it up, seal it up, close the deal, the deal)

[Verse 2: Timbaland]
Girl, you ain't right, I apologize
Won't be satisfied 'til what we had was gone away
Hey, hey, every other day we fuss and fight
Hey, hey, and I tell you two wrongs don't make a right
You had my head gone, I did you dead wrong
Singin' that same old song, wondering why you mad at me? (Me)
Now you understand my lingo, we still gon' be people
Baby, this is how it should be (Ay)
Are you gonna be like that?
You was supposed to have my back (Back back back back)
Now we both don't know how to act
Once I leave out the door, nothin' will bring me back

[Chorus: Chad Kroeger]
I'm waitin' for the day that
Together we can find another way back
With everything we've got at stake
Let's worry about today and put tomorrow in a bottle
If there's some way that we can take back
The wrong that we've created, we can change that
Don't turn your head the other way
You're born to save today, put tomorrow in a bottle

[Post-Chorus: Chad Kroeger & Timbaland]
Let's put tomorrow in a bottle
Let's put tomorrow in a bottle
Let's put tomorrow in a bottle
Let's put tomorrow in a bottle
(Pack it up, seal it up, close the deal)
Let's put tomorrow in a bottle
Let's put tomorrow in a bottle
Let's put tomorrow in a bottle
Let's put tomorrow in a bottle
(Pack it up, seal it up, close the deal, the deal)

[Bridge: Timbaland]
Said I never thought that all that the love we had would go away
Now there's nothin' left that you can say, say-ayyy
That's the day shit gon' be the same
Because I'm backed against the wall
Now the conclusion to the story is the same

[Verse 3: Sebastian]
I was your bread and butter, like girl, I put you on
Now that I want that lovin' back, why's the relationship so gone?
Like we established the fact, that you was wrong from the get
How am I 'sposed to fly in my ex, from Tallahasee and back
When a girl is scared of heights, Sanchez on top you seen them Jets
Why fuck her in the back when the first class got the latest snacks?
People can blame my past, people can kiss my ass
I'm at a loss for words, Chad gonna sing the rest

[Chorus: Chad Kroeger]
I'm waitin' for the day that
Together we can find another way back
With everything we've got at stake
Let's worry about today and put tomorrow in a bottle
If there's some way that we can take back
The wrong that we've created, we can change that
Don't turn your head the other way
You're born to save today, put tomorrow in a bottle

[Post-Chorus: Chad Kroeger & Timbaland]
Let's put tomorrow in a bottle
Let's put tomorrow in a bottle
Let's put tomorrow in a bottle
Let's put tomorrow in a bottle
(Pack it up, seal it up, close the deal)
Let's put tomorrow in a bottle
Let's put tomorrow in a bottle
Let's put tomorrow in a bottle
Let's put tomorrow in a bottle
(Pack it up, seal it up, close the deal, the deal)

[Intro: Nelly Furtado]
Go Timbo!

[Verse 1: Timbaland]
I'll be the same when it all goes up
I'll be the same when it all goes down
Not the first one, open it up
I'll be the last one closin' it out
Don't know if I'll give you a shot yet
Lil' momma, I'm peepin your style
Do I think you're dope enough? Yup!
One way of findin' it out
The way you came at me, boo
Don't care, not afraid I'm like wild
Really want it all head to toe
Question - is she gon' let it out?
Anyway the hour glass go
I don't worry anyhow
Why don't we see where it go?
Let's figure it out
(Break it down)

[Chorus: Timbaland & (Nelly Furtado)]
When the cats come out, the bats come out to play, yeah
(In the morning after)
The dawn is here, be gone, be on your way, yeah
(In the morning after)
When the cats come out, the bats come out to play, yeah
(In the morning after)
The dawn is here, be gone, be on your way, yeah
(In the morning after dark)

[Verse 2: SoShy]
I got a little secret for ya
I never sleep when it comes the night
But every time I snap my fingers
I switch back into the light
My moon belongs to your sun
Your fire is burning my mind
Is it love or is it lust?
Something that I just can't describe (Ah)
Am I the one and only? (Ah)
Cause you're the only one (Ah)
It felt so long and lonely (Ah)
Waiting for you to come
It's looking bright and early
I'm willing to close my eyes
This is the unusual story
Timbo and SoShy

[Chorus: Timbaland & (Nelly Furtado)]
When the cats come out, the bats come out to play, yeah
(In the morning after)
The dawn is here, be gone, be on your way, yeah
(In the morning after)
When the cats come out, the bats come out to play, yeah
(In the morning after)
The dawn is here, be gone, be on your way, yeah
(In the morning after dark)

[Verse 3: Nelly Furtado]
I need some R.E.M., but
I don't like sleepin' alone
So come and pick me up as
Soon as you put down the phone
I wanna get into trouble
Later you'll carry me home
I wanna go undercover
I just wanna rattle your bones
Yes, I'm the one and only
But I'm not the only one
So let's work overtime
On this shift, stay up with the sun
Maybe we can start a riot
Maybe we can burn this town
Maybe I’ll be your vampire
We can figure it out!

[Chorus: Timbaland & (Nelly Furtado)]
When the cats come out, the bats come out to play, yeah
(In the morning after)
The dawn is here, be gone, be on your way, yeah
(In the morning after)
When the cats come out, the bats come out to play, yeah
(In the morning after)
The dawn is here, be gone, be on your way, yeah
(In the morning after dark)

[Outro: Timbaland & (Nelly Furtado)]
Dark dark dark dark dark
(In the morning after dark)
Dark dark dark dark dark
(In the morning after dark)
Please don't leave me, girl
(In the morning after dark)
Please don't leave me, girl
(In the morning after dark)
When the cats come out the bats come out to play
When the cats come out the bats come out to play
The dawn is here, be gone, be on your way
When the cats come out the bats come out to play
The dawn is here, be gone, be on your way

[Intro: Timbaland]
Go Timothy! (Go Timothy!)

[Verse 1: Timbaland]
Hey! I was mean... before I became a fiend
I took over the world when they gave me a beat machine
And then I made my city jump (Jump)
It's your favorite producer, come on, baby, let it bump (Bump)
I'm like a music cyclone when I'm in the zone
A typhoon every time I get on a song
A tycoon, I just went and bought another home, who you stuntin' on?
I'm never off, I set it off, and you was never on
What's there to care about? People know my whereabouts
Anywhere I want, private jet, in and out
Whip brand new, you know what Tim about
Ferrari 5-99, windows tinted out
I-I-I'm the man, m-my beats is crazy
You want my sounds? Frikki you gotta pay me
But don't get it confused, never had no silver spoon
But you got a long walk, tryin' to fit Timbaland's shoes

[Chorus 1: Timbaland & D.O.E.]
And next up I believe that's me
And what's your name D.O.E. on the M-I-C
And where you from N-Y-C, we up in here G
Why don'tcha, get on the mic for the Symphony?

[Verse 2: D.O.E.]
Okay, okay
When you see me roll through (yup) got the whole crew
Timbaland he produce, if you a fruit, produce
Ridin' in the old school (pimpin') like I'm 'posed to
She french kiss my dick and then I told her "Merci beaucoup"
(Put it in the bag) Nah baby I ain't Fab
When I fucked you it's a wrap, I'mma put you in the cab
Better be happy I rap, if I wasn't I'd be strapped with the mags
And I'm... and I'm coming for your stash
When I find out where you at, I'll be (Shimmyin' your lock)
Get the fuck up out yo bed, you betta (Gimme what you got)
Want yo' blunt money, strip money
Dick money, blow money
Lyin' like there's no money? (Uhh) Gotta go money
Pockets feelin' drained, then it's back to snatchin' chains
And I wish a nigga run up on me, he gon' find that he done made
The wrong move - I ain't changed, still the same
D.O.E. be the name, I'm from Northside Queens

[Chorus 2: D.O.E. & Brandy]
Next up Ha! Hey I believe that's me
And what's yo' name? Bran'Nu a.k.a Brandy
And where you from? Mississippi but was raised in Cali
Why don'tcha, get on the mic for the Symphony?

[Verse 3: Brandy]
I got it, I got it - ha! It's been a long time comin'
I'm back like I forgot something important
Can't have a problem with me, I fade it to black
Like church slacks now I'm in the Range, no Cadillac
So you don't want it with me
I'm on the tip of your tongue like bubblegum, I got yo' head strung
It's my return like the "Kingdom Come," I'm takin off like a rocket
I got this beat in my pocket, I keep your heart droppin'
And you.. ha, never gonna hold me back
Timbo put me on the map, now you wanna say I act
Bran'Nu.. ha! Just like my Prada boots
Struttin like a model do, don't you wish you had another
Chance to.. ha! Get up under my skin
Frontin' like you get it in and you keep runnin' your mouth like them brats do
I gotta learn you like a school do
Cause clearly you don't have a clue

[Chorus 3: Brandy & Attitude]
So next up Yeah, hey, I believe that's me
And what's yo' name? Attitude on the M-I-C
And where you from Alabama, we up in here G
Why don'tcha, get on the mic for the Symphony?

[Verse 4: Attitude]
Okay, niggas pokin' joke shit, I'm never mediocre
Plenty bread so you know I gotta keep a toaster
On my side bitch ride unless she a Oprah
Bitch, I'm too fly to drive, I'mma need a chauffeur
I get a whole lot of hoes like a G supposed ta
They could put me in the fed for what's in my sofa
Rap niggas wack, smack 'em if they say your part
Diss me I'll up the ratchet on you and your A&R
I know they mad, never thought that it could happen
Got my shit on, then I hopped in a Aston
Every check I cash in, bigger than the last one
Met a new freak, she thicker than the last one
Nah, I don't love her homey, music is my passion
I don't show compassion and all I'll be fucking
Bitch be yellin' I'm the shit even when nobody's askin'
Boy I'm on fire like the shit in the ass man
That's why I stay so gone player
Like how we are fucking up the ozone layer
I drop a hit every time I got some shit to say
And If I miss I come back like a ricochet

[Intro: D.O.E.]
Girl, gimme that, mmm, ahh, c'mon, girl, get down

[Post-Chorus: Timbaland Skatting]

[Verse 1: Timbaland]
I don't wanna talk now, I don't wanna hear you scream no mo'
Won't somebody save me? Everything I do feel like it's wrong
All we do is fall down even though we try to stay afloat
I swear it's gon' kill me even though you think it won't
So why rock the boat and make waves?
When everything's calm and okay
So why am I confused if you love me?
I thought this would be smooth sailing

[Chorus: The Fray (Joe King)]
'Cause I don't wanna let you go
But we're caught in the undertow
'Cause I am losing my control
But we're caught in the undertow
Our only prayer is all our own
But we need air, we go alone
'Cause I don't wanna let you go
But we're caught in the undertow

[Verse 2: Esthero]
I don't want to cry, every time we try, it never fails
We change the illusion, whenever you go and set the sail
My heart's in your hand, don't you go hurt me again
All we got is one chance and it's sink or swim
So why rock a boat and make waves? (Make waves!)
When everything's calm and okay? (I'm okay!)
Why am I confused if you love me? (Love me!)
I thought this would be smooth sailing

[Chorus: The Fray (Joe King) & Esthero]
'Cause I don't wanna let you go
And we're caught in the undertow
'Cause I am losing my control
But we're caught in the undertow
Our only prayer is all our own
But we need air, we go alone
'Cause I don't wanna let you go
But we're caught in the undertow

[Bridge: Timbaland & Esthero]
And the water's rising
And the water's rising
And the water's rising
And the water's rising

[Pre-Chorus: The Fray (Joe King) & Esthero]
'Cause I don't wanna let you go
But we're caught in the undertow
'Cause I am losing my control
But we're caught in the undertow

[Chorus: The Fray (Joe King) & Esthero]
'Cause I don't wanna let you go
But we're caught in the undertow
And I'm losing my control
But we're caught in the undertow
Our only prayer is all our own
We need air, we go alone
Our only prayer is all our own
We both need air, we go alone
'Cause I don't wanna let you go
'Cause I don't wanna let you go
'Cause we're caught in the under...
Tow, tow, tow
Undertow, tow, tow

[Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
(Hey, hey!) We belong to the music
We don't answer to you

[Intro: Jet]
Timothy.. I took your place (I took your place)
Timothy.. cause such a waste (cause such a waste)
Timothy, we found your spaceship
Timothy, it's the farthest you've ever flown-own-own
-own-own-own-own-owwwwn

[Bridge: Timbaland]
Hey! Put your lighters up
Put your lighters up y'all, y'all, y'all, y'all, y'all
Y'all put your lighters up
This the Timothy song if you don't know about me

[Verse 1: Timbaland]
Yeah, they call me Tim, V-A's phenomenon
I kill 'em all winter, until the summer come
From just another name, all the way to number one
And I'm simply the best when it's all said and done
Remember when me and Magoo was tryna make a mill'?
Well, we did and years later, we got it still
Gave you my bio, "Under Construction 1 and 2"
Hundred percent, Ginuwine, that was from me to you
I'm makin' moves while they ridicule
I'm like a warm summer breeze in the swimmin' pool - I'm cool
I never kept it basic, I been so many places
Been gettin' money since them honies had them small faces
So many little me's, I can hear small traces
But I just ignore it, cause I'm too big for it
And I can hear 'em screamin'

[Chorus: Jet]
Timothy, where have you beeeenn?
It's not what it seems but it isssss
Timothy, where have you beeeeen?
She cried in the kitchen to let you go
Timothy, where have you beeeeen?

[Verse 2: Timbaland]
I been in Athens, Georgia by way of Bubba Sparxxx
When the Nights were Bright and all the Days was Dark
But now they all bright, everything is all right
If you assume my life is wonderful then y'all right
I got a bad wife, three beautiful kids
I make the world dance, yeah look what I done did
Hits for Jay-Z, Nelly Furtado
Catch up, y'all slow, escargot
Nelly did fourteen mill', where's Fargo?
I brought a airplane, fuck I need a car fo'?
Ask Justin Timberlake is Timbaland great?
Y'all gotta deal with me, no handshake
Stand up nigga, rather have a stand off
With the law before I let 'em say I ran off
And I can hear 'em screamin'

[Chorus: Jet]
Timothy, where have you beeeenn?
It's not what it seems but it isssss
Timothy, where have you beeeeen?
She cried in the kitchen to let you go
Timothy, where have you beeeeen?

[Verse 3: Timbaland]
Ay, some say I went away, but really I never left
They wonder where I been, but they can never guess
I been around the world, here to the other side
And I successfully achieved what all those others tried
Carry my city on my back like a crucifix
For more than a decade 'cause I can do this shit
A lot of people want my spot, but I don't hesitate
The track label my legacy won't appreciate
I stand strong, everything I put my hands on
Me and Mr. Iovine, 'cause ain't no I in team
'Cause I can hear 'em sayin'

[Chorus: Jet]
Timothy, where have you beeeenn?
It's not what it seems but it isssss
Timothy, where have you beeeeen?
She cried in the kitchen to let you go
Timothy, where have you beeeeen?

[Outro: JoJo & (Jet)]
Timothy, where have you been?
She cried in the kitchen to let you go
Where have you been?
(Timothy, where have you been?)

Come here girl, come here girl, come here gi-ir-rl

[Verse 1: Timbaland]
Let me see them big titties
Don't be actin' sad-idy you're not pretty
Break bread if you wanna get with me
All I wanna do is dig up in them kidneys
Tell your boyfriend he better mind his business
'Fore he end up in the trunk of my Bentley
I'm considered a boss, you can't get me
You ain't got enough paper to deal with me
Baby girl wanna two step with me
Turn around with her ass up against me
Roll along and got tipsy, hit it tonight, tomorrow you the mystery
All you haters on that ho shit miss me
I stay strapped, security don't frisk me
Fed it off 'til the motherfucker empty
I'll turn around and do the same shit next week, come on

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake & (Timbaland)]
(Bounce) like your ass had the hiccups
(Bounce) like we was ridin' in my pickup
(Bounce) why you lookin' so sad, baby girl? You need to cheer up
(Bounce) I got the remedy, it's you on me and me on you
It's you on me and me on you and you on her
And her on me, and her on you, and y'all on me
And me on y'all and y'all on me
Ménage à trois, ménage à trois, ahh, uhh

[Verse 2: Dr. Dre]
There she go, just what the doc's been lookin' for
She just what I need, lookin' Chinese like Sum Yung Ho
I got a bungalow, we can disappear for a week or so
Yeah, I gotta stadium flow, Superbowl with it like I'm Dungy, yo
Oh, yes, congratulations, you run a millionaire invitation
Sorry I'm so demanding
You can save the dancing for back at the mansion
And this money handsome, ain't that a panty anthem?
I kill me, just like you from the back, you'll see

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake & (Timbaland)]
(Bounce) like your ass had the hiccups
(Bounce) like we was ridin' in my pickup
(Bounce) why you lookin' so sad, baby girl? You need to cheer up

And her on me, and her on you, and y'all on me
And me on y'all and y'all on me
Ménage à trois, ménage à trois, ahh, uhh

[Verse 3: Missy Elliott]
Hold up, hell naw, like Britney Spears, I wear no drawls
In the club I drink it up, goomp goomp, drink it up
Got Patron sippin' in my cup, hey, where's your man?
I bet that I could make him love me, oooh
When he see the jugs he will wanna rush to get a quick touch
Of this big ole butt, mmhmm, big ole butt
Thick legs, big ole jugs, legs stick like rims on the truck
Take 'em to the crib, yeah, we gon' fuck
You could call me a freak, I like to get BUCK, BUCK
And I don't have to do much to make him get it up
Sum Yung Ho, she worth two dollars
I'm worth more dollars than make up beauty parlors
I pop collars, ca-ca-ca-ca-collars
I don't buy shots, I only buy the bottles
Only rich girls, we only buy the bottles
But like a porn star, I'm best when I swallow

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake & (Timbaland)]
(Bounce) like your ass had the hiccups
(Bounce) like we was ridin' in my pickup
(Bounce) why you lookin' so sad, baby girl? You need to cheer up
(Bounce) I got the remedy, it's you on me and me on you
It's you on me and me on you and you on her
And her on me, and her on you, and y'all on me
And me on y'all and y'all on me
Ménage à trois, ménage à trois, ahh, uhh

[Intro: Money]
Let me show you, boy
Aha, are you ready?
Fantasy (oh) it could be (so) good and we
(I was just thinkin' ... about you ... and me)
Wildest thing (you have) ever dreamed (boy)
(So what will it be?)

[Verse 1: Money]
Just lookin' at you shorty lights a flame inside (side, side)
I'm wondering if you can come and help put out the fire (fire, fire)
That you create in me, baby, tell me what you like
'Cause I can be your all boy, I can be your love toy
If you ain't busy, baby, I'm all yours tonight (night)
Let imagination take us further than the mind
Travel in a dream (dream) we can bring something to life (alive)
That no one's ever seen yet, can I

[Chorus: Money]
Show you what it's like beyond your fantasy? (oh) it could be (so)
Good and we... might just get it hotter than the
Wildest thing (you have) ever dreamed (boy) let me

Good and we... might just get it hotter than the
Wildest thing (you have) ever dreamed (boy)

[Verse 2: Money]
Just think of all the tasty things that we can try (try, try)
The come up you can have will be more than money can buy (buy) (hu-hu-hu-ho)
We ain't even gotta keep it quiet (quiet, quiet)
Boy, all my walls are soundproof, I can scream your name through
My entire house, we will not disturb
None of these ol' neighbors, you'll get all that you deserve (you deserve)
Boy, I got this on deck if you can conjure up the nerve (the nerve)
To come see what if feels like, can I

[Chorus: Money]
Show you what it's like beyond your fantasy? (oh) it could be (so)
Good and we... might just get it hotter than the

Good and we... might just get it hotter than the
Wildest thing (you have) ever dreamed (ever dreamed boy)
Touch it

[Verse 3: Money]
Touch it, touch it, feel it, roll around in it if you like
Taste it, taste it, then embrace it again a second time
Don't you waste it, you'll regret it, 'cause I can satisfy
Any fantasy that you can come with, can I

[Bridge]
Let me

[Chorus: Money]
Show you what it's like beyond your fantasy (oh) it could be (so)

[Intro: Timbaland]
Yeah! Yeah! It's Tim-Unit Nigga (HA HA HA)
Yeah! You know I like how I sound on that nigga! Huh!

[Verse 1: Timbaland]
Ugh, nigga, your time is up, I ain't come to kid you
I knew you niggas was dumb, but how dumb is you?
Thinkin' you could see the king when you unofficial
You don't wanna go to war 'cause I launch these missiles
I'm a ride or die nigga, I be tearin' shit up
We ain't like them other fools, so don't compare 'em to us
All the hoes love a nigga, they be backin' it up
But me, I love money, I be stackin' it up
When my bandwagon pull up, they hop on board
They hop right on mine and hop right off yours
I get respect, homie, all across the board
I get a quarter mil' a track without an award
Ever wanna test a nigga? Then come see me
In the street, I hold my ground like I'm concrete
I know shit ain't sweet, so when shit get deep
I'm rich, I can pay to have you six feet deep, nigga

[Chorus: Timbaland]
I give it to whoever want it, if you want it, come see me
You know where I'm at if you want it, if you want it, come get me
I give it to whoever want it, if you want it, come see me
You know where I'm at if you want it, if you want it, come get me

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
Yeah! Nigga, you violate, I regulate, rata-tat-tat
Bigger shells, they fit in that banana clip jack
Run and the bullseye form on your back
Hard to miss with a full clip in the mac
I got ammo, ammo, I load, reload
Cut a nigga quick, yeah, my knife game lethal
That tough guy shit, nigga, that's what I see through
You like a three-course meal, motherfucker, I eat you
You food, and I'm in the mood
So front, I let the hammer fly
Nigga, you could duck, run for cover or die
Your choice, you choose, I pop, you move
Like you ain't shot, you been shot
Nigga, your blood on the street
You up shit's creek, you can hardly speak
You startin' to get weak, your eyes close, your life flash
Your heart's slow, your heart stop, yo' ass dead, you're fucked, kid

[Chorus: Timbaland]
I give it to whoever want it, if you want it, come see me
You know where I'm at if you want it, if you want it, come get me
I give it to whoever want it, if you want it, come see me
You know where I'm at if you want it, if you want it, come get me

[Verse 3: Tony Yayo]
I'm like Nicolas Cage, Yay' is the Ghost Rider
P89, yeah, I like my toast lighter
Costa Rica to Brazil, I got my hoes in the Lear
While your bitch bald-headed like Britney Spears
I'm in the projects, gettin' dope and piff money
Two more flips, that's Anna Nicole Smith money
Fuck a G4, I'm in a G500, G450, G550
That's airplane talk, I'm the aviator man
Baby AR, shoot your baby out your hands
Spaghetti and corn bread mix got me blunted
This ho talkin' 'bout she don't fuck on a empty stomach
Buy out the mall and hug the block
A hundred thou' woodgrain in a Phantom drop
Then I cruise in the club, got my Rug' in the club
Pay the bouncer a buck, now my uz' in the club, yeah, nigga!

[Chorus: Timbaland]
I give it to whoever want it, if you want it, come see me
You know where I'm at if you want it, if you want it, come get me
I give it to whoever want it, if you want it, come see me
You know where I'm at if you want it, if you want it, come get me

[Intro: Timbaland]
Clap your hands everybody, if you got, what it takes
I'm Timbo and I want you to know that these, are, da breaks!
(Uh-huh, uh-huh) Hey, get your back up off the wall
(Uh-huh, uh-huh) Hey, get your back up off the wall
(Uh-huh, uh-huh) Hey, get your back up off the wall
(Uh-huh, uh-huh) Huh, let me tell you

[Verse 1: Timbaland]
You got me feenin' for your body parts
You said you're lonely and you need it bad
Come and see me when you wanna start
And where we're going, you don't have to ask

[Chorus: Timbaland]
Come to my cipher, put that blunt in the air
Let me seduce you, let me play in your hair
I see that you're hyper, let's take it upstairs
Hey girl, let's have a meeting, meeting

[Verse 2: Timbaland]
I know a quiet place where we can talk
Girl, relax and let me do my thang
Baby, I don't wanna break yo' heart
I just wanna make you say my name

[Chorus: Timbaland]
Come to my cipher, put that blunt in the air
Let me seduce you, let me play in your hair
I see that you're hyper, let's take it upstairs
Hey girl, let's have a meeting, meeting

[Verse 3: Magoo]
I'mma check, make her heart break her man fo' sho'
In the back in my mind, girl, you in for dough
Even though you a stunt, I'm a fan of chess
Role-play, you the best, you supply the sess
Yes, I'm a fiend of your hole
One hit of you and I lose control
I look through your eyes, I'mma see your soul
Bank roll and a hole through the cars and go

[Chorus: Timbaland]
Come to my cipher, put that blunt in the air
Let me seduce you, let me play in your hair
I see that you're hyper, let's take it upstairs
Hey girl, let's have a meeting, meeting

[Outro: Timbaland]
(Uh-huh, uh-huh)
Get your back up off the wall (Uh-huh, uh-huh)
Hey, get your back up off the wall (Uh-huh, uh-huh)
Get your back up off the wall (Uh-huh, uh-huh)
Meeting's adjourned
(Heh, the meeting just begun, watch this)

[Intro: Timbaland]
Is it goin'? Is it goin'?
Is it goin'? Is it going?
I don't know what you're lookin' for
Oh, yeah, boy, come on

[Verse 1: Nelly Furtado]
I'm the type of girl that look you dead in the eye, eye
I'm real as it comes, if you don't know why I'm fly-y-y-y-y
I seen you to try switch it up, but girl, you ain't that dope
I'm the Wonder Woman, let me go get my rope
I'm a supermodel and mommy — sí, mami
Amnesty International, got Bangkok to Montauk on lock
Love my ass and my abs in the video called "Promiscuous"
My style is ri-dic-dic-diculous-ulous-ulous

[Chorus: Nelly Furtado]
If you see us in the club, we'll be actin' real nice
If you see us on the floor, you'll be watchin' all night
We ain't here to hurt nobody (So give it to me, give it to me, give it to me)
Wanna see you work your body (So give it to me, give it to me, give it to me)

[Verse 2: Timbaland]
When Timbo' is in the party, everybody put up they hands
I get a half a mil' for my beats, you get a couple gra-a-and
Never gon' see the day that I ain't got the upper hand
I'm respected from Californ-I-A way down to Japan
I'm a real producer, and you just a piano man
Your songs don't top the charts — I heard 'em, I'm not a fa-a-an
Niggas talkin' greasy, I'm the one that gave them they chance
Somebody need to tell 'em that they can't do it like I can

[Chorus: Nelly Furtado]
If you see us in the club, we'll be actin' real nice
If you see us on the floor, you'll be watchin' all night
We ain't here to hurt nobody (So give it to me, give it to me, give it to me)
Wanna see you work your body (So give it to me, give it to me, give it to me)

[Verse 3: Justin Timberlake]
Could you speak up and stop mu-mumbling? I don't think you came in clear
When you're sittin' on the top, it's hard to hear you from way up here
Now I saw you tryna act cute on TV, "Just let me clear the air..."
We missed you on the charts last week — damn, that's right, you wasn't there
If s-sexy never left, then why is everybody on my shi-i-it?
Don't hate on me just because you didn't come up with it
So if you see us in the club, go on and walk the other way
'Cause our run will never be over — not, at least, until we say (Uh)

[Chorus: Nelly Furtado]
If you see us in the club, we'll be actin' real nice
If you see us on the floor, you'll be watchin' all night
We ain't here to hurt nobody (So give it to me, give it to me, give it to me)
Wanna see you work your body (So give it to me, give it to me, give it to me)

[Break: Nelly Furtado & (Justin Timberlake)]
Oh... (Damn, improve)
Oh... (Damn, improve)
Oh... (Damn, improve)
Oh... (Damn, improve)
Oh... (Damn, improve)
Oh... (Damn, improve)
Oh... (Damn, improve)
Oh... (Damn, improve)

[Chorus: Nelly Furtado]
If you see us in the club, we'll be actin' real nice
If you see us on the floor, you'll be watchin' all night
We ain't here to hurt nobody (So give it to me, give it to me, give it to me)
Wanna see you work your body (So give it to me, give it to me, give it to me)
If you see us in the club, we'll be actin' real nice
If you see us on the floor, you'll be watchin' all night
We ain't here to hurt nobody (So give it to me, give it to me, give it to me)
Wanna see you work your body (So give it to me, give it to me, give it to me)

[Verse 1: Timbaland]
Uh
I'm head over heels for someone high
That I really can't deal with (Deal with)
I want to block her out my mind
But I really can't do it (Do it)
I tell myself this the last time
I'mma let her do this to me
Whenever we do spend time
I realize that I can't get enough of you

[Interlude: Patrick Stump from Fall Out Boy & Timbaland]
Wipe that sm-ile off your fuckin' face (And I say to you)
Wipe that sm-ile off your face (Then I say to you)
Wipe that sm-ile off your fuckin' face (And I say to you)
Wipe that sm-ile off your face

[Chorus: Patrick Stump]
To be despised, to be loved
To be dreamt of, to be sought
I'm the inside of I don't care
Right in the middle, I'm right in the middle
To be despised, to be loved
To be dreamt of, to be sought
I'm the inside of I don't care
Be my unholy, my one and my lonely

[Verse 2: Patrick Stump]
I wear scarves and hoods
'Cause they're the only poker face that I've got left
And everything I love about you is a mess
Smash the mirror and break the palm reader's hand
I want to be better than I am

[Interlude: Patrick Stump from Fall Out Boy & Timbaland]
Wipe that sm-ile off your fuckin' face (And I say to you)
Wipe that sm-ile off your face (Then I say to you)
Wipe that sm-ile off your fuckin' face (And I say to you)
Wipe that sm-ile off your face

[Chorus: Patrick Stump]
To be despised, to be loved
To be dreamt of, to be sought
I'm the inside of I don't care
Right in the middle, I'm right in the middle
To be despised, to be loved
To be dreamt of, to be sought
I'm the inside of I don't care
Be my unholy, my one and my lonely

[Verse 3: Timbaland]
AOWWWWWW!
Girl, just look what you've done
How could you do this to me?
I gotta put my foot down
I can't let you do this to me
I can't forget those good ol' times
And all the things you've been doin' to me
I wanna hit that one mo' time
I'm in love, what'chu doin to me
I'mma say it loud
Why can't us fuck in this crowd?
Why we arguin'?
I thought me and you were 'posed to be friends
Let's chill for minute (For a minute)
Better yet we need to heal for a minute (For a minute)
Baby, put down the knife
Sometimes I wanna save ya life
But I'm in...

[Chorus: Patrick Stump]
To be despised, to be loved
To be dreamt of, to be sought
I'm the inside of I don't care
Right in the middle, I'm right in the middle
To be despised, to be loved
To be dreamt of, to be sought
I'm the inside of I don't care
Be my unholy, my one and my lonely

[Outro: Timbaland]
We don't got no fuckin' band!
We ain't got no speakers, no fuckin' microphones set up!
Timberland, you tunin' son of a bitch
Get the fuck outta my house now
'Fore I get too mad and I can't turn back
HEY!! Didn't I say get the fuck out!
Get the fuck out! Ha ha ha ha ha...

[Distorted Intro]
Get out, you can't be in here, you have to get out
I implore you, please?.. Please?..
You are all going to die down here...

[Verse 1: Timbaland]
It's life or death, either one
The king is back, take head and run
I piss and take a shit on your beats for fun
I killed the Game, I ain't even use a gun
Who better than me? Don't make me laugh
I run this shit, they just chase my ass
I ain't talkin' shit nigga just tellin' the facts
I think all the tracks I'm hearin' from niggas is whack
I be hearin' this niggas, what they say in their rhymes
I took my spot, nobody gave me mine
I make the beats, that "Boom Boom Boom" in they trunks
You disagree homie then go on and jump
You can bump your gums, you can say what you want
That's all you gon' do, 'cause you niggas is punk
I'm number one, you ain't nuttin' but shit
When they need a hit, I'm who they come to get
Talk to me

[Pre-Chorus: Timbaland]
If you got love for me, I got love for you
If you won't fuck with me, I won't fuck with you
We can do it however you wanna do
Nigga, if you won't fuck with me, I won't fuck with you
Go 'head

[Chorus: Timbaland & (Attitude)]
Kill yourself, kill yourself, kill yourself
Go kill yourself, kill yourself, kill yourself
(If I was you, I wouldn't feel myself)
Go kill yourself, kill yourself, kill yourself
Go kill yourself, kill yourself, kill yourself
(If I was you, I wouldn't feel myself)

[Verse 2: Attitude]
Yo
Hey
I'm tired of niggas, niggas is tired
You ain't a G, I see bitch in your eyes
If you're close to me, you're supposed to be
But most you rap niggas is hoes to me
Wherever you from, the question i ask
Is do you think I give a fuck, riddle me that
'Cause in my hood you done been to hell and back
This sinister shit, to hell with that
I seen them come, I seen them go
I doubt if you can show me something I ain't seen before
Who's supposed to be in charge, I need to know
When I shake your hand, I'mma step on your toe
Go get your gun, go get your clique
I'mma be right here chillin' with your bitch
You mad at me, cause I'm getting' rich?
Well Put the pistol to your head and empty the clip
Fuck nigga!

[Pre-Chorus: Timbaland]
If you got love for me, I got love for you
If you won't fuck with me, I won't fuck with you
We can do it however you wanna do
Nigga, if you won't fuck with me, I won't fuck with you
Go 'head

[Chorus: Timbaland & (Attitude)]
Kill yourself, kill yourself, kill yourself
Go kill yourself, kill yourself, kill yourself
(If I was you, I wouldn't feel myself)
Go kill yourself, kill yourself, kill yourself
Go kill yourself, kill yourself, kill yourself
(If I was you, I wouldn't feel myself)

[Verse 3: Sebastian]
See my heart, feel my pain
Some is stars, some is lames
How they follow little trends to get they fame?
I ain't snap my damn fingers to get in the game
You claim you rich, show me, son
If you got so many dollars then lone me one
Fools think they're killers they own a gun
When you know you bout as sweet as a honey bun
Trashy broads, behind the bar
Like you tattooed your frontin' heart
VIP bands don't make you a star
Like we really still don't know who the fuck you are
Don't talk behind my back, just call me nigga
Move my heart to the side, make room to forgive ya
If you still wanna hang, we'll come to get ya
Put the rope around your neck, jump my nigga

[Distorted Outro]
You're all going to die down here
Get out, get out, you can't be in here
You're all going to die down here

[Intro]
Bounce, bounce, bounce

[Verse 1]
I ain't got no feeling, I'mma let these niggas know
I've been killin 'em with these beats
Now I'm spittin' them killer flow
What you know about me, dog? Not a damn thing
Got a problem, nigga? Shoot me in the streets, dog
I'm a one-man game
Don't take this lightly, if I want you dead, you gone
I can make that happen because, nigga, my bread is long
I done been on both sides of the track
You can say I changed the game
A lot of niggas try to get in my lane
Everybody askin' me the same whole thing, what he say?

[Hook]
Oh Timbaland, where he gon' run to? (Nowhere)
Oh Timbaland, where he gon' run to? (Nowhere)
Oh Timbaland, where he gon' run to? (Nowhere)

Oh Timbaland, where he gon' run to?

[Verse 2]
I ain't goin' nowhere, dog, I'mma be right here in your face
Can't do it like me, dog, your kick drum ain't got enough bass
Don't ever talk bad about me, you just might make me mad
And I just might see you somewhere and break your ass in half
This not a Timbaland that you used to
Now I'm in a whole 'nother zone
You could let me do me, you could do you
Or get popped in your dome
Hit love for the birds to the block, so recognize the game
Timbaland ain't gotta run nowhere, baby
Timbaland got private planes

[Hook]
Oh Timbaland, where he gon' run to? (Nowhere)
Oh Timbaland, where he gon' run to? (Nowhere)
Oh Timbaland, where he gon' run to? (Nowhere)

Oh Timbaland, where he gon' run to? (Nowhere)
Oh Timbaland, where he gon' run to? (Nowhere)
Oh Timbaland, where he gon' run to? (Nowhere)

[Bridge]
I've been around, some time long ago
I've seen the light, don't act like you ain't seen it before

[Verse 3]
I'm listenin' dog, you ain't sayin' shit
You can keep on wishin', you never make a hit
Yeah, I got money, take it all from me, I'm gon' be the same
You can get a few whips, you can get a few chips
You still gon' be a lame
We ain't the same, my nigga, I'm on some other shit
I'mma say this plain and simple, nigga, take this punishment
I'mma take ya'll on a trip, I'mma take ya'll on a ride
And one day I'm gon' dip, but I won't be hard to find

[Hook]
Oh Timbaland, where he gon' run to? (Nowhere)
Oh Timbaland, where he gon' run to? (Nowhere)
Oh Timbaland, where he gon' run to? (Nowhere)

[Intro: The Hives]
The time has come
Flyweight champion of the world!
(Flyweight champion of the world)
The time has come (hey girl)
The Hives

[Verse 1: Timbaland]
Take it to the back of the club
Fast talkin', don't take this the wrong way
I've been peepin' that ass
And if you give me my chance, I ain't gon' play
I really wanna get to know ya
That's what I told ya girl, you know I don't play (Ow!)
I wanna put it in your--whoa girl
You better do what the song say

[Chorus: The Hives & (Timbaland)]
Uh, just throw it on me, uh, just throw it on me
Uh, just throw it on me
(Wiggle that ass before you throw it on me)
Uh, just throw it on me, uh, just throw it on me
Uh, just throw it on me
(Wiggle that ass before you throw it on me)

[Verse 2: Timbaland]
I got so many broads
White cars I can jump in two or three in the same day (Woo-oo)
And when I park my car
Soon as I walk in the spot women say "Ow!" They...
Showin' me titties
And they callin' my name and all night, God damn babe (Shut up!)
Niggas is hatin' me
'Cause they girl wanna throw that thang on me like it's okay, girl!

[Chorus: The Hives & (Timbaland)]
Uh, just throw it on me, uh, just throw it on me
Uh, just throw it on me
(Wiggle that ass before you throw it on me)
Uh, just throw it on me, uh, just throw it on me
Uh, just throw it on me
(Wiggle that ass before you throw it on me)

[Verse 3: Timbaland]
From the look of at that ass
You probably a "Gold Digger" but I ain't Kanye
Baby girl, you're on the right track
But you're goin' the wrong way
And when we leave out the party
Baby girl I got the game that we gon' play
And when ya wake up tomorrow
I'll be on the highway (Peace)
Hey!

[Chorus: The Hives & (Timbaland)]
Uh, just throw it on me, uh, just throw it on me
Uh, just throw it on me
(Wiggle that ass before you throw it on me)
Uh, just throw it on me, uh, just throw it on me
Uh, just throw it on me
(Wiggle that ass before you throw it on me)

[Outro: Timbaland]
Right...
... before you throw it on me
Right - The Hives
(Just throw it on me)
The Hives - Just throw it on me!
Just throw it on me, just throw it on me
(Uh-uh)
Throw it on me, ooh yeah
Ow!

[Verse 1: Timbaland]
Hmm, I got a feelin' she keeps me in the dark
I gotta keep my eye on her, she ain't no walk in the park
I bought her this but she want that, she, she, she want it all
You see she wanted to paint the picture and say she my broad
I got a little tip from the word on the block
People sayin' I shouldn't get involved
But I didn't judge or try to change it 'cause you are who you are
I'm like a drug, she's addicted to me, she can't keep me now
She always makin' plans today, come and find me tomorrow
Goodbye, girl

[Chorus: She Wants Revenge]
She's too invested in the hours that pass her by
I'd pay attention if I thought it was worth the time
I'd tell her easy, but her hands, they find a way
Confusing passion for the love he never gave
Fall back on reasons that we know won't stand a chance
Watching her shoulders like a memory from the past
I'd tell her easy, but her hands, they find a way
Confusing passion for the love he never gave

[Verse 2: Timbaland]
I couldn't get rid of shorty if I wanted 'cause she was down
But I was tired of playin' the role like I ain't know that she get around
Somethin' 'bout this girl fascinates me
She's the type that like to hang with the stars
The way she makes me feel and sedates me
Who knew we would take it this far?
Everywhere that I try to go, she got a "Wanted" poster with my face on it
Soon as I walk out the do', there it is, "Wanted" poster with my face on it
Can't blame myself when it's not, my fault cause nothin' is promised
At least I can say I was honest -- goodbye, girl

[Chorus: She Wants Revenge]
She's too invested in the hours that pass her by
I'd pay attention if I thought it was worth the time
I'd tell her easy, but her hands, they find a way
Confusing passion for the love he never gave
Fall back on reasons that we know won't stand a chance
Watching her shoulders like a memory from the past
I'd tell her easy, but her hands, they find a way
Confusing passion for the love he never gave

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus: She Wants Revenge]
She's too invested in the hours that pass her by
I'd pay attention if I thought it was worth the time
I'd tell her easy, but her hands, they find a way
Confusing passion for the love he never gave
Fall back on reasons that we know won't stand a chance
Watching her shoulders like a memory from the past
I'd tell her easy, but her hands, they find a way
Confusing passion for the love he never gave

The sweet TV with the VCR
And I did it -- I did this for your birthday

[Chorus: w/Black adlibs]
We got a five-star room, the luxury suite
With marble floors, and don't thank me

With a king-size bed, the Cognac bar
The sweet TV with the VCR
And I did it -- I did this for your birthday
(I'm what you want, I'm what you need)

[Bridge: Static]
Let's get on the floor (Let's get on the floor)
Let's get in the chair (In the chair)

So pass the UHH and get the hype
Alright, we gon' party tonight

[Verse 1: Magoo]
If you're livin' for love, start livin' for life
If you're having a baby, then make her your wife
If you're up in the club where the dub
It's like a bank sell to the highest bid
Put the cash in your bank
Girl I'm lovin' your booty, you can "hoo" to my blow
Then fish but please honey child, don't kiss
All I want is a freak when I'm up in the club
Maybe after the dance, dinner sharp, then the tub
I'm a nigga wit' class, you're a girl with a job
Taste of my neck like corn on the cob
I'm second to none, I'm freaky as ever
Go downtown, "Well I never"

[Verse 2: Timbaland]
Uh, uh
Well I'm the man, that they call Timbaland
Now he the bir-ba-bir-ba-bird, understand?
We gon' party, until the sun comes up
Bartender, you forgot to fill up my cup, uh
Ain't no stoppin' until your draws start floppin'
There won't be no beef unless the disc stop jockin' (what?)
She said this, and he said that
And he said that Timbaland can't rap
But I don't care because I make dope tracks
I make you bounce and wiggle, and do this and that
Timbaland, where you live at?
VA baby, believe dat

[Verse 3: Missy]
Aiyyo, aiyyo
Now I'm rich, I once was poor
If you're late with my dough, then there's no show
I grease my hair and it still won't grow
If you feel my butt, boy you gotta go
Out the back for touchin' my back
For trying to jack every Timbaland track
Maganoo, where you was?
They been bitin' our style, those silly bugs
Where's the spray? I'mma spray 'em good
So the next time they bite they die like "Ugh"
I'mma roll up the biggest dutchie
Get some sweets cuz I got the munchies

[Hook: Timbaland]

[Verse 4: Magoo]
He he
Girl, when the bar open up five rum
Everybody wanna get a buzz, get some
9 out of 10, all girls gonna freak
Just gon' depend on who they gonna freak
Don't gotta floss, all girls know they name
Only near, chillin' in the club, no game
Brotha mad at me cuz I got cheddar cheese
When the club close got his girl on her knees
Oh man please, learn the two degrees
Degree number one, keep your hon off trees
Degree number two, keep your girl 'round you
Never trust a girl, Lord knows what she do

[Verse 5: Timbaland]
Uh huh
Tricks - is what I got in my bag
Hits - is what I make out the lab
Ritz - is the crackers that I eat
Bitch - is what a man don't need
Rubber - shows I'm a careful lover
Stutter - is what I do in trouble, what?

[Verse 6: Missy]

Spray my hairspray so the waves obey
So when I say stay, them bitches stay
Oh by the way

I can't even buy you flowers
But together we can be the perfect soulmates
Talk to me, girl

[Bridge: Keri Hilson]
Oh, baby, it's alright now, you ain't gotta flaunt for me
If we go Dutch, you can still touch my love, it's free

Thug it out 'til we get it right

[Chorus: Keri Hilson, Timbaland, Both]
Baby, if you strip, you can get a tip
'Cause I like you just the way you are
I'm about to strip and I'm well equipped

Boy, I like you just the way you are
Let me see ya strip, you can get a tip
'Cause I like, I like, I like

[Verse 2: Timbaland]
I ain't got no Visa

Talk to me, girl

[Bridge: Keri Hilson]

[Verse 3: John Doe/D.O.E]
Yeah, baby girl

So listen baby girl

So listen baby girl
When I make it, I want you there, want you there, yeah

[Verse 4: Sebastian]
Yeah my money ain't aloof like Phil and them
And it's really not quite low as LSN
Your body ain't Pamela Anderson
It's a struggle just to get you in the caravan
But listen baby girl
Before I let you lose a pound, I'll buy a bigger car
So listen baby girl
I love you just the way you are, the way you are

[Bridge: Keri Hilson]
Oh, baby, it's all right, now you ain't gotta flaunt for me

Extended clips I represent because my thugs trip
Easy boy, I'm stompin corners where them drugs flip

You took me wrong and learned that thorough cats don't last long
Alias the Don
I leave it messy like I'm Joseph Pesci
Don't fuck around, you ever test me and you'll have to wet me
I'm ghetto fabulous
The mob crush the Lord just, never be discussed
When there's dirt involved, niggas leave the mouth closed to hush
I rush club scenes like, "What?"
Always carryin the bust
The reason why, these niggas that ruck ain't had enough
I hate to peel ya cabbage back, or bitch-slap

AK's and street sweeps gunnin down in ya peeps
44's and Calico, Pretty Ricky and Low
Thugs know
The real on how I let shit go
But if it's real, my niggas hold a forty and fill
Mass grills, body armor, niggas trained to kill
I'm at the point of no return, so I let shells spill
Vinny Rush, Crazy JJ and Mush must chill
And Killa K and Johnny Hesh steady aimin that steel
Shit's for real, my nigga P and Mike might peel
They get the gats and crazy stuff my brother love the ghetto tugs
And set on top of niggas what let's straight wet the party up
ESP was in the cut my rootin black, pull it up
Is that enough?
Y'all niggas still fail to call my bluff?
And yet I told you, when left back cain't nobody knows you
I suppose you
Woulda kept your mouth closed like I told you
What y'all in V-A
Know about this- I told you
What y'all in Nomo, what
Know about this, what

Lobster shrimp nigga, I'm a pimp nigga

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Yeah, c'mon, from the gutter to the rich
From holes in my clothes to the most butter shit
That's life, what a bitch
Now I rock ice for the fuck of it
Your wife love my shit, know who you fuckin' with? (Uh-huh)
Jay-Hovah, 'fore I never got no play
Now these bitches wanna give me more head than Sade (Ugh!)
(Say what?) Crisp in the 6 withcha bitch parlayed
I need privacy, I pull up the back shade
Initials on the headrest, it's official
Style so sick I need bed rest, nigga I got issues (Say what?)
I hate fake bitches, "you gotta wait" bitches
"I don't know you, I don't fuck on the first date" bitches (Is that right?)
Hot shot niggas, talk to the cop niggas (Yeah!)
"Money, that's my girl," cock-block niggas
See you in the club, and scheme on your watch niggas
Talk a lot of shit with no Glock niggas
It's Jigga baby, let it be known
I'm the king, I could never be dethroned
It's the God!

[Chorus: Jay-Z & (Timbaland)]
Uh-huh, yeah yeah yeah
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, yo
Is you a pimp nigga? (Yes I'm a pimp nigga)
Well spit the game nigga (Lobster and shrimp, nigga)
Yo, ain't nuttin' changed nigga, you know the name Jigga
And I came to put it down for y'all, what?

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Call me, fitty plus, niggas envious
Drop top, Jigga, leave 'em in the dust
You got a lot of crew, do any of 'em bust?
Hell no, Jigga off the hook, "Hello!"
They call me papi c, this is hot to me
I got this lock and key, I got cities under siege
When I'm in L.A. the six-four is ill
When I'm in the A-T-L it's the Coupe DeVille
When I'm down in Miami, I'm hoppin' through
With the all black Ninja with the sock over my shoe
Mami screamin', "Papi chu', who keeps stoppin' you?"
And I'm screamin', "Not a cat, mami holla back"
It ain't nothin' but beginners, and y'all in the game
But y'all can't ball like Chicago centers
This is it niggas, get your grip niggas
It's about to get hot mami, Who You Wit? "Jigga!"

[Chorus: Jay Z & (Timbaland)]
Is you a pimp nigga? (Yes I'm a pimp nigga)
Well spit the game nigga (Lobster and shrimp, nigga)
Ain't nuttin' changed nigga, you know the name Jigga
And I came to put it down for y'all
Is you a pimp nigga? (Yes I'm a pimp nigga)
Well spit the game nigga (Lobster and shrimp, nigga)
Ain't nuttin' changed nigga, you know the name Jigga
And I came to put it down for y'all
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 3: Jay-Z, Timbaland & Both]
Hear Timbo' on the CB, need some info
Your chick is with you Dawg? Gotta be, 10-4
I'm in the 5-speed now so I shift to fo'
Mash my foot on the gas 'til it hit the floor
Tires left skid marks, whoa
Shit's about to start (How we got there?)
Snatched the case of Crist' up out the car
Can you stand the rain 'cause it's pourin' now
I hope she likes porno flicks 'cause she starrin' now!
If the answer is no, she speakin' foreign now
Just let a brotha know, I turn my car around
Freak or freeze, if the answer really is no
Girl I leave so fast you can speak to my breeze
She said, "You're stressin' me now,"
Said, "No No No," then, "Yea yea yea" like she Destiny's Child
We about to cook with no recipe now
To the mornin', then; LET'S BE OUT!

[Chorus: Jay Z & (Timbaland)]
Is you a pimp nigga? (Yes I'm a pimp nigga)
Well spit the game nigga (Lobster and shrimp, nigga)
Ain't nuttin' changed nigga, you know the name Jigga
And I came to put it down for y'all
Is you a pimp nigga? (Yes I'm a pimp nigga)
Well spit the game nigga (Lobster and shrimp, nigga)
Ain't nuttin' changed nigga, you know the name Jigga
And I came to put it down for y'all
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Hear Timbo' on the CB, need some info
Your chick is with you Dawg?

[Timbaland] Gotta be, 10-4
I'm in the 5-speed now so I shift to fo'

[Outro: Timbaland]

Ha ha, money ain't a thang
Ha ha, I got no thangs you know what I'm sayin'?
You know why? 'Cause I'm a pimp
And Jay-Z? He's the pimper you know what I'm sayin'?
That's how we do it right here in the nine-eight
So we gotta be out let it ride like this
Bounce

[Verse 1: Missy Elliott]
Tell me why you trippin', out on me, mm
Everytime I wanna hang out
You get mad at me
Why can't I do the things, that I like to do, mmm
Why can't you put your trust in me
Like I put my trust in you
Even if I'm...

[Chorus: Missy Elliott]
Even if I'm out 'til 3:30 in the morning
I won't talk to no one, I'ma tell 'em about my honey
Even if the guys try to tip me with their money
I'ma let 'em know I'm dedicated to my honey

[Verse 2: Missy Elliott]
Why you wanna argue with me, all the time?
Even when I'm out with my girls
You be on my mind
Why can't you sit down
And understand
That no matter where I be, or where I am
I let them know that you're my man, you're my man

[Chorus: Missy Elliott]
Even if I'm out 'til 3:30 in the morning
I won't talk to no one, I'ma tell 'em about my honey
Even if the guys try to tip me with their money
I'ma let 'em know I'm dedicated to my honey

[Bridge: Missy Elliott]
No one but you
I'll be coming home to you
No one but you
Even if it's after two

[Chorus: Missy Elliott]
Even if I'm out 'til 3:30 in the morning
I won't talk to no one, I'ma tell 'em about my honey
Even if the guys try to tip me with their money
I'ma let 'em know I'm dedicated to my honey

[Intro: Timbaland]
You see? I think it's time for me put it down..
.. for my females, hahah
I'mma let my females shine on this track
You see? I ain't biased
I ain't racist either
So I'mma let uhh.. Mocha bring it in

[Verse 1: Mocha]
The one boss bitch, not on that horse shit
Honey I wanna score with, money, I'm all for it
Speak the raw shit, they on the floor quick
Prepare to be surprised, if you think I'm a poor chick
Got off the wall shit, who could be more thick?
Plus I can flip, rough-up, or flatten out, four bricks
As for the mic, I can break flow out, or either bless em
My style is my own, and a shorty, can't test it
So y'all - ramble on, I'mma get my gamble on
Ceram' handle-arm, while y'all scramble on
Want to battle? It's on, I'll take you on anywhere
I'll take you on a bus, on a boat, or up in the air
I'll take you on with the gat, I'll take you on on the track
I'll take yo' ass on a trip, and you never come back
Though this a freestyle, these styles ain't free
When I'm done, better believe, they got a PILE for me

[Chorus: Timbaland & Babe Blue]
What cha know about this, ha? You don't know
Lemme show you bout this, ha? We gon' blow
We don't go without hits, ha? Get the dough
You can never doubt this, ha? Ha?
What cha know about this, ha? You don't know
Lemme show you bout this, ha? We gon' blow
We don't go without hits, ha? Get the dough
You can never doubt this, ha? Ha?

[Verse 2: Mocha]
Y'all go 'head and yap on, I'mma keep rap strong
Talk but don't act on what you rap on (say what?)
I speak facts to beat clacks, and lead tracks
Heed that, relax, feedback? Keep that
Bet-ta ease back, never see me slack
Break your kneecaps - then, have you do three laps
Tryin to see this half a mil, y'all - dingy stacks
For - weed in sacks, tote - ki's to crack
Wonder why they can't keep they eyes off me?
Y'all chicks ain't 8, I'm a dime plus 3
Got a 6? I got a stack
Got a whip? I got a jet
Got a clip? I got a tec
That's why you not a threat
Wanna know how you could be down too?
Can not do, make em say "ahhh, oohh"
Been through it, put too much into it
And writin so long, I ran out of pen fluid

[Chorus: Timbaland & Babe Blue]
What cha know about this, ha? You don't know
Lemme show you bout this, ha? We gon' blow
We don't go without hits, ha? Get the dough
You can never doubt this, ha? Ha?
What cha know about this, ha? You don't know
Lemme show you bout this, ha? We gon' blow
We don't go without hits, ha? Get the dough
Babe Blue

[Verse 3: Babe Blue]
Y'all chicks assed out, Babe Blue's here
Shook out your mind, cause my debut's near
All y'all demo chicks see me when you master yours
I surpass you whores, then I smash your broads
Shorty, don't get your hopes high, praise the most high
Babe Blue, livin loca
I crush all those, small hoes, what?
My go-to-the-store clothes is better than your wardrobe
You ain't seein mine, I walk right in the club
You one of them chicks that be in line
Me? Studded out, ice flooded out
Bitch you ain't nice - please, cut it out
Bronx to the death, we gon' spit raw

Forget yours, Moch' and Blue, comin through
Bystorm, Z Man, tell me what you gon' do?

[Chorus: Timbaland & Babe Blue]
What cha know about this, ha? You don't know
Lemme show you bout this, ha? We gon' blow
We don't go without hits, ha? Get the dough
You can never doubt this, ha? Ha?

[Verse 4: Babe Blue]
Y'all chicks talk a lot, now you wanna hate me?
Moch' and Blue, Cagney and Lacey
Start the biddin wars at 1.2
We gonna show all of y'all what one joint do
You wanna get the third degree, cause you never heard of me?
See thugs murder me, deep blood burgundy?
Hell nah, see I'm tryin to get my mail ma
But y'all chicks didn't know, so I had to tell y'all

[Chorus: Timbaland & Babe Blue]
What cha know about this, ha? You don't know

We don't go without hits, ha? Get the dough

[Timb]
If it's money to be made, I guess I'm the printer
If it's ice to be rocked, I guess I'm the winner
You know my crew, Ginuwine, not the pretender
One in a million like Aaliyah
Burn like Gonorrhea, what?
I beat the beater, snares everywhere
Cris' like the diamonds in the watch on my wrist
Audiences growing like a newborn
You must be on some new and improved
Lyrically I murder tracks, put two in a crew
Tell me, who wanna mo'
Catch me in the studio, what? Doing a do
Give me 10 minutes, I'll hook you up with joint that's mean

[Bassey]
I come sweeter than a two seater Benz
Have your pockets wide open, have you spendin' on friends
It never ends, expensive indeed
Without the C's, lavish habits love the carats
Nigga's with mad weaves
Spendin' money ain't nuthin'
Nigga's who style frontin'
And then pretend ya gettin' old
Nigga, we let you know, diamond district
Platinum Rolex's with the chips in it
Money to burn, nigga when will you learn
It's automatic, now I realize I gotta have
Lifestyles of the rich, that fly assed bitch
There's a track to be ripped, I got the hot shit
Check the whip, I'm banging from my land to my six
Had you screamin' at the show saying Bassey's a hit
I got the gift and nigga's know I'm ready for this
Eyes closed, lips sealed, and prepare for the kiss

[Timb & Lil' Man]
And I told ya'll we won't miss, what?

If I ain't known you twenty years, I don't trust you much
Roll with nuthin' but thugs and hustlers, yeah
I don't care if they crackin' down
I'mma drug graduate without the caps and gowns
I used to have a thing for buying gats and pounds
And I laugh in my rhymes cuz you cats is clowns

[Babe Blue]
Smash you down, patch you down
We take yo guns and we blast yo' round
Pass the crown to the new female king
This is real dog, you nuthin' but a Lee Nail thing

[1 Life]
Like the end of the world
We put it all to a stop and
Chicken heads and dimes, yeah, they all gon' flock
And you go against us and you all gonna flop

When we spit, yo we never run outta rounds
This is lifeball not football, you outta bounds
Since some of you people's houses I be cruisin' around
Slow it down cuz I think that I'm losing you now
For those that's not lost, tell y'all ho's to stop
Cuz the union is in here, toast it up
When they shoot you suppose to duck
Look at them by the bar posing drunk
(Say what?)

[Babe Blue]
We don't care who we toast in here
We get you for how much you gross this year
You not a punk, you suppose to fear
Better not come out until the coast is clear

[1 Life]
Totin' beer, you hatin', sayin' how they get a deal that fast
But even without this rap game I still have cash
My mommy wears a money wiz, I'm trickin' buying Vickey Secret
Just to cover her punani hair

Can't nobody do it like we do

[Lil' Man]
Uh oh, you didn't think I was coming
My people can't stand for the little man
To rock without or with bad
I can determine what chu gon' do
Are ya gon' play it? Are ya gon' move?
The party ain't gon' start if ya don't dance
I don't care if you leave, but you still be my man
I don't get mad over silly pettyness
I say to hell with it, say oh well with it
Timbaland is known watch him make ya move ya feet
Make dope beats, rhyming sound so unique
His Beats are like Sean Archer and Caster Troy
Ya need the same identity to find how he soars
He's the wicked man, the wicked just begun
Call him Timbaland the resurrection
Clear-ese
Don't try to hide from ya fear
Clear-ese
Don't ya hear the set got in ya ear?
Clear-ese
This is the love man you're talking to
Clear-ese
His beats are dope, I try to tell you

I be that nigga named Luda
A.K.A. L-O-V-A L-O-V-A
Fuck that shit
Nigga what you wanna say one time
Southside let's ride (say what)
And if you love what you do, do what you feel
Then I know you gonna mark my words
I drop shit like birds
Then it's about the time for yo ass to get served
Just lay it on down
Just lay it on down
While we relax to the tight raps
And the phat tracks
That that nigga Timbaland put down
Oh yes, let's get it on down to the nitty grit
Don't have no time for the petty shit
Cuz I got more dick than a lil' bit
And time flies, when I'm havin' fun
I can make a ho get like Forrest Gump and just "run baby run"
I guess that they can't handle this
Brother's just to scandalous
If you don't wanna get freaked
Get up out my way just like an ambulance (say what)
Giddy up, giddy up ride up on the real, and death to the fake
And tell yo boyfriend just to chill, don't playa hate
Kick back relax, and just take off yo shoes
Cuz I gotta tell you what I wants to do (uh oh)
Yea

[Chorus: Timbaland & (Crowds)]
Let me touch it (let me touch it)
Let me feel it (let me feel it)
Let me grab it (let me grab it)
That fat rabbit (fat rabbit, fat rabbit, fat rabbit)
Let me touch it (let me touch it)
Let me feel it (let me feel it)
Let me grab it (let me grab it)
That-that rabbit (ohhh, c'mon)
Let me touch it (let me touch it)
Let me feel it (let me feel it)

Fat rabbit (fat rabbit, fat rabbit)
Let me touch it (let me touch it)
Let me feel it (let me feel it)

[Verse 2: Ludacris]
Fatter than fat facts like a dove sack
Showin' them where that love's at
So open up your eyes and get a surprise like in CrackerJacks
Punan' Don happy
Givin' up that nappy dug out
Get the cut up, then I cut out
Why you standin there wit yo' butt out (whoo)
And it's always in the back of my mind
Wherever the place, whenever the time
Even in College Park, after dark, I'mma get my sunshine
Closer than close, closer than most, then I'm all up in ya
Beginner, give me a thigh, breast, and wing like Ms. Winner
And let dinner be served
Can I get it on a platter, shatter your bladder
And put so much light in yo' life I'll make the roaches scatter
The wetta the betta, I'm ready to get ya
Gotta have rabbit like that cheddar
So I can freak ya like I just met ya
Hot like a sauna, get comfy like in a Cadillac

Kick back relax and just take off yo shoes
Cuz I gotta tell you what I wants to do (uh oh)

[Chorus: Timbaland & (Crowds)]
Let me touch it (let me touch it)

[Verse 3: Ludacris]
Yo' love is supa-cala-fragalistic
You don't know how bad I missed it
If it broke then don't fix it
Yo stuff is butta like a biscuit
Reminisce like Mary
I gotta pop that cherry
Kinda like that coochie
You wanna be my hoochie
Better than my advesary
Don't be so scary
I, never thought that you could act up
Make a nigga wanna back up
Keep it tight through the night while I wet this track up
So we can slip and slide
Make you wanna dip and dive
Trippin' while we rip and ride
Til I get to the coming side
Got you where I want yo ass
In the case of an emergency, break the glass
Keep yo eyes on the President, erase the past
We be happy if we had more blunts to pass
Get done up and run up
And the guts of yo butt don't shake like they used to
I wake 'em up like a rooster
Take it slow, not faster than a turbo rooster
No worry, no hurry
No pain, no gain
Keep yo eyes on strain
Cuz ain't a damn thing changed
Kick back, relax and take off yo shoes
Cuz I gotta tell you what I wants to do (uh oh)
Yea

[Chorus: Timbaland & (Crowds)]
Let me touch it (let me touch it)
Let me feel it (let me feel it)
Let me grab it (let me grab it)

Let me touch it (let me touch it)
Let me feel it, girl (let me feel it)
Let me grab it, girl (let me grab it)
That-that rabbit, girl (ohhh, c'mon)
Let me touch it, girl (let me touch it)
Let me feel it, girl (let me feel it)
Let me grab it, girl (let me grab it)
Fat rabbit, girl (fat rabbit, fat rabbit)
Let me touch it, girl (let me touch it)

[Timb]
It's a hot Saturday
My little sister's outside
Playin' patty cake (patty cake)
My momma's in the kitchen (kitchen)
Wit' the Shake 'n Bake
Magoo got on the stockin' cap
Tryin' to pick this way
I'm (I'm) in the back with the play sta'
A little boy (boy) came and gave me an invitation
Said there's a party and ya gotta wear your suit
And ain't no time (time) for the D-Q
I say who-dee-who

[Static]
Pass me the courvoisier
It's a party-yea, it's time to play
I see today is a good day
I'm out for gleem, plus play it then finally hit your screen
I may not be the giant but I want that jolly green
I got tomorrow's dreams baby, don't share the turf (what?)
Maybe I'll tap your glass, I got some cheers for you
For they yak can't hold me back
So baby, whassup with that? (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Tell me where the party at

[Timb]
Pick it pick it pick it up

[Yoshamine]
You and I goin' do that damn thing, make it bang
You went out to the room in the back
Bring me in a Henney and a pack
Give a blunt to that fact suicide
State of mind, do or die, anytime
We can bang in the back of the 'Lac
Any damn thing bang
Do the thing in the back of the 'Lac
In the car, at the bar, gettin' high, wanna try
You went out with the heels on the block
Get the nine's all coughin'
And nigga's gon' run in our spot
Wonder why hypnotize, on my eyes and thighs
You ain't heard of me yet
But I betcha ain't met another one yet
Who do it like this
It's on, put yo hands in the air
We got you in the zone, get yo hands in the air
If it's on, put your hands in the air
We got you in the zone, put your hands in the air

If it's on, put your hands in the air
We got you in the zone, put your hands in the air
If it's on, put your hands in the air
We got you in the zone, put your hands in the air

See I'm keepin' all the party people in the place
And I'll pull another playa's parts bags
Send searchin' for sex for six packs
See I'm Simpsoning them all to the back
She even knows I'm hellerin
So they'll move till they pickin low, go over really
If I say hit his head and then hang another round
I'm showing 'em, knowing if it's a drag
That you hit it from the back and stroke
Left to the right keep it right on time
One time, two time for your mind
Better get soft layers and go over mine
Come about two chairs and go here's an ear if it's on tonight
Then this is the word I speak
Shit don't quicks mo' too tight

[Static]
I come clear to your mouth and spit many a spouse and get
Civil cuz riddles can sizzle picks it a foul out
Package your rap attack, it's for presses and stash
They catch your track by the tail and smack they head on the nail
Factoring the jam made by Timbaland givin' fans something
Bumpin' (bumpin') and scrumpin' for your consumption
Listen close to the slick and those quick quotes
Keep gettin' dope shit, fuck with this, it'll get you so most

[Yoshamine]
When she get crucial forget about what chu used to
Cuz I'm here to pay dues too, nigga put it to the back sayin'
I'mma school you on the rules to how to tell who's who
On a cruise to who's tryin' to use you
In the same sentence demention that will lose your attention
So pull mad intentions like Mag'
Lot of people gonna wanna see me stand stagnant, but it ain't gonna happen
Sound completely like Twista, or get mean like Mista'
For they feel the purple from the first time
The first rhyme that they first heard
First word, nigga's know that I'm a gold mine
Come on nigga's now lets go a time
Tell I'm in a power mood, the party groove records tour if I move it
I'mma support their dues or loose it

It's on, put yo hands in the air
If I got you in the zone, get yo hands in the air
If it's on, put your hands in the air
I got you in the zone, put your hands in the air

If it's on, put your hands in the air
If I got you in the zone, put your hands in the air
If it's on, put your hands in the air
If got you in the zone, put your hands in the air

If it's on, put your hands in the air
I got you in the zone, put your hands in the air
If it's on, put your hands in the air
If I got you in the zone, put your hands in the air

If it's on, put your hands in the air
If got you in the zone, put your hands in the air
If it's on, put your hands in the air
If I got you in the zone, put your hands in the air

Put 'em on, put 'em on, put 'em on
Put 'em on, put 'em on, put 'em on
Put 'em on, put 'em on, put 'em on
Put 'em on, put 'em on, put 'em on

[Verse 1: Nas]
I, splash y'all dudes with gats I use
Ice dangle off my chest 'cause my cash improve
Nice knuckle game, chip-toothed, weigh a buck and change
I want the dough, fuck the fame
Already made history, y'all can have that, that ain't shit to me
About to have my own ASCAP, and NASDAQ
And plus a rotisserie, instead of Kenny Rogers
And Benihana's, y'all can eat, plenty at Nas'
Buffet of lobsters, dressed in Esco' boxers
For honies that sex so proper, best flow since Rakim
Liver, personification of drama
Describe my, characteristics, murder co-signer
Some'll smoke embalmin' fluid and vomit to it
I'm straight chronic, yo it's atomic how I blew up
Same ol' G, since I rocked Kangol's, Lee's
Nothin' changed but my bankroll, still jig to the ankles

[Chorus: Nas]
Please, to my niggas
To my bitches, to my gangstas
To my riders, to my niggas
To my bitches, to my niggas
To my riders, to my gangstas
To my bitches, to my niggas
And fly ass hoes, to my niggas
To my bitches, Timbaland and Esco'

[Verse 2: Mad Skillz]
Yo, yo, we rippin' tracks, it's like beatin' beats with bats
Watchin' crews change the views when the heat in they back
If you hear a click, trust me, you will hear a clack
If you push it up front, I got no choice, but to pull it back
Your rhymes don't faze me, I'm above 'em; half y'all raps is
Born retarded, now you out here tryin to get rid of it
You should be sick of it, I possess no flaws
That's from the man that made your Head Nod 'til you licked his balls
Verses I spit 'em, when it's my turn to get 'em, I got hot flows
I only do shows for burn victims
So cock this mic, and bust out your back, kill you
And then they gonna blame me for fuckin' up rap
Who's fuckin' with that? Skillz and Esco', it's on
When you speak in my direction, watch your tone
From Q-B to V-A, can't count the blocks we own
It's locked and sewn I repeat, nigga, watch your tone

[Chorus: Nas]
Please, to my niggas
To my bitches, to my gangstas
To my riders, to my niggas
To my bitches, to my niggas
To my riders, to my gangstas
To my bitches, to my niggas
And fly ass hoes, to my niggas
To my bitches, Timbaland and Esco'

[Verse 3: Timbaland]
Yo commmmmme see
The big man with the diamonds and the fly Bentleys
Ladies loooooovve me; niggas say
"Timbaland's really rappin', what the fuck is up, B?"
The jeallllllousy
I kill niggas with seven thangs, mostly they jackin' beats
I'm a eight digit niiggy
Baby, I just rebuilt Titanic and send it out to sea
What?

[Chorus: Nas]
Please, to my niggas
To my bitches, to my gangstas
To my riders, to my niggas
To my bitches, to my niggas
To my riders, to my gangstas
To my bitches, to my niggas
And fly ass hoes, to my niggas
To my bitches, Timbaland and Esco'

And what's wrong wit' that
Are you ashamed of me?
You can fool your girls
But you can't fool G

You was checkin' me out, I was scopin' you too
Oh I'll turn and walk away
If you deny (I)
But before I go
Could you tell me why

Tell me why you standing here (tell me am I gettin' on your nerves)

Thank you, thank you, thank you
(*laughing*) Uh right now, I'mma bring a special guest in
He gon' rip it for me, like this, check it out

[Verse 1: Twista]
(Who am I?) Nigga with the blunt, steady trippin
Sippin on the concoction, with the gun cocked in
Drum knockin, gotta get off
Bitches and killas in the front watchin
Flowin with like a finna studda some
Betta come off a by the ton, brotha run, I hope he said he were
I'mma flow until my belly hurt
Pimp nigga rockin on the stage and rock on in the petty shirt
Let it ruff, ooh, feels like anotha one (Who you be?) Mr. Shystie
The one who make you frown up like the lemon in my ice tea
The motherfucker most likely
To get into it with the opposition in my position I break 'em off when I give 'em the heat
Steady reefer rollin, bullets body decomposin I dismember the weak on a Timbaland beat
You remember the deep, conversation we had
When my "Adrenalin" was rushin, check yo brakes and knee pads
When the Twista get to bustin, parties gon' get rushed in
I can make 'em hit the dance flo', brothas, bitches, and hustlers, I get up in the guts homie, never phony
Hit em' wicked when they run up on me, and motherfuckers still don't know me, let 'em know slowly

[Chorus: Twista, Timbaland, Both]
Who you be? I'm the one that stay high
Same nigga rock a party, rock a body
Make ya throw ya hands up in the sky
Let the shotties fly - who am I, who you be? (Say what?)
I'm the one's gon' get buck, T straight from the Chi
Verbal homicide, everybody duck
With the party up and pimp strut
T-N-T now what's up - who am I?
Who you be? I'm the one that stay high (Uh!)
Same nigga rock a party, rock a body
Make ya throw ya hands up in the sky
Let the shotties fly - who am I, who you be?
I'm the one's gon' get buck, T straight from the Chi
Verbal homicide, everybody duck
With the party up and pimp strut
T-N-T now what's up (Second Verse)

[Verse 2: Twista]
(Who you be?) Who am I? The one that's surrounded by the wood
500 with the rims dippin through the hood
Up to no good thats why I steady stay  misunderstood
And I'm always in the mix of some shit
Scoop a shawty and she thick and the bitch getta grip on them hips
Putta dick on the lips top it doggie style, she my homie gal, so I tricked on that bitch
(Now who you be?) The one who's on the dance floor, sex gon be one of the mass hoes
Freak on a bad ho, youse could really wanna flash gold, turn a hater to a sass ho
Play and ballin up at Cape Town, strippin went down, stedy, tippin off of CD's and tapes
Though see niggas see Gs to take, run up to the car, got no thangs, they got CD's to break, no easy pace
(Who you be?) The crime cause other obituary and eulogy
Photo stank and yall be who to see, only smokin it with you and me, lets go hang out where the booty be
Always on sumthin, no frontin, yello wide ol' belly in the po funkin
Grinnin while I'm bending the curb on the journey journey for herb
Always tellin somebody to smoke somethin, true indeed

[Chorus: Twista & Timbaland]
Who you be? I'm the one that stay high (Yeah)
Same nigga rock a party, rock a body (Uh-huh, uh-huh)
Make ya throw ya hands up in the sky

Verbal homicide, everybody duck
With the party up and pimp strut
T-N-T now what's up - who am I? (Say what, say what?)

[Verse 3: Twista]
(Who you be?) The one thats flowin fluently, make yo baby say goo to me
Whatcha did to her didn't ask why I hit her for cause the game might get at ya
Get it Get it girl, I don't know what you was waitin on
But if you ain't with a partna
This young monsters a fly guy, shake a lil bit of dat body, we gon party till we sky high
To my playas and soldiers, shady niggas, young thugs and strap holders
Pimps strikin fees and red bones ghetto fees and Gs and MC's for the rap folders
The one that be kickin off air time, from sunrise to bedtime

Pimp slash brotha Twista from the Chi

[Chorus: Twista & Timbaland]

Flip your back out, and we can start twistin
Check the intuition, the dime definition
Cop all the rocks that sparkle and glisten
Where your man at? Yo, that cat missin
I got you on the line, you mine, no fishin
Satisfaction, no competition

What's the deal? Fulfill every wish and
Haters keep hatin, dissers keep dissin
We rich and, I take you out on a mission
You can make it hot, what I do make it sizzle
Keep you lookin jig', your nails to precision

You in the way girl? Boom when I block that
Treated your physique like a beat and I rock that
You got your Hustle? I ain't tryin to Knock that
Drop carats and the ring, make sure the rock's fat
You can rise, but you ain't tryin to stop that
You'd think I had the keys Boo the way I locked that
Oh that's your man? I think it's time to drop that
Lay it off, play it off, yeah you get the props back
You get the dress, I get the cane and the top hat
After we done Boo, I let you run the clock back
Fallin in love? Oh never not that
Who you know who control where they gettin jocked at?

[Verse 3: Mad Skillz]
Now when you came in the door, I seen you before
A dime, fine all the way to the core
Thick enough to make a nigga drop to the floor
Talked in your ear til my throat got sore
Lames, she could see my game was straight raw
Specially since she bought my tape right out the store
She was like, "Ain't you 'sposed to be out on tour?"
"Since you ain't tryin to go Boo, what you askin for?"
Need I say more, from the 8-oh-4
If you placin bets girl, then you best be sure
Slick, if you sick, then I got the cure
Chrome spinnin, we winnin Boo, check the score
Filthy rich, I like to dress like I'm four
Have the chicks fightin like the next World War
Sure, yo you never treat em like a whore
Like Jay said, "Love it or hate it, either or"

[Chorus: Timbaland]
(Go ahead Daddy, go ahead) Wit' yo' bad self
(Go ahead Daddy, go ahead) Wit' yo' bad
(Go ahead Daddy, go ahead) Wit' yo' bad self

[Lil' Man]
I'm the Lil' Man, join with the Timbaland
People walkin' around sayin' to theyself "Damn!"
People can't realize who the fuck who I am
I'm like the VCR tech they call bad
People don't know what they gonna see next
They might see Timbaland with Funkmaster Flex
Or doin' a duet with the group called Beck
Or back in the studio gettin', gettin' sex

[Timb] I'm the ill nigga that loves Chips Ahoy

[Lil' Man] Timbaland where you at?

[Timb]
Here I go boy, I got yo' back with a Tec 9

Never, ever step over my toe (nah nah)

]From the "V", Static, where you at?

[Static]
Here I go, if ya pearlin' in a 'lac, then turn that shit up
If ya chillin' at the club, then tear the party up
And if you got shove, let it bump bump
Not speakin' for yo' cheddah, but I keep mine in lumps
Nigga, my momma taught me that, can't sneak me from the back
So I found her chasing cheese, so I watch for dirty rats
See I'm wise like the guys, and smart like the streets
See I be rollin' blunts while Timb' be makin' them beats, Timbaland

[Chorus: Lil' Man & Timbaland]
What cha talkin' 'bout?
What you sayin' to me?

Let's have a party, B
What cha talkin' 'bout?
What you sayin' to me?
Why you staring at me?
Let's have a party, B

[Lil' Man]
Play that guitar, man, eh, and damn!
That shit is tight like a bowl of crisps
Listen to the words that I spit, makin' ya sick
It's the Lil' Man puttin' it down
Got all my females flashin' around
It's that little voice that's makin' ya tickle
Come on Timbaland, and gimme some of that liquor

[Timb]
Are you drunk? (Yes, I'm drunk)
Are you pump? (Yes, I'm pump)
Do you wanna see the party get chrump?
(Yes, I pump)
This ain't nuthin' but a party (Say what?)
After the party (Where ya goin'?)
Hearty, I gotta make my way back to the crib
I forgot I was on probation (Yeah that shit is real)
But ain't nuthin' gon' happen to me
Magoo, finish it baby

[Magoo]
Ha ha, yeah
One more again from VA
Yes, your southern representative
Keep two Tecs in my Lex, cuz I'm sensitive
All my competition stop wishin' for my demise
Cuz I'm hard like my dick, we'll ever be on the rise
Get between some thighs, and fuck until I'm stuck
Order the main course, four bitches, I'm serving duck
How da fuck you payin' a bitch just to fuck?
If a bitch want money for me, pray for luck
Only thing I love is weed and big cash
If yo' ass ain't a check, nigga kiss my ass
Leavin' freaky bitches in stitches, cuz ho's be envious
Me and Timbaland still friends and will continuous
Oh, what a web we weave
When I achieved to fuck the baddest bitch you niggas them ever seen
Possible, if you got game they blaze a zing
Pockets of rubbers, bitches go rump with just my name

[Chorus: Lil' Man & Timbaland]
What cha talkin' 'bout?
What you sayin' to me?
Why you staring at me?
Let's have a party, B
What cha talkin' 'bout?
What you sayin' to me?

[Timb]
This is how we do it
We make it ride on through
Like liquid fluid
This is how we do

Yeah, have a couple people lookin' forward to this
Now we gotta be out

[Chorus: Lil' Man & Timbaland]
What cha talkin' 'bout?
What you sayin' to me?
Why you staring at me?
Let's have a party, B

[Bob Marley]
Jah! Rastafari

[Black Thought]
Black Thought from the legendary Foundations
Sendin' this one out to the people, knah I mean?
My peoples in the streets of Illadel
The streets of New York City, know what I'm sayin'?
The streets of Jamaica to the ghettos of London
Word up, peoples in the struggle in ???, Cuba, South Africa
Word up, worldwide, Roots crew
And yo, open your minds to this one, feel it
Feel this joint, for real
Uh yo yo yo

[Bob Marley]
This morning I woke up in a curfew
O God, I was a prisoner too, yeah!
Could not recognize the faces standing over me
They were all dressed in uniforms of brutality, ay!
How many rivers do we have to cross
Before we can talk to the boss? ay!
All that we got, it seems we have lost
We must have really paid the cost

[Hook - Bob Marley]
That's why we gonna be burnin' and a-lootin' tonight
I said we're gonna burn and a-loot
Burnin' and a-lootin' tonight
One more thing
Burnin' all pollution tonight
Oh yeah, yeah
Burnin' all illusion tonight
Oh stop them, stop them, stop them

[Bob Marley]
Give me the food and let me grow
Let the Roots Man take a blow, ay!
I said all them, all them drugs gon' make you slow
It's not the music of the ghetto

[Hook - Bob Marley]
We gonna be burnin' and a-lootin' tonight
(Said we're gonna burn and a-loot)
Burnin' and a-lootin' tonight
One more thing

[Black Thought]
Yo y'all know the time
I'm tryin' to eat in '99, I need more
Some takin' this to the streets right, they want war
The sheriff at the front door, he comin' to hunt y'all
You got these devils at the back door that wanna confront y'all
They want y'all to pass like some type of gun law
They come in the night, then block out every border you can run for
Me, I'mma rocket launcher, a militant monster
I'm self sponsor, light up the mic just like ganja
Black Thought in the flesh, no impostor power hilly
Thorough bred soldiers ain't with the same silly shit that's uncertain Rap
Inside a steel curtain
His net workin' or shoulders, backs, and necks hurtin', for real
So be supreme or just remain a mere person
Yo you can find knowledge of self or keep searchin'
Whoever in the crevices, thirsty, workin'
Beneath the surface y'all know the purpose
Keep the streets burnin' yo

[Hook - Bob Marley]
Burnin' and a-lootin' tonight
I said we're gonna burn and a-loot now
Burnin' and a-lootin' tonight
One more thing
Burnin' all pollution tonight
Oh yeah, yeah
Burnin' all illusion tonight
Oh stop them

[Intro] 

[MC Lyte]
This struggle continues (x2)

[Chorus]
We jamming (Bob Marley, Bob Marley)
I want to jam it with you
We jamming (Bob Marley, Bob Marley)
I hope you like jamming too

[Bob Marley]
There is no rules, there is no vows we could do it anyhow
I and I will see you through
Because everyday we pay the price, with a living sacrifice
Jamming until the jam is through
We jamming, to think that jamming was a thing of the past
We jamming and I hope the jam is going to last

No bullet could stop us now, we neither beg nor we won't bow
Neither can't be bought nor sold
We all defend the right, Jah, Jah children must unite
Whose life is worth much more than gold

[Chorus]
Holy Mount Zion
Holy Mount Zion
Jah sitteth in Mount Zion
And rules all creation

[Bob Marley]
The mighty will te try, the truth it cannot hide
To keep you satisfied
Love that does exist, is the one the Lord presist
So jam by my side

[MC Lyte]
We jamming on the one for the daughters and sons
No the struggle is not over til the battle is won
Hip-Hop is life but it isn't all to me now
Where will we be if they take our mic from we
Or better yet strip us from life itself
They done-done it before so I sit behind the door
Those that claim but don’t really know the game
Bob Marley, know the man behind the name (yeah!)

[Chorus]

[MC Lyte]
J-A double M-I-N
We be jammin from Brooklyn down to Kingston
We be jammin in the name of the lord, sweet Allah
Without the blessings from above I ‘naw be no rap star
Exodus when i bust
See the struggle i must
Realize it ain't just
But whats next
On the cusp all soldiers at war
Steadily ignored
Still we ain't sure
What the battle is for
Years ago when we toured
Ready to explore
Entered through back doors
Treated like stink-manure
Spoke up for rights, we were cracked in the jaw
Elvis made a bundle while we remained poor (yes)
We remained poor
But we be jammin (yes)

[Bob Marley]
I and I will see you through

[MC Lyte]
We be jammin
Come a long way, but we still not there yet

[Bob Marley]
I and I will see you through

[MC Lyte]
The struggle continues

[Bob Marley]
Jam’s about my pride and truth I cannot hide
To keep you satisfied
True love that now exist is the love I can’t resist
So jam by my side
We’re jammin (we’re jammin)
And we’re jammin in the name of the lord (in the name of the lord)
We’re jammin (we’re jammin)
We’re jammin right straight god (from god)
Holy mount zyon, we’re jammin right straight from god
Holy mount zyon, we’re jammin right straight from god
Holy mount zyon, we’re jammin right straight from god
Holy mount zyon, we’re jammin right straight from god
Yes, (Iya)
I and I will see you through
I and I will see you through
I and I will see you through

[Chorus]

[Outro]
We jamming (Know the man behind the name)
Hope you like jamming too
Verse 1:
No sun will shine in my day today
The high yellow moon, won't come out to play
I said darkness has covered my light, (oooh)
And has changed my day into night, (oooh)
Where is the love to be found (Where's this love to be found)
Will someone tell me because life sweet life must be somewhere to be found (Sweet life)
Instead of Concrete Jungle, (Jungle, oh, oh oh,)
Concrete Jungle, (Jungle)
Where the living is hard
Man you have to do your thing yeah. (Jungle)
Oh yeah

Scratches:
Come On

No chains around my feet but I'm not free
I know I am bound here in captivity
Ooohhhh
Never know
Never known happiness
Never known
Never known what sweet caress is
Well I'm always laughing like a clown (oh)
Still ill be laughin jus like a clown
Concrete Jungle (Jungle)
Illusions, Illusions (Concrete Jungle)
Concrete Jungle (Concrete Jungle)
Oh, no no no
Concrete Jungle
Rakim:
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah (come on)
In the lions den
You hear the cry of dying men
The lions in
Every puddle, Leviathan
You try and win go against the blind to win
It'll put the eye of the tiger in iron men
The heart beats like animals in dark street
Stalk to eat
In the jungle it's concrete
Instead of wood we use metal to draw heat
The habitats the hood
They single the god beats
The tribals in a deadly game of survival
Genocidal
Read you Koran and your Bible
When the merciful get merciless
We need to read Psalms 82 verse 6
Its real so make you sure you do real things
Females never forget your still queens
Feel it till you feel free with wings
And the male we ain't got to kill to be kings

Concrete Jungle (Jungle) (Come on now)
Concrete Jungle (Come on) (3x)

[Intro] 

[Bob Marley]
The unity must have to start now
Because I mean, how long would we have to suffer?
Let us learn these things that we must be united

[Verse 1] 

[Guru]
That's right
Truly, we're involved in a struggle
So what we going to do?
We got to make it right for our people
For our forefathers and mothers
That's right (must be united)
For the seeds (must be united)
Spiritual warriors (must be united)

[Verse 2] 

[Bob Marley]
Woman hold her head and cried
Because her son had been shot down in the street and died
From a stray bullet
Woman hold her head and cried
Explaining to her was a passer by who
Saw the woman cry
Wondering
How can she work it out (how can she work it out)
Now she knows not the wager of turning them
Her gift of love is life
She cried

[Bridge] 

[singing girls]
Oh ummm how
Johnny was a good man
How
Johnny was a good good good good good good good
Good good good good good good man
Johnny was a good man
She cried
She cried

[Verse 3] 

[Guru]
Any attempt to change my stance son, would be futile
Ma, things for you would never get easier ooooow child
Supreme the colour scheme
Why brothers die with dirty cream
They avoid their dreams
But they obtained by worthy beings
Homicide statistics, obituary colums
Numerous things listed
Different violent types of behavior depicted
They murdered my bredren
He was a good man
Protected his fam, we all respected this man
Still his life got held up like liquor stores
Or old school jams
What goes around re-surfaces
Now is it worth it kid?
Do you really wanna get out the game?
I know you nervous kid
Hot and caught up
Like my boy Bokeem in the flick
Plus we know reality is much more worse and much more sick
Your cerebral eye probe vocals, can't touch your ear-lobes
Destroying all microbes
The ill dynamic psycho
Analyst, so understand it this
Beautiful world as we know it, is definitely at risk
Righteous soldiers professed to be triumphant at battle
Loud cries from the cell, many cages rattle
Fire radiates heat, ice radiates cold
I radiate thoughts and ideas all things wit in my control
Some men travel down twisted roads
And innocent lives get lost
May Ja, bless his soul

[Verse 4

[ 

[Bob Marley] 

[singing girls]
Johnny was a good man
How
Never did a thing wrong
How
Johnny was a good man
Kinda woman's tender care, keep crying
These two was the child she bare
Oh, a woman's tender care
Seem to all the child she bare
Woman cry just like I am there

[Verse 5] 

[Guru]
Word is bond he was a good man
So is my man BIG
Rest in peace BIG
So is my man Pac
Rest in peace Pac (Rest in peace Pac)
So was so many other brothers
Too numerous to mention (To numerous to mention)
Time is now (Time is now)
For us to fight for what is ours, rightfully
As was prophisised from the beginning
So shall it be (So shall it be)

[Intro] 

[Bob Marley]
The D.A. now
Hey, do you have anything on you?

Rebel music to get you ready for the revolution

[Verse 1] 

[Bob Marley]
Oh, why can't we roam this open country?
Tell me why can't we be what we want to be?
We want to be free
Three o'clock
Road block, road block
"Hey, do you have anything on ya?"
And hey, Mister Cop, I have got no
As I was say, Mister Cop, I have got no
Hey, Mister Cop, I have got no birth certificate on me now
Hey do you have anything on you
Aaah, rebel music

[Verse 2]

Retaliation we spot em we got them in body bag
Got no love for you all
Politician free living need some more
I want to be free, please
Could you let my people go
Forget it we sick of the drama, we find get raw
We won't ask no more
What you pull me over for?
Was I speeding? Probably so
These big Benz engines ready flow
Just write me a ticket and let me roll on, but no
You want to harass me
Ask me can they search my trunk, that's when I stared laughing
For what?

[Outro] 

[Bob Marley]
And I've got to throw away
Yes, I've got to throw away
Ah yessir, I, I've got to throw away
My little herb stalk

Curfew

Rebel music to get you ready for the revolution

Since my B-day up to this day is close by
Watchin over me, while Babylon scopin me
From my mother's womb they took my mind started mouldin me
Like Mookie on the crock I heard the devil callin me
By the powers of Ja, he took the devils off of me
I can see clearly now, I'm stepping with authority
God blessed you, I got the whole world supportin me
Ja, is my friend different from the enemy them
I talks to him shoutin out lookin up to heaven
Gave me a call he said I want you tell them all
That you shall witness when Babylon fall
All you shall witness when Babylon fall
All you shall witness when Bablyon fall

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Ma$e said come on, Mike said shamone
Started up early like Raven-Symoné
Keisha Knight-Pull, Emmanuel
I dropped out of school with no manual
Nothin' handed at all but did I complain
Every time magazines tried to taint my name
But ya'll can't hold me down like restraint
I took the "T" up out the word can't
'Round same time when Nas said I can
Bush for sendin' our fam to Iran
I'm in the club with Henny, ass in my other hand
Lord, please forgive me, I'm just a man
Right now I'm trying to make some adjustments
'Fore they do me like they did Janet and Just' and 'em
Me and my cuz and them
Trying to rap like Bust and them
And my clothes was busted and bummy
But I ain't never ever accept no money from these so-called sponsors
They was in Benzs, I was in Hondas
Now I wonder where they all at like Ananda
Hmm, yeah, that something to ponder
The money I make on this one's for Donda
That's West to you, you the next
I can't hold my breath for you
What you need to do is turn it up some decibels
And put some more zeroes in front of that decimal, nigga

[Chorus: Ma$e & Kanye West]
See, I know what y'all like (Yeah)
That's why it's gon' be alright
Every day and all night
Mase is back, it's gon' be alright
See, I know what y'all like
That's why it's gon' be alright
Every day and all night
Mase is back, it's gon' be alright
Holla back, it's gon' be alright
For real, it's gon' be alright
Mase is back, it's gon' be alright

[Verse 2: Ma$e]
Arm froze and all, Dom Rose and all
Maserati, Bugatti the roads and all
Different color Louis open toes and all
I tried to tell the chick don't expose it all
Country dudes mouth full of gold and all
Bay area chick, cornrows and all
I do it right, I do my wife, I leave the hoes yo y'all
From the boutique, I might close the mall
I drink my Geico and turn it Gecko
I wave the Roley, you wave the Seiko, need I say mo'
More diamond than LisaRaye
I'm no replica, I am the DNA
Breeze cool, leave you like a hurricane
Somebody get killed, the whole borough blame
M.A. dollar, what a thorough name
No matter who come through, I'm forever the king
I shoulda neva left the game, that's what a cutie said
Still chicks throwin' me up like newly weds
I'm grown and sexy, done with the groupie head
In the milk-white Phantom seats, and ruby red
You heard the rumor, listen to the facts
I drop my cars in pairs like pitty pat
When I'm done with this track, it feel like Biggie back
The game is country, I came to bring the city back
I came, I came to bring the city back

[Chorus: Ma$e]
See, I know what y'all like
That's why it's gon' be alright
Every day and all night
Mase is back, it's gon' be alright
See, I know what y'all like
That's why it's gon' be alright
Every day and all night
Mase is back, it's gon' be alright
Holla back, it's gon' be alright
For real, it's gon' be alright
Mase is back, it's gon' be alright

[Outro: Ma$e]

[Intro: Nathaniel]
Shit man
Nigga gotta go on and god damn
Get the shit straight when I god damn get out
Well shit
This what really goin down

[Verse: Nathaniel]
Whassup my nigga another day the same shit
Punk-ass C.O.'s on a nigga dick
Got me up at three o'clock cookin eggs n' grits
I'm a G from C.P. I can't take the shit
Tryin to hold a nigga down in this country ass town
I'm used to smokin chronic movin pounds
They got a nigga on some "Sir, yessir, left right left"
Throw me in the hole if my ass outta step
They treat you like a motherfuckin slave
Dopefiends find Jesus, swear they saved
Niggas better get they game tight
Cause these crackers tryin to take a nigga life and they rights
I'm surrounded by fake-ass crooks
They swear they kingpins but don't have money on they books
I hear so many lies it make me sick
These niggas called ballers sellin dimes and nicks
I can't wait til the day they let me go
So I can eat some steak and shrimp
Grab a mic, and bust a flow
I'm Audi 5 nigga lights out
Hold it down on the streets until the day that I get out

[Outro: Nathaniel]
I'm out man

[Verse 1: Cool Breeze]
I call the crib they say "Breeze, you ain't know?"
I say "What?" "Big Time got popped in his Benzo!"
I said "Damn man, I'm riding in his Lexus
I'm 'bout to dump this nigga's shit in New Dimensions
Get to the crib so I can call Big Slate up
And tell 'em the money man done slipped and got his throat cut
And everything that we took from the warehouse
I heard somebody talkin' 'bout it at the White House
Man I thought you said that this job was for me and you
I ain't know that Bill Clampett wanted some too
You tell his folks that I'm sorry 'bout that Lexus
I'm 'bout to dip and see my sister up in...naaah!
Can't even tell you where I put my extra playa card
'Cause them Red Dog police know we homeboys
Just tell everybody who owe us a dime
It's the 'great ho 'round up yo' money' time
I got to have mine, then I'm outta here!
Take a loss, come back up just like Coco Grier
Ain't got to worry 'bout yo' partner getting caught like a lame
It won't be over 'til that big girl from Decatur sang"
(It won't be over 'til that big girl from Decatur sang!
East Point police don't know a damn thang...)

[Verse 2: Big Boi]
Yeah, it won't be over, check this out
Can you see what I be hearing talking to spirits when I sleep?
Peep this out real quick Slick, we gets on this beat and speak
About that pimp shit, that walk with dat limp shit, that hemp shit
Looking up in your face, I see a coward and a dimwit
Looking to run up in my private home just like you was the folks
Serving a warrant to a baby daddy who didn't come to court
On a Tuesday, April Fool's Day, don't get caught slipping
Leaving the keys off in the ignition, making me guilty by suspicion
Penny pinchers trying to stack for ninety-six
Buying another Fleetwood, Diamond took it, so know we's in the mix
I need to take my ass to the crib and drop the baby off
'Cause them niggas at the corner sto' been looking at me for too long
Staring like accidents on highways, high days are better than sober ones
Don't be biased, but I know it has to come
So I put two in the sky to let them know I'm babysittin'
Y'all don't know nothin' 'bout Big Boi, 'cause that nigga steady dipping
It ain't over (why that? why that?) 'til the bitch open her mouth up
And sang

[Verse 3: Big Gipp]
Took me a long time to get here
Long time, man
I'm talking about, years, and years
Riding past funeral fields holding bodies of my peers
If you don't educate yourself
Now how the fuck you gonna understand how you supposed to get paid?
Niggas walk around get with shade tree ass ways
Fuck a fade, let my hair drag
Back and forth like a see-saw
Jumping Lily, to lilypad dag
Looking to get my Goodie feel
I'm broke in like some old men
Who'd stop dem or would stop
I'm dropping lines for the big plot
Sixteen is when I started this dream
It's ninety-six I'm in your face
Can you hear that bitch scream?
(It won't be over til that big girl from Decatur sang...)

[Intro: André 3000 (George Clinton in background)]
Everybody's got opinions
On the way you're living (oooh)
But, see, they can't fill your shoes
Life is made of half illusion (evolution)
Forty percent confusion (oooh)
Whatever's left I'm using to keep myself from losing, yeah
You don't know what I've been through (oooh)
Hell, I might go through you (Data boys are horny tonight)
Uh-oh, oh-no-oahohh (Data boys are horny tonight)
Hey, hey, hey, hey (SCSIs with a booty in her face)
And mm-mmmmmm (Modem seeking, data searching, access sleeping)
All in all, it's all in my head

[Verse 1: Big Boi]
You know it's that high guy, from East P.I
Spittin the realness of reality, you mad at me
Boi how you gonna handle me?
You want me to lolligag and talk that bullshit?
I refuse to play so I'm gon' speak that Southern good shit
That harder than yo' hood shit, lil' shit
That make y'all niggas think about the trigger
Before you pull it, on liquor stores and banks
Them folks got more than enough bullets to put that ass
Off in the slang, don't claim no gang, we the niggas
That did that "Ain't No Thang But a Chicken Wang"
But still though, how you gonna play a nigga like dildo
We OutKast til it's over, barbecue and never mildew
For real bro

"In tonight's news  (safe in cyberspace) 20th century technology:
Has the computer age, scientists, and doctors gone too far? (A tail ain't nothing but a long booty, a booty ain’t nothin but a butt)
Einstein or Frankenstein?
Dr. Scholl's, or Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde?
Are we digging into new ground
Or digging our own graves? Story at 11"

Data girls are horny tonight (synthesizer)
Fuzzy logic, their pubic virginity (synthesizer)
Ooooh oooh ooh .. (synthesizer)
Ooooh oooh ooh .. (synthesizer)
Conceived under the influence of toxic wasted doctors
Computer bugging debugging devices and vice versa
And various viruses
Performing with laser light precision and verbal incision
For a lingustic ballistic lobotomy
Mind-fuckin you, a psycho-sodomy
Of the medulla oblongata
Exit your mind down your spine and out your behind
Fuck you

Synthesizer, microwave me (Cybersites are horny tonight)
Give me a drug so I can make seven babies
Pump my breasts up, can you suck the fat up (Fuzzy logic therapeutic country)
Please make my life appear
Like ain't no such thing as bad luck (You wanted that? A holiday)
My nose ain't right, think I need a new one
Just take your pick, a yellow, red, a black, or a blue one
Virtual reality? Virtual bullshit! (Cybersexy Wendy web walking in the nude)
Synthesizer preachers can reach you up in the pulpit
Who a bitch? (Digital good time)
Give me my gat so I can smoke this nigga
Tell his mamma not to cry (Digital good time)
Because they can clone him quicker
Than it took his daddy to make him
Niggas bitin verbatim (Said she'd lapdance on your laptop, while your laptops in your lap)
Thought provokin' records radio never played dem
Instant, quick grits, new, improved (Digital good time)
Hurry hurry, rush rush, world on the move (Digital good time)
Marijuana illegal but cigarettes cool
I might LOOK kinda funny but I ain't no fool (Cyber sexy Cindy web walking in the nude)
Now if you wanna synthesize I emp-athize (Digital good time)
Now if you wanna synthesize I emp-athize (Digital good time)
But if you synthesize I will understand (A tail ain't nothing but a long booty, ain’t nothin but a butt)
You'll synthesize a man

Wassup, man?
Wassup player, wassup, wassup? What'chu need? What'chu need?
Shit, trying to smoke good like you
Shit, I ain't smoking good, I'm just out here trying to pay these bills, my nigga
What it look like for the Oskie-Wowskie?
Shit, for you? Cause you my nigga, shit, 65
65?
Yup, yeah
You don' charged me 50 the other day
It's some of that goddamn LA, some of that west coast
So it must've had a fifteen-dollar plane ticket added on to the motherfucker
Aye, shit, aye, I ain't the one to put the tag on it, my nigga, I just sell to you just the way I get it, know what I'm saying?
Stems and seeds and everything, huh?
Shit, you know how it go, playa
Well, I'mma tell it like this, I can't even smoke like that so you can go on and keep that
Shit, I holla at you later then
I'll holler at you to then, don't holla at me no more
Shit, holla at you
Bye, nigga

[Intro: Big Boi]
Zora and Rooster under peachtree
They K-I-SS-I-N-G
Wow, first came he love
Now, then comes the marriage
1, 1, 1, baby, 2, baby, 3, baby carriage, baby

[Verse 1: Janelle Monáe]
Welcome to my world oceans vs. mountains
(Welcome to her world oceans versus mountains)
Call me the poor girl cause I love to fight them
(Call her the poor girl cause she loves to fight them)
But I'm quite sweet
If you take the time to get to know me
Deep down my heart riles around
Like a bone lost deep inside
See I'd like to fall in love but
Not that type of guy
Ooh-wee, you got my clouds on fire
We're tight rope walking and the world's the wire
Remember kissin' on Broadway, you and I
I was bein' your baby and tickin' your tock and yo' clock
See we done jumped the broom and now you know I'm good
And I was dreamin' bout children Emily and
Oh darling baby with the daddy's eyes
And it meant so much to me (it meant so much to me)
And I needed your good love
Baby how could you just go and
Change it all you turned my spring to fall
I needed you, you know
But when the love is gone it's time to go

[Chrous: Janelle Monáe]
If you don't think I mean it
Then you'll feel it when I'm gone
I said I'm done enough of your love
I said I'm done enough of your love
I'm up til 3 o'clock in the morning
While you party up til the dawning
I said I'm done enough of your love
I said I'm done enough of your love
Darlin', ain't no feelin' left it's just the killin'
Oh... just grab my gun and let's go out
Just grab my gun and let's go out
It ain't no room for love it's just this burnin'
Got me reelin'
Call the law and hold the applause
Call the law and hold the applause

[Verse 2: Big Boi]
Oh, baby, it's mo', baby, it's workin' on the 6
We was only in our teens our dreams were simplistic
Jumped the broom but it seems I tripped I must have slipped
After exchanging of the rings these things you give me lip
But not the kissing of the bride the dipping of the groom
The shit that make a nigga up and leave up out a room
More like "boohoo" then "boo" "fuck you" and "fuck you too"
(Fuckin' bitch)
Kids cover them ears
It appears that ya mama want drama we need a comma
Or some space between words for better or for worse
This is not what I deserve the worse that I can take
Actually I want the cake and eat it too and plus yo plate
But wait now.. Don't you get the house kids cars
Everything we built together was ours now it's all yours
Thats hard... It's all yours... Good God!

[Chrous: Janelle Monáe]
If you don't think I mean it
Then you'll feel it when I'm gone
I said I'm done enough of your love

Oh... just grab my gun and let's go out
Just grab my gun and let's go out
It ain't no room for love it's just this burnin'
Got me reelin'
Call the law and hold the applause

[Interlude: Janelle Monáe + Big Boi]
You comin' home
Zora
But the birds are gone
Zora, is that a pistol?
With they sad songs
What you fin' to do wit' that?
They showin' off
C'mon, baby—put the gun down
But they might be wrong
Shittin' me!
I really wish you could change, baby
Well if my best ain't good enough, I don't know what to tell ya
Reclaim your throne
I'm the king of this castle
Down here in the darkness
C'mon, baby—hold up!

[Chrous: Janelle Monáe]
If you don't think I mean it

[Part 1]

[Verse 1: MF DOOM]
Villain man never ran with krills in his hand and
Won't stop rockin' til he clocked in a gazillion grand
Tillin' the wasteland sands
Raps on backs of treasure maps, stacks to the ceilin' fan
He rest when he's ashes
Ask 'em after ten miles in his galashes, smashes stashes
Chip on his shoulder with a slip on holster
A clip, a folder and his grip on a boulder bolster
They supposed to know, it show when his aura glow
Get from out the row, when he get dough, it's horrible
Time is money, spend, waste, save, invest the fess
For ten K's, he'll cave a chicken chest S
Yes, y'all, the dub will get you trickles
The best ballers pitch in and rub to get her nickels
But, tut-tut, he 'bout to change the price again
It go up each time he blow up like hydrogen
Villain here, have 'em shrillin' in fear
And won't stop top illin' 'til he a gazillionaire
Grillin' stare, yeah, your boy had drama
Got 'em on a mental plane, avoided bad karma
Once sold an inbred skinhead a nigga joke
Plus a brand-new chrome smoker with the triggers broke
I thought I told 'em, "Firing pins was separate"
He find out later when he tries to go and rep it
Took a Jehovah money for a Arabic Torah
Charged in advance to translate it and ignored her, sorta
One monkey don't stop no slaughter
A junkie wanna cop a quarter-ton, run for the border
Know the drill, it ain't worth the overkill
Flow skill, still, there's no thrill
Fill a billion 10K bills in his pillow
Villain, when it gets realer, split the skrilla with—

[Part 2]

[Verse 2: MF DOOM]
Dilla (Dilla) mix, mix, mix
Do a deal for kicks and get rich quick
Sketch lyric, bet your bottom nick' on some vic'
Ick from the drumstick come with the dumb schtick
Sick slick, hidden in a book
The only way they find it if it's spittin' in a hook
Listen, don't look now, keep walkin'
Traded three beans for this cow, cheap talkin'
Hawk men stalkin' hear that we hawkin' often
Coughin' to a coffin, might as well scoff the pork then
He's like Worf, some say stronger though
Off the top, Jay Strongbow, play along bro
Wear a mask like yo, off The Gong Show
Flow slow as Mongo, Don Juan thong pro
For ya info when he's not practicin' Jim Crow
A actress and some nympho bimbo
He's playin' Ray J, the old tape
DOOM—well what can I say like JJ in a gold cape
Fill it to the rim like brim
Villain and ya won't find him in no gym
Probably a foggy bog with the frogs
With a dot on the guard as he squat on a log
Half cocked and half baked
Used to keep a full stock of work, half rocked and half shake
My mistake, sign a track agreement
For more G's than lines and cracks in the cement
In any event, it's fake like wrestlin'
Get 'em like Jake The Snake on mescalines
Ahem—elixir for the dry throat
Tried to hit the high note, Villain since a itsy bitsy zygote
By remote, send in the meat wagon
Braggin' MC's packed in with they feets draggin'
These stats are staggerin'
Had his Ph.D in indiscreet street hagglin'

[Part 3]

[Verse 3]
Villain—his agenda is clear
Endin' this year with dividends to spare, here
It's not meant for the seein'
Went through the ceilin' after enterin' his center bein'
A new meanin' to sales through the roof
Guaranteed raw and saw his truth was truth, proof
It's the return of the tramp
Who do a duet jam when Ernest goes to camp
For the right earn, na'mean? Like Vern
We need some more oil for the machines to burn, learn
Jiminy Crickets
He gets lucky like winnin' free tickets off sickly lyrics
One man's waste is another man's soap
Son's fanbase know the brother-man's dope
A real weirdo with a bugged, rare flow
And the way his hair grow was ugly as a scarecrow
He wears a mask so the charge won't grab
On a rooftop with a large stone slab
Heads up, talk white and thought niggerish
Refuse to walk tight and got his off the vigorish
Black licorice and equally as yucky
How he handled the money was strictly Dan Stuckie
Monkey hustle, man on fire
Later for the date than the Hadron Collider
And cost more, it be seemin' like a style
DOOM leave the competition steamin' like a pile
Smile (ding!) Sparklin' jewels
In effect like alternate side of the street parkin' rules
Fools, the roach was never dead
Live for a week, then dehydrate with a severed head
Instead, it was depicted as flicked in
Split, the wigs lit (Can you dig it?)

[Outro]
We have got to try and find DOOM!
Good luck!

[Verse]
Mmmm!
The flow is toe in, precision as an afro trim
All big letters but isn't no acronym
Smack the thin grin off a chin for crack smoking
DDT the first bar, leave this track back broken
Chrome grown men doing business with Anglo-Sax and them
Lacking swing but that banjo's so relaxing
As the wax spin, hacking axes in the wind
Pretend it's just a pen, see if you can pencil 'em in
Tense, mention men of honor fenced in
Census is tens, the wheels fall off then it's the end
Don't get keelhauled in
Villain always been, feel real, genuine ballskin
Not to call the whole crowd out
It's just a few chumps, and you know who you are like a shoutout
Place 'em in your loud mouth and taste 'em like a pastry
Waste of space face hastily bow out gracefully
Disappear, reappear and disappear again
Villain not his hair, he's no Afro-American
If that's the case, he'd be a bald-headed African
Taking all the credit and jetted, astral traveling
Turn a man into a mannequin for AFLAC'n
And being tough actin' Tinactin bluff jacking
He wears a mask so when he dogs his face
Each and every race, could absorb the bass
In the place to be, don't believe the hyperbole
It's like a murder spree, get sniped verbally
Or beat in the head with lead pipe languages
For street cred, leave him for dead in anguishments
The slang suggest it was the guy in the glasses
Who came to help the people with they minds in they asses
You set trip and get a grip like Spalding
These walls is thin, feel genuine ballskin

[Verse]
Chain-smoking beedies 'til his brain's broken completely
Get back on his feet, work out and eat some Wheaties
Greedy for the cheese, please, most couldn't fathom
Had him in the cobra clutch, when he spat the mad hymn
Gems, collection of brrrats Timbs and hats
Had no time for the pitty-pat, I'll give him that
The rhythm hit him back with a right hook
Shook it off, caught a shiner, thought it was an aight look
Depends on the shades
The end of days fades, pretenders lay
In dazes on stages, DOO-Malaise
Eat it up, microphone, microwave mayonnaise
His own way was strange but it matters not
Tuned into a frequency tone that shattered rock
Hold it down like Shatner do Spock
Rapper jocks need to put a sock in they chatterbox
The block got light of Vioxx stock
Folks gather round, it's no joke like "Knock, knock"
It's them, they came home to roost y'all
And watch 'em transform the game to the rules of foosball
She's too small, any questions?
Him could squeeze blood from a penny in the recession
Keep guessing, it gets deeper than depression
The power of suggestion wake a sleeper, peep the lesson
Dig that beat
Ripped it with Metal Fingers and stomped it with big fat feet
And you know what they say, cut the hay
Resistance is futile, you will be assimilated, but today
It's all grey, metallic with a ruby stone
Rude like the type of dude you could write a movie on
Hardcore porn, did his own stunts
Writ his own rhymes and split his own blunts
Once, in a while, every other minute
Eyes pop out, Popeye, heavy on the spinach
Steady on his business and ready with a ill pitch
Keeps a bad bilznitch like Denny Kucinilznich
No hitch, just a shit-load of spit and sneeze
Strictly G stacking up off a rack of hidden fees
Rap is like the gay club strip tease
With hippies on the yip saying "Hey bub, grip these"
They screaming for attention
Beaming at the mention of a scary demon convention
You could cut the tension with a switchblade
And serve it on the same plate of hors d'oeuvres a witch made
Filleted, persuaded the chambermaid
To bet her paycheck on a get-naked game of spades
Straight up, no chaser, no layaways
Caution, faint taste of microwave mayonnaise

[Outro]
Doom has taken over every continent

[Intro]
What is the magic that makes one's eyes
Sparkle and gleam, light up the skies?
The name of the game is lightworks
I see you're peein' in your pants little sissy boy

[Verse 1]
Jerks, welcome to the Octagon
Lay a player flat before the trainer felt his clock was on
Keep your socks torn, it's a box-a-thon
With hard rock Black, Rock & Ron's goin' Barbizon
Curled up beggin, layin on the canvas
Instead of in the ready position like praying mantis
Scissors, Lanvis, grand fist sandwich
Stance switch, slammed on, stitches twitch, hands itch
Damn snitch, any street corner
Could be the platform 'til we defeat, gone and wander
Watch your mouth jaw, southpaw, outs floor
Doubt your clout more, bout roar, outscore, boy
Off the leash like UFC
Off the beat, off ya feet like two lefties
FUB's, heffer please
Lost a few to stew beef, new referees
What a remarkable team, show your teeth

[Chorus]
The shine that sparkles and gleams
Light up the skies
The name of the game is the lightworks
Light up the spliffs
The name of the game is lightworks

[Verse 2]
Wipe off slight smirks
The match was mapped out
Get jabbed and crap-slapped out, tapped out
Either the lunch bin or choke hold time
Munchkins get punched in like vocal rhyme

[Chorus]
The shine that sparkles and gleams
Light up the skies
The name of the game is the lightworks
Light up the spliffs
The name of the game is lightworks

[Outro]
The right hurts
Universal beatdown!

[Verse]
More rhymin', pure diamond, tore hymen, poor timing
Raw lining, Paul Simon touring, I'm in
Boring typing, snoring pipe when hyper than four hypemen
Excited writing, trifling times ten
Long stay, songs play, gone haywire, wrong way
On the interstate, integrate all day
It's just a small phase, that's what them all say
Then fall prey in a mini-mall hallway
Meant to be sold, not told to friendly enemies
Remember these intentionally, empathy please
Silent moment, violent prone atonement
Miles a minute on a microphone, own rent, loan spent
No debt, has bet, fast get, cash jet
Master McSmash, Asterix stashed it last
Not least, pass the pot of hot grease
Geese shot, not easily spotted plot, cease snot release
Hold your insulting tongue and mark his words well
Or end up to the curb and shocked by third rail
Get the message by bird mail or turds flail
Villain man, best nerd male you heard wail
An absurd tale of books, nooks and crannies
Before she look, he have his fancy hooks in them granny panties
Or plan B, when in Rome, go back home
And get real dome from a well-known crack gnome
He talk to himself when he need someone to hate on
The black McCain campaign, negative debate-a-thon
Gone wrong on the song
Who's zooming who? Knew it was you, DOOM, all along
Ever since he first started the art, it's been worth it
Soon to charter a stint on part of the Chitlin' Circuit
Word kid, get your ticket from the telepath
"Wicked, wicked, wicked" on electroencephalograph

[Outro]
Villain, nice to meet you
{​​*snore*}​​ You born like this?

[Produced by MF DOOM]

[Intro]
Goddamn it
Super motherfucking villain goddamn it
About to get these millions, stacks and shit
Yo, his dip tried to tell him
Ooh, you're like the sun
Chasing all of the rain away
When you come around, you bring brighter days
She told him
You're the perfect one
For me and you forever will be
He told her
I will rock this microphone ... always!

[Verse]
I hold the mic, like niggas hold their girls tight
But I ain't after her, probably your Acura pearl white
The hooker? Nah, as many times as I done hit it
To be specific more times than dimes in a briz-nick
When you broke North, I crashed the barbecue like Riddick
At the Garden, true, that's the God in me, pardon you
Jeepers! I was tore back, the ho gained access to my beeper
Called back my secretary gatekeeper
Like I ain't peep her, I said, "Darling you was stupid though
You know the Super Villain, (He is a super) ho"
I had this style ever since I was a child
I got this other style I ain't flip in a while, it goes
Pure scientific intelligence, with one point of relevance
Emcees whose styles need Velamints
And once the smoke clear, tell 'em it's
The Super motherfucking Villain, nigga came through raw like the elements
On 99 plus one of them
And with a flow to pull a fraud nigga file from out in front of him
When we with y'all, we had tons of fun
Me and my duns and them
Actual true and living sons of them
Dead planets and God-U's
Throwing divine rules to come through, we will over charge you's
Fool, and won't feel remorse for shit
Except for one time, once I had took my fronts out and lost them shits
Scientific going berserk like Red Alert
I really went to pick up wiznork for cheddar dirt
To fund these experiments is where I went
Obviously dead bent, and spent every red cent
To rule you, and still drop more jewels than schools do
Or even TV news that's designed to fool you (who?)
Yeah you, who hear the most grimy suggestions
From brothers with fly names and I.D. questions
That's a Secret like Victoria teddy sets that's edible
Them's not ready yet for the incredible
Team of MC's who broke all fakes
Who thought they were slaughter proof
Stomping through like North Face waterproof
Tat-tat, that's the end of that
After hit the bar where baby girl bartender at
I told her more wine, mingling with no single mentions of
Stay tuned for more spine tingling adventures of ...

[Intro: Posdnuos/P-Pain]
What rhymes with shillin? Villain
What rhymes with shmillain? Villain
He's a villain, yes he is

[Verse 1: Kurious & DOOM]
Set it off, adrenaline rush
The boys way beyond a pen and a Dutch
Stronger than Henn, a bag of the dust
You need to watch how they acting with us
Now time to get it in gear
You can get it in right here
Revenge is better than beer
Yo DOOM, it's been a minute, think they getting it clear (Yeah!)
When brothers reunite (When brothers reunite)
Make sure we party right (Make sure we party right)
We rock it all night long
Even beyond the morning light (Morning light)
It's hard to see him in the light
Even harder to see him on the mic
A black Benz beats being on a bike
And he can talk a gay chick outta being a dyke
Like that y'all (New Kurious album)
Freak freak y'all, to the beat y'all (At a store near you, go get it)

[Verse 2: DOOM & Posdnuos/P-Pain]
Keep it on click fully auto
I won't stop the rock 'til pockets thick and gordo
More so a risk of sounding poor, bro
No tux, who needs tickets to the award show?
Normally cordial
More or less, less is more or no
(*Haaach*) Hock spit out the cockpit
Stuck to the window 'til it's solid as a rock hit
Yes, he is

[Verse 3: Mobonix]
He grabbed the mic like two money bags
Waiting for the getaway to count what he had
Thought he was a spaz, but dude kept wrecking
The crowd remote control, keep 'em all guessing
Funny man gave 'em nothin' like a bummy dare
Taught him how to fight wit' a mic and the hottest stab
But that's the life of a villain
And you know after that, chilling
Went places God's graces don't follow
The big joke, ain't no Cola in the Coke bottle
Writing rhymes 'til the pen go hollow
And been flow hotter than the sunshines of Marrow
It's just the villainous scheme
If not real life, it's still in yo' dreams
Like that y'all, like that y'all
Like that, a-like that and like that y'all

[Interlude: Posdnuos/P-Pain & Prince Paul/Filthy Pablo]
What rhymes with thrillin? Villain
What rhymes with stealin? Villain
He's a villain, yes he is
That's right, I'll smack the black off of ya punk!

[Verse 4: Slug]
Villain, pushin' on the couch cushion
Southside Minneap', never lived out in Brooklyn
Kept the faith, forget the fame
If they sweat the name, let it set the lane
Held mind, cold and hard
Had no regard who the chosen are
Who, you? Oh no
You played the oboe, keep it on the low low
Rappers are candy, butterscotch
I'ma let their baby mothers watch
She loves the ock, I touch the spot
Bitch, I'm the itch that must've got up her crotch, heh
Now stop, fill the buildings
Leave some pills for these little villains
Hey shorty, share the flask
Let me explain why I wear this mask

[Outro]
Villain!
I want you to call me at that address if I'm still there
Gonna make sure you get cracked!

[Intro: MF DOOM]
As the life cycle goes on ... goes on
And you learn to hold on (hold on)
To things like the mic ... the mic
And you learn to appreciate who is the nicest on said device
But who is (The finest)

[Verse 1: Tommy Gunn + MF DOOM]
Tommy Tashuma, too much drama, blind behind the rumor
Time and time and time, my mind, I'm trying to find a tumor
Tommy Tashuma, no time for humor
As soon as one of ya' men's dead in Hempstead
You trying to find Pumas
Sooner the better, even knitted a sweater already
Keep your leather, we coming through the brutal weather
We ready to do whatever, yo' DOOM you with it?
You know it like a poet, my brother
Hey, Gunn you wit it? Whatever... 

[the finest!]

[Verse 2: MF DOOM]
I know about going paid to broke, to next day well-off
To bust a shell off, to dick-riders: "Get the hell off"
Made a call to a client, he must've had his cell off
A show-off, he has the same bike Puff fell off
I tell off the bat, from science to pure facts
Which niggas is wack 'til they last two tracks
Matter fact, y'all could wait for the rep to tell
The tall-tale, how he escape from out the depths of hell

[Verse 3: Tommy Gunn]
When die, he gon' die like a soldier die:
Holding a swollen eye, drinking Olde Gold
Smoking a stog, watching po-po patrol the beach
Blowing my high, rolling by, when Gunn die
He gon' try to preach the streets then go to the sky

[Verse 4: MF DOOM]
Yup! That hold water, like drizzle in a paper cup
This one etched in stone, the chisel with the paper up
I need a cut: a taper-up, edge-up
Niggas can't measure up, I'm here to get the treasure up

[Verse 5: Megalon]
Stands up and hold 'em high, do or die
He got heat, no surprise, stop the beat, close your eyes
Got the weed, rolling lah
Not sweet, so no demise, all the guys drops seeds so multiply
Within the prophecies hold the lie

[Verse 6: MF DOOM]
He bled my mother and my father, but can't bleed me, OD
Ghetto misery, he bled my brother, my sister, but can't bleed me
A OG, ghetto misery, bled my mother, my father, but can't bleed me
Sci-Fly, whole style stuck up
Used to talk to myself, I told him, "Shut the fuck up!"
Buckle up, cause it's about to be rough
He said, "Keep talking that shit, you 'bout to be snuffed"
Then we squashed it, I let em know: "Watch it --
We only met a time to join these rhymers in the mosh pit"
Gosh, it feels great just to increase the chance
For a pussy nigga face to hit the dance floor

[Verse 7: Megalon + MF DOOM]
I pull ya' top up, got clout, crack rock, what?
Now it's all good business, and so this bitch is locked up
On the dance floor: you got knocked out, your bitch got knocked up
Baby-face, and hey can you brand you, brand new machete
Damn, I just shook your hand and can't stand you already
Can't stand you, understand you deadly
But my hammer's like a band, my man, it's Brand New and Heavy
Yo' DOOM, you ready?
Yeah! Yo' Gunn, you with it?
Whatever

[Verse 8: MF DOOM]
Come on stay, I wrote this rhyme on my born-day
Remind me of the same style I flipped on "Hey!"
Yikes! Who can fuck with the likes
Of one such who scores touchdown and spikes mic's
Metal grill, with many styles, better still
Feel like number 26 on a roulette wheel
And deal, and run rings around rhymers
And run rings like number runners whose old-timers

[Verse 9: Megalon]
Shorty in the all black, she think she all that
I called her, she said, "Don't call back!"
She called me, now what you call that?
Let's go back, I sold crack
Hold gats, smoke that, drink that, toke that
Fuck! Where that ho at? Where that dough at?

[Verse 10: MF DOOM]
Suffering succotash! This hooker broke into his last buck of cash
He love her, motherfuck her ass
Metal feet dented your car fender
My agenda up in the basement party tipping the bartender
Is unbeknownst to you -- who could get body blown?
MF like Mike Fran Corleone
And got it sown, maricon, like to know what you staring at?
An invisible cat, who pull off a disappearing act
Raised by a pack a wild womens like Sweetback
Front? I'mma be back! (Like brothers in the street act)
(Surrounded by a bunch a bad bitches like Sweetback)
(Fuck with me I'll be back)
Like niggas in the streets act (streets act!)

[Outro: Sample]
Of black misery
The finest

[Hook]
M-O-N-E-Y
Never did a thing for L-O-V-I-N
Never understand what people's heads are in
Ask me what I need

[Verse 1: King Geedorah]
A fly tramp, that's what she called me
Cause I don't wear no Stetson hats like Paul C
As y'all see, who give a fuck? Who know what is it?
These styles will be flipped to the absolute exquisite
It's like a blizzard, soon as I got home from ATL
Looked into my baby's face, my boo was like ... "Well!
I know your types of clientele! Thoughts, needs"
As I held her firmly, yet gentle as the soft sea
She said, "The one with the horse weave? The pretty one?
Or crazy, had to touch the tattoo through the short sleeve?
Which one you want?" I'm like, "If there was comp?
Fuck around, a nigga like me probably run up in all three!"
King Geedorah what they call me, either caesar or baldy
Probably have moved since last y'all saw me
On the D-low, I slaughter solo emcees, they paper-thin
In they Polo, Nautica, or DK men
Amen! It's funny how significance make a difference
Notice parables of three in every other inference
For instance: "Who wants to battle? On the real?
Choose your weapon: microphone, beats, or the wheels-of-steel"
I own a crown in all three for getting down without a doubt
I'd like to give a extra special out to Jet Jaguar, the sun, moon and star
The Monster Island Czars - y'all know who you are
Get that!

[Hook]
M-O-N-E-Y
Never did a thing for L-O-V-I-N

[Verse 2: Megalon]
Coming straight from the black lungs
I rip tracks for all players that pack guns
Stack ones in packs, done and doing back-to-back runs
To my peeps that close, so's ya' knows what's up
Y'all know the dough's quick, hoes that mess with 5-O shrimp like, "What?"
Like they wanna shmoosh us, just to packing the pushers
I'm packing gat then bust a cap at po-po
If they catch us and try to push us
Since when a MINY nigga don't be taking no shit?
I be that drug dealing nigga that be fucking ya' bitch!

[King Geedorah]
What a fella! Like Salt, Pepa, Spinderella
I came to spark the deaf, dumb and blind like Helen Keller
If I'm not with George of the Jungle, if he not with Stella
Or either Priscilla, I'm doing dips on Godzilla
Though y'all know he don't play, right?
TNT throws a nigga out a moving van in broad daylight
And he was shackled by hands and feet
Then they say he tried to escape, once his face scraped the concrete
Near the curb on Monster Island, 103 Street
Where brothers run the risk of getting swallowed once the Beast eat
I'd rather lay in the cut, collect cash pay
Only TNT I see is Gilligan's castaway
With Mary Jane and Ginger
Oh, from which you spent the night by accident, I creep like a ninja
When the mack is bent, who can give one fuck?
Get bucked, get broke up like three-piece nun-chucks
Y'all sun struck, sick to they head-piece
Three-headed beast brings the drama to a dead cease
(Get that money, god)
Sick to they head-piece
(Get that money, god)
(Get that money, god)
(Get that money, god)
Greenbacks ... the meanest green stacks

[Hook]
M-O-N-E-Y

Never
Ask me what I need, I need your

[Intro]
"And that ended Doom's plans for world destruction!"
"And how did you manage to stop him?"
"Simple, I 

[..] rearranged the circuits"
"Once he threw the switch" {*bang*}
"My ability to attack is faster than the cobra..." {*dialogue fades*}
"Very helpful."
"And I will be certain not to make the same mistakes as Doom!"

[Verse: E. Mason]
What's the hero, who's the villain?
Dead or livin, killed or killin, who the fuck should remain chillin?
(Doom) Webster says, wicked and evil, but yo who's Webster?
Nihilation and outcast, equals freedom that's so fast
Culture in chains, that be the rolls villain plays
All these are just metaphors, they describe symbols in folklore
But who knows why it's like this?
Hero? Hit or old miss? Maybe it's all good
Really of God, but who should, determine the real
Evil, what's the deal
Fools rush in, they don't know the yin, from the yang
And are ashamed to deviate, or act sane
From the norm, they are slaves, forced to conform
To really find your essence, take this as a lesson
Break away from the rest of them
Get from the form ending, like the villain in the song
Find truth, who determines wrong
From right, without a fistfight
Different from day than from night {Operation... Doomsday}
It's just a simple play on words
Delete all these punks ass herbs
Who's the hero, what's the villain?
The question still remains chillin
Listen to the music, try very hard to use it
Open up and research, and that's the end of this verse
But y'all niggas keep y'all minds open out there

[Outro]
"So like fuck you, fuck the newspaper, fuck all that shit man!"
"I'm leavin" {"Good evening"}
"Yo why you want to be leaving man?"
"Man don't worry about that sucker, yo man listen"
"Yo I'm not gonna finish my piece man, not with this lady around man"
"Yo what the fuck is this shit man?"
"I don't like that shit man, I don't want no fuckin pictures taken of my shit man"
"Yo relax!"
"Nah man, that shit is fucked up man, that shit can get us busted over here man!"
"Relax man it's for the paper"
"NAH NAH I'm not gonna relax, I'm gettin the fuck out of here"
"Look, we got a car! She's got a car parked right over there man!"
"Let's get the fuck out of here!"
"Well come on let's go then!"

"Doom, wears body armor to conceal his own mangled form, right?" "Yeah"
"So like fuck you"
"Do yourself a favor.. do yourself.. trust me"

[Intro: MF DOOM & MF Grimm]
You know when you're gonna come in?
Nobody will never ever, ever, really, really know
Because the more you know, the more you know that you don't know shit!
Niggas'll never run out of shit!
So much shit, so much scripts through here, niggas never run out of shit...
Enjoy the roller coaster ride

[Verse 1: MF Grimm]
Walk the path of Jesus, witness if Hell freezes
The mind teases reality, crack the pieces
Nothing eases; being chastise with blood baptize
Guys revise, acknowledge past lives
Statements will be made, acknowledge me (Acknowledge me)
My mind is Heaven's gate so enter me (Enter me)
My mind is the gate to Hell, so try to flee (Try to flee)
Both gates look the same, which will it be?
Demons scream from thought process
Enter semen, child born, stress
Body want to sleep but the mind can't rest
Measure pleasure through financial progress
When it come to currency, love is nonexistent
Foes modify, friends become so distant
Some hope you die, backstab in an instant
Foes I despise, disguised as allies
To sabotage, camouflage, loyalty is lies
To see God, look into my eyes
To see the Devil, then you look into my eyes
(As I rise from Hell's equator...)

[Chorus: MF Grimm]
Cause I'ma slow it up, speed it up, slow it up, speed it up
Metal Fingers feed beats, Grimm Reaper eat 'em up
Speed 'em up, slow 'em up, speed 'em up, slow it up
Brainsick, tick, tick, tick, MF blow it up
Slow it up, speed it up, slow it up, speed it up
Metal Fingers feed beats, Grimm Reaper eat it up
Speed it up, slow it up, speed it up, slow it up
Brainsick, tick, tick, tick, MF blow it up

[Verse 2: MF Grimm]
Take air, compress it, bless it, mix loops like Ku Klux
MF don't give two fucks
Nigga, quarterback blitz, popped, quickly fumble
Leave game with concussion, seeing stars and mumbles
This happens to any emcee that wants to rumble
Dynasties destroyed like Carringtons and Colbys
Noise, reduced, MF thinks in Dolby
Chop that ass in half like Obi-Wan Kenobi
Greatest of all time, God straight up told me
Greatest of all time, the Devil even told me
Icicles on surfaces of sun, we livin' coldly
Prophets be phony
And we attack, we switch like the Wu-Tang symbol
Still kill Jack even though quick and nimble, plain and simple
Pick niggas off while they ballin'
And die old like Stalin
Yes, Death, I hear you callin', I accept collect
Human sacrifice, must pay respect
We catch reck, nigga, we catch reck
And, we gonna, gonna

[Chorus: MF Grimm]
Slow it up, speed it up, slow it up, speed it up
Metal Fingers feed beats, Grimm Reaper eat 'em up
Speed 'em up, slow 'em up, speed 'em up, slow it up
Brainsick, tick, tick, tick, MF blow it up

[Intro: Megalon]
Who you think I am, but who you want me to be?

[Verse 1: King Ceasar]
When I rock, jock niggas in shellshock
Don’t watch the birdie, watch the clock go tick-tock
I rip shop, I make your girl’s bottom lip drop
Yo, word to the truckers at the pit stop, I’m hip hop
I hold heat, never forget what niggas told me
They showed me other emcees trying to fold me
They owe me, yo, plus them niggas mad slow, G
I got my “Get U Now,” so I’m coming with my homie
Here’s the plan: stick ‘em up, I enter
Through the window, stoop down so we can’t see our crescendo
Pass the indo.  Yo, he used to be our friend though
Yeah, but that’s the reason I don’t really like to lend dough

[Verse 2: Rodan]
From the corner, cylindrical triangle hat says “Dunce,” lyrics precise
Like forensical science, leave you entangled for months
Trying to figure who done it, you fronted, got your shit stunted
Didn’t have to be that way.  Some saw the light coming and they shunned it
For the wickedness of those who despise life and worship death
Be a savage, match shit eye-for-eye, tooth-for-tooth, breath-for-breath
In the last days of the countdown, shit is just that drastic
Write journals like Hebrew prophets, study math like an Aztec

[Hook: Megalon]
Loved not for who you think I am but who you
Want me to be, a true thugging emcee
True thugs with no strings attached
I wanna give you my slugs and don’t wanna take ‘em…

[Verse 3: Megalon]
Box sprays with my box-cutter in my boxers
Shots sprayed on the cops’ hostages, we rastas, Rockaway
Boulevard, got love obnoxious, got five
Cops today for my Rockaway niggas that rock braids, got paid
A-Rock, you know how I rock.  Meet me at
The Lobster’s.  I suggest I should dress proper
Copped a buzz, I copped a Dutch, I got a lot of love
With no strings attached

[Verse 4: Kamackeris]
Rhymes, rhymes, rhymes, we got plenty
Dimes, dimes, dimes, too many
Sparked up and chat, you keep counting
I do my thing, jealous niggas keep doubting
Rock ‘n’ roll, lock ‘n’ load
Emcees out for pots of gold, we stop ‘em cold
In their tracks and take all their chipseses
All their DATs, all their bullshit mixeses
Give ‘em credit?  Nah, dead it.  We just
Flip the callisthenic, toss the Andy Pettitte to set it
We grand-slamming and never bystanding
And pussy emcees we abandon

[Verse 5: King Geedorah]
Flew in from Monsta Island just to rag shit with jet lag
With brothers specialized in ways how us not to get bagged
Egads!  I bring confusion like roll call
To emcees so-called, hoes be like, “Yup, I told y’all”
So socialize.  My bio show I dip, dip, dive
Memorize like Iomega zip drive
Go to the bar to drink to get soberer, King Geedorah
Eat the head of a king cobra like Ginkoba

[Verse 6: Kong]
Kong in the cut like cold meat, I hold heat so sweet
Roll deep with no beef.  Those that doze deep
Closed sheets foes chose to speak with.  Reach over
To reload the reef, swift from feet to teeth, keep
Kongcrete parallel to body ‘til the next male
Shotties and hotties still waiting to exhale
Smell the bloodbath when slugs caught, slugs passed
In bloodsport, bugged laugh and bugged thoughts caught
Some eyes, make the K-Slash stagger like a Bocker drinking vodka
Hit note like Sinatra at a opera, drop a flocker
Orville Redenbacher, get you, got you, shot the two L’s
Without the proper for the album’s knocker, hit the liquor
Quicker than a quicker picker-upper girl and
Stick her, I leave more nuts than a Snicker, kick her
To the curb, punk a bitch, stomp a chick
For now call me Kong, Monsta Isle, Monsta Click (Blao!)

[Hook: Megalon]
Loved not for who you think I am but who you
Want me to be, a true thugging emcee
True thugs with no strings attached
I wanna give you my slugs and don’t wanna take ‘em back

[Intro: Pebbles the Invisible Girl]
Feel the magnetism between us (The mic)
Growing stronger and stronger (The mic)
Why don't we do it? (The mic)

[Verse: MF DOOM]
I was in a case out of state
She was thirteen and good, we had a hotter date
It was just a number, she never told she was knocked up
By the end of the summer chick almost had me locked up
My aunt came and got me, and steadied the block
We bounced to the yeti, and I'm ready to rock
With no attachments, feelin' a little loose
Blowin' up in every spot, we had a little juice
Probably the Dom or the Afghani bud in me
We played the stage, standin' by the speaker and suddenly
Who tapped me? I'm 'bout to get real ill
Already ripped the whole club with Metal Face's steel wheel
What a sweet surprise, her with the fly eyes
And fine, she pulled me to the sidelines
The mystery shot up with strong words
She was an intelligent wisdom and a songbird
I met her last week at the same place
She stepped to me, the same way at a no shame pace
I'm off-guard, her game had me choked up
Checkin' me, play testin' me 'til I spoked up
Seven whole days and nights and not a word from you (Not a word)
I was worried, I thought I woulda heard from you
Stranger, you know I never get enough of you
How you be comin' through (The mic!)
Myself and two a alikes had ran through this crew of three
In my earlier days they showed me things new to me
So we knew mad brothers who they had hit off
They even used to watch each other just to rock they shit off
When slovenly two smile and I'm scopin' her
Switchin' off three times a night made them more opener
So you could love Allah or leave him the hell alone
Message from my godfather, solid gold telephone
Many of my men went up in smoke
While trickin' with these chickens and ended up broke
You find out who's ya mans when you broke
Like a bad joke, it's funny when you on you got mad folk
I played the middle man in every little scam
Some as complex as a hip hop album riddle jam
I find it's quite intriguing as I think about rappers
Walk upon me speaking with they stinkin' mouth (About what?)
About this and that from sneakers to hats to gats
Freak chicks with the cooty cat raps
And it's that cool the dice at that
I'm at a black tie affair with a diva with the fatty fat
I play the back, steady on the humble
But be right up front when we get ready to rumble
I gave her breath control, ask her who she learned off
Coulda took her back to the crib, somehow was turned off
Me and you was overdue
From gettin' together, baby
I always knew our love was meant to be (The mic)

[Chorus: Pebbles the Invisible Girl]
Feel the magnetism (The mic) between us (The mic)
Growing stronger and stronger (The mic)
Why don't we do it? (The mic)

[Intro]
Keep your hoes in check
("Super!")

[Verse]
I got this girl and she wants me to duke her
I told her I'd come scoop her around 8, she said ("Super!")
That sounds great, shorty girl's a trooper
No matter what I need her to do, she be like ("Super!”)
Own his own throne, the boss like King Koopa
On the microphone he flossed the ring ("Super!")
Average emcees is like a TV blooper
MF DOOM, he's like D.B. Cooper
Out with the moolah, I let her get a outfit
Just to cool her off, she said, "Niggas ain't about shit"
I wonder if she meant it, I doubt it
The way it be in her mouth she can't live without it
And can't live with this, handle your business
Villain'll stay on a scandalous ho's shit list
One pack of cookies please, Mr. Hooper
It's fun smacking rookies, he is the ("Super!")
Look like a black wookiee when he let his beard grow
Weirdo, brown-skinned'd, always kept his hair low
Rumor has it it's a S-Curl accident
DOOM was always known to keep the best girls' backs bent
Some say it's the eyes, some say the accent
A lot of guys wonder where they stacks went
I call her thunder thighs with the fatty swolla
Only mess with high rollers, do what daddy told her
No matter the city she with me to do the thang-thang
Work in the coochie, hooptie chitty chitty bang bang
Same name on the titty as on the name ring
Pretty like Baby D off "All in the Same Gang"
Keep my eye on her, really don't trust her
But I treat her like a daughter, taught her how to bust a nut
And the heat to turn beef to horsemeat chalupa
Teach her how to hold it, of course he is the ("Super!")
See most cats treat her like Foofur
Or beat her to a stupor, take it from the ("Super!")
You need to make her feel cuter
And lay down the G like Luther, everything'll be ("Super!")
Do for her, keep her in a new fur
So she look sweet when she go to meet the ("Super!")
Got the buddha get the Grenadiers, twist it
Put it in the air, come here, kiss it
Listen here scooter, let her try to bag you
When she's on the rag, never let her fry the Ragu
Which'll have you under some type of spell crying "dag boo"
Her name on your back in a tattoo
Whether a bougie broad, nerd ho, street chick
Don't call her Wifey if you met her at the Freaknik
You don't want her don't waste her time, I'll duke her
And be a father to your child like the ("Super!")
He keep his hoes in check
Sends 'em out to get glows from off frozen necks
Tell 'em, "Take his clothes, leave him posing naked for real
Better yet, get him for the check off the record deal
Find out where he keep the Tec and the blue steel
Make sure for extra wreck, let him know how you feel
And while he's running down to All-Star Weekend to ball
I'm coming with the U-Haul" ("Super!")
("Super!")
("Super!")

[Outro Skit]
(DOOM): Has the laser cannon been loaded?
(DOOM Cronie): Everything has been prepared as you ordered. But how did you get permission to return to New York, Master?
(DOOM): Through the efforts of a misguided... fool
(J. Jonah Jameson): It's free enterprise! And I'm not gonna let some blasted government bureaucrat tell me how to run my business
(Jameson Employee): But DOOM—
(J. Jonah Jameson): Will be my guest on my private estate on Long Island! There's nothing you can do about it
(Jameson Employee): He's dangerous, I just hope you know what you're doing
(J. Jonah Jameson):  Don't I always? Ah, there's DOOM's jet, right on time

(Peter Parker): Why is it so cold down here?
(Voice 2): The heat went out in the whole building
(Voice 3): Warm enough out there on Long Island with DOOM
(Peter Parker): DOOM? Here in New York?
(Robbie Robertson): Yes, DOOM, has an amazing new machine

(DOOM): Get the president of the United States on the phone
(J. Jonah Jameson): How long's all this gonna take, DOOM?
(DOOM): I would not advise you to repeat that error
(J. Jonah Jameson): Sure, I know what you mean

[Verse: MF DOOM + sample]
Darker than the East River, larger than the Empire State
Where the beast who guard the barbed wire gate
Is on the job—not my fate, tired of the wait
'Til the Villain bring deliverance from the dire straits
Fire at a higher rate, why debate the liars?
Fliers scatter, buy a plate—isolate the wires
Try the straight pliers, if not—the vice grips
A real price-saver way to acquire nice whips
What a steal for real on wheels of steel
Stunner, a funner summer number-one meal deal-bummer
A bizarre phenomenon—is your armor on?
Take your cash, Karma, or break your fast—Ramadan
Transaction drama—aw, come on, Barney
Clack, clack—pardon me, whack rap con carne
He came to feed the childrens like Sally Struthers
After that, he's going back to Cali, where's the—("—love is—")
Wilder than the Nile, hold power like the great pyramids
Of Giza, and stay leanin' like the tower of Pisa
Give him something he can feel that's soft to squeeza
Raw with the pen, and on the mic—off the hezza
Get shot off that wide-eyed talk
And if he had a pot—he'd still piss on the sidewalk
Can't take the street out the street-person
Lookin' for the perfect beat, coercion into heat-burstin'
They couldn't spot him on the spot date
Got the only tape that come with a free hot-plate
Whoever do get to see me sing
With the 3 D-ring sittin' stationary like B.B. King
Can see how it really sting—it ain't no front row
Standing room only at the motocross stunt show
The ruckus ain't up to Snuffleupagus
Me and Sub' is like the brown Smothers Brothers ("My love is—")
Vaster than the seven seas, bigger than Mount Kilimanjaro
If they don't know, fill 'em in tomorrow
On the horror show, a mental note: return Bob’s record
Swear to God, before he gets a job, he robs an Eckerd
Blessed with a hot flow—tested—it got dough
Invested in stress, the best to finesse an opto
As I reminisce, never forgot when I was very broke
Shot the Henny straight, couldn't afford to cop the Cherry Coke
Or should I say, broke with wealth?
To know enough to give them just enough rope to yoke they self
Plan B before I take the ring and pawn it
The long arm of the law couldn't even put they fingers on it
Dog-gone it—do the statistics
How he bust lyrics—it's too futuristic for ballistics
And far too eccentric for forensics
I dedicate this mix to Subroc, the hip-hop Hendrix

[Outro: Sample + MF Doom]
"In my pocket, a note. 
It's—from my father."
"—from the guard's whip. Is this a trick?
Why would I resort to trickery? You're already a prisoner. What do I gain by deceiving you?
You can't blame me for being suspicious."
"No."
Hehe

[MF Grimm]
Tossing, turning, dreams of murder, someone's killing me
Of changes, there's nights I'm on a killing spree
All done cold blood waking up in cold sweats
This is such a cold world unconscious getting death threats
Shadows choking me, my last breath lets out my body
It's a conspiracy, my mind and my body's not really down with me
Me against the whole world? It's a little deeper
Me against my self, I fight the Grim Reaper
Swing sickle, I got my Glock bust rounds off
Demented, schizophrenic, I know this sounds off to you
I do not lie, when I doze off spirits hope I die, whatever
Angels waste the time, they work together
Scheme and plot on me, cause I'm the son of man
I hear voices from a dog like Son of Sam
Don't give a damn if the bullets fill me
I don't wanna live, I hope they kill me
Put me out my misery, I live in misery
I kill all my enemies, cause I love company
Those who seek me, are called wise men
Or either wise-guys I pray you comprehend
And realize I'm condemned
No rest, homicidal dreams
My cellmate, all he do is scream
Out loud how he wants to go home
That's funny, I'm here all alone
Locked, in a single cell
His back's bleeding, he's cold as hell
And I'm hoping, they turn on some heat
I call the C.O. to bring some extra sheets
"Where'd he go?" he walk through walls, run halls, I pray "teach me"
They don't see him at the health they try to reach me
I said "please see how he feels"
They said, "He's alright but he's not real"
Evaluations say I suffer from depression
Hallucinations, self-creations, what they're guessin'
I'm here doing years, I'm stressin'
Medicate me, sedate me want me to rest an'
Don't take it cause he said that won't be best an'
He said I need his help and he needs me
"Nigga you walk through walls, go home you're free"

Home, that was far and he was turned off
Cause his wings was burned off
A lesson was learned, communicate with one
I was chosen cause I'm God's son

[MF Doom]
And I'm the retarded one!
(*sings*) Out in the streets
You won't survive with, wack-ass beats ("We can see that!")
These days and times
Watch as we get ours with rhymes
To my Metal Face bros with stomachs of cast-iron
Who been in to win and blast to the last siren
On the slow-mo the calm artist with the so-so chick
Chased them all like how he did to Slobodan Milosovik
Anyhoo, how 'bout them Yankees?
Once I leave off-stage the party people thanks mee's
If I may speak freely nasty like the freaky-deeky
At your local sleazy speak-easy
For any fan of the limelight
In the mic stand was left a lit stick of dynamite
It's risky business like hand-to-hand crack sale
With rappers who's better off on the cover of Black Tail
Jumpin Jehosaphat, who's that?
Who cats who do magic be like "tell me how you do's that"
Heck no, especially those who cop pleas like gecko
Thought I might do techno
Ha ha, betcha bust out laughing at the bet
For no reason he get cussed out like Tourettes
Yet tight flow to make her bad-ass stutter
Or even crack a smile from a mad fast cutter
Butter, word play since third grade age
Back when we used to play "Bang! Open bird cage"
Hip hop's Benny Hill sip Henny straight, get every penny weighed, then he chill, at any rate
My metal-face hoes with tongue or (at) least eye ring
Do yourself, I will continue to do my thing
Like Kung-Fu fighting everybody was biting
And the super-villain strike again like lightning
In the same spot (bzzz!) now what's the chance of that?
And a name-drop like pick the name out the hat
That's a no jiver from the, liver conniver
Who vote players out the rap game like Survivor while I
Drop through greens like a nerd cat with intended speech from way back
And spin on your back and then freeze
While I play high-ball, low-ball, to zero
So called rhymers, go call Cleo
While I, steal the show like thought-so-try-hiking
Super-duper stars need Ortho-TriCylin
Sometimes the men, mostly from the women
I hear voices saying that's the super-villain
(Uhh, I hear voices)
Mostly from the women, I hear voices... super-villain

[Hook]
Is he ill?
Do he really fit the bill?
Spit to kill?
Keep things real?
Know the drill?
The ledge edge still?
Catch wreck at will?
(Repeat x2)

[Verse 1: MF Doom]
Today's forecast, a slight chance of flurries
Slightly slim chance that they might dance to worries
And won't know what to say, break to a cutaway
DOOM like the rain known to come back another day
Like this day like now-a-day be right there
Like I, O, A, gimme half a light year
Same time it take y'all to drink a light beer
Feel the wrath of his truth just like the cast from Nightmare
Whoever got the cash, the mic, they both right here
What more can I say? keep your sights clear
Bare facts, triple naked to bare backs
He only came to jack rare tracks for your earwax
Oh snap! You hear that? Naw
DOOM stay way up in the cut like Ma and Pa
When he come out he dumb out, there he go
The villain with the illest flow in all of Mexico
All foes on some when he leave out let me know
Just so's I can breath out before I let go
Rappers is like Satchmo that you best know
Invest in free dough like Matthew Lesko
Followed by hailstorms, snow and earthquakes
Give out more toothaches than first birthday cakes
The more we reverse scripts the worse they fate
To beat y'all with dimes and dummy Anbesol shake
Now you got a rhyme tummy ache by mistake
Can't call it, can't call Jake, call cannonball face
Dig tapes and stay in great shape
Today's rap game is like one big date rape
The name ring bell like ring ding dong
He can never be wrong like Ling Ting Tong
Once heard a hit song, sounded like an annoying gong
It's so wack, I ain't wanna hit the bong
Now who get iller with the pen than I do?
And in it just to get the benjamin like Netanyahu?
Let the god bless you like Achoo!
Get you like whats that on your chest, got you
PNS beat good for you it's shredded wheat
As well as getting shredded by the metal headed lead feet
Son 'em and dead 'em like a dad that's dead beat
Beat him like a dead horse, nasty as red meat
DOOM memorize rhymes and still forgot
Call it how he see it and kill a shot, like Willard Scott
In the place to be like no iller spot
To spill a knot, it's like a chilling thriller plot
Starring the villain as the black Jesus
If it ain't the 'gnac or the Jack it's Grey Goose
Still could stay loose off grape juice regardless
Nevertheless did his best on the retarded test
It's trick questions, always kept a cheat sheet
On the microphone, a rep up before Beat Street
And beat meat that MF DOOM he stay true
If you online check the site and FAQ

[Hook]

[MF Doom]
Yo, yo
Bring in the big guns, weapons is ready
In the square shoot the heady reppin the yeti is ready
Bout time last train from Gun Hill, Dunn chill
Stay filled with exhiliration from one kill

[Scott Free]
Yo, rock for ? row don't tempt me
Smack the drum black, black rap Jack Dempsey
You get laced without a trace just for takin up space
Bill Bill the bombville you still catch a Gas Face
For real
MF DOOM - “Impostas”

[Emcee(s): MF DOOM]

[Producer(s): MF DOOM and Ill Clown]

[Sample (Melody): Setsuo Yamamoto, Shun Nishigaki, and Tatsuro Suzuki - “Charlie Ending” (0:31)]

[Intro: MF DOOM]
The Supervillian versus the gold-digger
DOOM mild-mannered old nigga
Supporter for the daily blues
Reporter for the jewel, drop news, pop Israeli tools

[Verse 1: MF DOOM]
The world-renowned master of word game
Who lay low sometime behind iceberg nerd frames
(Ayyo, MF) They heard the name, but just couldn’t
Quite place the rep if they retraced they steps
Next EP, who to give thanks ta?
Here lies the pranksta who tried to test a gangsta
The last thing he saw was a potato
From the lone NATO who hosts his own late show
Keep a low lab on Monsta Island like Seinfeld
White-wine clientele connected like Mind Meld
I can tell they sees these styles as too tricky
They’re too picky on this microphone doohickey
MF, Monday through Friday, get money
Saturday through Sunday, the brown Al Bundy
Waiting for the shit you’re kicking as the plot thickens
He wrote these rhymes in 3-D with red and blue BIC pen
And to the chickens, only hoes who say, “Let me hold ‘em”
Take him in their mouth while he’s semi-swollen—semicolon
I told him words would do a nigga brutal
For not using his noodle, F up and get bamboozled
He was the one to open to her up, blow her brains
Back, dope her up or rope her to the train tracks
Or he would choke her ‘til she collapse, steal/steel
To poker/poke her with the wood, and tell her, “Be good”
He could take a phrase like “Peter Piper picked a pepper”
And put it where he couldn’t peep a sniper, sicker repper
Nigga poppa, stick a chick proper
Double-platinum, Oprah, soap-opera watchers, gossipers
On top of her

[Bridge: MF DOOM and (Sample)]
(I keep forgetting) can’t go
Raw anymore
(I keep forgetting) rappers is
Impostas.  Been a show-stopper since a ho-hopper

[Verse 2: MF DOOM]
Never came second place in a neck-and-neck race
To the naked face who wanna battle: bring a neck brace
We supply the insult to injury
Whoever in the industry getting money is too stingy
Violate, you might as well smoke me, loc
Relocate, migrate, or get caught with the okey-doke
It’s guaranteed it’s your last step, so step to me
With the Uzi, watch that first step—it’s a doozy
Time flies as the hourglass trickles sand
One last thing before I blao this popsicle stand:
A rolling stone, and that’s that.  At home
On the microphone like, “That’s where he laid his hat at”

[Outro: MF DOOM and (Sample)]
(I keep forgetting)
Keep making dough
(I keep forgetting)
Mad Flow, MF, Metal Face hoes
(I keep forgetting)
Factual stacks at shows
(I keep forgetting)
Worldwide, ‘cross the globe, let the beat rock

[Verse 1]
War! War! War!
Talking about you's such a bore
I'd rather talk about moi
Like do you know the cost of AK's up in Africa?
20 dollars ain't shit to you
But that's how much they are
So they're gonna use the shit just to get far
Is gold diamonds helping ya?
Don't you like my ban-dan-na? (bandana)
My stains hang low, on my shirt's like "Ay-ya-ya!"
Got monkey brains and banana
I'll hit you with my antenna
I put soap in my eye
Make it red so I look rawr-rawr-rawr!
So I woke up with my Holy Quran
And found out I like Cadillac
So we're shootin' until the song is up
Little boys are acting up
And baby mothers are going crazy
And the leaders all around cracking up
We goat-rich, we fry
Price of livin' in a shanty town just seems very high
But we still like T.I
But we still look fly
Dancin' as we're shootin' up
And lootin' just to get by (Huh?)

[Hook]
With your feet on the air
Your head on the ground
Try this trick and spin it - yeah!
Your head'll collapse, when there's nothin' in it
And you'll ask yourself
Where is my mind?
Where is my mind?
Where is my mind?
(Huh?)

[Verse 2]
War! War! War!
Who made me like this!
Was it me and God in co-production?
My Devil's on speed-dial
Every time I take the wrong direction
All I want is one thing and that is what you got
Sometimes I go and lose my mind, then I feel numb
There's 24 hours in a day
I used to spilt it 8, 8, 8
8 - work! 8 - sleep!
And 8 for play!
Now I give it all it takes
Now people on the Internet
A new life for the intellect
People judge me so hard cause I don't floss my titties out
I was born out of dirt like I'm porn in a skirt
I was a little girl who made good, well au revoir, adieu
I put people on the map that never seen a map
I've showed 'em something they've never seen
And hope they make it back!

[Hook]
With your feet on the air
Your head on the ground
Try this trick and spin it - yeah!
Your head'll collapse, when there's nothin' in it
And you'll ask yourself
Where is my mind?
Where is my mind?
Where is my mind?
(Huh?)
With your feet on the air
Your head on the ground
Try this trick and spin it - yeah!
Your head'll collapse, when there's nothin' in it
And you'll ask yourself
Where is my mind?

[Verse 1: M.I.A.]
We do it cheap
Hide our money in the heap
Send it home and make 'em study
Fixing teeth
I got family, a friend in need
A hand to throw the gasoline
A mobile phone, hooked up to the scene
Hello, my friend, yes, it's me
Don't be scared, there's somethin' going on
I'm gettin' money, since I've grown
Could be dash, go out and hustle 'em
But, I hate money cause it makes me numb

[Chorus: M.I.A.]
Hustle, hustle, hustle
Grind, grind, grind
Why does everyone got hustle on their mind?
Hustle, hustle, hustle
Grind, grind, grind
Why does everyone got hustle on their mind?

[Bridge: Afrikan Boy]
You think its tough now? Come to Africa!
You think its tough now? Come to Africa!
You think its tough now? Come to Africa!
You think its tough now? Come to Africa!
You think its tough now? Come to Africa!

[Verse 2: Afrikan Boy]
Out there, we are grinding like pepper
You can catch me on the motorway
Selling sugar, water, and pepper
I rep Africa, not Miami
Hustle, hustle with M.I.A
I'm broke, I've got indefinite stay
You can't touch me, like leprosy
I hustle though from here to Sri Lanka
My mum told me to be an accountant
Bun that, I wanna work in a corner shop
Contact Sugu, he's got the contacts, mayne!
I'm illegal, I don't pay tax-tax
EMA, yes, I'm claiming that, that
Police, I try to avoid them
They catch me hustling they say, "Deport them!"

[Chorus: M.I.A.]
Hustle, hustle, hustle
Grind, grind, grind
Why does everyone got hustle on their mind?
Hustle, hustle, hustle
Grind, grind, grind
Why does everyone got hustle on their mind?

[Interlude: M.I.A]
Ugh! Afrikan Boy!
You know I'm big in Mozambique!
Hey-hey!

[Verse 3: M.I.A.]
Hello, my friend!
Hello, my friend!
Hello, my friend, yes, it's me!
Hello, my friend!
Hello, my friend!
Hello, my friend, yes, it's me!
4 by 3, 3 buy 3
Buy 1 song, get 1 free
Maybe me, a bootleg CD, color TV, or a DVD
We got barrels in the sea
It's big enough to take a whole family
We drum on it like
Jun cha cha ju gu ju gu cha!
Jun cha cha ju gu ju gu cha!
Come sit by me, let me tell you we
Don't do bling, but we do white-tee
Up some jungle, up some tree
One second, my phone's ringing
It's my friend, Habibi
He then went drop, called me
Cheap Moroccan, got no credit than me
Ya'll got less credit than me
I keep that tab at a shop like a G
Cause without me, there'll be no chocolate Hershey!

[Chorus: M.I.A.]
Hustle, hustle, hustle
Grind, grind, grind
Why does everyone got hustle on their mind?
Hustle, hustle, hustle
Grind, grind, grind
Why does everyone got hustle on their mind?

[Beyonce]
The cards never lie, my last breath a sigh
And now I think about if it's my time to die
I don't know what I was thinking, steady wasting time with Hill
And I need to live my life because my time is unforgiven

I can't understand how my life changed around
Manifest my destiny, is it the brown underground?
Blue skies are turning gray it's the point of indecision
Believing in the cards you must respect its every vision

[Wyclef]
Girlfriend, get your mind on line
Don't spend your time cause you can't waste your time
Everyday like it's your last, but you must feel divine
Intervention comes and snatch up all your dreams from behind

Love!
You feel it and you got to let them know it
Love!
Your heart and that's the feeling that you go with
If you have a dream you need to go and let them know it
Cause you could wake up in the morning and it could be over

[Beyonce]
No, No, No, No
I don't wanna, I don't wanna
I don't wanna go
Just, Just, Just let me stay home
Let me live my dream, let me see another dawn

No, No, No, No
I don't wanna, I don't wanna
I don't wanna go
Just, Just, Just let me stay home
Let me live my dream, let me see another dawn

[Rah Digga]
Carmen, don't listen cause the cards have deceit
Just slide him the money, we don't need a receipt
Truth only exists within the eyes of the beholder
Plus he's kind of young for fortune telling
He probably should be older

[Wyclef]
But the cards never lie, I thought I told you
Now it's her turn to try, to reach her goals before she reaches the sky

[Beyonce]
This is love
It's like I'm trying to throw my life away
Sometimes love is all you got and other times it makes you pay

[Wyclef]
Well when you finally rise
Then you'll realize

[Beyonce]
The windows to the soul are not the hips but the eyes

[Wyclef]
Oh You could wish on the stars but they're dead, just a lie

[Beyonce]
But they shine just as bright as they did their entire life

No, No, No, No
I don't wanna, I don't wanna
I don't wanna go
Just, Just, Just let me stay home
Let me live my dreams, let me see another dawn

No, No, No, No
I don't wanna, I don't wanna
I don't wanna go
Just, Just, Just let me stay home
Just let me live my dreams, let me see another dawn

[Intro]
Where were you in '92?
Where were you in '92?
Where were you in '92?
Where were you in '92?
'92? '92? '9-'9-'92?

[Verse 1]
This is how we do it in the XR2
The boys look fine, stereos Alpine
20/20, Thunderbird, 12:09
Took a pill, good time, all the time
This is how we do it in the XR2
The boys look fine, stereos Alpine
20/20, Thunderbird, 12:09
Took a pill, good time, all the time

[Verse 2]
Brick Lane Massive, we were like grime
Ladbroke Grove dance, Bagley's time
High top fades, we're never paid
Rolled-up jeans, easy Lucozade
'sace jeans, shades, and chains
We roll in there like we're late
DJ's, MC's, private raves
Keep it secret - light it, mate

[Chorus]
Whistle, whistle, blow, blow
Here we, here we go, go
Whistle, whistle, blow, blow
Here we, here we go, go
Whistle, whistle, blow, blow
Here we, here we go, go
Whistle, whistle, blow, blow
Here we, here we go, go
Whistle, whistle, blow, blow
Here we, here we go, go
Whistle, whistle, blow, blow
Here we, here we go, go
Whistle, whistle, blow, blow
Here we, here we go, go
Whistle, whistle, blow, blow
Here we, here we go, go

[Verse 3]
Some of them drink Heineken and some of them drink Bacardi
Some of them talk a lot of shit and act rowdy
Some say people follow me, some say people is the key
When the music's got a beat, then that's what gets me
Some say– and some of them–
Some say– and some of them–
When the music's got a beat, then that's what gets me
Some people think we're stupid, but we not

[Verse 4]

And to the SWAT's
Helicopter the block
And them put you on the news
Wasn't proper to watch

Catch me in your strip all black in bandanas

So I can let this tar lift you off your feet like Vince Carter

[Hook]
Two Glock nines
Any motherfucker whisperin about mine

[x4]

[T.I.P.]
Oh I'm a motherfuckin' G nigga
Fuckin' with me

Have a nigga clutchin' his knee
Strugglin' to breathe
Make the gat splatter your bladder
Like a kidney disease
Yeah I know you're holdin' weight
So just gimme the keys
Or these motherfuckers with you are fin to witness ya bleed
Paramedics cuttin' ya jeans
Rippin' ya sleeves
Put your ass in a body bag, zip it and leave
Ain't no motherfucker do it like I do
You and your nigga runnin' up
Put two in him and two in you
I put a nigga at the bed like a child with the flu
Put hit out on that bucket and runnin' wild with your crew
Put this thang to your head
Put your brains on the roof
Here now we ain't the same
Y'alls is liars and we the truth
Now that you know the scoop

[Hook]
Two Glock nines

[Beanie Sigel]

Niggas tryin' to watch mine

Throwin' cops where your block rhyme

[T.I.P.]

And sixty triggas standin' behind me

Bustin' in them bushes where you are hiding

[Beanie Sigel]

T.I.P., Beanie Sigel, P.A
Ghetto Vision, Roc-A-Fella
Man it's outrageous
And we out

[Verse 1: Guru]
Though the times are getting wicked I'm bolder
I got a chip on my shoulder
True players always maintain, I'm different I told ya
Don't want to be just a commodity
I'm smarter G
This is my life, and my soul not just a job to me
It's the truest part of me
Fans now mobbing me
Fake friends acting like I just won the lottery
Back then I guess it was hard to see
The real paradox
What an odyssey
It's like that saying
Be careful what you pray for you might get it
Of course it's all about winning and money but how far would one let it
Taken 'em, the holy game can make 'em, then instantaneously break 'em
Rain one day sunshine the next
Haters try to stop my flow sometimes I'm vexed
What's next hounded by the press
Mad stress on my chest
Of course I know that I'm blessed but here's the test
On "Any Given Sunday" I got to play my best

[Hook]
Sacrifice don't give up the fight
Everything will be all right on any given Sunday
Guru: The harder they come, yeah the harder they must fall
Depends on you if you win or lose
You know you got to pay some dues so that you can live on Monday
Guru: Strive to achieve and die for what you believe

[Verse 2: Jamie Foxx]
On the battlefields left abandoned
One man standing
To me the ball was handed
Taken shots and left stranded
No defense so they tackle me
Every blow brings back a memory
Learning lessons from my injury
It's killing me
Cause at first they wasn't feeling me
Never given a chance to show my true ability
Too many pressures trying to play me out
Put me in positions that's sure to lay me out
No doubt

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Common]
Playing on a field of hard times
These struggles like the yard line that I gain from
Nowhere is where I came from
From day one, I knew the game and how to play run
But never knew the price of fame would weigh tons
Now I learn from self when pain comes
And walk when they say run
Fame could be as painful as the Death of Payton
Young black, gifted
But I'm wrapped in myself
Done broke many tackles but I'm trapped in myself
See what happens with wealth
At times you can lose yourself
During the sunniest of days many superstars melt
From cotton to football fields
You know how they play brothers
Long as we playing well they love us
I know on Any Given Sunday
This can be taken from me
What it all comes down to is money
I know on Any Given Sunday
This could be taken from me
What it all comes down to is money y'all

[Hook x2]

[Beyonce]
Sweetness flowing like a faucet, body bangin' no corset
Brother's wanna toss it but they lost cause my game made em forfeit
Slicker than a porpoise and thicker than a horse's
Carmen Brown got the whole town speechless
I stick to my thesis, eyes stick to my features
Brother's try to hold but they game never reaches
And most of these cats are like the middle of peaches
I see you lookin' at but what you lookin' at
We in a bar , wanna twist me like a bottle cap

[Mos Def]
I'm tryin' to holler miss to see if you gon' holler back

[Beyonce]
Your game is whack, and no, you will not get your quarter back
See this is Carmen, curves like a cul-de-sac
Skin coffee and cream, your donuts, you ain't dunking that

[Mos Def]
But this is Milla, Lieutenant if you're wonderin'

[Sam Sarpong]
And I'm Natheniel, (Mos Def) Mel Gibson (Sam) Danny Gloverin'

[Beyonce]
But I'm not hearing you, you might as well be mumb-l-in
See, I have dreams  and with a man, what will become of them?
There's not a kid out here who can make me believe
I should postpone my goals, cause he got tricks up his sleeve?
Whole bar full of cuffs and you ain't locking me down

[Mos Def]
I got a warrant for ya heart, in the bed, hold the trial

[Sam]
Get a pardon if ya come with the sargeant now

[Beyonce]
Give  the chair cause I don't care I ain't feelin' your style

[Hook x2]
Yo, I'm tryin' to get with you shorty
(But I'm not feelin' you)
But I'm an officer shorty
(My looks are killin' you)
Murder one will get you under the covers
(Game talker or manslaughter I ain't feelin' you brothers)

[Beyonce]
Eyes like the ocean

[Mos Def]
Ma I got some lotion
Hold ya thighs, raise em' high and daddy long stroke em'

[Beyonce]
Hair like forever

[Sam]
I swear I could do it better
Take the gun out my holster, I still pack a baretta

[Beyonce]
You brothers sweat Carmen like Patrick Ewing
But that kid

[Mos Def]
Don't waste ya time he ain't worth doin'
He just a sargeant, passin' out tickets for parking

[Sam]
Chickenheads cluckin'

[Beyonce]
Pitiful bulls barkin'
See this is Carmen, voice sweet as Marvin
I turn out lights with the switch when I'm walkin'
Girls steady jealous cause they man always hawkin'
Even got Lou lookin' at me like he stalkin'
And I got a mind too, I wouldn't bless you
If your first name was Ha-Chu, on Sunday singin' gospel

[Mos Def]
You ain't a dime just a nickel actin' hostile

[Beyonce]
Headed for the big top and bouncin' off this side show

[Audience Clapping and Cheering]

Thank you, thank you!
Back together at last
DMX,  Ozzy Osbourne,  Old Dirty Bastard and Crystal Method

[ODB]
Fuck that shit, you know what I'm sayin'?

Big Baby Jesus in the motherfucking house

[DMX]
Unh, fuck it
Unh, come on!
Unh, Unh
I don't walk, I stalk, livin' foul like pork
Shuttin' down underground streets of New York
Hawk is what them niggas call me, cause they all be
Suckin' my dick and on my motherfucking balls, G
I know the half, so I laugh wit' 'em
Blood bath went I let the fuckin' wrath hit 'em
Full clip, but only half did 'em
That's all it took, another crook
Taken out over a dirty look
I bag niggas, but niggas with trash shot dead
You're only takin' a fuckin' thing from me but hot lead
You know my style faggot, cause I'm always schemin'
In jail, niggas holdin' a sink screamin'
"Police," but you got no peace
Yo, was that you big man, and a lot mo' grease
All I gets is pounds, niggas want none of this
Back streets are like track meets cause I be runnin' this

[Hook: Ozzy Osbourne]
Ain't nowhere to run (cause I be runnin' this)
Ain't nowhere to hide (come on)
Ain't nowhere to go (cause I be runnin' this)
Reaper saved your soul (come on)

[Ozzy Osborune]
Surrounded by the colors, I see crimson, black and blue (come on)
Locking open doors again, I'm still afraid of you (straight up, motherfucker)
Light to dark, then light again, I always thought I knew (come on)
Young to old and young again, what's left for me to do? (straight up)
System of the universe, selecting me in time (come on)
I'm falling down upon the earth, and singing truth in rhyme (come on)
If I was a rolling stone, I'd roll until I'm through (come on)
And if I was a garden I would bloom in black for you (Dirt Dog in the fuckin' 

[?])

[Hook]
Ain't nowhere to run (cause I be runnin' this)
Ain't nowhere to hide (come on)
Ain't nowhere to go (cause I be runnin' this)
Reaper saved your soul (come on)

[ODB]
Ahhhh, yi yi yi yi (come on)

[Hook]
Ain't nowhere to run (cause I be runnin' this)
Ain't nowhere to hide (come on)
Ain't nowhere to go (cause I be runnin' this)
Reaper saved your soul (come on)

[ODB]
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
What you motherfuckers invented
Is the craziest nigga that ever been invented
Ha ha ha ha ha
Most know, don't front on Ol' Dirty Bastard
Ha ha ha ha
I call on Jesus
There's no obstacles that you have to jump
There's no walls that you have to climb
This is real, this is elementary, dear
Elementary, Watson, elementary
Ahhhhh
I ain't no picture on your fucking wall, necklace wearin' bitch
Nigga, I want this money till it's rich
Buy my album, coded by Dirty, set you free
Go against the grain, I got to pee
I know you don't recognize me now
I done cocooned
How many lightning bugs do it take to light up a fucking moon?
Brothers, people, you'd better get the fuck off of me
We don't need it, it gets more ugly
Bitches was tryin' to bust their ass
Tryin' to get away from me when I said my real name
I call myself in the bitch butthole
All the same, all the same, all the same

[Ozzy Osborune]
Ain't nowhere to run
Ain't nowhere to hide
Ain't nowhere to go
Reaper saved your soul

[ODB]
Ahhh yi yi yi yi
What, motherfucker?
Don't try to psychology my shit, motherfucker
Cause you'll never psychology it, motherfucker
Never, never, never, motherfucker, never

[Intro: Muhammad Ali]
I done something new for this fight
I murdered a rock, injured a stone
Hospitalized a brick
I'm so mean I make medicine sick

[Verse 1: Wyclef Jean]
(Come on)
Root to the fruit
More bass than Bootsy Collins
You versus me
Thats like Ali verses Foreman (a-ha)
God's act, stand back and watch
Devil's time out
Can't be timed with no swatch watch
Who I am, the black Abraham
Zunga zunga zang, yellow man, Vietnam
Add an extra bar as I spar with literature
Taking kingdoms from tsars
Winning more wars than the Moors

[Verse 2: John Forté]
Now what's the deal star?
I seen the Devil spar with Allah
Mathematics was the key to set my whole race free
You might debate we, a refugee
No harm hurt me
Dying, thirsty from the struggle
To my own hustle bubble
On the low, woe is me
To show the Free Bob right
The righteous Asiatic thinker
While Satan rob light
Civilized like the Mali
Burgundy, wildy rocking
Seen the fifth when Ali clocked him
John Forte he'll keep you locked in

[Verse 3: Q-Tip]
People all around
You got to recognize and witness
The Mister who swift enough to knock you out with Mic fitness
Hands blistered from holding the mics tight
Some say it's fight night
Well throw the R after the F cause I'ma take away your breath
The bell rings and now it's just a daily operation
Yo, you soft like lubrication
You can see this occupation (The winner)
And you know we hail from Q-Borough
L-Boogs and Clef the trainers, Prazwell promotes the thorough

[Verse 4: Lauryn Hill]
We used to bite the bullets with the pig-skin casing
Now we perfect slang like a gang of street masons (uh)
Scribe checks, make connects
True pyramid architects (yeah)
Replace the last name with the X (X)
The man's got a God complex
But take the text, change the picture
Watch Muhammad play the messenger like Holy Muslim scriptures
Take orders from only God
Only war when it's Jihad
See Ali appears in Zaire to reconnect 400 years
So we the people, dark but equal, give love to such things
To the man who made the fam' remember when we were kings

[Hook: Lauryn Hill]
Blocks on fire (Block's on fire tonight)
Fiends getting higher (uh-huh)
Robbing blue collar
(Hey yo we rob them blue collars)
Killing for a dollar (Stick 'em up)
See youths get tired (Ali ah yeah)
Dealing with them liars (Ali ah yeah)
(We're dealing with too many liars)
From Brooklyn to Zaire (uh-huh ah yeah)
We need a ghetto Messiah (ah yeah come on)

[Chorus: Lauryn Hill]
Send me an angel in the morning, baby
Send me an angel in the morning, darling
Send me Muhammad in the morning, baby
Send me an angel in the morning, darling

[Verse 5: Phife Dawg]
Once the pen hits the pad it's danger
To this I be no stranger
Step inside the ring and I'll derange ya' (Come on)
I'm hearing no comments, everyone looks despondent
Dejected, rejected similar to Liston Catching licks
Beat it, Sonny
My man is still the greatest in this
To hell with Frazier, yapping' about that negative shit
Now listen, you can try and escape if you want to
But ask yourself, who the hell you gonna' run to?
Like Sade Adu, you got a punch that I can sleep to
Fugees, Tribe, Busta Rhymes forever coming through

[Verse 6: Pras]
We sing Amazing Grace over two dollar plates
One roll, snake eyes like Jake The Snake
Many lies put up for stakes, wash our sins at the Great Lakes
You and I cannot see eye to eye, so therefore we can't relate
I'm here, when I make myself crystal clear
You fled to Cape Fear when I laced you up in Zaire
Tussle with a lasso in the Royal Rumble
Separate boys from men in the concrete jungle

[Verse 7: Busta Rhymes]
I remember when Cassius Clay flipped the script
Taking trips to Zimbabwe
Africans started calling the God, Ali Bumbaye (so bwoy)
So bright, it be the God stricken
God nutrition, lightly stricken (ha)
Blows that feel like you was poison bitten
Ha, yo, I'm 'bout to blister you and your sister
Predicting every ass whipping before my fights my nigga
This be your last warning once you walk right past the doorman
Ali and Foreman gonna' lock ass until the morning
Marvel finances provided by Joseph Mobutu
Special guests of honour like the Archbishop Desmond Tutu
We watched the Rumble In The Jungle
To see who be the targeted uncle, to be the first to fall and fumble
'Nuff blows they getting thrown, like solid milestones
Internally shaking up niggas, imbalance your chromosones
With the force of a thousand warriors
When I bust your ass, identify me as the lord victorious

[Hook: Lauryn Hill]
Blocks on fire (You're a star)
(Blocks on fire)
Dudes getting higher (You're a star)
Robbing blue collar (You're a star)
(Yeah rob them blue collars)
Killing for a dollar (You're a star)
See people get tired (You're a star)
(Youths getting tired)
Of dealing with them liars (You're a star)
(We're dealing with too many liars)
From Brooklyn to Zaire (You're a star)
We need a ghetto Messiah

[Intro]
Haha
What is an MC, if he can't rap?
What is a DJ if he can't scratch?
Don't worry about a thing 'cause my niggas goin' do it all just like that

[Pre-Hook: Snoop Dogg]
Boom, boom, boom— boom
Ahhh, bend over, bend over
Boom, boom, boom— boom
Ahhh, bend over, bend over
Boom, boom, boom— boom
Ahhh, bend over, bend over
Boom, boom, boom— boom
Ahhh, bend over, bend over

[Verse 1: Bad Azz]
Indeed I am flossy like gangsta shit
I got pounds of weed and keys sittin' on G's
Catch a breeze, when I ride by high sittin' on 'Tonas
Tearin' up spots and blocks in my hood ain't got no corners
'Cause we done chipped 'em all off a prop abuse
Bustin' rocks and Glocks, and getting ghost from the police
No peace so, he gets served with no concern
To who gets burned, and one day they'll learn
Not to be fuckin' with the nigga, buckin' with the trigger
Nothin' you could figure could help you escape
From this mind state, that I create young nigga
Yeah! And it's just like that

[Hook: Snoop Dogg]
L.B.C. out the moon and my speakers go
Boom, boom, boom— boom
My rearview mirror's vibrating, 'cause my speakers go
Boom, boom, boom— boom
L.B.C. out the moon and my speakers go
Boom, boom, boom— boom
And my rearview mirror's vibrating, 'cause my speakers go
Boom, boom, boom

[Verse 2: Soopafly]
Now I rock, some talk it don't stop
When that funk shit drops to make your shit go pop
Now let that beat ride in your g ride
We gettin' me right hittin' with that Dogg Pound "C" life
Now it's I, with that stylish flow
So niggas step back, or heads get cracked, and I won't let back
Who comin' with that gangsta shit
The shit that only gangsta's get gangsta with
Now quick to bust your ass like the cop
Waitin', debatin' for my ass to flip flop but I don't flop
I just flip the script when I did for set-trip
Keep the clip close to my hip, and don't say shit
When I blast I-I done told your ass
Little fuck 'em down, Dogg Pound, motherfucka

[Hook: Snoop Dogg]
Boom, and you know that
D.P.G's out the moon, and my speakers go
Boom, boom, boom— boom
My rearview mirror's vibrating, and my speakers go
Boom, boom, boom— boom
Boom, and you know that
D.P.G's out the moon, and my speakers go
Boom, boom, boom— boom
My rearview mirror's vibrating, and my speakers go
Boom, boom, boom— boom
Boom

[Verse 3: Techniec]
From the archives, I arise off the long beach streets
Will be complete 'til the 

[?] done to all that competes
Don't be alarmed as I swarm through, I warned you
And your crew see wax so, what's that? A known fact
Battle that the habitat our men is deadly
You can get diluted or depends on where your head be
Strivin' for what you're in for
And for your info mo' flow
Than the tightest nigga flowed in '94
So, stand and deliver, watch nigga's shiver
Quiver in they boots, as I mob with my troops
Through the east where the phonies get deleted
Be seated, and all the G's I know stay heated

[Verse 4: Tray Deee]
See I was born to be known as a thug and thief
So anyone with beef I got to slug to sleep, peep
I'm not no nigga figure he can come up
By gettin' a job so I mob, not givin' a fuck
I'm the drama mama warned all they kids about
I mash up strapped get my dibs an' out
Hustler mustn't trustin' a gat to keep me fat
Seekin' victims, pick 'em and then I stick them in track
My heat black, with the serial number scratched out
Don't wear a glass shield, but you still be assed out
I'm Mr. Tray Deee and since they say "G" as my title
My method mainly homicidal

[Hook: Snoop Dogg]
Boom, yeah, and you know that
2-1 out the moon and my speakers go
Boom, boom, boom— boom
My rearview mirror vibrating, 'cause my speakers go
Boom, boom, boom— boom
Boom, yeah, and you know that
2-1 out the moon and my speakers go
Boom, boom, boom— boom
My rearview mirror vibrating, 'cause my speakers go
Boom, boom, boom— boom

[Verse 5: 2Pac]
Could it be, my history livin' G like
Enemies that wanna see me, what it be like?
Picture me practicin' perfection, now hit the deck
Playa haters gettin' chin checked when I hit the set
Watch how they fall, when I buck 'em all
We outlaw, westside playa, touch 'em all
I buck 'em all then remain ballin'
Out the moon with my Glock cocked shot callin'
Brothers fall then they crawl, and they beg for they life
Should've never tried to rush me, you're dead here tonight
It's Thug Life
Go tell them bustas up at Bad Boy Records
Fat tricks got a big mouth, must've better check it
I can see it plain as day, this game I play wide open
I pull the trigger, dead figure with his eyes open
His pride broken, I tried smokin' but bailed out
Soon as they left me at the jailhouse
Mobbin' in my—

[Hook: Snoop Dogg]
Yeah, and you know that
Death Row out the moon and my speakers go
Boom, boom, boom— boom
Outlaw out the moon and my speakers go
Boom, boom, boom— boom
My rearview mirrors vibrating and my speakers go
D.P.G. out the moon baby baby

[Beyonce']
You know you really, really, really, really
Want to be with me
So why don't you stop beating around the bush
And come and give it to me
Derek we can make beautiful music together
If you only stop resisting the only woman that you really want
And its not wifey

[Mekhi]
Hey! You're real social
I don't like the way you're looking
Don't get too close
I'm about to take you down to booking

[Beyonce']
C'mon and touch me D I know you want to

[Mekhi]
Look, I only need your prints
Don't really care about your frontal

[Beyonce']
I don't see me living another day
Without your tender kisses
Why don't we retire to the room
Put on some Luther, light some incents
Get to know one another just a little better
Than we do now

[Mekhi]
You trying to act like I'm not a cop

[Beyonce']
You can bring the cuffs, if you would like to
If that's your style

[Mekhi]
Looks let's get it straight, you cease and disist
I got some platinum bracelets
I'm about to squeeze on ya wrists

[Beyonce']
But you don't understand the way that I feel
The pain I could heal

[Mekhi]
I could lose my job for this
There is no way we could chill

[Beyonce']
So why you bring me this far
Now let's try to be real
Cause only time will reveal
If you still playing the field
Every second that you stay is like an hour we will
I got a couple days to kill
Either you down or you peel

I don't want anything without you in my life
You are my baby
Why don't you forget about your girl
And say you want me as your lady
Get to know one another just a little better
Than we do now
Give in to everything you're feeling that's surprising
Let's make love now

[Mekhi]
Nah, I don't think so
Your body is like weed smoke though
Light-headed, feel ya eyes saying please don't go

[Beyonce']
It ain't about getting locked
Cause it's your steeze I need
My heart don't lie, come over D and feel my beat

[Mekhi]
Oh no! Cause I can see your skin is soft
You know, but I dont wanna pay the cost to be with you

[Beyonce']
You can't deny your feelings for us
You know it's true

[Mekhi]
I gotta go, but really now I'm feeling you
I wanna do it, but I don't
You know, I'd feel your thigh, but I'm so full of decency

[Beyonce']
Go with your instincts and I'm sure it leads to me
There's only moments to see if it is to be...

[Intro]
Look, if you had, one shot
To sit on your lazy butt, and watch all the TV you ever wanted
Until your brain turned to mush, would you go for it
Or just let it slip?
Yo

[Verse 1]
Remote is ready, eyes wide, palms are sweaty
There's Flintstones on the TV already, Wilma and Betty
No virgin to channel surfin', and I'm HD ready
So I flip, garbage is all I'm getting
There's Simon Cowell, who folks wanna disembowel
He opens his mouth, always says something foul
They're dying wow, wannabes are crying now
He votes 'em out, time to throw in the towel
Shows based on reality, oh the humanity
Oh, Ozzy's family sure loves profanity
Woah, the insanity, oh, dogs that crap and pee
Home of depravity? No, they live happily
Yo, plus Da Ali G Show, and Celebrity Mole
Oh there's Anna Nicole, she's scarin' me
Look, Ma — No cavities! Oh, it's a station break
Better go out to the kitchen and microwave something

[Chorus]
You're gonna lose your mind watching TV
They told me, they'd scold me, but I'd still tune into every show
My cable gets C-SPAN, TVLand, and HBO
The Travel Channel, Discovery and Lifetime
You're gonna lose your mind watching TV
They told me, cajoled me, "Turn off those music videos!"
I'm gonna watch C-SPAN, TVLand, and HBO
The History Channel, and QVC, and Lifetime
You're gonna...

[Verse 2]
My butt is aching, as I watch NASCAR racing
That show about undertaking, Larry King
To 24, to Law & Order
The Weather Channel's boring like 60 Minutes
Ancient reporters, next up on E! True Hollywood Story
The rise and decline of twelve actors named Corey
Shows for next fall, they've already been namin'
CSI: Boise, and Touched by an Uncle
Both sound pretty lame, and
So does Everybody Tolerates Raymond
And King of Queens jumped the shark the first minute
I can't believe Richard Simmons ain't in it
I move right on to 8 Simple Rules For Dating My Teenage Daughter
Then I bet I watch The Bachelorette
Followed by Welcome Back, Kotter
And The Muppet Show where they go "Mahna Mahna"

[Chorus]
You're gonna lose your mind watching TV
They told me, they'd scold me, but I'd still tune into every show (oh)
My cable gets C-SPAN, TVLand, and HBO
The Disney Channel and A&E and Lifetime
You're gonna lose your mind watching TV
They told me, cajoled me, but I still love Lisa Kudrow (oh)
I'm lookin at C-SPAN, TVLand, and HBO
The Playboy Channel, and Court TV, and Lifetime
You're gonna...

[Verse 3]
Never miss Melrose Place or Lost in Space
I've seen each Amazing Race and Without a Trace
But I only watched Will & Grace, one time, one day
Wish I hadn't, 'cause TiVo now thinks I'm gay
Oh, and Fear Factor, I watched maybe a half hour
After that, felt like I needed a long shower
Network execs with naked ambition
Next week on FOX watch lions eat Christians
Like to tie up those programming planners
Make them watch all that junk until their heads explode just like Scanners
Leech-covered, grub-eating fools on Survivor
Look, there's James Lipton discussing the oeuvre
Of Mr. Rob Schneider
And there's Gilligan and SpongeBob
Plus there's MacGyver
And Jay Leno has got Madonna
Hey, there's Luke Perry
And a special all Pig Latin episode of Drew Carey
Wanna turn on ET
'Cause I'm a gossip freak
And I gotta know who J-Lo is marrying this week
A 30-second spot
Welcome back to Are You Hot?
I was planning on recording The Sopranos — I forgot
I love shows with or without a plot
I'll stare 'til my legs are numb, my eyes bloodshot
Because I only have got one brain to rot
I'm gonna spend my life watching television a lot

[Chorus]
You're gonna lose your mind watching TV
They told me, they'd scold me, but I still tune into every show (oh)
My cable gets C-SPAN, TVLand, and HBO
The Sci-Fi Channel and AMC and Lifetime
You're gonna lose your mind watching TV
They told me, cajoled me, turn off that Oprah Winfrey show (oh)
I got it on C-SPAN, TVLand, and HBO
The Learning Channel and MTV and Lifetime
You're gonna...

[Outro]
You can watch anything you want to, man
It's all about the Pentiums, baby
Uhh, uh-huh, yeah
Uhh, uh-huh, yeah
It's all about the Pentiums, baby
It's all about the Pentiums, baby
It's all about the Pentiums!
It's all about the Pentiums!
(Yeah!!)

What y'all wanna do?
Wanna be hackers? Code crackers? Slackers
Wastin' time with all the chatroom yakkers?
9 to 5, chillin' at Hewlett Packard?
Workin' at a desk with a dumb little placard?
Yeah, payin' the bills with my mad programming skills
Defraggin' my hard drive for thrills
I got me a hundred gigabytes of RAM
I never feed trolls and I don't read spam
Installed a T1 line in my house
Always at my PC, double-clickin' on my mizouse
Upgrade my system at least twice a day
I'm strictly plug-and-play, I ain't afraid of Y2K
I'm down with Bill Gates, I call him Money for short
I phone him up at home and I make him do my tech support
It's all about the Pentiums, what?
You gotta be the dumbest newbie I've ever seen
You've got white-out all over your screen
You think your Commodore 64 is really neato
What kinda chip you got in there, a Dorito?
You're usin' a 286? Don't make me laugh
Your Windows boots up in what, a day and a half?
You could back up your whole hard drive on a floppy diskette
You're the biggest joke on the Internet
Your database is a disaster
You're waxin' your modem, tryin' to make it go faster
Hey fella, I bet you're still livin' in your parents' cellar
Downloadin' pictures of Sarah Michelle Gellar
And postin' "Me too!" like some brain-dead AOL-er
I should do the world a favor and cap you like Old Yeller
You're just about as useless as JPEGs to Helen Keller
It's all about the Pentiums!
It's all about the Pentiums!
It's all about the Pentiums!
It's all about the Pentiums!

Now, what y'all wanna do?
Wanna be hackers? Code crackers? Slackers
Wastin' time with all the chatroom yakkers?
9 to 5, chillin' at Hewlett Packard?

Uh, uh, loggin' in now
Wanna run wit my crew, hah?
Rule cyberspace and crunch numbers like I do?
They call me the king of the spreadsheets
Got'em all printed out on my bedsheets
My new computer's got the clocks, it rocks
But it was obsolete before I opened the box
You say you've had your desktop for over a week?
Throw that junk away, man, it's an antique!

Your laptop is a month old? Well, that's great
If you could use a nice, heavy paperweight
My digital media is write-protected
Every file inspected, no viruses detected
I beta tested every operating system
Gave props to some, and others? I dissed'em
While your computer's crashin', mine's multitaskin'
It does all my work without me even askin'
Got a flat-screen monitor, 40" wide
I believe that yours says, "Etch-A-Sketch" on the side
In a 32-bit world, you're a 2-bit user
You've got your own newsgroup, alt.total-loser
Your motherboard melts when you try to send a fax
Where'd you get your CPU, in a box of Cracker Jacks?
Play me online? Well, you know that I'll beat you
If I ever meet you I'll control-alt-delete you
What?
It's all about the Pentiums!
It's all about the Pentiums!
It's all about the Pentiums!
It's all about the Pentiums!

What y'all wanna do?
Wanna be hackers? Code crackers? Slackers
Wastin' time with all the chatroom yakkers?
9 to 5, chillin' at Hewlett Packard?
What?
It's rotten, so rotten here
So rotten, ah, oh!

[Verse 1]
It was like, the last day before trash day (uh)
My place was getting kinda nasty (uh)
Even know the garbage I knew would reek (ya know)
Thought that I could leave it for one more week
Then I, I'm taking, birthday cake (oh) and chile and greasy old bacon
Throw in all on top of the mess I've been making
Wife so mad she start to shaking
Leaky bag and now the girl is gagging
She's nagging, I need you to get that stuff of the kitchen floor (oh)
Is that too much to ask you for (oh)
But I see no reason why, I can't let a few more weeks go by (uh uh)
And that garbage is piled up high
And buddy you should see the flies
I said..

[Hook]
There something rotten here (say what)
You better hold your nose (oh)
Hey you disgusting slob, you better take the trash out

Boy there's a lot in here (a lot)
And everyday it grows (oh)
(Hey you disgusting slob, you better take the trash out)
Uh uh uh, make you
Wanna throw up

[Verse 2]
Look at all this garbage that I keep generating (come on)
I sit around all day and watch it biodegrading
Bet there's a hundred health codes that I'm violating
Even my dog passed out and needed resuscitating
You won't believe it, take a whiff of that aroma
Sure to put you in a coma
It's so messy can't find my toenail clippers
It's so bad the roaches wearing slippers
Worn, sweaty clothes, pile up in this joint
Stand up by themselves at this point
It's so filthy now baby I can't lie
I wipe my feet before I go outside
I wonder what crawled in here and died
Ya know, walking around barefoot I'd be terrified
But it gives me stuff to talk about with my friends, like
Hey I think them rats getting big (oh)

[Hook]
There's something rotten here (say what)
You better hold your nose (oh)
(Hey you disgusting slob, you better take the trash out) uh uh uh uh, oh
Look what we got in here (now what)
Let's watch it decompose (oh)
(Hey you disgusting slob, you better take the trash out)uh uh uh uh, make
You wanna throw up

[Bridge]
With a little bit a (vomiting noise)
And a little bit a (vomiting noise)
Make me wanna throw up
It makes you wanna (vomiting noise)
Just makes you wanna (vomiting noise)
Oh

[Verse 3]
Some Lysol, some Comet
I got a mop and it's got your name on it
(What?) I'm just kidding doggone it
(Oh) Unless your gonna do it
Careful not to (ay) breathe the fumes
The garbage piles are going all the way to the bathroom
Turn into toxic waste sometime this afternoon
Better get a Hazmat suit and a push broom
Oh

[Hook]
There's something rotten here (say what)
You better hold your nose (oh)
(Hey you disgusting slob, you better take the trash out)uh uh uh uh, oh
It's kinda pot in here (tear pot)
Bring out the fire hose (oh)
(Hey you disgusting slob, you better take the trash out)uh uh uh uh, make
You wanna throw up

[Ending]
With a little bit a
And a little bit a
Make me wanna throw up
Give a little bit a
And a tiny bit a
Make you wanna throw up
Mix a little bit a
With a molecule of a
Make me wanna throw up
It makes me wanna
Just makes me wanna
Oh!

Hottest shorty I know, if you had some lipo'
You could be second-runner-up Miss Ohio
Seven dollar bills rolled up inside my plastic billfold
Buy you a bagel even if it isn't day old
And you never ever gotta wear your sister's old clothes
As long as I'm still assistant manager at Kinko's
Cut your hair with scissors and a soup bowl
You ain't got to pay me, that's the way that I roll
My chick can have want she wants
At Wal*Mart she can pick out anything she want
I know girl you ain't never had a man like that
Who doesn't make you buy generic brand like that
Yeah you like my Hyundai, see my Hyundai
I can take you to see your cousin Phil next Sunday
But that's kind of far and I'm not made of cash
Do you think you could chip in for gas?

It's all about the Washingtons, that's right
You want White Castle, need White Castle
Long as you got me it won't be no hassle
You want it, we'll get it, just don't be a hater
If I grab a bunch of napkins for later

[Hook Four]
Thrift store jeans on sale half-price
The underwear at Goodwill is nice
And baby you can have whatever you like (if you like)
I said you can have whatever you like (if you like)
Yeah, yeah
Baby, I can give you anything you please
Even share my government cheese
And baby you can have as much as you like (if you like)
I said you can have as much as you like (if you like)
Yeah, yeah

[Intro: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
From the top to the bottom (Bottom to top I stop)
At the core, I've forgotten (In the middle of my thoughts)
Taken far from my safety (The picture's there)
The memory won't escape me

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
We're stuck in a place so dark, you can hardly see
A manner of matter that splits with the words I breathe
And as the rain drips acidic questions around me
I block out the sight of the powers that be
And duck away into the darkness, time's up
I wind up in a rusted world with eyes shut
So tight that it blurs into the world of pretend
And the eyes ease open and it's dark again

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
From the top to the bottom (Bottom to top I stop)
At the core, I've forgotten (In the middle of my thoughts)
Taken far from my safety (The picture's there)
The memory won't escape me (But why should I care)

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
In the memory, you'll find me
Eyes burning up
The darkness holding me tightly
Until the sun rises up

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
Listen to the sound, dizzy from the ups and downs
And nauseated by the polluted rot that's all around
Watching the wheels of cars that pass
I look past to the last of the light and the long shadows it casts
A window grows, captures the eye
And cries out yellow light as it passes me by
And a young, shadowy figure sits in front of a box
Inside a building of rock with antennas on top
Now, nothing can stop in this land of the pain
The sane lose, not knowing they were part of the game
And while the insides change, the box stays the same
And the figure inside could bear anybody's name
The memories I keep are from a time like then
I put on my paper so I could come back to them
Someday, I'm hoping to close my eyes and pretend
That this crumpled up paper can be perfect again

[Pre-Chorus: Chali 2Na & Mike Shinoda]
Yo, from the top to the bottom (Bottom to top I stop)
At the core, I've forgotten (In the middle of my thoughts)
Taken far from my safety (The picture's there)
The memory won't escape me

[Verse 3: Chali 2Na]
I'm here at this podium talking, the ceremonial offerings
Dedicated to urban dysfunctional offspring (What's happening?)
City governments are eternally napping
Trapped in greedy covenants, causing urban collapse
And bullets that scar souls with dark holes
Get more than your car stole
Some hearts be blacker than charcoal (For real)
This society's deprivation depends
Not on our differences, but the separation within
No reparation is made, limited aid on minimum wage
Living in a tenement cage where rent isn't paid
Tragedy within a parade
The darkness overspreads like a permanent plague
I'm the forgotten

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
In the memory you'll find me
Eyes burning up
The darkness holding me tightly
Until the sun rises up

[Intro: Motion Man]
Hey, yo, when this first started off it was just Linkin Park
And then in the middle came Motion Man
And at the end of it all, it was KutMasta Kurt with a remix

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
When I was obsessed with time
All I know, time was just slipping away
And I watched it count down to the end of the day
Watched it watch me and the words that I say
The echo of the clock rhythm in my veins
I know that I didn't look out below
When I watched the time go right out the window
Trying to grab hold, trying not to watch
I wasted it all on the hands of the clock
But in the end, no matter what I pretend
The journey is more important than the end or the start
And what it meant to me will eventually be a memory
Of a time when I tried so hard

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter

[Verse 2: Motion Man]
Ay, yo, one thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind
I designed this rhyme to explain in due time
All I know, hah, I so-socialize
Like the host of the party
I spoke, shaked, and made eye contact
Partied and toasted strong, all that
Northeast, Southwest coast
I'm staring out the window
No opportunity to mingle
I tried to sew it up, you weaken your system
And had to throw it up
I brought you back into things
Like imaginary man of your dreams
You'd always seem to make it worth it
I pig-skin, I never nerf it
You felt leather, never pleather
Real bringing the pleasure
By any means, it means I'm leaving your team
Hell of a team, man, it seems but I tried so hard

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter

[Interlude: Kutmasta Kurt (scratching)]

[Verse 3: Mike Shinoda]
One thing, I don't know how
It doesn't even matter when you look at it now
'Cause when I designed this rhyme
I was scared of it all, scared to fall
And hadn't even tried to crawl
But I was forced to run, with you mocking me
Stopping me, backstabbing me constantly
Remembering all the times you fought with me
Watch the clock now, chock full of hypocrisy
But now your mouth wishes it could inhale
Every single little thing you said to make things fail
Every single word you sputtered just to get your piece
But it really doesn't matter to me
'Cause from the start to the end, no matter what I pretend
The journey is more important than the end or the start
And what it meant to me will eventually be a memory
Of a time when I tried so hard

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter

[Outro: Chester Bennington]
In the end

[Intro: Lee Cadena, Chester Bennington, Mike Shinoda]
"You know what I mean?
You could put a label on a life
Put a label on a lifestyle." (Sometimes…)
"You know, put a label on how you wake up every morning
And go to bed at night." (Hybrid)

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
I've been diggin' into crates, ever since I was livin' in space
Before the rat race, before monkeys had human traits
I mastered numerology and big bang theology
Performed lobotomies with telekinetic psychology

Invented the mic so I could start blessin' it
Chin-checkin' kids to make my point like an impressionist
Many men have tried to shake us
But I twist mic cords to double-helixes
And show them what I'm made of

I buckle knees like leg braces
Cast a spell of instrumental-ness on all of you MCs who hate us
So you can try on, leave you without a shoulder to cry on
From now to infinity, let icons be bygones
I firebomb, ghostly notes haunt this
I tried threats, but moved on to a promise
I stomp sh-, with or without an accomplice
And run the gauntlet with whoever that wants this

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda, Chester Bennington]
(High voltage) This is the unforgettable sound
(High voltage) Bringin' you up and takin' you down
(High voltage) Comin' at you from every side
(High voltage) Makin' the rhythm and rhyme collide

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
(Akira)
I put a kick in the backbones of clones with microphones
Never satisfy my rhyme jones
Sprayin' bright day over what you might say
My blood type's Krylon, Technicolor Type-A

On highways, bright with road rage
Pages of wind in cages of tin that bounce all around
(Surround sound) Devouring the scene
Subliminal gangrene paintings, overall the same thing

Sing-song karaoke copy bull-
Break bones verbally with sticks-and-stone tactics
Fourth dimension combat convention
Write rhymes at ease while the track stands at attention
Meant to put you away with a pencil pistol official
Sixteen-line, the rhyme missile
While you risk your all, I pick out all your flaws
Spittin' rah blah blah blah, you can say you saw

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda, Chester Bennington]
(High voltage) This is the unforgettable sound
(High voltage) Bringin' you up and takin' you down

"And like the rock and rap, you know what I mean?
People actin' like, you know, "Wow, that's a new invention!"
That sh- ain't new
We're constantly evolving
It is constantly changing." (Sometimes)
"There's a lot of change
Everybody's always tryna to put labels on…
There ain't no label for this shit
They always gonna try to put a label on it
Try to create somethin' so they could water it down"

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
Sometimes, I feel like a prophet
Misunderstood, under the gun like a new disease
Sometimes, I feel like a prophet
Misunderstood, under the gun like a new disease

Who's the man demanding you hand over your Land Rover?
No man's bolder than Pharoahe, when he jams, your plan's over
I inflict sclerosis, the most ferocious
When I spy, my third eye's extremely high voltage
That's why I need ruby quartz glasses
'Cause when I glance there's a chance that I might blast the masses
Subliminals, transmitted through piano
Integrated in flow, calculated in nano
I use skills when I need, please heed the rhyme I heal
When I bleed when I proceed through time
I walk through walls and inanimate obstacles
By inducing a reduction of cells and molecules
I bring the knowledge, you swallow a steak, that's a hologram
I boxed your head, fattened your lip like Collagen
A telepath, deliver verses with no postage
Pharoahe Monch, Mike Shinoda, we high voltage

Think of many episodes I swung in Lincoln Park

[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
Just because I'm losing
Doesn't mean I'm lost
Doesn't mean I'll stop
Doesn't mean I'm across
Just because I'm hurting
Doesn't mean I'm hurt
Doesn’t mean I didn’t get what I deserved
No better and no worse

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I just got lost
Every river that I tried to cross
Every door I ever tried was locked
Oh and I'm just waiting 'til the shine wears off

[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
You might be a big fish
In a little pond
Doesn't mean you've won
'Cause along may come
A bigger one

[Chorus: Chris Martin + JAY-Z]
And you'll be lost
Every river that you tried to cross
Every gun you ever held went off
Oh and I'm just waiting 'til the firing stopped
Oh and I'm just waiting 'til the shine wears off
(Geah, just waiting 'til the—
Yeah, uh-huh, I gotchu, uh, yeah)

[Verse 3: JAY-Z]
With the same sword they knight you
They gon' good-night you with
Shit, that's only half if they like you
That ain't even the half what they might do
Don't believe me, ask Michael
See Martin, see Malcolm
See Biggie, see Pac, see success and its outcome
See Jesus, see Judas
See Caesar, see Brutus, see success is like suicide
Suicide, it's a suicide
If you succeed, prepare to be crucified (uh)
Media meddles, niggas sue you, you settle
Every step you take, they remind you you're ghetto
So it's tough being Bobby Brown
To be Bobby then, you have to be Bobby now
And the question is, is to have had and lost
Better than not having at all? Because I'm—

[Outro: Chris Martin]
Oh and I'm just waiting 'til the shine wears off
Oh and I'm just waiting 'til the shine wears off

[Intro: Mike Shinoda]
Come, come, come, come, coming at you
Come, coming at you, come, coming at you

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
Yo, peep the style and the kids checking for it
The number one question is "how could you ignore it?"
We drop right back in the cut over basement tracks
With raps that got you backing this up like "rewind that"
We're just rolling with the rhythm
Rise from the ashes of stylistic division
With these non-stop lyrics of life living
Not to be forgotten, but still unforgiven
But in the meantime, there are those
Who wanna talk this and that, so I suppose
That it gets to a point where feelings gotta get hurt
And get dirty with the people spreading the dirt, it ​goes

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
Try to give you warning, but everyone ignores me
Told you everything loud and clear, but nobody's listening
Call to you so clearly, but you don't want to hear me
Told you everything loud and clear, but nobody's listening

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
I got a heart full of pain, head full of stress
Handful of anger held in my chest
And everything left's a waste of time
I hate my rhymes, but hate everyone else's more
I'm riding on the back of this pressure
Guessing that it's better I can't keep myself together
Because all of this stress gave me something to write on
The pain gave me something I could set my sights on
You never forget the blood, sweat, and tears
The uphill struggle over years, the fear
And trash-talking and the people it was to
And the people that started it, just like you

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
Try to give you warning, but everyone ignores me
Told you everything loud and clear, but nobody's listening
Call to you so clearly, but you don't want to hear me
Told you everything loud and clear, but nobody's listening

[Bridge: Mike Shinoda]
I got a heart full of pain, head full of stress
Handful of anger held in my chest
Uphill struggle, blood, sweat, and tears
Nothing to gain, everything to fear
Heart full of pain, head full of stress
Handful of anger held in my chest
Uphill struggle, blood, sweat, and tears
Nothing to gain, everything to fear
Heart full of pain...

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
Try to give you warning, but everyone ignores me
Told you everything loud and clear, but nobody's listening
Call to you so clearly, but you don't want to hear me
Told you everything loud and clear, but nobody's listening

[Breakdown: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
I got a heart full of pain, head full of stress (Nobody's listening)
Handful of anger held in my chest (Nobody's listening)
Uphill struggle, blood, sweat, and tears (Nobody's listening)
Nothing to gain, everything to fear (Nobody's listening)

[Outro: Mike Shinoda]
Come, come, come, come, coming at you
Come, coming, come, come, coming at you
Come, coming, come, come, coming at—
Come, come, come, come, coming at you from every side

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
Why does it feel like night today?
Something in here's not right today
Why am I so uptight today?
Paranoia's all I got left
I don't know what stressed me first
Or how the pressure was fed
But I know just what it feels like
To have a voice in the back of my head
Like a face that I hold inside
Face that awakes when I close my eyes
Face that watches every time I lie
Face that laughs every time I fall
And watches everything
So I know that when it's time to sink or swim
That the face inside is here in me
Right underneath my skin

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
It's like I'm paranoid, looking over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin

[Verse 2: Rasco]
Hey yo
Here we go again with the pain I feel isn't real but in my mind
I find myself in places with names but not faces
My memory races at speeds, hundred degrees
My soul, bleeds devil must have planted the seed
Now it feels like my backs against the wall I'm taking the fall
Whenever I call nobody's responding at all
But I don't know who I can trust, they screaming my name
I need somebody to help me out of the flames

[Verse 3: Planet Asia]
All I'm trying to do is just master me
All I wanna do is smoke and blast a beat
But something keeps talking to me consciously
Responsibly, it keeps haunting me
From dusk till dawn everything has something for ya
That voice inside of your head got you projecting paranoia
Cold sweat shining on your face exposing your purpose
And if I ripped off the skin I'd probably find another person
There's nothing worse than trying to bring yourself up back from the dead
So I advise you listen to that voice in the back of your head

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
It's like I'm paranoid, looking over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside is right beneath the skin
It's like I'm paranoid, looking over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin

[Interlude: Mike Shinoda]
The face inside is right beneath your skin
The face inside is right beneath your skin
The face inside is right beneath your skin
The face inside is right beneath your skin

[Bridge: Chester Bennington with Mike Shinoda]
The sun goes down
I feel the light betray me
The sun goes down (It's like I'm paranoid)
I feel the light betray me
The sun (Can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside is right beneath the skin)
It's like I'm paranoid, looking over my back
Like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside is right beneath the skin

[Outro: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
It's like I'm paranoid, looking over my back
Like a whirl whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin

[Intro: Mike Shinoda]
Yo

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
Watch as the room rocks, mentally moonwalk
Mixed Media slang bangin' in your boombox
Verbal violence, lyrical stylist
In a time when rock hip-hop rhymes are childish

You can't tempt me with rhymes that are empty
Rappin' to a beat doesn't make you an MC
With your lack of skill and facility, you're killin' me
And a DJ in the group just for credibility

I heard that some of you are gettin' help with your rhymes
You're not an MC if someone else writes your lines
Rappin' over rock doesn't make you a pioneer
'Cause rock and hip-hop have collaborated for years

But now, they're getting randomly mixed and matched up
All after a fast buck, and all the tracks suck
So how does it stack up? None of it's real
You wanna be an MC? You've gotta study the skill

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
Who can rock a rhyme like this?
Bring it to you every time like this?
Who can rock a rhyme like this?
Step, step up! Step, step up!

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda, Chester Bennington]
So, you pick up a pen and write yourself a new identity
But mentally, you don't have the hip-hop energy
With a tendency to make up stories (Bullshit)
Sounding like the only hip hop you've heard is top 40 (Top 40)

And your record company is completely missin' it
All the kids are dissin' it for not bein' legitimate
So in a battle, you can't hack it, react with wack shit
And get smacked with verbal backflips

Get your ass kicked by fabulous battle catalysts
It's taken decades for MC's to establish this
You're new to hip-hop, and welcome if you're serious
But not on the mic, leave that to the experienced

[Break: Mike Shinoda]
Using the waves of sound
The true master paralyzes his opponents
Leaving him vulnerable to attack

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
Who can rock a rhyme like this?
Bring it to you every time like this?
Who can rock a rhyme like this?
Step, step up! Step, step up!
Who can rock a rhyme like this?
Bring it to you every time like this?
Who can rock a rhyme like this?
Step, step up! Step, step up! Step up!

[Bridge: Mike Shinoda]
After years of pain-staking research by the world's leading sound scientists
We here at the Sound Institute have invented a reliable audio weapons system
Actual movement of musical sound in space used to carefully attack and neutralize the cellular structure of the human body
And the question must be asked…

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
Who can rock a rhyme like this?
Bring it to you every time like this?
Who can rock a rhyme like this?
Step, step up! Step, step up!
Who can rock a rhyme like this?
Bring it to you every time like this?
Who can rock a rhyme like this?
Step, step up! Step, step up!

Wasn't that fun? Let's try something else

[Verse: Black Thought]
Forty-five caliber killer, but out of the Phila-
-dela thriller show you brothers how you not a guerilla
Smooth talkin', fully automatic weapon concealer
Taste thriller, great fillers, hit 'em with the bounce filler
Filthy stinkin', standin' on solid ground and still be sinkin'
Submergin' in the Parks and still be Linkin
Pluck beef when it starts, but fuck your thinkin'
It's not a mirage
I rip the motherfuckin' track up from out the garage
Where I'm hip to the duck, but it's hard to dodge
In the back of that spine where my darts is lodged
Thought flippin' straight up, rippin' apart your squad
X-Ecutioner style, that cuts and blends
Like a syringe, we bangin' you in each of your limbs
See me comin' through your party hard, without no bodyguard
Smokin' somethin', stompin' on each of your Timbs
I'm the B to the L, the A, the C-King (Uh-huh)
And when it comes to plannin' the Thought, keep thinkin' that

[Outro: Chester Bennington]
Shut up!
Shut up!
Shut up!
Shut up!
Shut up!
Shut up!
Shut up!
Shut up!

You ain't done nuthin for me
You are disgusting me

Dead and stuffy in the face
Look who's standing, if you please (Wyclef)
Try to bring me to my knees

Too bad, too bad about it
Why don't you scream and shout it?
Too bad, too bad about it
Why don't you just scream and shout it?
Too bad too bad about it
Why don't you scream and shout it?
Too bad too bad about it
Why don't you just scream and shout it?

[Verse 2: John Forte]
You say John Forte
Like the major holiday
I met with MJ on the ranch of seven fey
Flowin' to them g six, that's how you saw them remix
Blast off a cramp while I laugh at yo re-six
T double O B A to the D
You just double A
Small town battery
Buffet
You can't eat of them floor we bend
Word like the power lunch of the four seasons
Too bad

[Verse 3: Michael]
What do you want from me?
What do you want from me?
Tired of you hunting me
Yeah yeah
You aiming just for me
You are disgusting me
You got blood lust for me
But too bad too bad
Look who got slapped in the face (Refugee Camp)
It's dead and stuffy in the place
I'm right back where I wanna be
I'm standing though you're kicking me

[Chorus: Michael]
Too bad too bad about it
Why don't you scream and shout it
Too bad too bad about it
Why don't you scream and shout it
Too bad too bad about it
Why don't you scream and shout it
Too bad too bad about it
Why don't you scream and shout it

I'm right back where I wanna be

[Intro]
I wake up my girl, get me mad right
The king of rock come on and there is none higher
Sucker MC's should call me sire
Standin' out here
Talking, broking, never joking, smoking
Up on the corner
Do what they wanna
Get outta here
Hasta la vista

[Verse 1: Michael Jackson]
Told me that you're doing wrong
Word out shocking all along
Cryin' wolf ain't like a man
Throwing rocks to hide your hands
You ain't done enough for me
You ain't done nuthin for me
You are disgusting me
Yeah yeah
You aiming just for me
You are disgusting me
Just want your cut from me
But too bad, too bad
Look who just walked in the place
Dead and stuffy in the face
Look who's standing, if you please
Try to bring me to my knees

[Chorus: Michael Jackson]
Too bad, too bad about it
Why don't you scream and shout it?
Too bad, too bad about it
Why don't you just scream and shout it?
Too bad too bad about it
Why don't you scream and shout it?
Too bad too bad about it
Why don't you just scream and shout it?

[Verse 2: Michael Jackson]
Hell all up in Hollywood
Sayin' that you got it good
Creepin' from another hole
Tell her what somebody told
What do you want from me
What do you want from me
Tired of you hunting me
Yeah yeah
You aiming just for me
You are disgusting me
You got blood lust for me
But too bad too bad
Look who got slapped in the face
It's dead and stuffy in the place
I'm right back where I wanna be
I'm standing though you're kicking me

[Chorus: Michael Jackson]
Too bad too bad about it
Why don't you scream and shout it
Too bad too bad about it
Why don't you scream and shout it
Too bad too bad about it
Why don't you scream and shout it
Too bad too bad about it
Why don't you scream and shout it
Too bad too bad about it
Why don't you scream and shout it
Too bad too bad about it
Why don't you scream and shout it
Too bad too bad about it
Why don't you scream and shout it
Too bad too bad about it
Why don't you scream and shout it

[Verse 3: Shaquille O'Neal]
Life's about a dream
I'm really undefeated when MJ's on my team
Theme
Reality brings forth realism
It's the man of steel
Organism, T.W.I.S.M
I'm full of trisim
Take charge like manila
9-5 Shaq represent with the thriller
Grab my crotch, twist my knees, and I'm through
Mike's bad, I'm bad, who are you?

[Chorus: Michael Jackson]
Too bad too bad about it
Why don't you scream and shout it
Too bad too bad about it
Why don't you scream and shout it
Too bad too bad about it
Why don't you scream and shout it
Too bad too bad about it
Why don't you scream and shout it
Too bad too bad about it
Why don't you scream and shout it
Too bad too bad about it
Why don't you scream and shout it
Too bad too bad about it
Why don't you scream and shout it
Too bad too bad about it
Why don't you scream and shout it

[Outro: Michael Jackson]
Too bad too bad about it

[Katy Perry (MIMS in background)]
This was never the way I planned
Not my intention (Look)

[Rap Verse 1: MIMS]
Since my girl kissed a girl
I guess I can do the same thang
Call me John Witherspoon
Bedroom
Bang-bang
Me and Mrs. Jane-Jane
Watch us do our thang
They say I only name one
But they both got the same name (Same name)
They call me Big Daddy, but I ain't Cane/Kane
I got a homeless personality
I can't change
I mean I'm so on top, it's like another world
I am MIMS
A.K.A
Mr. My-Girl-Kissed-Another-Girl

[Katy Perry]
(Verse 1)
This was never the way I planned
Not my intention
I got so brave, drink in hand
Lost my discretion
It's not what
I'm used to
Just wanna try you on
I'm curious for you
Caught my attention

Chorus: Katy Perry
I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry chap stick
I kissed a girl just to try it
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it
It felt so wrong
It felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight
I kissed a girl and I liked it
I liked it

(Verse 2)
No, I don't even know your name
It doesn't matter
You're my experimental game
Just human nature
It's not what
Good girls do
Not how they should behave
My head gets so confused
Hard to obey
Repeat Chorus

Bridge: Katy Perry
Us girls, we are so magical
Soft skin, red lips, so kissable
Hard to resist, so touchable
Too good to
Deny it
Ain't no big deal, it's innocent

[Rap Verse 2: MIMS]
My Girl Gotta Girlfriend, she said she kissed a girl
Won't fill me no details, cause she don't, kiss and tell
Man, I'm in a different world
Is this heaven, is this hell
Some say I'm a lucky man like I fell into a wishing well
Even though I'm livin' well
Somethin' just ain't sittin' well
She gettin' more play than me
Every night, it's a different girl
But I don't mind it
I find it
Somethin' sort of excitin'
My girl kissed a girl, and guess what
She liked it (Liked it)
Repeat Chorus

[Intro: R Kelly, Jay Z]
Changing Faces, Jay Z, R Kelly
Uh, yeah, Jigga, uhu
Changing Faces

[Verse I: Jay Z]
How we do
Yo, all of my rhymes for, all of my days I trade
All of my dimes and all of my bad ways I fade
Killing late nights cruisin'
All you see is the brake lights
And hair blowing you know where we going
Or at the club in the rear frontin'
Poppin, droppin'
The amount some cats but will wear ain’t trying to hear nothing
Probably was wilder than Bobby are you the Whitney to get me
Hold me down and make me slow down the v twizzy
Keep the ice out the club lights change face
Get "i love wifey" on the license plates
Wait – make me think about you even when you not around
Use the bathroom, put the toilet seat back down
Cop you some sprinkles the hound with the wrinkles
If preferred his and her furs to the ankles
Keep your friends buggin' lovin' all my ways
Jigga keep you jiggy all of my days

[Pre-Hook: Changing Faces]
In the middle of the night
Got me thinkin' 'bout you babe
Got me dreamin' 'bout you baby

[Hook: Changing Faces]
All that I have
All that I have
Baby it's yours
Baby it's yours forever and ever baby
All I want is to be with you all of my days
All I want all I need
All I want is to be with you all of my days
All I want baby

[Bridge: Changing Faces]
Anything that turn you on
I'll be givin' it to you babe
You dont have to worry baby

[Hook: Changing Faces]
All that I have
All that I have
Baby it's yours
Baby it's yours forever and ever baby
All I want is to be with you all of my days
All I want all I need
All I want is to be with you all of my days
All I want baby

[Interlude: Jay Z]
Yeah ha ha, check it

[Bridge: R Kelly, Jay Z]
All I want, all I need
Is you in my life, loving me
All I want, all I need
Is you in my life (Uh huh)
Loving me

[Verse II: Jay Z]
Now we going house shoppin'
Everybody want to know the price your spouse droppin'
Keep it on the low R Kelly style it’s quite shockin'
A year ago all I did was spend nights hoppin'
In the club in search of pretty faces and nice stockings
Who would have thought i’d walk down the aisle
Rice droppin' got you a nice rock and …
Now it’s on and poppin' droppin' hotter than platinum bracelets
Jigga – R Kelly – Changing Faces
Uh

[Hook: Changing Faces]
All that I have
All that I have
Baby it's yours
Baby it's yours forever and ever baby
All I want is to be with you all of my days
All I want all I need
All I want is to be with you all of my days
All I want baby

[Intro: Jennifer Lopez, Sample & LL Cool J]
Love is life and life is living
It's very special
All my love…
Oh-oh-oh
Uh, baby, don't go
All my, all my, all my love
Baby, don't go, yeah
Very special
Baby, don't go, uh
All my love
Baby, don't go, yeah
Baby, don't go
All my, all my, all my love
I understand, just chillin'
Baby, don't go, yeah, yeah
Why you actin' like that?

[Verse 1: Jennifer Lopez & LL Cool J]
It's such a shame, but I'm leaving (Uh)
Can't take the way you mistreated me (Uh)
And it's crazy, but oh, baby (Come on, yo, uh, uh, uh)
It don't matter, whatever, don't phase me
I don't believe you wanna leave like this
I don't believe I just had my last real kiss
I do believe we'll laugh and reminisce
Wait a minute, don't bounce, baby, let's talk about this, man

[Pre-Chorus: Jennifer Lopez & LL Cool J]
Well, I'm bouncing and I'm out, son (What you want, baby?)
I gotta leave you alone (Come on now)
'Cause I'm good, holding down my spot
And I'm good reppin' the girls on the block (Don't go, baby)
And I'm good, I got this thing on lock
So without me you'll be fine, right? (Come on, baby)

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez & LL Cool J]
All my pride is all I have
Pride is what you had, baby girl, I'm what you have
You'll be needing me, but too bad
Be easy, don't make decisions when you mad
The path you chose to run alone
I know you're independent, you can make it on your own
Here with me you had a home, oh, yeah
But time is of the essence, why spend it alone? Huh

[Verse 2: Jennifer Lopez & LL Cool J]
The nights I waited up for you (Oh, boy)
Promises you made about coming through
So much time you wasted
That's why I had to replace you (Uh, uh, uh)
It makes a cat nervous, the thought of settling down
Especially me, I was creepin' all over town (Creepin')
I thought my tender touch could lock you down (Yeah)
I knew I had you, as cocky as it sounds
That's the way you used to giggle right before I put it down
It's better when you angry, come here, I'll prove it now (Come here)
Stop playing (Haha, aw), you gaming
I gotta leave you alone (What you want now?)

[Pre-Chorus: Jennifer Lopez & LL Cool J]
'Cause I'm good holding my spot
Stop acting like that
And I'm good reppin' the girls on the block
Now you know you need to stop
And I'm good, I got this thing on lock
So without me you'll be fine, right?
Here we go

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez & LL Cool J]
All my pride is all I have
Pride is what you had, baby girl, I'm what you have
You'll be needing me, but too bad
Be easy, don't make decisions when you mad
The path you chose to run alone
I know you're independent, you can make it on your own
Here with me you had a home, oh, yeah
But time is of the essence, why spend it alone? Huh

[Verse 3: LL Cool J & Jennifer Lopez]
People make mistakes to make up, to break up, to wake up
Cold and lonely, chill, baby, you know me, you love me (Oh)
I'm like your homie, instead of beefin', come hold me
I promise I'm not a phony, don't bounce, baby, console me (Come here)
Ain't nothing you can say to me that
Can change my mind, I got to let you go now (Chill, baby)
And nothing will ever be the same, so just (Yeah)
Be on your way, go ahead and do your thing now (Baby, don't go)
And there's no more to explain to me, you know (Come on, now)
I know your game and I'm not feeling what you do (Come on, now)
So I'm bouncing and I'm out, son (Don't bounce)
I gotta leave you alone, yeah, yeah (Don't bounce, don't bounce, baby)

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez & LL Cool J]
All my pride is all I have (Don't bounce, baby)
Pride is what you had, baby girl, I'm what you have
You'll be needing me, but too bad (Don't bounce, baby)
Be easy, don't make decisions when you mad (Uh)
The path you chose to run alone
I know you're independent, you can make it on your own
Here with me you had a home, oh, yeah
But time is of the essence, why spend it alone? Huh
All my pride is all I have (Don't bounce, baby)
Pride is what you had, baby girl, I'm what you have (Baby, don't go)
You'll be needing me, but too bad (You're everything to me)
Be easy, don't make decisions when you mad (You mean everything to me, baby)
The path you chose to run alone
I know you're independent, you can make it on your own (We all make mistakes, you know what I'm sayin'?)
Here with me you had a home, oh, yeah (I still love you, baby)
But time is of the essence, why spend it alone? Huh (I'll always love you, baby)

[Outro: LL Cool J]
I promise you
You know what I'm sayin'?

[Intro: Jennifer Lopez & (Nas)]
Oh yes
(Uh, this for you, girl)

[Verse 1: Nas]
Yo, I took you from the projects, put the best clothes in ya closet
Like Ginger from "Casino" and now you a pro
We was like Joe DiMaggio and Marilyn Monroe
All ya jealous girlfriends hatin' waitin'
So I put the cards in yo' hand
All I know, when Nas was yo' man
It was so real, boats and sixes
Special Japanese chefs makin' home cooked dishes
Plenty trips, invisible sets
You know what you missin'

[Verse 2: Jennifer Lopez]
It's funny 'cause for a while
I walked around with a smile
But deep inside, I could hear
Voices telling me this ain't right
Don't you know he's not for you?
I always knew what I had to do
But it's hard to get away
'Cause I love you, I just tried to stay

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
I used to say I couldn't do it but I did it (Yes, I did)
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it (Oh, yes)
Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it
And I know inside I'ma be alright (I'ma be alright)
I said I couldn't do it but I did it (Yes, I did)
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it (Oh, yes)
Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it
And that voice inside says I'm gonna be alright

[Verse 3: Jennifer Lopez]
Friends of mine say to me
Say you got control over me
You're not alone, I played my part
I saw the way you were from the start
Could I expect so much from you?
You had a girl when I first met you
Did the best that you could do
Now I realize that I can't change you

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
I used to say I couldn't do it but I did it (Ooh)
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it
Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it
And I know inside I'ma be alright (Be alright)
I said I couldn't do it but I did it (Yes, I did it)
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it (Oh, yes)
Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it
And that voice inside says I'm gonna be alright

[Bridge: Jennifer Lopez & Nas]
Said I wouldn't walk away
Some days I want to stay (Days I want to stay)
But leaving you is what I need to do (Need to do)
To be okay (I need to be okay)
I never thought it would be true (Would be true)
Be living without you (Living without you, shit 'cause life is crazy)
So now it's time for me to make that move (Uh, check it)

[Verse 4: Nas & (Jennifer Lopz)]
Yo, nobody understands me, I'm dealin' with pressure
My peoples is locked in a jail cell with no bail stressin'
Guess it's the life of a kingpin (Oh, no)
Rap Stephen King, rap bling
Like neon lights, we gon' be alright (Be alright, yes)
But it's like, you feelin' me lesser
Claim I'm actin' like a retard, right? (Oh, no)
Me and my boys, we start fights, when will I mature?
You scream I'm in the streets all night
Or where was I at, ya found light brown hairs on my hat (Said I'm gonna be alright)
I'm slow caught

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
I used to say I couldn't do it but I did it
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it
Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it
And I know inside I'ma be alright
I said I couldn't do it but I did it
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it
Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it
And that voice inside says I'm gonna be alright

[Outro: Gyptian]
I know you mean that, when you said that
You are my girl I know you talk the real truth in fact
You never lied to me, because your a lady
You are a lady that's full up of courtesy

[Intro]
Listen, dear
I realise that you've been hurt, deep
Because I've been there
But regardless to who, what, why, when and where
We're all precious in his sight
And a rose is still, and always will be, a rose

Doo doo doo doo doo doo mmm
Dooby dooby doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo mmm

[Verse 1]
There was a rose I knew, I done met her once or twice before
She was a pretty sweet thing, not the least bit insecure
Then you came with your slick game and played with her youth
Unashamed of the way you lied and played with the truth, hey hey
She never knew what hit her, oh
Steal her honey, then forget her
Now the rose is scorned
She wears a thorn, tryin' to forget about you

[Chorus]
'Cause a rose is still a rose
Baby girl, you're still a flower
He can't leave you and then take you
Make you and then break you
Darlin', you hold the power (what I am is what I am)

[Verse 2]
Now believe me when I tell you that I've been hurt myself
When he tells you that he loves you, it's you, nobody else
And now you're so tough, tryin' to wear tight clothes and things
Tossin' and flossin', tryin' to fill the void heartbreak brings
Oh, oh, yeah
When she gets nearer
She's cryin', you can't hear her
Now the rose is scorned
She wears a thorn, tryin' to forget about you

[Chorus]
'Cause a rose is still a rose
Baby girl, you're still a flower
He can't leave you and then take you
Make you and then break you
Baby girl, you hold the power (what I am is what I am)

[Chorus]
See, a rose is still a rose
Baby girl, you're still a flower
He can't leave you and then take you
Make you and then break you
Darlin', you hold the power (what I am is what I am)

[Bridge]
Let your life be in the sunshine
Not the darkness of your sorrow
You may see you're lost today
But new love will come tomorrow
Don't believe that life is over
Just because your man is gone
Girl, love yourself enough to know
That without him, your life goes on
Without him, your life goes on
And without him, your life goes on

[Chorus]
'Cause a rose is still a rose
Baby girl, you're still a flower
He can't leave you and then take you
Make you and then break you
Baby girl, you hold the power (what I am is what I am)

[Chorus]
See, a rose is still a rose
Baby girl, you're still a flower
He can't leave you and then take you
Make you and then break you
Darlin', you hold the power (what I am is what I am)

'Til I roll up on yo block
You motherfff... girl you been doing my best friend

[Hook]

[Chorus]
I been around the world
And gets nothin but love
For who I am
I thank my fans so much
Even though some may hate
Still I appreciate
All my friends and family
That kept it real with me

[R. Kelly]
I been around the world and back like whut up
East side to west side tourin like whut up
And even though the price for the house was so much
I still roll with them from the hood like whut up
Cuz when it comes to bein the realest I'm sho nuff
Im a straight up industry villain fo sho nuff
And I can't satisfy some of ya'll no matter what
And some a yall cats are soldier love
Said we livin in a cold cold world
Ain't nuttin but fake faces fake people fake friends
Said we livin in a cold cold world
Where there ain't nuttin but envy wannabees playa-hatas
Yea I know I need a hug but ya'll need a hug too
Cuz God gunna judge me the same day he judge you
And even though we have our struggles that's alright
You know we ghetto folks is gon' find a way to shine

[Chorus]

[Ja Rule]
Sometimes... this world can be so cold
When you looking through the windows of the soul
I been looking to see the truth as it unfolds
Cuz I been around this globe and back enough to know the fact
Who loves me and who loves me not
We be shit's so hot you could put it in red tops
And pump it through every hood, ghetto, and block
Until they heart stops that's why they fear for me
And I thank you for every blessing that you givin me lord
And I'm grateful for all my talent and my vocal accords
And all these hatas I keep shakin em off
Rubbin they face in fame I'm sorry I changed the game
But its mine and I can't complain
Rule and R Kelly, "Been around the world"
Puttin it on women "Bumpin n' Grindin" these bitches
But we always on time when a woman fed up
And that's luv, that's why they all fuck wit us
Cuz we...

[Chorus]

[R. Kelly]
Said my lyrics is my testimony, that's how I live
I had to get rid of a lotta fake homies, I won't forgive
You see me on T.V. sometimes not how it is
Yall gotta start learnin how to separate me from showbiz
When I'm rollin through your city, show me love
And ladies when you see your boy, gimme hug
And though I'm not conceited (right)
Its jus my space sometimes I need it (right)
Said I got so many friends in them area codes
That I hand out them tickets when it comes to my shows
Ja's lets break bread together, pray together
That we grow strong together
Its clear forever, help each other through the stormy weather
Lets hurt together, lets cry together
And even if we grow together
Then together we can make it better

[Chorus x2]

[Mary singing with words by Black Star]
Yes you are (Sometimes you just meet someone and you just completely...)
You're so beautiful
Here we go... come on
Absolutely fantastic, Now you're near
Absolutely fantastic, In my life
Fantastic, All my fears
Fantastic, Beautiful
Fantastic, Come to me
Fantastic, Now I am
Fantastic, Someone watching over me Fantastic

[Mos Def]
I dreamt that I could paint you with words
But there were no colors bright enough
Black or white enough
Blue or green enough, it didn't mean enough
You are the star that touched the earth
Shine bright for all eyes to see
Radiate and touched me
Now I'm shining like you do
It was dim before I knew you
Bright light for weeping eyes to get used to
Trust who? That's some shit I had to adjust to
Soon as you relax, they ease back and cold bust you
Love murdered in Brooklyn, sound the alarm
But you said remain calm, my passion is unarmed
I tried to practice my war-like tactics
But in the clutch of your touch, my armor just collapses
Such bliss breeds obliviousness
So recollect sweet breath still wet on my lips
My prayer's this: God protect my beloved and keep her covered From the valley to the summit like the land undiscovered
Like the stars unnumbered
You are so beautiful
Hook

[Mary]
Beautiful, now you're near in my life all my fear
Beautiful, come to me, now I am, someone watching over me

[Black Star]
Like the stars outnumbered, you are so beautiful
I do all my best so I could be true to you
Ain't nothing in this word that I wouldn't do for you
?? everything usual
Like the stars outnumbered, you are so beautiful
Where I stand, understand who I am, that makes me a man

[Talib Kweli]
You know what, they say that beauty's in the eye of the beholder (true)
So I use my third, and now our love is solid like a boulder
Want to build with you as I get older
And that's my word, sure as I stand on my ancestors' shoulders
You see through my drama and my world like a stage
Not the same years but living in the same age
Just the quality, not the quantity
Follow me, definitely
Far from probably, got to be
You and me, beautifully, thick like pieces of the man I used to be
Now I'm back cause of what you do to me
You like my reflection, better half to my whole
Like lyrics to the beat, you're the mate for my soul
The breath for my life, my sister and my lover
Used to have cold feet, now you the warmth under my covers
I can't ignore your aura cause it grabbed me by the hand
Like the moon pulled the tide and the tide pulled the sand

[Hook]
Go ahead, Mary, baby, sing your song
Oh, so beautiful
Never dreamed that it would be so beautiful
I wanna say that I love you
All the love you give, all the love you give to me
All my days and nights were lonely
And it's so beautiful
But now I have a friend that I can talk to, yeah
Boy, you're so beautiful

[Mos Def and Kweli be switching back and forth like a crossfader]
Because you're fruitful, beautiful
Smart, lovable, huggable, doable like art
Suitable to be part of the cosmos
With my eyes closed, I see you clearly
Combined lifetimes with like minds, your lovelight shines
Bright the apple of my eyesight
The tender kiss that wets my appetite
My mighty Aphrodite, the flame that ignite me
Your name just excite me
Your eyes so alive they invite me
Cause you are so beautiful
You don't even know the length I would go
To make absolutely sho' you is respected and protected
And never neglected, I hope my prayers is accepted
That you always will be watched over
And never rocked over
And if you need me to, I'll stop over
To check on you, I'd never jet on you
I know a lot of foolish cats that slept on you
But what I'm gonna do is be totally committed
If you need me I'll be hotter than a New York minute
With a hundred percentage, from the start to the finish
Cause the vibe that you give leave my soul replenished
It's a new beginning, it's a serious business
Got my heart and soul in it
It's the way that I'm living
Let it be known that it's devoted, is gon always prevail
The newly risen, truer living universal for real
It's like that y'all, and ya don't stop

[Mary]
You're the only love I know, Beautiful
You're the only love that knows, Beautiful
You're the reason why I live, Beautiful
You're the reason why I want to give you everything, Beautiful

...Since you came into my life

[Verse 1: R. Kelly]
Every day and night I pray
Love will swing you back this way
Life without you here with me
Ain't the same without you G
Baby, hear me, I never meant to hurt you
Baby, come and talk to me
Let me know what's on your mind
Every time I see you
You're running from me all the time
Baby, hear me, I never meant to hurt you
I only wanted you

[Chorus: R. Kelly]
You to be, be happy
You to have the best of things
You to be, down with me, baby
'Cause your loving is so good

[Verse 2: R. Kelly]
Giving me the run-around
Thought our love was going down
Baby, don't you know that I'm down until the day I die?
Baby, hear me, never meant to hurt you
Girl, you know I'd never do anything to hurt you
'Cause baby, I love you
Every night and day I pray your love returns
Oh, I'd give my life if it would only make you happy

[Verse 3: The Notorious B.I.G.]
Sitting, reminiscing on when you started dissing
Spitting in faces in public places
Rolex with wood faces had you tripping for months
Made some dough, did some shows, now you're starting to front
Smoking blunts on the veranda with Amanda
She's filling your head with, "He said, she said
Poppa doing this, Poppa doing that
But don't tell him I said it, cause my Jeep might get wetted"
Forget it, go on take her word like the Koran
Y'all stay friends, I stay in smoke-filled Benzes
I regret putting you on to baguettes
Honeysuckle sips, Vickie Secret pajama sets
You was a Reebok vandal, now you wear Chanel sandals
I made you, why would I play you?
Think about it while in the streets you roam
It's Dom P's and Chris'ties in the fridge when you get home

[Chorus: R. Kelly]
You to be, be happy
You to have the best of things
You to be, down with me, baby
'Cause your loving is so good

[Bridge: R. Kelly]
Every day and night I pray
Love will swing you back this way
Life without you here with me
Ain't the same without you G

[Chorus: R. Kelly]
You to be, be happy
You to have the best of things
You to be, down with me, baby
'Cause your loving is so good

[Intro/Verse 1: Eve]

Shorty got your mind tight
And everytime you see her walk by start thinkin bout your night like

And ever since the first day you seened her thinkin she the wife type
You figure she'll be perfect lovin you
Fantasize the tingle from her fingers rubbin you
Tryin to analyze the situation, you feelin crazy
Wan't it there forever what's so special 'bout this lady?
Feelin like you wanna cool back
But you know you perfect for her you got all of what them fools lack
Maybe you should make this thing happen
Raise some things swingin on the porch while the kids nappin
You got everything else you need
Snatch her up fill that empty space she can make your life complete

[Michael Jackson]
All you got ta do is walk away and pass me by
Don't acknowledge my smile, when I try to say hello, to you, yeah

Keep'n me wonderin' why-y-y, when all I can do is sigh

[Chorus: Michael Jackson]

And I wish that I could be with you tonight
(You give me)
Ah, 'cause you give me butterflies, inside inside and I

You like, wait, stop, the way that she got you hot
Excited said you be what she got
Enticin' mommy like the cream of the crop
Pressure gettin heavy 'bout to make your heart pop
All your life you waited for this chick
Nobody told you would it feel like this
Do anything just to feel that kiss
Wanna give her whatever you got
In front of millions make it known whatever the plot

[Bridge: Michael Jackson]
If you will take my hand, baby, I will show you
Guide you to the light, then
If you will be my love, baby, I will love you
Love you, 'til the end of time

[Chorus: Michael Jackson]
I just wanna touch and kiss
And I wish that I could be with you tonight (Girl, you give me)
Ah, you give me butterflies, inside inside and I

We can make an X rated version of (R. Kelly's)
Feelin' on my booty (Whoop)
Mr. Biggs, I really like how you kiss me
From my *mwah*, to my *mwah*
You really handle your biz (Whoop)
I think I like this game, this freaky, freaky game
And I wanna play again
Mr. Biggs, Queen Bee

[Chorus 2x]

Body kiss, I will kiss
Make one wish
From your *mwah*, and your *mwah*
From you *mwah*, to your *mwah*
Body kiss, I will kiss
Make one wish
From your *mwah*, and your *mwah*
From you *mwah*, to your *mwah*
Body kiss, I will kiss
Make one wish

[Intro: Britney Spears]
For whatever reason
I feel like I've been wanting you all my life
You don't understand?
I'm so glad we're at the same place at the same time
It's over now

[Verse 1: Britney Spears]
I spotted you dancing, you made all the girls stare
Those lips and your brown eyes (ooh), and the sexy hair
I should shake my thang, make the world want you
Tell your boys you'll be back, I wanna see what you can do

[Pre-Chorus 1: Britney Spears]
What would it take for you to just leave with me?
Not tryna sound conceited
But you and me were meant to be
You're a sexy guy, I'm a nice girl
Let's turn this dance floor into our own little nasty world

[Chorus 1: Britney Spears]
Boys, sometimes a girl just needs one (You know I need you)
Boys, to love her and to hold (I just want you to touch me)
Boys, and when a girl is with one
Boys, then she's in control

[Verse 2: Pharrell Williams & (Britney Spears)]
Pull the girl off the dance floor, whisper her in ear
Must've said something about me (So, what you say?)
'Cause now she's looking over here
You looking at me, with that sexy attitude
But the way your girls moving it, it puts me in the mood

[Pre-Chorus 2: Pharrell Williams & (Britney Spears)]
What would it take for you to just leave with me?
Not tryna sound conceited, but meeting you was destiny
I'm from N.E.R.D. (Ooh)
Aren't you Britney? (Don't you know?)
Let's turn this dance floor into our own little nasty thing
(Get nasty!)

[Chorus 2: Pharrell Williams & Britney Spears]
Girls, I can't speak for no one (I get nasty)
Girls, well, I need her all the time (I get nasty)
Girls, I don't know 'bout your girl (I get nasty)
Girls, but I know she's judging mine (You like that?)

[Chorus 1: Britney Spears]
Boys, sometimes a girl just needs one (I get nasty)
Boys, to love her and to hold (I get nasty)
Boys, and when a girl is with one (I get nasty)
Boys, then she's in control

[Bridge: Britney Spears]
You like that?
Here we go
Have no fear
Baby, what you waiting for?
Uh-uh
Let me see what you can do

[Chorus 1: Britney Spears]
Boys, sometimes a girl just needs one
Boys, to love her and to hold (The way that you move)
Boys, and when a girl is with one (Is kinda turning me on)
Boys, then she's in control (oh)

[Chorus 2: Pharrell Williams & Britney Spears]
Girls, I can't speak for no one
Girls, well, I need her all the time (It's just me and you, baby)
Girls, I don't know 'bout your girl
Girls, but I know she's judging mine (Get nasty)

[Outro: Britney Spears & Pharrell Williams]
Boys
Girls
Boys
Girls
Boys (Can't live with 'em)
Girls
Boys (Can't live without 'em)
Girls
Get nasty!

[Intro: Jay-Z]
I mean...
Ush, is this what it comes to man?
This how we gon' do it?
I mean, even grass grow, baby, you know?
Seeds become plants, boys become men
What we gon' do? Let's lead the way

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Uh, wrapped around all girls like Pashminas
What's my demeanor? The grass is always greener
On the other side, there's bigger lies, can't give a ring up
I couldn't give a fuck, how could I give a finger?
Let alone half bath and closets
So claustrophobic, in fear of close objects
Now it's sort of like two-car garages
It's like two broads menagin', you're the best, mama

[Verse 2: Usher]
Is there any chance that you remember me being more than just a horrible man?
And would you consider pulling this trigger and taking a second shot at romance? Aw baby
I groomed the days when you were my girl
And I was your man, though I took you for granted
But it wasn't 'til now I see...

[Pre-Chorus: Usher]
How much I missed you
Girl, I'm sorry that I ran the streets acting like a damn fool
But for once, here goes the truth
I can't be fake, I can't be phony
Acting all hard, that's for homies that's lonely
I try to flex, but I confess
That when you left, you took the very best thing

[Chorus: Usher]
The best thing that ever happened to me
You took the best thing
The best thing that I ever seen
You took the best thing
The best thing that I ever had
And now all I feel is stress
'Cause, baby, when you left, you took the very best

[Verse 3: Usher]
Remember Mimi or Vita? Remember Iesha or Eva? (I ain't got 'em no more)
Hey, it's for Naomi and Jenny, was the same outcome as Chilli
(Girl, I let 'em all go)
Oooh, no more tricking and kissing miscellaneous chicks acting like a jerk
Woman, I been to church and I talked to the bishop
And he wanted me to share this with you

[Pre-Chorus: Usher]
How much I missed you
I'm so sorry that I ran the streets acting like a damn fool
But for once, here goes the truth
I can't be fake, I can't be phony
Acting all hard, that's for homies that's lonely
I try to flex, but I confess
That when you left, you took the very best thing

[Chorus: Usher]
The best thing that ever happened to me
You took the best thing
The best thing that I ever seen
You took the best thing
The best thing that I ever had
And now all I feel is stress
'Cause, baby, when you left, you took the very best

[Verse 4: Jay-Z]
Momma try to told me, "Hovi Hov to slow it down
You gon' lose your best thing if you keep getting 'round"
Like Pop need a partner when you old to hold you down
Ma, forever young, was forever numb
Sorry Stacy, sorry Dawn, Amil-lion and all of them
All of them was for their time, it wasn't you, it was him
School me once, school me twice, three times, I was dumb
Now it's so plain to see to me I got the one
You're the best, mama

[Pre-Chorus: Usher]
I can't be fake, I can't be phony
Acting all hard, that's for homies that's lonely
I try to flex, but I confess
That when you left, you took the very best thing

[Chorus: Usher]
The best thing that ever happened to me
You took the best thing
The best thing that I ever seen
You took the best thing
The best thing that I ever had
And now all I feel is stress
'Cause, baby, when you left, you took the very best

[Intro: Ludacris]
Luda!
Now I may not be the worst or the best
But you gotta respect my honesty
And I may break your heart
But I don't really think there's anybody as bomb as me
So you can take this chance in the end
Everybody's gonna be wonderin' how you deal
You might say this is Ludacris
But Taio Cruz, tell her how you feel

[Verse 1: Taio Cruz]
Now listen to me, baby
Before I love and leave ya
They call me heartbreaker
I don't wanna deceive ya

[Pre-Chorus: Taio Cruz]
If you fall for me
I'm not easy to please
I might tear you apart
Told you from the start, baby, from the start

[Chorus: Taio Cruz]
I'm only gonna break break your break break your heart
I'm only gonna break break your break break your heart
I'm only gonna break break your break break your heart
I'm only gonna break break your break break your heart

[Post-Chorus: Taio Cruz]
Whoa, oh
Whoa, oh
Whoa, oh
Whoa, oh

[Verse 2: Taio Cruz]
There's not point tryin' to hide it
No point tryin' to evade it
I know I got a problem
Problem with misbehaving

[Pre-Chorus: Taio Cruz]
If you fall for me
I'm not easy to please
I might tear you apart
Told you from the start, baby, from the start

[Chorus: Taio Cruz]
I'm only gonna break break your break break your heart
I'm only gonna break break your break break your heart
I'm only gonna break break your break break your heart
I'm only gonna break break your break break your heart

[Verse 3: Ludacris]
(Thats all I'm gonna do, woman)
Listen, now I'm only gonna break your heart
And shatter and splatter it all into little itty-bitty pieces
Whether or not you get it all together
Then it's finders, keepers, and losers weepers
See, I'm not tryin' to lead you on, no, I'm only tryin' to keep it real
You might say this is Ludacris, but Taio Cruz, tell her how you feel!

[Bridge: Taio Cruz]
Hey, and I know karma's gonna get me back for bein' so cold
Hey, like a big bad wolf, I'm born to be bad and bad to the bone
Hey, if you fall for me, I'm only gonna tear you apart
Hey, told ya from the start, hey

[Chorus: Taio Cruz]
I'm only gonna break break your break break your heart
I'm only gonna break break your break break your heart
I'm only gonna break break your break break your heart
I'm only gonna break break your break break your heart

[Outro: Taio Cruz]
Whoa, oh
Whoa, oh
Whoa, oh
Whoa, oh

[Raekwon]
We used to do the smurf together and bump
Hit Macys up and do {?} all down in the trunk
Aligator blazers and three fingers, playing the boat
Holding that thang, you holding my mans
Like a westside flick with a fly shorty
A bunch of young live niggas want you but their money is corny
What it do lady' Kiss your man hand and let him through sweetie
Watch it, she got a man, it's the remix

[Mary J. Blige]
Chemistry was crazy from the get-go
Neither one of us knew why
We didn't deal nothing overnight
Cuz a love like this takes some time
People start off as a phase
Said we can't see that
Now from top to bottom
They see that we did that (yes)
It's so true that (yes)
We've been through it (yes)
We got real (cencored) (yes)
See baby we been

[Hook: Mary J. Blige]
Too strong for too long (and I can't be without you baby)
And I'll be waiting up until you get home (cus I can't sleep without you baby)
Anybody who's ever loved, ya know just what I feel
Too hard to fake it, nothing can replace it
Call the radio if you just can't be without your baby

[Mary J. Blige]
I got a question for ya
See I already know the answer
But still I wanna ask you
Would you lie' (no)
Make me cry' (no)
Do somethin' behind my back and then try to cover it up?
Well, neither would I, baby
My love is only your love (yes)
I'll be faithful (yes)
I'm for real (yes)
And with us you'll always know the deal
We've been

[Hook w/ Raekwon ad-libs]

[Raekwon]
Ayo I heard you in the hood like Hilary
Expensive boots and bags, bullets holding mad artillary
I been seen it coming like an all red, this was the date
Your whip change cus you wanna be more {?}
I blessed you with half my tolernace
Copped you the R5 and you went and crashed it up for following
And yeah, you let dons be dons
The chemistry so sincere, I'mma show and prove it's on
Fuck hanging, I need luck slangin
Plus when you got a real nigga in the cut, what, that's bangin
Kissing your head, getting bread, trying to avoid plagues
Chilling at your momma's crib, kissing they boy legs
Cus when I ain't home, you holding it
If love got it fucked up, tell the truth, ma you stole it
And don't take it personal lady, cus I can't (be without you baby)

V.A. dirty south, dirty south
This how we do what we do, man
When we do what we do
What, what
Project shit, what?

[Verse 1: Justin Timberlake]
I know you see me lookin', girl, go on and act right
A little closer, let me see you in the spotlight
Now turn around and let me see just what you curve like
Go grab your friends and y'all can come to the back, ooh
Why don't you take a sip up on this champagne?
Relax, take your coat off, and let me get your name
I love that hourglass shape you got up on that frame
I like the way you talk your game, we might be one and the same
Now I know you got a buzz off that alcohol
I got a house that can entertain all o' y'all
Maybe later on, I'll give you a phone call
About to slide out, but I'll get back at ya, ooh
And when I call, don't give me the runaround
I ain't gon' have ya try to play me like a silly clown
Don't second guess it, girl, there ain't nothin' to think about
'Cause ya got me fiendin', but girl, ya don't hear me

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake & Timbaland]
Little lady (Lady, lady)
You got me just (Screwed up)
Off of your melody
Little lady (Lady, lady)
Come on and don't (Chop me up)
Please don't make a fool of me
Little lady (Lady, lady)
You got me just (Screwed up)
Off of your melody
Easy, baby (Baby, baby)
Come on, girl, don't (Chop me up)
Please don't make a fool of me

[Verse 2: Timbaland & Justin Timberlake]
You're kinda cute, baby, are you new in town?
My name is Tim, a.k.a. Thomas Crown
I heard you're lost, do you know your way around?
If you got a problem, baby, I can hold you now (Oh)
I can be your navigator or your compass
Better yet a genie, baby, make your first wish
You the party, baby, I'm just the guest list
I think I need some Tylenol, you got me restless
So grab your friends and let's take ya back to my house
Let's watch Sex and the City or Desperate Housewives
Simon says, touch yours while you touch mine
Parental discretion is advised (Oh)
Y'all can be the star in my freaky spot light
Studio 54 if we get the props right
All we need right now is a little bit of, little bit of act right
Y'all lookin shy, but y'all act like y'all don't hear me

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake & Timbaland]
Little lady (Lady, lady)
You got me just (Screwed up)
Off of your melody
Little lady (Lady, lady)

Please don't make a fool of me
Little lady (Lady, lady)
You got me just (Screwed up)
Off of your melody
Easy, baby (Baby, baby)
Come on, girl, don't (Chop me up)
Please don't make a fool of me

[Verse 3: DJ Paul]
Yeah, see, girl, you stronger then the strongest drug I ever had
You can mix 'em all together, you still would be twice as bad
'Cause you're the worst best girlfriend I ever had
Harder to quit than cigarettes and green bags
Harder to escape than jail cells and bills
Man, ya you had me lost since the minute girl and pig tails
Like Michael Jackson, how you do me this way
Got me cryin' rivers like Timbaland and Timberlake, yeah

[Verse 4: Juicy J]
They call me Juicy J, straight up out the Three 6 Mafia
Ghetto fab player, all these freaks I'm tryna holler at ya
Quit playin' games, girl, you got my head spinnin' 'round
I ain't gon' chirp your mobile phone and chase you all over town
I just wanna pick you up and take you to a wrestling match
Is it good? Is it good? And have a lil' smack fest
So if you never call me, I'll be somewhere down in Tennessee
Washin' away my sorrows in cold cup o' Hennessy

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake & Timbaland]
Little lady (Lady, lady)
You got me just (Screwed up)
Off of your melody
Little lady (Lady, lady)
Come on and don't (Chop me up)
Please don't make a fool of me

[Intro: Jermaine Dupri]
What y'all wanna do?
What y'all wanna do?
Tell me

[Verse 1: Jermaine Dupri]
See, around here, we're just too much
We could slow down and you still couldn't catch us
My town full of heavy-hitters, bread-getters
Real fly, unforgettable-type niggas
See, all I do is keep hitting them up
Getting them up, shaking your butt, nigga, what
Lil Liberaci, can't nobody stop me
Always making moves, so you better watch me
Slide to the southside in my blue drop top, 355
Keeping it live
When you wanna make them jump, you know what to do
Call me and my crew to the rescue
Captain So So Def
We rocks the party till there's no one left
Turn your volume up a notch
And watch the ba-bomb, bump-bump-bump make your speakers pop

[Verse 2: Usher]
You never missed your water till your well runs dry
I never missed my woman till she said goodbye
Now my heart's made a change
My whole world's rearrange
And I'm ready to give you what you deserved
Baby, baby, baby, please

[Chorus: Usher]
Come back, come back
Lover, this is where you belong
In my arms, in my world
Come back, come back
Lover, this is where you belong
In my life, as my girl

[Verse 3: Usher]
The grass is greener on the other side
We take people for granted till they're out of sight
I don't think that you know how much I'm going through
I don't think that you know how much I really love you

[Bridge: Usher]
All I do, is think of you
I can't eat, can't sleep, baby it ain't hard to see (all I do)
All I do, is think of you
And you bump, diggy bump, bump, bump
Diggy, diggy, bump, bump, baby

[Chorus: Usher]
Come back, come back
Lover, this is where you belong
In my arms, in my world
Come back, come back
Lover, this is where you belong
In my life, as my girl
Come back, come back (it's not what you want, baby)
Lover, this is where you belong (but what you need, sugar, come back with me)
In my arms, in my world (satisfaction guaranteed, baby)
Come back, come back (it's not what you want, baby)
Lover, this is where you belong (but what you need, sugar, come back with me)
In my life, as my girl (satisfaction guaranteed, baby)
Come back, come back (it's not what you want, baby)
Lover, this is where you belong (but what you need, sugar, come back with me)
In my arms, in my world (satisfaction guaranteed, baby)
Come back, come back (it's not what you want, baby)
Lover, this is where you belong (but what you need, sugar, come back with me)
In my life, as my girl (satisfaction guaranteed, baby)
1 - Think you gotta keep me iced, you don't
Think I'm gonna spend your cash, I won't
Even if you were broke
My love don't cost a thing
Think I wanna drive your Benz, I don't
If I wanna floss, I got my own
Even if you were broke
My love don't cost a thing

When you rolled up in the Escalade
Saw that dub you gave to the valet
Knew that it was game when you looked at me
Pulling up your sleeve so I could see the Rollie bling
Saw you later in the corner booth
Raising up a toast so I would notice you
But you're hard to miss, think you outta know
Doesn't really matter if you're balling out of control

2 - All that matters is
That you treat me right
Give me all the things I need
That money can't buy yeah
Repeat 1

When I took a chance
Thought you'd understand
Baby credit cards aren't romance
Still you're tryna buy what's already yours
What I need from you is not available in stores
Seen a side of you that I really feel
You're doing way too much, never keep it real
If it doesn't change, gotta hit the road
Now I'm leaving, where's my keys?
I've got to go

Repeat 2

Repeat 1

A thing, a thing, a thing
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Puff Daddy]
Yeah let's go baby
Bad Boy
Ayo ma' peep this
My game's tight like the way your jeans fit
Please believe it
Yeah you independent I can see
I'm glad you got your own dough
You can spend that on me
And why not, we can stack our dough
And buy blocks
If I got you got
Watch, they hope we might slip
But we keep a tight grip
And make hits like this, holla!

[Jennifer Lopez]
You think the money that you make
Can substitute the time you take
To get the keys into my heart
Think you can win my heart
Don't know what's in my heart
I think you need to take some time
To show me that your love is true
There's more than dollar signs in you
Then you can win my heart, and get what's in my heart

[Puffy](J-Lo)
Yeah, yeah
I like this right here
Just come on, come on
Just bounce for me
Like this
Just bounce for me
Like this
Just bounce for me

Bad Boy, J-Lo

[Intro: Usher & Girl]
Hey
Hey, what's up?
That's you
Yeah listen

[Verse 1: Usher]
Baby, I know we said it's best we don't talk no more
But I got to get it off my chest 'bout all the shit I've been hearing, babe
I, I thought you were that ride or die, you would never leave my side
I even made you out to be the woman that I will be with for life
I took in your kid, did everything that you wanted me to
Now I'm in the shit about you fronting on radio interviews
Do it make you feel good to lie, even though I know you wanna cry?
Hey, if you were gonna tell it, then you should've everything instead of making me the bad guy
If you got nothing good to say, then don't say nothing
'Cause if I really start talking, it'll be something
So you cheated, I cheated, so be it
We need to leave it alone, move on... 

[call waiting beeping]
Hold up

[Interlude: Usher & Phone Operator]
Hello, you got a collect call from Clinton Correctional Facility. Will you accept the charges?
Yes, I'll accept it
What's up?

[Verse 2: Shyne & Usher]
Sitting in my cell, head about to burst
Wouldn't be alive if I didn't shoot first
Had it made, sorry for the ricochet
But I'd be in the grave if I didn't let it spray
I never said that I was perfect (Yeah)
Nobody walkin' on this earth is (That's right)
That night, I would've got murdered
If I ain't grab the ratchet and let them cowards have it, yeah

[Interlude: Jermaine Dupri]
Uh, listen up, listen up, listen up, world
Listen up, listen up, listen up, world
Uh, I gotta confess
This is the hottest remix I ever did in my life
So So Def

[Chorus: Usher & Jermaine Dupri]
These are my confessions
Just when I thought I said all I can say
My chick on the side said she got one on the way
These are my confessions
Man I'm throwed and I don't know what to do
I guess I gotta give you part two of my confessions
If I'm gonna tell it, then I gotta tell it all (all, yeah yeah)
Damn near cried when I got that phone call (call)
I'm so throwed, I don't know what to do
(If you got something to confess to right now, step to the mic, Twista!)
But to give part two of my confessions

[Verse 3: Twista]
I confess about the incident when I was with a shorty in the Lexus Coupe
Your homie said she saw me, but she didn't have proof
But I knew I really should've been just telling you the truth
And I confess about the days
I was rolling my Seville with the custom gold grill
I was in the field, still looking for a thrill
And I knew it was bogus I should've kept it real (wooooaah!)
And I confess that just when I thought I could really try to get away
Or have another woman on the side
But I never knew that it would catch up with a nigga one day
You gotta hear me girl, I done learned a lesson
If you stay with me, then it'll be a blessing
No stressing, it'll never be no guessing
'Cause I'm pouring out my heart and these are my confessions

[Chorus: Usher & Jermaine Dupri]
These are my confessions
Just when I thought I said all I can say
My chick on the side said she got one on the way (rock with me)
These are my confessions
Man I'm throwed and I don't know what to do
I guess I gotta give you part two of my confessions
If I'm gonna tell it, then I gotta tell it all (all)
Damn near cried when I got that phone call (call)
I'm so throwed, I don't know what to do
(Kanye, confess to the people, man)
But to give part two of my confessions

[Verse 4: Kanye West]
Damn, how did she bring it up? How did she break it down?
Man, you at the clinic? Dog, slow down, that's your child
But if you keep it, then you gotta tell your girl you was cheating
And you went raw dog when you beat it
That's when she gon' tell you to beat it
And you know it ain't y'all little secret
You famous, you can't go nowhere
'Cause everytime you go there, there's hoes there
So basically, you and your girl over
And I know when she broke the news
You told her, "Man, don't say that"
Matter fact, like Pat, don't say jack
Every time a nigga sitting on pay stacks
Things come up from way, way, way back
Way back, way back
Way, way back, way back

[Chorus: Usher & Jermaine Dupri]
These are my confessions
Just when I thought I said all I can say
My chick on the side said she got one on the way (rock with me)
These are my confessions
Man I'm throwed and I don't know what to do
I guess I gotta give you part two of my confessions
If I'm gonna tell it, then I gotta tell it all (all)
Damn near cried when I got that phone call (call)
I'm so throwed, I don't know what to do
But to give part two of my confessions

[Outro: Usher & Jermaine Dupri]
This by far is the hardest thing I think I've ever had to do (yeah)
To tell you, the woman I love (uh huh)
That I'm having a baby by a woman that I barely even know (yeah)
I hope you can accept the fact that I'm man enough to tell you this (she probably can't)
And hopefully you'll give me another chance (she might go)

[Intro: JAY-Z & Beyoncé]
Yes! (Whoo, ow!)
So crazy right now
Most incredibly
It's your girl, B
It's your boy, Young
You ready?

[Hook: Beyoncé & JAY-Z]
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh no no (Oww!)
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh no no
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh no no
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh no no

[Interlude: JAY-Z]
Ch-yeah!
History in the making, part two!
It's so crazy right now

[Verse 1: Beyoncé]
I look and stare so deep in your eyes
I touch on you more and more every time
When you leave, I'm beggin' you not to go
Call your name two, three times in a row
Such a funny thing for me to try to explain
How I'm feelin', and my pride is the one to blame (Yeah, yeah)
'Cause I know I don't understand
Just how your love can do what no one else can

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
Got me looking so crazy right now
Your love's got me looking so crazy right now (Your love)
Got me looking so crazy right now
Your touch got me looking so crazy right now (Your touch)
Got me hoping you'll page me right now
Your kiss got me hoping you'll save me right now
Looking so crazy, your love's got me looking
Got me looking so crazy in love

[Post-Chorus: Beyoncé]
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh no no
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh no no
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh no no
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh no no

[Verse 2: Beyoncé]
When I talk to my friends so quietly
("Who he think he is?") Look at what you did to me
Tennis shoes, don't even need to buy a new dress
If you ain't there, ain't nobody else to impress
It's the way that you know what I thought I knew
It's the beat that my heart skips when I'm with you
But I still don't understand
Just how your love can do what no one else can

[Chorus: Beyoncé & JAY-Z]
Got me looking so crazy right now
Your love's got me looking so crazy right now (So crazy, your love)
Got me looking so crazy right now (Your love)
Your touch got me looking so crazy right now (Oh, your touch)
Got me hoping you'll page me right now (Yeah)
Your kiss got me hoping you'll save me right now (Hey)
Looking so crazy, your love's got me looking (Ch-yeah!)
Got me looking so crazy in love (Ch-yeah!)
I'm looking so crazy, your love's got me looking (Whoo!)
Got me looking so crazy in love (I'm warmed up now, let's go)

[Verse 3: JAY-Z & Beyoncé]
Young Hov, y'all know when the flow is loco (No)
Young B and the R-O-C, uh-oh (Oh, no)
O.G. Big Homie, the one and only (No, no)
Stick bony, but the pockets is fat like Tony (No, no, no)
Soprano, the ROC handle like Van Exel
I shake phonies man you can't get next to
The genuine article, I do not sing though
I sling though, if anything, I bling yo
A star like Ringo, war like a Green Beret
You crazy? Bring your whole set (Oh)
JAY-Z in the Range, crazy and deranged
They can't figure him out, they like, "Hey, is he insane?"
Yes sir, I'm cut from a different cloth
My texture is the best fur - chinchilla
I've been iller than chain smokers (Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh no no)
How you think I got the name Hova? (Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh no no)
I been realer, the game's over
Fall back, Young (Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh no no)
Ever since I made the change over to platinum (Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh no no)
The game's been a wrap, one

[Bridge: Beyoncé]
Got me looking, so crazy, my baby
I'm not myself lately, I'm foolish, I don't do this
I've been playing myself, baby, I don't care
'Cause your love's got the best of me
And baby, you're making a fool of me
You got me sprung and I don't care who sees
'Cause baby, you got me, you got me
You got me so crazy, baby (Hey!)

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
Got me looking so crazy right now (Your love)
Your love's got me looking so crazy right now (Looking crazy)
Got me looking so crazy right now
Your touch got me looking so crazy right now (Baby, your touch)
Got me hoping you'll page me right now (Yeah, babe)
Your kiss got me hoping you'll save me right now (Oh)
Looking so crazy, your love's got me looking (Yeah)
Got me looking so crazy in love (Whoa)
Got me looking so crazy right now
Your love's got me looking so crazy right now (Your love)
Got me looking so crazy right now
Your touch got me looking so crazy right now (Your touch)
Got me hoping you'll page me right now
Your kiss got me hoping you'll save me right now
Looking so crazy, your love's got me looking
Got me looking so crazy in love

[Verse 1 - Fabolous]
I don't know what you've been told
About these fours that you control
Now everybody know the brother's calm
And I cover the arm (yeah), smother the charm (yeah)
Girls say a brother the bomb
But ain't no ladies in my life, other than moms (uh uh)
That's 'til this girl changed my way
And it even feels strange to say
I'm so caught up, 'cause I can't stand to admit
Cupid got good aim, your man has been hit

[Verse 2 - Usher]
I'm the kinda brother
Who been doin it my way, gettin my bread for years - in my career
And every lover (y'all)
In and out my life, I hid love and left a tear - without a care
(Until I met this girl who turned the tables around)
Met this girl, turned the tables around
She caught me by surprise and I
(I never thought I'd be the one breaking down)
I can't figure it out why

[Hook - Usher]
I'm so - caught up
Got me feelin it - caught up

[Verse 3 -Usher]
(Ahhhhh ...)
Oh naw, let me go baby (oh)
Now listen (oh)

My momma told me
Be careful who you do, cause karma comes back around, same old song (now)
But I was so sure that it wouldn't happen to me, cause I know how to put it
Down
But I was so wrong
This girl was mean (so mean), she really turned me out (she's so mean)
(Her body was so tight, I'm looking for another date, top of the flashlight
Yeah)
My homies say this girl is crampin my style (she's crampin my style)
And I can't figure it out but

[Hook - Usher]
I'm so - caught up
Got me feelin it - caught up
I don't know what it is (what it is)
But it seems she got me twisted (but it seems she got me twisted)

Really feelin it - caught up (hey)

But it seems she's got me twisted (but it seems she's got me twisted)
I'm so - caught up
Really feelin it - caught up
I'm losin control, this girl's got a hold on me

And I think I like it baby (oh)
Oh nooooo, oh whoa no
Oh, yeah, oh my, ohh

That a do like you (uh) and feel like this (uh)
I knew like few who real like this (uh)
I do like you, S-H-E-R (yeah)
Baby we are, two of the flyest, youngest, pimpest niggas around
Throwin seven figures around
Like we don't care, ain't like we don't share
For this girl, ain't a shoe she won't wear
But we don't dare (nope), say we ain't stuck (uh)
How you fit in a seven and say it ain't luck? (damn)
Sister's been bought up, yes I'm caught up
The Fabolous player about to get his sport up
Like for real

[Hook - Usher]
This girl with me, she really turned me out (yeah, yeah, yeah, sugar)
My homies say this girl's crampin my style, now

I'm soooo - caught up
Why I'm - caught up

But it seems she's got me twisted (she got me twisted)
