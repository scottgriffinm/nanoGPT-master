l away?
Cherish well your thoughts, and keep a tight grip on your booze
'Cause thinkin' and drinkin' are all I have today

[Verse 3]
Then a man rode into town, some thought he was the law
Billie Jean was waiting when he came
She told me he would take her if I didn't use my gun
But I'd have no one but myself to blame
I went down to those dusty streets, blood was on my mind
I guess that stranger hadn't heard the news
'Cause I shot first and killed him, Lord, he didn't even draw
And he made me trade the gallows for the Mexicali Blues, yeah

[Chorus]
Is there anything a man don't stand to lose
When he lets a woman hold him in her hands?
You just might find yourself out there on horseback in the dark
Just riding and running across those desert sands

[Verse 1]
Look for a while at the china cat sunflower
Proud walking jingle in the midnight sun
Copperdome bodhi drip a silver kimono
Like a crazy quilt stargown through a dream night wind

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
Krazy Kat peeking through a lace bandanna
Like a one-eyed cheshire, like a diamond-eye jack
A leaf of all colors plays a golden-string fiddle
To a double-e waterfall over my back

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Comic book colors on a violin river crying a lot of
Words from out a silk trombone
I rang a silent bell, beneath a shower of pearls
In the eagle-winged palace of the Queen Chinee

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
I know you, rider, gonna miss me when I'm gone
I know you, rider, gonna miss me when I'm gone
Gonna miss your baby, from rolling in your arms

[Verse 1]
Laid down last night, Lord, I could not take my rest
Laid down last night, Lord, I could not take my rest
My mind was wandering like the wild geese in the West

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
The sun will shine in my back door someday
The sun will shine in my back door someday
March winds will blow all my troubles away

[Verse 3]
I wish I was a headlight, on a northbound train
I wish I was a headlight, on a northbound train
I'd shine my light through the cool Colorado rain

[Chorus]
I know you, rider, gonna miss me when I'm gone
I know you, rider, gonna miss me when I'm gone
Gonna miss your baby, from rolling in your arms

[Instrumental break]

[Outro]
I know you, rider, gonna miss me when I'm gone, gone, gone
I know you, rider, gonna miss me when I'm gone, gone, gone
Gonna miss your baby, from rolling in your arms

Pigpen's not with us tonight, he's home sick. He's gonna be sick for a few months, and uh, I know that you all will join us sending your best wishes back to him. I'll tell him that

[Verse 1]
Well, this job I've got is a little too hard
I'm running out of money, Lord, I need more pay
Gonna wake up in the morning, Lord, I'm gonna pack my bags
Gonna beat it on down the line

[Chorus 1]
I'm going down the line (Going down the line)
Going down the line (Going down the line)
Going down the line (Going down the line)
Going down the line (Going down the line)
Yeah, I'm going down the line (Going down the line)
Going down the line (Going down the line)
I'm gonna beat it on down the line

[Verse 2]
Listen, I'll be waiting at the station, Lord, when that train pulls on by
I, I'm going back whеre I belong
Hey, I'm going north to my samе old used-to-be
Hey, down in Joe Brown's coal mine

[Chorus 2]
I said coal mine (Coal mine)
Whoa, coal mine (Coal mine)
I said coal mine (Coal mine)
Yeah, coal mine (Coal mine)
Yeah, coal mine (Coal mine)
Hey, hey, yeah, yeah (Coal mine)
Coal mine, oh, down in Joe Brown's coal mine

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Yeah, I'm going back to that shack way across the railroad track
Uh-huh, and that's where I think I belong
Yes, I got a sweet woman, Lord, yeah, she's waiting there for me
Yeah, that's where I'm gonna make my happy home

[Outro]
I said happy home (Happy home)
Whoa, happy home (Happy home)
I said happy home (Happy home)
I said a happy, I said a happy (Happy home)
Happy, happy, happy home (Happy home)
Hey, hey, yeah, yeah (Happy home)
Happy home, well now, that's where I'm gonna make my happy home

[Verse 1]
All the years combine, they melt into a dream
A broken angel sings from a guitar
In the end there's just a song, comes crying up the wind
Through all lonely streets and shattered years

[Chorus]
Stella Blue
Stella Blue

[Verse 2]
When all the cards are down, there's nothing left to see
There's just the pavement left and broken dreams
And still you hear that song, it's crying like the wind
Down every lonely street that's ever been

[Chorus]
Stella Blue
Stella Blue

[Bridge]
I've stayed in every blue light cheap hotel
Can't win for trying
Dust off those rusty strings just one more time
Can't keep from crying

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
It all rolls into one, and nothing comes for free
There's nothing you can hold for very long
And when you hear that song, crying like the wind
It seems like all this life was just a dream

[Chorus]
Stella Blue
Stella Blue
Stella Blue

[Instrumental]

[Outro]
Right now, I'd like to introduce the newest member of our musical family. This is Donna Jean Godchaux (Hi), and she's gonna help us out on vocals here

[Intro]
Three, five, seven, eight, nine, ten

[Verse 1]
Some folks trust to reason
Others trust to might
I don't trust nothing
But I know it come out right
Say it once again now
Oh, I hope you understand
When it's done and over
Lord, a man is just a man

[Chorus]
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on the land

[Verse 2]
Some folks look for answers
Others look for fights
Some folks up in treetops
Just looking for their kites
But I can tell your future
Oh, look what's in your hand
But I can't stop for nothing
I'm just playing in the band

[Chorus]
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on the land

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Standing on a tower
World at my command
You just keep a turning
While I'm playing in the band
And if a man among you
Got no sin upon his hand
Let him cast a stone at me
For playing in the band

[Chorus]
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on the land

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus]
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on the land
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on the land
Playing
Like a wave upon the sand
Daybreak
While I'm playing in the band

[Instrumental]

[Outro]
Thank you

[Verse 1]
Cold iron shackles and ball and chain
Listen to the whistle of the evening train
You know you bound to wind up dead
If you don't head back to Tennessee, Jed

[Verse 2]
Rich man step on my poor head
When you get back you better butter my bread
Well, you know it's like I said
You better head back to Tennessee, Jed

[Chorus]
Tennessee, Tennessee
There ain't no place I'd rather be
Baby, won't you carry me
Back to Tennessee

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Drink all day and rock all night
The law come to get you if you don't walk right
Catch a few winks, baby, down under the bed
Then head back to Tennessee, Jed

[Verse 4]
I dropped four flights and cracked my spine
Honey, come quick with the iodine
Got a letter this morning, baby, and all that it read:
You better head back to Tennessee, Jed

[Chorus]
Tennessee, Tennessee
There ain't no place I'd rather be
Baby, won't you carry me
Back to Tennessee

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 5]
I run into Charlie Phogg
He blacked my eye and he kicked my dog
My dog, he turned to me and he said:
Let's head back to Tennessee, Jed

[Verse 6]
I woke up feeling mean
I went down to play the slot machine
The wheels turned around and the letters said:
You better head back to Tennessee, Jed

[Chorus]
Tennessee, Tennessee
There ain't no place I'd rather be
Baby, won't you carry me
Back to Tennessee

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus]
Tennessee, Tennessee
There ain't no place I'd rather be
Baby, won't you carry me
Back to Tennessee

[Outro]
We're gonna take a break for a few minutes and fix a broken string and cool our heels, and we'll be back in about ten, fifteen minutes, play for a while more

[Chorus]
Driving that train, high on cocaine
Casey Jones you better, watch your speed
Trouble ahead, trouble behind
And you know that notion just crossed my mind

[Verse 1]
This old engine
Makes it on time
Leaves Central Station
At a quarter to nine
Hits river junction
At seventeen to
At a quarter to ten
You know it's traveling again

[Chorus]
Driving that train, high on cocaine
Casey Jones you better, watch your speed
Trouble ahead, trouble behind
And you know that notion just crossed my mind

[Verse 2]
Trouble ahead
A lady in red
Take my advice
You'd be better off dead
Switch-man sleeping
Train hundred and two
Is on the wrong track
And headed for you

[Chorus]
Driving that train, high on cocaine
Casey Jones you better, watch your speed
Trouble ahead, trouble behind
And you know that notion just crossed my mind

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Trouble with you is
The trouble with me
Got two good eyes
But we still don't see
Come 'round the bend
You know it's the end
The fireman screams
And the engine just gleams

[Chorus]
Driving that train, high on cocaine
Casey Jones you better, watch your speed
Trouble ahead, trouble behind
And you know that notion just crossed my mind
Driving that train, high on cocaine
Casey Jones you better, watch your speed
Trouble ahead, trouble behind
And you know that notion just crossed my mind
Driving that train, high on cocaine
Casey Jones you better, watch your speed
Trouble ahead, trouble behind
And you know that notion just crossed my mind
Driving that train, high on cocaine
Casey Jones you better, watch your speed
Trouble ahead, trouble behind
And you know that notion just crossed my mind
Driving that train, high on cocaine
Casey Jones you better, watch your speed
Trouble ahead, trouble behind
And you know that notion just crossed my mind
Driving that train, high on cocaine
Casey Jones you better, watch your speed
Trouble ahead, trouble behind
And you know that notion just crossed my mind
Driving that train, high on cocaine
Casey Jones you better, watch your speed
Trouble ahead, trouble behind
And you know that notion just crossed my mind
Driving that train, high on cocaine
Casey Jones you better, watch your speed
Trouble ahead, trouble behind
And you know that notion just crossed my mind

[Outro]
And you know that notion just crossed my mind

Well, anyway, ha, what we're gonna do next is...

[Verse 1]
Me and my uncle went riding down
South Colorado, west Texas bound
We stopped over in Santa Fe
That being the point just about halfway
And you know it was the hottest part of the day

[Verse 2]
I took the horses up to the stall
Went to the barroom, ordered drinks for all
Three days in the saddle, you know my body hurt
It being summer, I took off my shirt
And I tried to wash off some of that dusty dirt

[Verse 3]
West Texas cowboys, they's all around
With liquor and money, they loaded down
So soon after payday, know it seemed a shame
You know my uncle, he starts a friendly game
Hey, high-low jack and the winner take the hand

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 4]
My uncle starts winning; cowboys got sore
One of them called him, and then two more
Accused him of cheating; well, oh no, it couldn't be
I know my uncle, he's as honest as me
Hey, I'm as honest as a Denver man can be, yeah, that's me
One of them cowboys, he starts to draw
Picked up a bottle, cracked him in the jaw
Shot me another, well, hot damn, he won't grow old
In the confusion, my uncle grabbed the gold
Then we high-tailed it down to Mexico

[Outro]
I love those cowboys, I love their gold
I love my uncle, God rest his soul
He taught me good, Lord, taught me all I know
Taught me so well, I grabbed that gold
And I left his dead ass there by the side of the road

Thank you

[Verse 1]
Since it cost a lot to win
And even more to lose
You and me bound to spend some time
Wondering what to choose

[Pre-Chorus]
It goes to show you don't ever know
Watch each card you play
And play it slow

[Chorus]
Wait until that deal go down
Don't you let that deal go down, no no

[Verse 2]
I've been gambling hereabouts
For ten good solid years
If I told you all that went down
It would burn off both your ears

[Pre-Chorus]
It goes to show you don't ever know
Watch each card you play
And play it slow

[Chorus]
Wait until that deal come 'round
Don't you let that deal go down, oh no

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Since you poured the wine for me
Tightened up my shoes
I hate to lеave you sitting there
Composing lonеly blues

[Pre-Chorus]
It goes to show you don't ever know
Watch each card you play
And play it slow

[Chorus]
Wait until that deal go down
Don't you let that deal go down, no no

[Verse 1 repeated]
Since it cost a lot to win
Even more to lose
You and me bound to spend some time
Wondering what to choose

[Pre-Chorus]
It goes to show you don't ever know
Watch each card you play
And play it slow

[Chorus]
Wait until that deal come 'round
Don't you let that deal go down

[Outro]
Wait until that deal come 'round
Don't you let that deal go down
Don't you let that deal go down
Wait until that deal come 'round
Wait until that deal come 'round
Wait until that deal come 'round
Don't you let that deal go down
Don't you let that deal go down
Don't you let that deal go down
Don't you let that deal go down
Don't you let that deal go down

[Verse 1: The Grateful Dead]
We can share the women, we can share the wine
We can share what we got of yours 'cause we done shared all of mine
Keep on rollin', just a mile to go
Keep on rollin' my old buddy, you're movin' much too slow

[Verse 2: Jerry Garcia, Bob Weir]
I just jumped the watchman, right outside the fence
Took his rings, four bucks in change, ain't that Heaven sent?
Hurts my ears to listen, Shannon, it burns my eyes to see
Cut down a man in cold blood, Shannon, it might as well've been me

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3: Bob Weir]
We used to play for silver, now we play for life
One's for sport and one's for blood at thе point of a knife
Now the die is shakеn, now the die must fall
Ain't no winner in the game, he don't go home with all
Not with all

[Verse 4: The Grateful Dead]
Leavin' Texas, fourth day of July
Sun so hot, the clouds so low, the eagles filled the sky
Catch the Detroit Lightning out of Santa Fe
The Great Northern out of Cheyenne, from sea to shining sea

[Verse 5: Jerry Garcia, Bob Weir]
Gotta go to Tulsa, first train we can ride
Gotta settle one old score, one small point of pride
Ain't a place a man can hide, Shannon, will keep him from the sun
Ain't a bed can give us rest now, you keep us on the run

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 6: The Grateful Dead]
Jack Straw from Wichita
Cut his buddy down
Dug for him a shallow grave
And laid his body down
Half a mile from Tucson
By the morning light
One man gone and another to go
My old buddy, you're moving much too slow

[Outro: The Grateful Dead]
We can share the women, we can share the wine

[Verse 1]
Rat in a drain ditch, caught on a limb
You know better but I know him
Like I told you, what I said
Steal your face right off your head

[Chorus]
Now he's gone
Now he's gone, Lord, he's gone
He's gone
Like a steam locomotive rolling down the track
He's gone, he's gone
And nothing's gonna bring him back
He's gone

[Verse 2]
Nine mile skid on a ten mile ride
Hot as a pistol but cool inside
Cats on a tin roof, dogs in a pile
Nothing left to do but smile, smile, smile

[Chorus]
Now he's gone
Now he's gone, Lord, he's gone
He's gonе
Like a steam locomotive rolling down thе track
He's gone, he's gone
And nothing's gonna bring him back
He's gone

[Instrumental break]

[Bridge]
Going where the wind don't blow so strange
Maybe off on some high cold mountain chain
I lost one round but the price wasn't anything
A knife in the back and more of the same

[Verse 3]
Same old rat in a drain ditch, caught on a limb
You know better but I know him
Like I told you, what I said
Steal your face right off your head

[Chorus]
Now he's gone
Now he's gone, Lord, he's gone
He's gone
Like a steam locomotive rolling down the track
He's gone, he's gone
And nothing's gonna bring him back
He's gone

[Outro]
Like a steam locomotive rolling down the track
He's gone, he's gone
And nothing's gonna bring him back
He's gone
Ooh, nothing's gonna bring him back
Ooh, nothing's gonna bring him back
Ooh, nothing's gonna bring him back
Ooh, nothing's gonna bring him back
Ooh, nothing's gonna bring him back
Ooh, nothing's gonna bring him back
Ooh, nothing's gonna bring him back
Ooh, nothing's gonna bring him back
Ooh, nothing's gonna bring him back
Ooh, nothing's gonna bring him back

This is something we should've done a couple minutes ago but we're gonna do it now instead

[Chorus 1]
Truckin', got my chips cashed in
Keep truckin', like the do-dah man
Together, more or less in line
Just keep truckin' on

[Verse 1]
Arrows of neon and flashing marquees out on Main Street
Chicago, New York, Detroit and it's all on the same street
Your typical city involved in a typical daydream
Hang it up and see what tomorrow brings

[Chorus 2]
Dallas, got a soft machine
Houston, too close to New Orleans
New York got the ways and means
But just won't let you be, no no

[Verse 2]
Most of the cats you meet on the streets speak of true love
Most of the time they're sittin' and cryin' at home
One of these days they know they better get goin'
Out of thе door and down on the streets all alone

[Chorus 3]
Truckin', like thе do-dah man
Once told me "You've got to play your hand"
Sometimes your cards ain't worth a dime
If you don't lay 'em down

[Bridge]
Sometimes the light's all shinin' on me
Other times I can barely see
Lately it occurs to me
What a long, strange trip it's been

[Verse 3]
What in the world ever became of sweet Jane?
She lost her sparkle, you know she isn't the same
Livin' on reds, and vitamin C, and cocaine
All her friend can say is "Ain't it a shame"

[Chorus 4]
Truckin', up to Buffalo
I've been thinkin', you got to mellow slow
It takes time to pick a place to go
And just keep truckin' on

[Verse 4]
Sittin' and starin' out of the hotel window
Got a tip they're gonna kick the door in again
I'd like to get some sleep before I travel
But if you got a warrant, I guess you're gonna come in

[Chorus 5]
Busted, down on Bourbon Street
Set up, like a bowling pin
Knocked down, it gets to wearin' thin
They just won't let you be, no no

[Verse 5]
You're sick of hangin' around and you'd like to travel
Get tired of travelin' and you want to settle down
I guess they can't revoke your soul for tryin'
Get out of the door and light out and look all around

[Bridge]
Sometimes the light's all shinin' on me
Other times I can barely see
Lately it occurs to me
What a long, strange trip it's been

[Outro]
Truckin', I'ma goin' home
Whoa whoa, baby, back where I belong
Back home, sit down and patch my bones
And get back truckin' on
Hey now, get back truckin' on
Hey now, get back truckin' on
Hey now, get back truckin' on
Ow, get back truckin' on
Ow, get back truckin' on
Ow, get back truckin' on
Hey now, get back truckin' on

[Instrumental]

Truckin', I'ma goin' home
Whoa whoa, baby, back where I belong
Back home, sit down and patch my bones
And get back truckin' on
Hey now, get back truckin' on
Hey now, get back truckin' on
Hey now, get back truckin' on
Ow, get back truckin' on

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Spanish lady come to me, she lays on me this rose
It rainbow spirals round and round, it trembles and explodes
It left a smoking crater of my mind I like to blow away
But the heat came 'round and busted me for smiling on a cloudy day

[Chorus]
Coming, coming, coming around (Coming around)
Coming around (Coming around)
Coming (Coming), coming (Coming), coming around (Coming around)
Coming around (Coming around)

[Instrumental]

[Verse 2]
Escaping through the lily fields, I came across an empty space
It trembled and exploded, left a bus stop in its place
The bus came by and I got on, that’s when it all began
There was Cowboy Neal at the wheel of the bus to Never Ever Land

[Outro]
Coming, coming, coming around (Coming around)
Coming around (Coming around)
Coming (Coming), coming (Coming), coming around (Coming around)
Coming around (Coming around)

[Chorus]
Comes a time when the blind man takes your hand, says "Don't you see?
Gotta make it somehow on the dreams you still believe."
Don't give it up, you got an empty cup that only love can fill
Only love can fill

[Verse 1]
Walking all morning, been walking all night
I don't see much difference between the dark and the light
And I feel the wind, I taste the rain
Never in my mind to cause so much pain

[Chorus]
Comes a time when the blind man takes your hand, says "Don't you see?
Gotta make it somehow on the dreams you still believe."
Don't give it up, you got an empty cup only love can fill
Only love can fill

[Verse 2]
The words come out like an angry stream
You hear yourself say things you could never mean
When the heat cools down, and you find your mind
You got a lot of words you've got to stand behind

[Chorus]
Comes a time when the blind man takes your hand, says "Don't you see?
Gotta make it somehow on the dreams you still believe."
Don't give it up, you got an empty cup only love can fill
Only love can fill

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
From day to day just letting it ride
You get so far away from how it feels inside
You can't let go 'cause you're afraid to fall
But the day may come when you can't feel at all

[Chorus]
Comes a time when the blind man takes your hand, says "Don't you see?
Gotta make it somehow on the dreams you still believe."
Don't give it up, you got an empty cup only love can fill
That only love can fill

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Sugar magnolia, blossoms blooming
Heads all empty, and I don't care
Saw my baby down by the river
Knew she'd have to come up soon for air

Sweet blossom come on, under the willow
We can have high times if you'll abide
We can discover the wonders of nature
Rolling in the rushes down by the riverside

[Chorus]
She's got everything delightful
She's got everything I need
Takes the wheel when I'm seeing double
Pays my ticket when I speed

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
She comes skimmin' through rays of violet
She can wade in a drop of dew
She don't come, and I don't follow
Waits backstage while I sing to you
She can dance a Cajun rhythm
Jump like a Willys in four-wheel drive
She's my summer love in the spring, fall, and winter
She can make happy any man alive

Sugar magnolia, ringing that bluebell
While caught up in sunlight
Come on out singing, I'll walk you in the sunshine
Ooh, come on, honey, come along with me

[Chorus]
She's got everything delightful
She's got everything I need
A breeze in the pines and the sun and bright moonlight
Lazing in the sunshine? Yes, indeed

[Verse 3]
Sometimes when the cuckoo's crying
When the moon is halfway down
Sometimes when the night is dying
I take me out and I wander 'round
Walk around

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
Sunshine daydream, walk you in the tall trees
Going where the wind goes
Blooming like a red rose
Roll on over sweetly
Then ride out singin'; I'll walk you in the morning sunshine
Sunshine daydream
Sweet lovin' daydream
Roll on over daydream
Going where the wind goes
Hey, and blooming like a red rose
Roll on over sweetly
Ride out singin'; I'll walk you in the morning sunshine
Woo
Sweet lovin' daydream
Come on over daydream
Come on over daydream
It's now a sweet lovin' daydream
Sunshine daydream, ah yah
Sunshine daydream, ah yah
Sunshine daydream, ah yah
Sunshine daydream, ah yah
Ah yah
Sweet lovin' daydream

[Verse 1]
Just like Jack the Ripper
Just like Mojo Hand
Just like Billy Sunday
In a shotgun ragtime band
Just like New York City
Just like Jericho
Pace the halls and climb the walls
And get out when they blow

[Chorus]
Did you say your name was
Ramblin' Rose?
Ramble on, baby
Settle down easy
Ramble on, Rose

[Verse 2]
Just like Jack and Jill
Mama told the sailor
One heat up or one cool down
Nothin' for the tailor
Just like Jack and Jill
Papa told the jailer
One go up, one go down
Do yourself a favor

[Chorus]
Did you say your name was
Ramblin' Rose?
Ramble on, baby
Settle down easy
Ramble on, Rose

[Bridge]
I'm gonna sing you a hundred verses in ragtime
I know this song it ain't never gonna end
I'm gonna march you up and down the local county line
Take you to the leader of the band

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Just like Crazy Otto
Just like Wolfman Jack
Sittin' plush with a royal flush
Aces back to back
Just like Mary Shelley
Just like Frankenstein
Clank your chains, and count your change
And try to walk the line

[Chorus]
Did you say your name was
Ramblin' Rose?
Ramble on, baby
Settle down easy
Ramble on, Rose

[Bridge]
I'm gonna sing you a hundred verses in ragtime
I know this song it ain't never gonna end
I'm gonna march you up and down the local county line
Take you to the leader of the band

[Verse 4]
Goodbye, Mama and Papa
Goodbye, Jack and Jill
The grass ain't greener, the wine ain't sweeter
On either side of the hill

[Chorus]
Oh, did you say your name was
Ramblin' Rose?
Ramble on, baby
Settle down easy
Ramble on, Rose

[Outro]
Ramble on, Rose

[Verse 1]
Going where the water tastes like wine
Going where the water tastes like wine
Going where the water tastes like wine
I don't wanna be treated this a-way

[Chorus]
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad, feeling bad
I don't wanna be treated this a-way

[Instrumental break]

[Outro]
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad, feeling bad
I don't wanna be treated this a-way
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad, feeling bad
I don't wanna be treated this a-way
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad, feeling bad
I don't wanna be treated this a-way
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad, feeling bad
I don't wanna be treated this a-way

[Instrumental]

[Verse]
I wanna tell you how it's gonna be
You're gonna give your love to me
I wanna love you night and day
You know our love will not fade away

[Outro]
You know our love will not fade away
You know our love will not fade away
You know our love will not fade away
Where love is love, will not fade away
Where love is love, will not fade away
Where love is love, will not fade away
I said now love is love, will not fade away
Not fade away, not fade away
Not fade away, not fade away
Not fade away, not fade away
Not fade away, not fade away
Not fade away, not fade away
Not fade away, not fade away
Not fade away, not fade away
Not fade away, not fade away
Not fade away, no
Not fade away, woo
Woo

[Outro]
Thank you, folks, good night

[Verse]
The news is out, all over town
You've been seen out running 'round
I know that I should leave her there
I just can't go, you win again

[Chorus]
This heart of mine could never see
What everybody knows but me
Just trustin' you was my great sin
I just can't go, go on, you win again

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus]
This heart of mine could never see
What everybody knows but me
Just trustin' you was my great sin
I just can't go, go on, you win again

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus]
This heart of mine could never see
What everybody knows but me
Trustin' you was my great sin
What can I do, Lord? You win again

[Outro]
What can I do, Lord? You win again

[Verse 1]
All I know is something like a bird
Within her sang
All I know she sang a little while
And then flew on

[Refrain]
Tell me all that you know
I'll show you
Snow and rain

[Verse 2]
If you hear that same sweet song again
Will you know why?
Anyone who sings a tune so sweet
Is passing by

[Refrain]
Laugh in the sunshine
Sing
Cry in the dark
Fly through the night

[Chorus]
Don't cry now
Don't you cry
Don't you cry anymore
La-la-la-la
Sleep
In the stars
Don't you cry
Dry your eyes on the wind
La-la-la-la, la, la

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
All I know is something like a bird
Within her sang
All I know she sang a little while
And then flew on

[Refrain]
Tell me all that you know
I'll show you
Snow and rain

[Verse 4]
If you hear that same sweet song again
Will you know why?
Anyone who sings a tune so sweet
Is passing by

[Refrain]
Laugh in the sunshine
Sing
Cry in the dark
Fly through the night

[Chorus]
Don't cry now
Don't you cry
Don't you cry anymore
La-la-la-la
Sleep
In thе stars
Don't you cry
Dry your eyes on the wind
La-la-la-la, la, la

[Instrumental]

[Intro]
On this auspicious occasion, I'm gonna take this opportunity to introduce to you the newest member of our musical family, that being Miss Donna Jean Godchaux. (Hi) She's gonna help us out on this next one, and I hope you, ha ha, stand on your heads and wiggle your ears. (One, three, five, seven, eight, nine, ten)

[Verse 1]
Some folks trust to reason
Others trust to might
I don't trust nothing
But I know it come out right
Say it once again now
Oh, I hope you understand
When it's done and over
Lord, a man is just a man

[Chorus]
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on the land

[Verse 2]
Some folks look for answers
Others look for fights
Some folks up in treetops
Just looking for thеir kites
But I can tell your future
Oh, look what's in your hand
But I can't stop for nothing
I'm just playing in thе band

[Chorus]
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on the land

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Standing on a tower
World at my command
You just keep turning
While I'm playing in the band
And if a man among you
Got no sin upon his hand
Let him cast a stone at me
For playing in the band

[Chorus]
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on the land

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus]
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on the land
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on the land
Playing
Like a wave upon the sand
Daybreak
While I'm playing in the band

[Instrumental]

[Outro]
Thank you

[Verse 1]
Walk me out in the morning dew, my honey
Walk me out in the morning dew today
I can't walk you out in the morning dew, my honey
I can't walk you out in the morning dew today

[Verse 2]
Thought I heard a baby cry this morning
Thought I heard a baby cry today
Thought I heard a baby cry this morning
You didn't hear no baby cry today

[Verse 3]
Where have all the people gone, my honey?
Where have all the people gone today?
There's no need for you to be worrying about all those people
You never see those people anyway

[Verse 4]
Thought I hеard a young man mourn this morning
Thought I heard a young man cry today
Didn't hear no young man mourn this morning
I can't walk you out in the morning dеw today

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 5]
Walk me out in the morning dew, my honey
Walk me out in the morning dew today
I'll walk you out in the morning dew, my honey
I guess it doesn't matter anyway
I guess it doesn't matter anyway
I guess it doesn't matter anyway

[Instrumental break]

[Outro]
I guess it doesn't matter anyway

[Verse 1]
Well, the first days are the hardest days
Don't you worry anymore
'Cause when life looks like Easy Street
There is danger at your door
Think this through with me
Let me know your mind
Whoa-oh, what I want to know
Is are you kind?

[Verse 2]
It's a buck dancer's choice, my friend
Better take my advice
You know all the rules by now
And the fire from the ice
Will you come with me?
Won't you come with me?
Whoa-oh, what I want to know
Will you come with me?

[Bridge]
Goddamn, well, I declare
Have you seen the like?
Their walls are built of cannon balls
Their motto is don't tread on me

[Chorus]
Come hear Uncle John's Band
Playing to the tide
Come with me or go alone
He's come to take his children home

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
It's the same story the crow told me
It's the only one he know
Like the morning sun you come
And like the wind you go
Ain't no time to hate
Barely time to wait
Whoa-oh, what I want to know
Where does the time go?

[Verse 4]
I live in a silver mine
And I call it "Beggar's Tomb"
I got me a violin
And I beg you call the tune
Anybody's choice
I can hear your voice
Whoa-oh, what I want to know
How does the song go?

[Chorus]
Come hear Uncle John's Band
By the riverside
Got some things to talk about
Here beside the rising tide
Come hear Uncle John's Band
Playing to the tide
Come on along or go alone
He's come to take his children home

[Instrumental Break]

[Refrain]
Whoa-oh, what I want to know
How does the song go?

[Outro]
Come hear Uncle John's Band
By the riverside
Got some things to talk about
Here beside the rising tide
Come hear Uncle John's Band
Playing to the tide
Come along or go alone
He's come to take his children home
Thank you, we'll see you all later, right after this next one

[Verse 1]
Went down to the mountain, I was drinking some wine
Looked up into heaven, Lord, I saw a mighty sign
Writ in fire across the heaven, plain as black and white
Get prepared, there's gonna be a party tonight

[Chorus]
Uh-huh, hey, Saturday night
Hey, uh-huh, one more Saturday night now
Woo, Saturday night

[Verse 2]
Everybody's dancing down the local armory
With a basement full of dynamite and live artillery
The temperature keeps rising, everybody getting high
Come the rocking stroke of midnight, the place is gonna fly

[Chorus]
Uh-huh, hey, Saturday night
Hey, uh-huh, one more Saturday night
Woo, Saturday night

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Turn on Channel Six, the President comes on the news
Says, "I get no satisfaction, that's why I sing the blues"
His wife say, "Don't get crazy, Lord, you know just what to do
Crank up that old Victrola, break out your rocking shoes"

[Chorus]
Uh-huh, hey, one more Saturday night
Hey, uh-huh, one more Saturday night now
Ooh, Saturday night

[Verse 4]
Then God way up in heaven, for whatever it was worth
Thought He'd have a big old party, thought he'd call it Planet Earth
Don't worry about tomorrow, you'll know it when it come
When the rock and roll music meets the rising, shining sun

[Chorus]
Uh-huh, woo, Saturday night now
Hey, uh-huh, one more Saturday night now
Hey, Saturday night
Watch me now

[Instrumental break]

[Outro]
Hanging on a Saturday night
Hanging on a Saturday night
Everybody get right
Hanging on a Saturday night
One more Saturday, one more Saturday night
Ow, hanging on a Saturday night
Hanging on a Saturday night
OW, hanging on a Saturday
One more Saturday, one more Saturday night
Ooh, hanging on a Saturday night
Hanging on a Saturday night
OW, hanging on a Saturday night
One more Saturday, one more Saturday night
OW, OW

Thank you, see ya later

[Verse 1]
Ground Control to Major Tom
Ground Control to Major Tom
Take your protein pills and put your helmet on
Ground Control to Major Tom
Commencing countdown, engines on
Check ignition and may God's love be with you

[Verse 2]
This is Ground Control to Major Tom
You've really made the grade
And the papers want to know whose shirts you wear
Now it's time to leave the capsule if you dare
This is Major Tom to Ground Control
I'm steppin' through the door
And I'm floating in a most peculiar way
And the stars look very different today

[Chorus]
For here I am sittin' in a tin can
Far above the world
Planet Earth is blue
And there's nothin' I can do

[Verse 3]
Though I'm past one hundred thousand miles
I'm feelin' very still
And I think my spaceship knows which way to go
Tell my wife I love her very much
She knows
Ground Control to Major Tom
Your circuit's dead, there's somethin' wrong
Can ya hear me, Major Tom?
Can ya hear me, Major Tom?
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you hear—

[Chorus]
I am sittin' in my tin can
Far above the world
Planet Earth is blue
And there's nothin' I can do

[Verse 1]
Sometimes I feel I've got to
Run away, I've got to
Get away from the pain you drive into the heart of me
The love we share
Seems to go nowhere
And I've lost my light
For I toss and turn, I can't sleep at night

[Chorus]
Once I ran to you
Now, I'll run from you
This tainted love you've given
I give you all a girl could give you
Take my tears and that's not nearly all
Tainted love, tainted love

[Verse 2]
Now, I know I've got to
Run away, I've got to
Get away
You don't really want any more from me
To make things right
You need someone to hold you tight
And you think love is to pray
But I'm sorry, I don't pray that way

[Chorus]
Once I ran to you
Now, I'll run from you
This tainted love you've given
I give you all a girl could give you
Take my tears and that's not nearly all
Tainted love, tainted love

[Outro]
Don't touch me please
I can't stand the way you tease
I love you, though you hurt me so
Now, I'm gonna pack my things and go
Tainted love, tainted love
Tainted love, tainted, tainted love

[Verse 1]
We were at the table by the window with the view
Castin' shadows, the sun was pushin' through
I spoke a lot of words, I don't know if I spoke the truth

[Pre-Chorus]
Got so much to lose
Got so much to prove
God, don't let me lose my mind

[Chorus]
Trouble on my left, trouble on my right
I've been facin' trouble almost all of my life
My sweet love, won't you pull me through?
Everywhere I look, I catch a glimpse of you
I said it was love and I did it for life, didn't do it for you

[Interlude]
Woo-ooh, woo-ooh-ooh
Woo-ooh-ooh
Ah, ah-ah-ah, woo-ooh-ooh

[Verse 2]
Will I come to pass, or will I pass the test?
You know what they say, yeah
The wicked get no rest
You can have my heart, any placе, any time

[Pre-Chorus]
Got so much to lose
Got so much to prove
God, don't lеt me lose my mind, oh-oh

[Chorus]
Trouble on my left, trouble on my right
I've been facin' trouble almost all of my life
My sweet love, won't you pull me through?
Everywhere I look, I catch a glimpse of you
I said it was love and I did it for life, didn't do it for you

[Outro]
Woo-ooh, woo-ooh-ooh
Woo-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah

[Verse 1]
You were with your friends, partyin'
When the alcohol kicked in
Said you wanted me dead
So you show up at my home, all alone
With a shovel and a rose
Do you think I'm a joke?

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause people like you always want back what they can't have
But I'm past that and you know that
So you should turn back to your rat pack, tell 'em I'm trash

[Chorus]
Tell all of your friends that I'm crazy and drive you mad
That I'm such a stalker, a watcher, a psychopath
And tell them you hate me and dated me just for laughs
So why do you call me and tell me you want me back?
You maniac

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, you maniac
Mmm, you maniac
Oh, you maniac

[Verse 2]
You just went too far
Crashed your car, called me cryin' in the dark
Now you're breakin' my heart
So I show up at your place right away
Wipe the tears off of your face
While you beg me to stay, well

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause people like you always want back what they can't have
But I'm past that and you know that
So you should turn back to your rat pack, tell 'em I'm trash

[Chorus]
And tell all of your friends that I'm crazy and drive you mad
That I'm such a stalker, a watcher, a psychopath
And tell them you hate me and dated me just for laughs
So why do you call me and tell me you want me back?
You maniac

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, you maniac
Mmm, you maniac
Oh, you maniac

[Verse 1]
You change your mind like a girl changes clothes
Yeah, you PMS like a bitch; I would know
And you overthink, always speak cryptically
I should know that you're no good for me

[Chorus]
'Cause you're hot then you're cold
You're yes, then you're no
You're in, then you're out
You're up, then you're down
You're wrong when it's right
It's black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We kiss, we make up

[Post-Chorus]
(You) You don't really wanna stay, no
(You) But you don't really wanna go, oh
You're hot then you're cold
You're yes, then you're no
You'rе in, then you're out
You're up, thеn you're down

[Verse 2]
We used to be just like twins, so in sync
The same energy, now's a dead battery
Used to laugh (Used to laugh) 'bout nothing ('Bout nothing)
Now you're plain (Now you're plain) boring (Boring)
I should know (I should know) that you're not gonna change

[Chorus]
'Cause you're hot then you're cold
You're yes, then you're no
You're in, then you're out
You're up, then you're down
You're wrong when it's right
It's black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We kiss, we make up

[Post-Chorus]
(You) You don't really wanna stay, no
(You) But you don't really wanna go, oh
You're hot then you're cold
You're yes, then you're no
You're in, then you're out
You're up, then you're down

[Bridge]
Someone call the doctor
Got a case of a love bipolar
Stuck on a roller coaster
Can't get off this ride
You change your mind like a girl changes clothes

[Chorus]
'Cause you're hot then you're cold
You're yes, then you're no
You're in, then you're out
You're up, then you're down
You're wrong when it's right
It's black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We kiss, we make up
You're hot then you're cold
You're yes, then you're no
You're in, then you're out
You're up, then you're down
You're wrong when it's right
It's black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We kiss, we make up

[Post-Chorus]
(You) You don't really wanna stay, no
(You) But you don't really wanna go, oh
You're hot then you're cold
You're yes, then you're no
You're in, then you're out
You're up, then you're down

[Verse]
Alone, alone
What could go wrong again?
I'm stuck at home with nothing to do but think and
And I cried all the way home last week
And I felt bad for strangers sitting next to me

[Chorus]
What am I doing now?
What is the purpose of anything?
And if you're not around
I'm missing a whole half of me

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
What am I doing now?
What is the purpose of anything?
And if you're not around
I'm missing a whole half of me

[Verse 1]
I got too much time
What else is there to do now?
Overanalyze things I don't really care about
The last words he said:
"There's other things out there to see"
And then he left me for someone who looks just like me

[Chorus]
Sometimes
Sometimes
Sometimes
Sometimes

[Verse 2]
What's in Berlin?
What's there that's not here you need?
And I want a kid, one that looks like you and me
Sometimes I want out
To take you and run away
But if I write about nothing, then what would they say?

[Chorus]
Sometimes
Sometimes
Sometimes
Sometimes
Sometimes
Sometimes
Sometimes
Sometimes

[Verse 1]
Who loved you first?
Who loved you last?
Why do I even think of these things?
'Cause I've always been the type to see all the bad before all the good things
Haven't written the song in a minute
Haven't been in love in forever
But I'm looking at you, you're looking at me at every single possible angle

[Chorus]
And it's not like how you make me feel
I don't feel this kind of type of way
And it's not like how you make me feel
I don't feel this kind of type of way

I don't feel this kind of type of way
I don't feel this kind of type of way
I don't feel this kind of type of way
I don't feel this kind of type of way

[Verse  2]
Ask what you want, ask what you need
I'll tell you еverything that I know
I'm hoping that you won't ever lеave
'Cause there's nowhere else I wanna go

[Chorus]
And it's not like how you make me feel
I don't feel this kind of type of way
And it's not like how you make me feel
I don't feel this kind of type of way

I don't feel this kind of type of way
I don't feel this kind of type of way
I don't feel this kind of type of way
I don't feel this kind of type of way
I don't feel this kind of type of way
I don't feel this kind of type of way
I don't feel this kind of type of way
I don't feel this kind of type of way
I don't feel this kind of type of way
I don't feel this kind of type of way
I don't feel this kind of type of way
I don't feel this kind of type of way
I don't feel this kind of type of way
I don't feel this kind of type of way
I don't feel this kind of type of way
I don't feel this kind of type of way
I don't feel this kind of type of way
I don't feel this kind of type of way
I don't feel this kind of type of way
I don't feel this kind of type of way
Today I might just lay around
Listen to the same song
Cry for no reason at all
Get it out of my system

You know, I used to love getting bored
But now without you, I have so much time to think
There's nothing to think about anymore

I don't feel like myself right now
Feel like a stranger
Wonder, who that person might be
And if you'd still love her

And today I get upset over this song that I heard
And I guess I was just upset because why didn't I think of it first

And tell me why am I sad
When there is somewhere I don't want to go
Even though you invited me and I still said no

[Verse 1]
I saw you last night in my dream
That's still the closest you and I have been
That's kind of sad, don't you think?
I think so

[Chorus]
How did I fall in love with someone
I don't know?
I don't know
I don't know

[Verse 2]
How am I supposed to ever be with him
When he and I don't speak the same language?
But we have conversations in my head

[Chorus]
How did I fall in love with someone
I don't know?
I don't know
I don't know

[Verse 3]
There's so much going on
My grandmother's dead
And I can't sleep 'cause this isn't my bed
He doesn't even know those things exist

[Chorus]
How did I fall in love with someone
I don't know?
I don't know
I don't know

[Verse 4]
I could just meet him and get it over
Or I'll just keep wearing his name on my shirt
Whatever I need just to help me cope

[Outro]
How did I fall in love with someone
I don't know?
How did I fall in love with someone
I don't know?
How did I fall in love with someone
I don't know?
How did I fall in love with someone
I don't know?
How did I fall in love with someone
I don't know?
How did I fall in love with someone
I don't know?
How did I fall in love with someone
I don't know?
How did I fall in love with someone
I don't know?

[Verse 1: Faye Webster]
I always oversleep
I'm always next to you
Do you see me in your dreams?
'Cause I see you see me too
At times my mind feels too full
And I want to empty it
But I'm scared to write my thoughts down
In case someone steals them

[Chorus: Faye Webster]
But I got you
I got you
I got you
I got you

[Verse 2: Mei Ehara]
ばらけた朝は夜を抱えて
虫食う心のそばに花を植え
蛇口を落ちる水の音から
何もかもが見えてしまって
あなた　隣で
溢れて　見つけてよ

[Verse 1]
Can't take it back once it's been set in motion
You know I love to rub it in like lotion
If you only pray on Sunday, could you come my way on Monday?
'Cause I like to do things God doesn't approve of if She saw us

[Pre-Chorus]
She couldn't look away, look away, look away
She'd wanna get involved, involved, involved
And what would people say, people say, people say
If they listen through the wall, the wall, the wall?

[Chorus]
I can see it clear as day
You don't really need a break
Wanna see what you can take
You should really run away

[Post-Chorus]
I wanna do bad things to you (To you)
I wanna make you yell (Yell)
I wanna do bad things to you (To you)
Don't wanna treat you well (Well)

[Verse 2]
Can't take it back once it's been set in motion
You know I need you for the oxytocin
If you find it hard to swallow, I can loosen up your collar
'Cause as long as you're still breathing
Don't you even think of leaving

[Pre-Chorus]
Not gonna wanna look away, look away, look away
You're gonna wanna get involved, involved, involved
And what would people say, people say, people say
If they listen through the wall, the wall, the wall?

[Chorus]
I can see it clear as day
You don't really need a break
Wanna see what you can take
You should really run away
Other people wouldn't stay
Other people don't obey
You and me are both the same
You should really run away

[Outro]
Bad things
To you
I wanna do bad things to you
I wanna make you yell
I wanna do bad things to you
Don't wanna treat you well

[Verse 1]
Did you think I'd show up in a limousine? (No)
Had to save my money for security
Got a stalker walkin' up and down the street
Says he's Satan and he'd like to meet
I bought a secret house when I was seventeen (Ha)
Haven't had a party since I got the keys
Had a pretty boy over, but he couldn't stay
On his way out, made him sign an NDA, mm
Yeah, I made him sign an NDA
Once was good enough
'Cause I don't want him havin' shit to say, oh-oh-oh

[Chorus]
You couldn't save me, but you can't let me go, oh, no
I can crave you, but you don't need to know, oh-oh

[Verse 2]
Mm, mm-mm, mm
30 Under 30 for another year (Another year)
I can barely go outside, I think I hate it herе (I think I hate it here)
Maybе I should think about a new career (Uh)
Somewhere in Kauai where I can disappear
I've been havin' fun gettin' older now
Didn't change my number, made him shut his mouth (Shut his mouth, yeah)
At least I gave him somethin' he can cry about
I thought about my future, but I want it now, oh-oh-oh
Want it now, mm-mm-mm
You can't give me up

[Chorus]
You couldn't save me, but you can't let me go, oh, no
I can crave you, but you don't need to know, oh-oh

[Outro]
Did I take it too far?
Now I know what you are
You hit me so hard
I saw stars
Think I took it too far
When I sold you my heart
How'd it get so dark?
I saw stars
Stars

[Verse 1]
Everybody dies, surprise, surprise
We tell each other lies, sometimes, we try
To make it feel like we might be right
We might not be alone
Be alone

[Verse 2]
"Everybody dies," that's what they say
And maybe, in a couple hundred years, they'll find another way
I just wonder why you'd wanna stay
If everybody goes
You'd still be alone

[Verse 3]
I don't wanna cry, some days I do
But not about you
It's just a lot to think about the world I'm used to
The one I can't get back, at lеast not for a while
I sure have a knack for seein' lifе more like a child
It's not my fault, it's not so wrong to wonder why
Everybody dies
And when will I?

[Verse 4]
You oughta know
That even when it's time, you might not wanna go
But it's okay to cry and it's alright to fold
But you are not alone
You are not unknown

[Intro]
Mm-mm-mm, mm-mm
Da-da-da-da

[Verse 1]
Love when it comes without a warning
'Cause waiting for it gets so boring
A lot can change in twenty seconds
A lot can happen in the dark
Love when it makes you lose your bearings
Some information's not for sharing
Use different names at hotel check-ins
It's hard to stop it once it starts (It starts)

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm not sentimental
But there's somethin' 'bout the way you look tonight, mm
Makes me wanna take a picture
Make a movie with you that we'd have to hide

[Chorus]
You better lock your phone (Oh)
And look at me whеn you're alone
Won't take a lot to gеt you goin' (Oh)
I'm sorry if it's torture though
I know, I know

[Verse 2]
It might be more of an obsession
You really make a strong impression (A strong impression)
Nobody saw me in the lobby (Saw me in the lobby)
Nobody saw me in your arms, mm

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm not sentimental
But there's somethin' 'bout the way you look tonight, mm ('Bout the way you look tonight)
Makes me wanna make 'em jealous
I'm the only one who does it how you like (Only one who does it how you—)

[Chorus]
You better lock your phone (Oh)
And look at me when you're alone (You're alone, you're alone)
Won't take a lot to get you goin' (Get me goin', get me goin')
I'm sorry if it's torture though (Torture though)
I know, I know
You better lock your door (Oh)
And look at me a little more
We both know I'm worth waitin' for (Waitin' for)
That heavy breathin' on the floor (On the floor)
I'm yours, I'm yours (I'm yours)

[Outro]
I'm not sentimental
I'm not sentimental
I'm not sentimental

[Intro]
"He hath come to the bosom of his beloved
Smiling on him, she beareth him to highest heav'n
With yearning heart"
"On thee we gaze, O' gold-wing'd messenger of mighty Gods"

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 1]
Gold-winged angel
Go home, don't tell
Anyone what you are
You're sacred and they're starved
And their art is gettin' dark
And there you are to tear apart
Tear apart, tear apart, tear apart

[Chorus]
You better keep your head down-down
Da-da-down-down, da-da-down-down
Better keep your head down-down
Da-da-down-down, da-da-down-down

[Verse 2]
They're gonna tell you what you wanna hear
Then they're gonna disappear
Gonna claim you like a souvenir
Just to sell you in a year

[Chorus]
You better keep your head down-down
Da-da-down-down, da-da-down-down
Keep your head down-down (Down)
Da-da-down-down, da-da-down-down
Better keep your head down-down
Da-da-down-down, da-da-down-down
Keep your head down-down
Da-da-down-down, da-da-down-down

[Outro]
That's good

[Intro]
Something's in the—

[Verse 1]
Something's in the air right now
Like I'm losin' track of time (Time, time)
Like I don't really care right now
But maybe that's fine
You weren't even there that day
I was waitin' on you (You, you)
I wonder if you were aware that day
Was the last straw for me and I knew

[Pre-Chorus]
I sent you flowers
Did you even care?
You ran the shower
And left them by the stairs
Ooh-ooh-ooh, a-a-a-ayy
Thought you had your shit together, but damn, I was wrong (Wrong)

[Chorus]
You ain't nothin' but a lost cause (Cause, cause)
And this ain't nothin' like it oncе was (Was, was)
I know you think you're such an outlaw
But you got no job (Job)
You ain't nothin' but a lost cause (Cause)
And this ain't nothin' likе it once was (Was)
I know you think you're such an outlaw
But you got no job

[Verse 2]
I used to think you were shy (Shy)
But maybe you just had nothing on your mind
Maybe you were thinkin' 'bout yourself all the time
I used to wish you were mine (Mine)
But that was way before I realized
Someone like you would always be so easy to find
(So) So easy (So, so)
Hee, mm-mm-mm, mm

[Pre-Chorus]
Gave me no flowers
Wish I didn't care
You'd be gone for hours
Could be anywhere
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Thought you would've grown eventually, but you proved me wrong (Wrong)

[Chorus]
You ain't nothing but a lost cause (Cause)
And this ain't nothing like it once was (Was)
I know you think you're such an outlaw (Yeah)
But you got no job (No job)
You ain't nothing but a lost cause (Cause)
And this ain't nothing like it once was (Was)
I know you think you're such an outlaw (Think you're such a lost cause)
But you got no job

[Outro]
(What did I tell you?)
(Don't get complacent)
(It's time to face it now, na-na, na-na, na-na)
(What did I tell you?)
(Don't get complacent)
(It's time to face it now, na-na, na-na, na-na)

[Chorus]
Try not to abuse your power
I know we didn't choose to change
You might not wanna lose your power
But havin' it's so strange

[Verse 1]
She said you were a hero
You played the part
But you ruined her in a year
Don't act like it was hard
And you swear you didn't know (Didn't know)
No wonder why you didn't ask
She was sleepin' in your clothes (In your clothes)
But now she's got to get to class

[Pre-Chorus]
How dare you?
And how could you?
Will you only feel bad when they find out?
If you could take it all back
Would you?

[Chorus]
Try not to abuse your power
I know we didn't choose to change
You might not wanna lose your power
But havin' it's so strange

[Verse 2]
I thought that I was special
You made me feel
Like it was my fault, you were the devil
Lost your appeal
Does it keep you in control? (In control)
For you to keep her in a cage?
And you swear you didn't know (Didn't know)
You said you thought she was your age

[Pre-Chorus]
How dare you?
And how could you?
Will you only feel bad if it turns out
That they kill your contract?
Would you?

[Chorus]
Try not to abuse your power
I know we didn't choose to change
You might not wanna lose your power
But power isn't pain

[Outro]
Mmm
Ooh
La-la-la-la-la, hmm
La-la-la-la-la-la, la-la

[Verse 1]
Home alone, tryin' not to eat
Distract myself with pornography
I hate the way she looks at me
I can't stand the dialogue, she would never be
That satisfied, it's a male fantasy
I'm goin' back to therapy

[Chorus]
'Cause I loved you then and I love you now
And I don't know how
Guess it's hard to know when nobody else comes around
If I'm getting over you
Or just pretending to
Be alright, convince myself I hate you

[Interlude]
(You want me to put it here?)
(Okay)

[Verse 2]
I got a call from a girl I used to know
We were inseparablе years ago
Thought we'd get along, but it wasn't so
And it's all I think about whеn I'm behind the wheel
I worry this is how I'm always gonna feel
But nothing lasts, I know the deal

[Chorus]
But I loved you then and I love you now
And I don't know how
Guess it's hard to know when nobody else comes around
If I'm getting over you
Or just pretending to
Be alright, convince myself I hate you

[Outro]
Can't get over you
No matter what I do
I know I should, but I could never hate you

[Verse 1: Merlyn Wood]
I sold that dope in the dormitory
I know my roommate informing on me
I told my momma she shouldn't worry
Stop taking student loans from the country
I will pay that shit off 'til I'm forty ('til I'm forty!)
I don't want to have to make McFlurries
Sellin' students single sacks got boring
My college kids facing keys like both quarters
My thug life to every lad sandstormin'
Set up shop, exhibit product like it's a car show
The shit is pure, man—what he sell the Sweet'n Low
Catchin' hell in my BM convertible
Deep Dallas in the winter, place so hard
Put that gold jump rope on the floor

[Chorus: Merlyn Wood]
You, you, you
Money dance with my crew
Yeah, you ain't knew
I had bands back in school
You, you, you
Monеy dance with my crew
Yeah, you ain't knеw
I had bands back in school

[Verse 2: Matt Champion]
F—fuck with the cops, they beating the cases
I see the pistol 'round waist and they aiming
White doesn't fly with carnations, they pain me
Family need a little sleep and serenity
Popping cherry cola like her virginity
Confidence sink on the brink of a better me
I keep an  eye open; your bitch in bed with me
Knowing that you will just bet on the death for me
I got the fragrance, throw me the cologne
Sipping so long, they love your cologne
Fuck the percentages, I want the leverage
I want the leverage
I be reserved, I do not blurt
Keep out my face with your petty lil' urge
Life like a blur, learn 'bout the curves
Skin and my body, I've been insecure

[Chorus: Merlyn Wood]
You, you, you
Money dance with my crew
Yeah, you ain't knew
I had bands back in school
You, you, you
Money dance with my crew
Yeah, you ain't knew
I had bands back in school
You, you, you
Money dance with my crew
Yeah, you ain't knew
I had bands back in school
You, you, you
Money dance with my crew
Yeah, you ain't knew
I had bands back in school

[Verse 3: Ameer Vann]
I had the dope and the digit' scale
I had to shovel that fishscale
I saw the lights and then ran from 'em
Got out of jail with a court summons
Man, it's so hard just to stop juggin'
Stealin' from niggas with one bullet
All that evil really got to me
Taking everything I got from me
Stole shit up at the penthouse
Writin' raps in the hills now
Now I'm worried if it's niggas coming
To reclaim what I stole from 'em
Drug dealers that I ran from
Coming at me with a handgun
Two shots, nigga, And-1
Now I'm dead like John Lennon

[Verse 4: Dom McLennon]
I am from another dimension
Better step to me with nine hitmen
Freeway Ricky: I'm a line kingpin
This present moment's a divine vision
Saw my past and took a dive to dig in
Couldn't make myself a pot to piss in
Motivation lacking my decisions
This felt like a holy intervention
I put that pack in my undergarments
Them boys had locked the pharma' department
Packing up pills at the base apartment
I did a taste and thought it was garbage
Never had figured to ask who grabbed it
Noticed my friends had developed habits
Men and women both reduced to savage
Just to satisfy what needed scratching
MDMA mixed with bad karma
Spliffs from Newports rolled with marijuana
Someone broke in, saw the plug
Sent the law to his moms to put a slug on 'em
Boys woke him with the straps out
They ain't know it was the stash-house
Couple decades, got evaded
'Cause he moved the last piece before he passed out

[Outro: Kevin Abstract]
Hurtin' myself, hurtin' my bitch
And I got diamonds that's hurtin' my wrist
I light the spliff and I float by myself
I need some more time to find more of myself
Hurtin' myself, hurtin' my bitch
And I got diamonds that's hurtin' my wrist
I light the spliff and I float by myself
I need some more time to find more of myself
Can't see, close your eyes now
Don't know how to tell you
I know, still mind
I know now
Follow us and see the way
I know the way
And I'm waiting on

I can see the way you lost your love
I can tell
Can you blow?
Can you blow my mind?
Can you blow?
Can you blow my mind?

I love, I lie
And farther though
Far see
Mine, mine

[Intro]
Cold, then you'll know
Cold, then you'll know

[Verse 1]
You change your mind like a girl changes clothes
Yeah, you PMS like a bitch; I would know
And you overthink, always speak cryptically
I should know that you're no good for me

[Chorus]
'Cause you're hot then you're cold
You're yes, then you're no
You're in, then you're out
You're up, then you're down
You're wrong when it's right
It's black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We kiss, we make up

[Post-Chorus]
(You) You don't really wanna stay, no
(You) But you don't really wanna go, oh
You're hot then you're cold
You're yes, thеn you're no
You're in, then you'rе out
You're up, then you're down

[Verse 2]
We used to be just like twins, so in sync
The same energy, now's a dead battery
Used to laugh (Used to laugh) 'bout nothing ('Bout nothing)
Now you're plain (Now you're plain) boring (Boring)
I should know (I should know) that you're not gonna change

[Chorus]
'Cause you're hot then you're cold
You're yes, then you're no
You're in, then you're out
You're up, then you're down
You're wrong when it's right
It's black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We kiss, we make up

[Post-Chorus]
(You) You don't really wanna stay, no
(You) But you don't really wanna go, oh
You're hot then you're cold
You're yes, then you're no
You're in, then you're out
You're up, then you're down

[Bridge]
Someone call the doctor
Got a case of a love bipolar
Stuck on a roller coaster
Can't get off this ride
You change your mind like a girl changes clothes
Someone call the doctor
Got a case of a love bipolar
Stuck on a roller coaster
Can't get off this ride

[Chorus]
You're hot then you're cold
You're yes, then you're no
You're in, then you're out
You're up, then you're down
You're wrong when it's right
It's black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We kiss, we make up
You're hot then you're cold
You're yes, then you're no
You're in, then you're out
You're up, then you're down
You're wrong when it's right
It's black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We kiss, we make up
You're hot then you're cold
You're yes, then you're no
You're in, then you're out
You're up, then you're down
You're wrong when it's right
It's black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We kiss, we make up

[Post-Chorus]
(You) You don't really wanna stay, no
(You) But you don't really wanna go, oh
You're hot then you're cold
You're yes, then you're no
You're in, then you're out
You're up, then you're down
(You) You don't really wanna stay, no
(You) But you don't really wanna go, oh

You're yes, then you're no
You're in, then you're out
You're up, then you're down

[Ascension]

[Intro: Vince Staples]
You are now tuned into the tomb of Jehova
Play my tunes loud enough to shake the room, what's the hold up?
Heard the world is ending soon I assumed that they told ya
They tryna dinosaur us so now it's time to go up

[Strobelite]

[Verse: Peven Everett]
Momentary pain can be pleasure lain
Millisecond change; magic lantern strange
Are we just too far to be as one again?
Are we obsidian? Is this how it ends?

[Saturnz Barz]

[Chorus: 2-D & Popcaan]
All my lifе
I'm in the stakin' bar, I got debts, I'm a debasеr
All my life
Saturn's about to make love and I'm just a heartbreaker
All my life
And I won't get a take in 'cause I'm out when I'm stakin
And the rings I am breakin' are makin' you a personal day

[Momentz]

[Chorus: Posdnuos]
Clocks on the wall
Talk to watches on the wrist
It's the moments we relive
It's the moments like this
When it's time to get ill
We be so ahead of time
It's the moments we achieve
Best believe it's the moments

[Submission]

[Verse: Danny Brown]
Wish I could think of better ways
'Cause I lost my patience yesterday
If you could see inside of me
There'd be no heart on my X-ray
Opponents tryna checkmate
But I don't see no escape
Just tryna keep my head straight
On thin ice with the ice skates

[Charger]

[Verse: 2-D]
A cha-charger, everything is supposed to get in
I just don't know where I'm a-getting it from
A cha-charger, what is the cause of it?
And well in that case, how do you know it's your own?
A cha-charger, what do you say now?
Thought you could use it when the flowers have grown
A cha-charger, what did you do in it?
I bet you're racing it, I'm left in a stew, shukuchi

[Andromeda]

[Chorus: 2-D]
Take it in your heart now, love her

[Busted and Blue]

[Verse: 2-D]
Where do they come from?
The wires that connect to us
Weightless and fall on your body

[Carnival]

[Verse: Anthony Hamilton]
We play to win, just to find the dark
Go home again, and we both fall out

[Let Me Out]

[Chorus: 2-D]
Something I've begun to fear is about to change its form
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's a shift in times
But I won't get tired at all
Let Me Out

[Sex Murder Party]

[Chorus: 2-D]
I drove the keys
I drove the keys
In the seas
Of your priority
Dissolve the keys
Dissolve the keys
In the seas
Of your priorities

[She’s My Collar]

[Verse: 2-D]
She's the serpentine, she's my collar
I send a message, never call her
And now I wanna taste another
And it's safe in a persona, she's my collar

[Hallelujah Money]

[Chorus: Benjamin Clementine & (The Humanz Choir)]
Hallelujah

Hallelujah money
(Past the chemtrails)
Hallelujah money

We got the power to be
Ringing the great bell out there above us
We got the power to do that

[Intro: Dave Chappelle]
"What is happening in Hollywood that a guy that tough will be on the street waving a gun, screaming, 'They are trying to kill me'?What's going on? Why is Dave Chappelle going to Africa? Why does Mariah Carrey make a $100,000,000 deal and take her clothes off on TRL? A weak person cannot get to sit here and talk to you. Ain't no weak people talking to you. So what is happening in Hollywood? Nobody knows! The worst thing to call someone is crazy. It's dismissive. 'I don't understand this person, so they're crazy'. That's bullshit. These people are not crazy, they strong people. Maybе their environment is a littlе sick."

[Chorus: Jeremih & Choir]
And I know that somebody been praying for me
Head above ground and I could've been six feet deep
Out on these streets, when I get down on my knees
I'm thankful (Thankful), I'm thankful (Thankful)
I'ma blow this bag for everybody who counted me out
And I still got love for all my dawgs who holding me down
Head above ground for my niggas and my dons
I'm thankful (Thankful), I'm thankful (Thankful)

[Verse 1: Jeremih & Choir]
I done dodged a few heartbreaks, yeah
Never lost a thing I can't replace yet
Couple times, thought I wouldn't make it (Thought I wouldn't make it)
Then I came up ten toes out thе basement
I done had to mutе, fuck noise
Did a couple things, they left me no choice
I done hit some licks that my mama won't be proud of
Said we gon' be rich, give her something she can smile for
The devil on the block and he lurking
Tryna hit me up with a dozen
But when I look around, shit ain't worth it
That's for certain, yeah

[Chorus: Jeremih & Choir]
And I know that somebody been praying for me
Head above ground and I could've been six feet deep

[Refrain: Jeremih & Choir]
But I'm still out here making moves, ooh
I'ma do what I got to, I'ma do what I got to
Too many niggas gone too soon (I'm gonna do what I got to)
Ain't tryna lay up in a box two feet wide, six deep
You won't catch no RIP's off me
I'ma do what I got to (I'ma do what I got to)
I'm gonna do what I got to (I'ma do what I got to)
Somebody's been praying for me, for me

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Sit down, be thankful
Big smile although it's painful
I look up and see clouds, weed angels
Seen white chalk make street angels
You're welcome, look down, feet dangles
Be proud, be shameless
Yeah, be now, be ancient
Yeah, it been my turn, let me cut off these blinkers
I cut off these strangers and ifs ands and buts of the strangers
I never relinquish, I'm thanking Franklin as an acquaintance
Destiny danger, I done seen from every angle
From my neck to my ankle, the spots on this leopard ain't changing
Nigga, that's for the wankstas, 50 told me that, I say thank you
I been got the bag, I done turned that to the blanket
I been out of hand so I don't wanna dap 'less you banging
I'm being quiet, man, just waiting for these rappers to thank me, de nada

[Interlude: Robert Ontenient]
"To get to, like, - My favorite thing about Miami is how much of a melting pot it is. Like second to New York, I don't think I've ever been to, like, another city where, like, there's so many cultures, and like anywhere you go, like if you go to the mall, you'll hear like 15 different languages. That's an exaggeration, but like... y'know, it's like that out there. Anyways, this next song is a Miami classic. Played before a lot of sporting events, including Miami Heat games. It's callеd "Take It to Da House", Trick Daddy, Slip-N-Slide Exprеss."

It's black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We kiss, we make up

[Post-Chorus]
(You) You don't really wanna stay, no
(You) But you don't really wanna go, oh
You're hot then you're cold
You're yes, then you're no
You're in, then you're out
You're up, then you're down

[Verse 1]
You change your mind like a girl changes clothes
Yeah, you PMS like a bitch; I would know
And you overthink, always speak cryptically
I should know that you're no good for me

[Chorus]
'Cause you're hot then you're cold
You're yes, then you're no
You're in, then you're out
You're up, then you're down
You're wrong when it's right
It's black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We kiss, we make up

[Post-Chorus]
(You) You don't really wanna stay, no
(You) But you don't really wanna go, oh
You're hot then you're cold
You're yes, then you're no
You're in, then you're out
You're up, then you're down

[Verse 2]
We used to be just like twins, so in sync
The same energy, now's a dead battery
Used to laugh (Used to laugh) 'bout nothing ('Bout nothing)
Now you're plain (Now you're plain) boring (Boring)
I should know (I should know) that you're not gonna change

[Chorus]
'Cause you're hot then you're cold
You're yes, then you're no
You're in, then you're out
You're up, then you're down
You're wrong when it's right
It's black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We kiss, we make up

[Post-Chorus]
(You) You don't really wanna stay, no
(You) But you don't really wanna go, oh
You're hot then you're cold
You're yes, then you're no
You're in, then you're out
You're up, then you're down

[Bridge]
Someone call the doctor
Got a case of a love bipolar
Stuck on a roller coaster
Can't get off this ride
You change your mind like a girl changes clothes

[Chorus]
'Cause you're hot then you're cold
You're yes, then you're no
You're in, then you're out
You're up, then you're down
You're wrong when it's right
It's black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We kiss, we make up
You're hot then you're cold
You're yes, then you're no
You're in, then you're out
You're up, then you're down
You're wrong when it's right
It's black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We kiss, we make up

[Post-Chorus]
(You) You don't really wanna stay, no
(You) But you don't really wanna go, oh
You're hot then you're cold
You're yes, then you're no
You're in, then you're out
You're up, then you're down

[Verse 1]
Why do I keep
Coming back to this?
It's like a book I can't quite figure out
So I read it in pieces

[Refrain]
Sometimes it hurts
Gotta set it down for a bit
But I always come back to this
Ooh

[Verse 2]
Why do I keep
Running into this?
Every time I make a wrong turn
I end up on your doorstep

[Refrain]
Sometimes it hurts
Gotta step away for a bit
But I always come back to this
I always come back to this

[Verse 3]
And maybe I'm stupid
For thinking the world might end
And maybe I'm stupid
For thinking you'd be with me when it did
And maybe you'd be better off
If you never saw me again
Again

[Verse 4]
But God damn, I keep
Comin' back to this
I try to understand
But I can't make it make sense

[Verse 5]
Maybe it's time to just
Kinda go with it
'cause еven if its not now
I will end up herе somehow
It's physics or it's fate
And I can't stop it

[Refrain]
I always come back to this
I always come back to this

[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
A fire needs a space to burn
A breath to build a flame
And you have been my candlelight
So well contained
By burning you at every end
I tried to keep control
Now buried in the very flame
I could not let go

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
'Cause you don't know what you've got
Oh, you don't know what you've got
No, you don't know what you've got
'Til it's gone
'Til it's gone
'Til it's gone...

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
A fire needs a space to burn
A breath to build a glow
And I could finally see your light
When I let go

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
'Cause you don't know what you've got
Oh, you don't know what you've got
No, you don't know what you've got
'Til it's gone
'Til it's gone
'Til it's gone...

[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
A fire needs a space to burn
A breath to build a flame
And you have been my candlelight
So well contained

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
'Cause you won’t know what you've got
You won't know what you’ve got
Until it's gone

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
By burning you at every end
I tried to keep control
Now buried in the very flame
I could not let go

[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]

I get up whenever I fall, don't try me, it's gonna end up in a brawl (On God)

I'm gettin' out my own way
'Cause these days, I ain't tryna complicate things
My heart's in the right place
I'm setting my intentions, manifesting good change
And life gets hard, but a purpose
Has gotta make the bad days worth the tears
So I'll just be still, be still

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
'Cause things are happening that I can't see (See)
And if I got patience, then I got peace (Peace)
I have to let go, lеt go, let go of everything (Thing)
And watch what happеns when I break free (Free)

Just be, just be, just be (Just be), me

[Verse 2: Justin Timberlake]
I'm moving like the wind (Yeah)

Trust in myself to work it out
Wherever life got me going
Mindful of the future
Still grateful for the past
If all I got is right here and right now
I'ma make the moment last

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
'Cause things are happening that I can't see (See)

I ain't worried 'bout a storm
'Cause I'm built for any weather, yeah, that's what I know
How do I get my flowers?

Mm, I'm focused on the future
But grateful for the past
If all I got is right here and right now
I'ma make the moment last

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Timberlake]

Scratched a million off my checklist three years ago
Add two zeros to the one, I'm in a different mode
This my life, do what I want, I be with different hoes
You know the pick and roll, I picked her up and sent her home
I got rich off strong, we get ’em in and get 'em gone
You know Trappy just got out, I ain't have to put him on
We the ones who got the numbers, who put the city on
It’s the middle of the summer, I got a hoodie on
My demon time ain't nothin' nice
I try not to wear nothin' twice
I came up off of shootin' dice, yeah
My lil' brother ain't livin' right
My sis’ and ’em doin' aight
My cuz and ’em still servin' life, yeah
Seen a robber rob a deacon
I seen a preacher get caught for cheatin'
I'll break the bank for one of my people

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
I'ma turn up on a hater every chance that I get
I want the biggest watch that they got, don't care if that shit hurt my wrist

Soon as they say we can't come, you know we'll run 'round that bitch
You can miss me with that shit, you know I live in the mix (Money, cars and clothes and hoes)
You know I live in the mix (Money, cars and clothes and hoes)

Yeah, she think I'm a regular rapper, I'm not
One person come tell me we fuckin', you blocked
Watch me run this shit to the tippity-top, yeah (Keep goin')
Put my kids in Givenchy
She must think one plus one is three
I can't support your personal needs
She don't got a mortgage, moved in with her niece
These niggas be cappin', them cars be leased
Youngest in charge, I speak for the streets
I was nodding off, they woke up a beast
Struggle what made me, we used to have water for dinner, we didn't have nothin' to eat
Soon as I get on his ass, they gon' look at me better, like, "Damn, he was fuckin' with me," yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 3: Lil Durk]
I'm from the trenches
Niggas be tough on the 'net, but really be there for attention
Well, bitches be talkin' like they really rich, but really be beggin' me under my pictures
I'll give her forty, fifty thousand cash to start up a business
I'll spend that shit at the dentist
I'd rather fuck her and pay up her rent for a year just to get out of her feelings
I'm in the Lambo' truck in my hood, nobody gon' tell me shit
Goin' to Cali, I pick up my weed for sure, nobody gon' mail me shit
Dice game, Craps and Cee-Lo, I need cash, don't sell me shit
Baby got his hood on smash, yeah, you can tell they really rich
Drop the lo', ain't no room right now, I took her to the O
Then I pulled up on the Lam' 'cause she a fan of Boonie Moe
I got the city on lock, uh, fuckin' up all the opps
I be around with three million dollars in jewelry, I'm standin' on all the blocks
This the anthem, mmm-hmm
Droppin' the six in the Fanta, mmm
Black Rolls truck with the all-white seats, remind me of sittin' on panda, mmm

Straight drop dead, Len Bias (That's right)
My trap spot straight fire (Come on)
Runnin' through the courts, made it playin' like a sport (Huh)
Set the streets on fire, left it burnin' like a torch (Take that)
All I want is two-doors, gave the charges to the boys
Now I'm bigger than the blogs, now the topic on the Forbes (Woo, come on)
Catch a fed charge, now we pardoned by the laws
Niggas better stay in line or I'ma sit 'em in the morgue (Come on)
Heaven on earth, half a million on a watch (Watch)
Three bands on a sweater just to let a nigga watch (Boss)
Nigga wanna ride the wave, so I let him hold the yacht
Cuban links for the team, double M on the lock (Double M)
305 the code if you wanna get a block
You can send in Bitcoins, time to triple it with stocks (That's right)
All eyes on me, you niggas livin' in a box (Huh)
Got the haters leavin' comments while I'm really sendin' shots (Biggest)

[Interlude: Diddy & A Boogie wit da Hoodie]
Ayo, I told y'all the motherfuckin' first time I was never gon' stop, yeah (Love, love in the sky)
Ten years from now it's— but that was thirty fucking years ago, motherfuckers (As I kiss your bitch goodnight)
Get used to it, like the fuckin' air you breathe
The first shall be last and the last shall be first (Love, love in the sky)
Black motherfuckin' rich shit (As I kiss your bitch goodnight)
Ownership shit
Godly shit (When I bust, you just move)
Yeah
As we proceed to give you what you need
Come on, man, we wasn't talkin' shit
What the fuck you thought? (When I bust, you just move)
We here
Y'all motherfuckers actin' like y'all got amnesia or something
The truth will set you free
The truth will set you free, son
Ayo, I put this thing together

[Chorus: A Boogie wit da Hoodie, Diddy, & Both]

[Verse 1: Nas]
Hear ye, hear ye, only kings stand near me
Silicon Valley money mixed with Henny, that's Effendi
Half a century almost, sliced the green like a lawnmower
'Til we all on, never fall off, hear a boss talk
You don't hear me? That's your loss
Winner in life, fuck a coin toss
I'm coin-based, basically cryptocurrency Scarface
Join us, there’s gotta be more of us
I’m from the ghetto, what location? Two seconds from the Devil
I live heavenly in Cabo, with a Mexican sombrero
Drink heavily, health is wealth (Health is wealth)
Look at wealthy me, wipe your nose, HSTRY my type of clothes
Miss me with the hate, helped so many people get cake
Whips in cream for the crew, no other weed, I think faster
The time I spit this, I started some other business (Some other business)
Came from the pitchin' (Came from the pitchin’), 'caine in the kitchen
Dangerous missions, wastin' your time if you want my forgiveness (Forgiveness)

[Chorus: James Fauntleroy]
Sorry, not sorry, don't mind me
I’m livin' the dream, livin' a dream, yeah
Came from nothin', whoever thought that we would be

Sorry, that's another B
Haters still ain't recover from the other B
Mm, that's a double B
Nah, that's a triple B, can't forget 'bout the other Bey (Hey)
It's the white gloves for me
Hater know not to touch me, I'm with the fuckery (Fuck with me)
Humbly (Humbly), nah, respectfully
I'm a project baby, fuck y'all expect from me? (Technically)
'Merica's disrespect for me
You killed Christ, you created religion, unexpectedly
Circular ice on Japanese whiskey, on my mezzanine
Overlookin' the City of Angels, the angel investor in things
Unprecedented run (Facts)
Everybody's gettin' bands, we just dance to different drums (Bram, bram, bram, bram, bram, bram)
I like who I've become
Intermittent fasting, but these meals, I'm not missin' none (Sorry)

[Chorus: James Fauntleroy]
Sorry, not sorry, don't mind me
I'm livin' the dream, livin' a dream, yeah
Came from nothin', whoever thought that we would be

DJ Khaled

[Verse 1: H.E.R. & DJ Khaled]
Knew I was special from a young age (Come on)
Knew I would take some shit to my grave
Hope that the problems that I became to some niggas that I snaked
Don't catch up to me someday
But karma my bitch and she working for me (What else?)
One time for the niggas who still adore me (What else?)
'Cause it's some broads out here fucking for forty
And I'm just tryna make somebody son fall in love before forty
I been on some wild shit (Wild shit)
Coming out the bank with a mortgage deposit (Deposit)
Made myself a promise I'ma win
(I'ma win)
Never again, broke up, broken hearted

[Chorus: H.E.R.]
And I'm staring at the fountain blue from the balcony
Running a mile or if I was tryna chase a dream
'Cause I can have it all, I can have it (I can have it)
I can have it all, I can have it (I can have it)
Ain't got no hate in my blood or no jealousy
Know it's somebody, it's somebody out there just for me
And I can have it all, I can have it (I can have it)
I can have it all, I can have it (I can have it)

[Post-Chorus: H.E.R.]
I could feel it in the air (The air)

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Yeah, riding with my billionaire homie, I got the Glock up on me
He always asking me why I got it? Be tryna hide it from him
He told me "Why don't you get some security? You got a lot of money"
But I can't get this shit out my heart that took my father from me
Shit, do you know the feeling of success?
When you young and you black but you stressed and you blessed
And you gotta wake up every single morning, do your best
And when you get your cake up niggas gon' try you on the 'net
I had to switch way up 'cause I can't die by my respect
I got kids I gotta feed, I got a momma that can't grieve
When it was slow and niggas left, I made my mind up, I can't leave
Plus homie doing life, shit, I got guys that got free
Juveniles don't get no life at seventeen, he was eighteen
They gave him life so we gotta pray and believe
And try to squeeze on every resource that we know that he need
We must achieve
And once we see him we gon' go and succeed
The heart of Creed, I'm from Philly, nigga

[Bridge: H.E.R. & Meek Mill]
From the balcony I see the fountain blue (Know where I'm from)
Over the bridge is muddy waters, 'til your dreams come true
But I can have it all, I can have it (I can have it)
I can have it all, I can have it (I can have it)
From the balcony I see the fountain blue
Over the bridge is muddy waters, 'til your dreams come true
But I can have it all, I can have it (I can have it)
I can have it all, I can have it (I can have it)

[Verse 3: H.E.R.]
Who knew it would be worth all of the losses?
Hopped in the Bentley, ain't even worry what the cost is
I know you out there tryna sell your soul for profit
We gotta count all of the blessings 'cause it's God sent
Standing on the edge right now
I said I'm standing on the edge right now
And if the walls come down
If it all come down
If it come down

[Chorus: H.E.R.]
Staring at the fountain blue from the balcony
Running a mile or if I was tryna chase a dream
'Cause I can have it all, I can have it (I can have it)
I can have it all, I can have it (I can have it)
Ain't got no hate in my blood or no jealousy
Know it's somebody, it's somebody out there just for me
And I can have it all, I can have it (I can have it)
I can have it all, I can have it (I can have it)

[Outro: H.E.R.]
I could feel it in the air (The air)

I think it's time we found some sort of solution
Somebody's caught up in the endless pollution
They need to wake up, stop living illusions

[Pre-Chorus]

Why won’t somebody feel this?
This is my wish that we all feel connected
This is my wish that nobody's neglected
Be like a rocket, baby

I see through you like glass and all of your fake smiles
Don't talk about love Lil shorty, you still just a child

Oh, you should know by now I'm impatient

[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
Memories consume, like opening the wound
I'm picking me apart again
You all assume I'm safe here in my room
Unless I try to start again

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I don't want to be the one the battles always choose
'Cause inside, I realize that I'm the one confused

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I don't know what's worth fighting for or why I have to scream
I don't know why I instigate and say what I don't mean
I don't know how I got this way, I know it's not alright
So, I'm breaking the habit
I'm breaking the habit tonight

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
Clutching my cure, I tightly lock the door
I try to catch my breath again
I hurt much more than anytime before
I had no options left again

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I don't want to be the one the battles always choose
'Cause inside, I realize that I'm the one confused

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I don't know what's worth fighting for or why I have to scream
I don't know why I instigate and say what I don't mean
I don't know how I got this way, I'll never be alright
So, I'm breaking the habit
I'm breaking the habit tonight

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
I'll paint it on the walls 'cause I'm the one at fault
I'll never fight again and this is how it ends

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I don't know what's worth fighting for or why I have to scream
But now I have some clarity to show you what I mean
I don't know how I got this way, I'll never be alright
So, I'm breaking the habit
I'm breaking the habit
I’m breaking the habit tonight

[Intro]
Don't pay me no mind, I'll be fine
I'll pull myself together this time

[Verse 1]
You're right when you're right, but I'm always wrong
You could never get to me, I'm always on all night
Leaving when it's light and I'm walking home
Talkin' to myself like I've been on the phone all night
Alright

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll give you all I got

[Chorus]
Don't pay me no mind, I'll be fine
I'll pull myself together this time
I'll try to be someone who could hold up, hold up alone
I'll try to be someone who could hold up, hold up on their own

[Verse 2]
Took me more than a couple years
To see you around, it's nicе to hear you're alright
Still have my trophiеs on the wall
Been a while since I went and outroped them all and that's alright
Alright

[Pre-Chorus]
I gave you all I got
I didn't know
I gave you all I had, so

[Chorus]
Don't pay me no mind, I'll be fine
I'll pull myself together this time
I'll try to be someone who could hold up, hold up alone
I'll try to be someone who could hold up, hold up on their own

[Intro: Chester Bennington]
…Room to breathe
'Bout to…
Break
Breathe
I'm about to break
Breathe
I need room to breathe
Breathe
I need room to breathe
Breathe
I need room to breathe

[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
I cannot take this anymore
Saying everything I've said before
All these words, they make no sense
I found bliss in ignorance
Less I hear, the less you say
You'll find that out anyway

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
I find the answers aren't so clear
Wish I could find a way to disappear
All these thoughts, they make no sense
I found bliss in ignorance
Nothing seems to go away
Over and over again

[Interlude: Chester Bennington]
Over and over again
Over and over again
Over and over again
Over and over again
Just like before
Like before
Like before
Like before
Like before

[Chorus: Chester Bennington with Mike Shinoda]
Everything you say to me…
And I'm about to break (Like before)
I need a little room to breathe…
And I'm about to break (Like before)
Everything you say to me…
And I'm about to break (Like before)
I need a little room to breathe…
And I'm about to break (Like before)

[Verse 3: Jonathan Davis, Chester Bennington]
These are the places where I can feel
Torn from my body, my flesh, it peels
During this ride, we can cut up what we like (I'm about to break)
Waiting alone, I cannot resist
Feeling this hate I have never missed
Please, someone give me a reason to rip off my face
Blood is a-pouring, and pouring, and pouring
And pouring, and pouring, and pouring, and pouring
And pouring, and pouring, and pouring, and pouring (Shut up when I'm talkin' to you)

[Bridge: Chester Bennington, Jonathan Davis]
Shut up (Blood is pouring)
Shut up (Blood is pouring)
Shut up (Blood is pouring)
Shut up when I'm talkin' to you
Shut up (Blood is pouring)
Shut up (Blood is pouring)
Shut up (Blood is pouring)
Shut up
I'm about to break

[Chorus: Chester Bennington with Jonathan Davis, with Mike Shinoda]
Everything you say to me… I'm about to break
I need a little room to breathe… I'm about to break
Everything you say to me… and I'm about to break
I need a little room to breathe… and I'm about to…
Everything you say to me
(Takes me one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to break)
I need a little room to breathe
('Cause I'm one step closer to the edge
I'm about to break)
Everything you say to me
(Takes me one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to break)
I need a little room to breathe
('Cause I'm one step closer to the edge)
And I'm about to…

[Intro: Jay-Z & Mike Shinoda]
*Laughing*
You wastin' your talent, Randy!
Yeah, ready?

[Chorus 1: Mike Shinoda]
It’s like I'm paranoid lookin' over my back
It’s like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside is right…

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda & (Chester Bennington)]
Why does it look like night today?
Something inside's not right today
Why am I so uptight today?
Paranoia's all I got left
I don't know what stressed me first
Or how the pressure was fed
But I know just what it feels like
To have a voice in the back of my head
It’s like a face that I hold inside
Face that awakes when I close my eyes
Face that watches еvery time they liе
Face that laughs every time they fall
(And watches everything)
So you know that when it’s time to sink or swim
That the face inside is hearing me
Right underneath my skin

[Chorus 1: Mike Shinoda]
It's like I’m paranoid lookin' over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can’t stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside is right…

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
You know I thug 'em, fuck 'em, love 'em, leave 'em
'Cause I don't fuckin' need 'em
Take 'em out the hood, keep 'em lookin' good
But I don't fuckin' feed 'em
First time they fuss I'm breezin'
Talkin' 'bout, "What's the reasons?"
I'm a pimp in every sense of the word, bitch
Better trust than believe 'em
In the cut where I keep 'em
'Til I need a nut, 'til I need to beat the guts
Then it's, "beep beep" and I'm pickin' 'em up
Let 'em play with the dick in the truck
Many chicks wanna put Jigga fist in cuffs
Divorce him and split his bucks
Just because you got good head, I'ma break bread
So you can be livin' it up?
Shit, I parts with nothin', y'all be frontin'
Me give my heart to a woman?
Not for nothin', never happen
I'll be forever mackin'
Heart cold as assassins, I got no passion
I got no patience
And I hate waitin'
Ho get yo' ass in
And let's ri-i-i-i-i-ide
Check 'em out now
Ri-i-i-i-i-ide, yeah
Let's ri-i-i-i-i-ide
Check 'em out now
Ri-i-i-i-i-ide, yeah

[Chorus 2: Jay-Z]
We doin' Big Pimpin', we spendin' cheese
(Check 'em out now)
Big Pimpin', on B.L.A.D.'s
We doin' Big Pimpin' up in NYC
It's just that Jigga Man, Pimp C, and B-U-N-B
(Yo, yo, yo!) Big Pimpin', spendin' cheese
We doin' Big Pimpin', on B.L.A.D.'s
We doin' Big Pimpin' up in NYC
It's just that Jigga Man, Pimp C, and B-U-N-B (B-B)

[Intro: Jay-Z & Mike Shinoda]
Uh-huh uh-huh, jigga what (Yeah)
Uh-huh uh-huh, jigga who
Uh-huh uh-huh, jigga what
Uh-huh uh-huh, jigga who
Uh-huh uh-huh, jigga what
You gon' need a vocalin right?
Yeah

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Motherfuckers wanna act loco
Hit 'em up, numerous shots with the fo'-fo'
Faggots wanna talk to po-po's, smoke 'em like coco
Fuck rap, coke by the boatload
Fuck that on the run-by, gun high, one eye closed
Left holes through some guy clothes
Stop your bullshit, Glock with the full clip
Motherfuckers better duck when the fool spit
One shot could make a nigga do a full flip
See the nigga layin' shocked when the fool hit
Hey ma, how you know niggas wanna buy you
But see me I wanna fuck for free like Akinyele
Take this ride, make you feel it insidе your belly
If it's tight, get the K-Y Jеlly
All night get you wide up inside the telly
Side to side, 'til you say, "Jay-Z, you're too much for me"

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
I am a little bit of loneliness, a little bit of disregard
Handful of complaints, but I can't help the fact
That everyone can see these scars
I am what I want you to want, what I want you to feel
But it's like no matter what I do, I can't convince you
To just believe this is real

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
So I let go, watching you
Turn your back like you always do
Face away and pretend that I'm not
I'll be here 'cause you're all that I've got

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
Woo, woo, uh!
Got a condo with nothin' but condoms in it
The same place where the rhymes is invented
So all I do is rap and sex
Imagine how I stroke, see how I was flowin' on my last cassette
Rapid-fire like I'm blastin' a TEC, never jam though
Never get hot, never run out of ammo
Niggas hatin' and shit 'cause I slayed your bitch
You know your favorite, I know it made you sick
And now you're actin' raw but you never had war
Don't know how to carry your hoes, wanna marry your ho
Now she's mad at me 'cause Your Majesty
Just happened to be a pimp—what a tragedy
She want us to end, 'cause I fucked her friend
She gave me one more chance and I fucked her again
I seen her tears as she busted in
I said, "Shit, there's a draft, shut the door bitch and come on in!"

[Verse 4: Mike Shinoda]
I am a little bit insecure, a little unconfident
'Cause you don't understand I do what I can
But sometimes, I don't make sense
I am what you never wanna say
But I've never had a doubt
It's like no matter what I do, I can't convince you
For once, just to hear me out

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
So I let go, watching you
Turn your back like you always do
Face away and pretend that I'm not
And I'll be here 'cause you're all that I've got

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I can't feel the way I did before
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored
Time won't heal this damage anymore
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
No, hear me out, now
You're gonna listen to me, like it or not
Right now, hear me out, now
You're gonna listen to me, like it or not
Right now
I can't feel the way I did before
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I can't feel the way I did before
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored
Time won't heal this damage anymore
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored

[Outro: Chester Bennington]
I can't feel
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored
Time won't heal
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored

[Intro: Chester Bennington]
"I ordered a Frappuccino, where's my fucking Frappuccino?"
"Alright, let's do this."

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
When I pretend everything is what I want it to be
I look exactly like what you had always wanted to see
When I pretend, I can forget about the criminal I am
Stealing second after second just 'cause I know I can, but
I can't pretend this is the way it'll stay, I'm just
Trying to bend the truth
I can't pretend I'm who you want me to be so I'm
Lying my way from

[Chorus: Jay Z]
If you feelin' like a pimp, nigga, go and brush your shoulders off
Ladies is pimps too, go and brush your shoulders off
Niggas is crazy, baby, don't forget that boy told you
Get that dirt off your shoulder

[Verse 2: Jay Z]
I probably owe it to y'all, probably be lockеd by the force
Tryin' to hustle somе things that go with the Porsche
Feelin' no remorse, feelin' like my hand was forced
Middle finger to the law, nigga, grippin' my balls
Said the ladies, they love me
From the bleachers they screamin'
All the ballers is bouncin', they like the way I be leanin'
All the rappers be hatin' off the track that I'm makin'
But all the hustlers, they love it, just to see one of us make it
Came from the bottom of bottom, to the Top of the Pops
Nigga, London, Japan and I'm straight off the block
Like a running back, get it? Man, I'm straight off the block
I can run it back, nigga, ‘cause I'm straight with the Roc, c'mon

[Chorus (extended): Jay Z]
If you feelin' like a pimp, nigga, go and brush your shoulders off
Ladies is pimps too, go and brush your shoulders off
Niggas is crazy, baby, don't forget that boy told you
Get that dirt off your shoulder
You gotta get that dirt off your shoulder
You gotta get that dirt off your shoulder
You gotta get that dirt off your shoulder
You gotta get that dirt off your shoulder

[Verse 3: Jay Z]
Your homie Hov' in position, in the kitchen with soda
I just whipped up a watch, tryin' to get me a Rover
Tryin' to stretch out the coca, like a wrestler, yessir
Keep the Heckler close, you know them smokers'll test ya
But, like, 52 cards went out, I'm through dealin'
Now 52 bars come out, now you feel 'em
Now 52 cars roll out, remove ceilin'
In case 52 broads come out, now you chillin'
With a boss, bitch, of course, S.C. on the sleeve
At the 40/40 club, ESPN on the screen
I paid a grip for the jeans, plus the slippers is clean
No chrome on the wheels, I'm a grown-up for real, chill

[Verse 4: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
Yeah, I remember what they taught to me
Remember condescending talk of who I ought to be
Remember listenin' to all of that and this again
So I pretended up a person who was fittin' in
And now you think this person really is me and I'm
Trying to bend the truth
But the more I push, the more I'm pulling away 'cause I'm
Lying my way from

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & (Mike Shinoda)]
You (nah, no turning back now)
I wanna be pushed aside, so let me go
(Nah, no turning back now)
Let me take me back my life, I'd rather be all alone
(No turning back now)
Anywhere on my own, 'cause I can see
(Nah, no turning back now)
The very worst part of you, the very worst part of you
Is me

[Bridge: Mike Shinoda]
This isn't what I wanted to be
I never thought that what I said would have you running from me
Like this, this isn't what I wanted to be
I never thought that what I said would have you running from me Like this, this isn't what I wanted to be
I never thought that what I said would have you running from me
Like this, this isn't what I wanted to be
I never thought that what I said would have you running from me
Like this

[Chorus: Chester Bennington (Jay-Z & Mike Shinoda)]
You (no turning back now)
I wanna be pushed aside, so let me go
(Nah, no turning back now)
Let me take me back my life, I'd rather be all alone
(No turning back now)
Anywhere on my own, 'cause I can see
(Nah, no turning back now)
The very worst part of you, the very worst part of you
Is me

[Outro: Jay-Z]
Biatch!
My name is H-to-the-O-V
I used to move snowflakes by the O-Z
I guess even back then you can call me
CEO of the R-O-C, Hov'!
Fresh out the fryin pan into the fire
I be the, music biz number one supplier
Flyer/flier than a piece of paper bearin my name
Got the hottest chick in the game wearin my chain, that's right
Not D.O.C
But similar to them letters, "No One Can Do it Better"
I check cheddar like a food inspеctor
My homey Strict told me, "Dude finish your brеakfast"
So that's what I'ma do, take you back to the dude
With the Lexus, fast-forward the jewels and the necklace
Let me tell you dudes what I do to protect this
I shoot at you actors like movie directors mother...
Well I don't mind stealing bread
From the mouths of decadents
But I can't feed on the powerless
When my cup's already overfilled

Yeah
But it's on the table
The fire's cooking
And they're farming babies
The slaves are all working

Blood is on the table
The mouths are all choking
But I'm goin' hungry
Yeah

I don't mind stealing bread
From the mouths of decadents
But I can't feed on the powerless
When my cup's already overfilled
But it's on the table
The fire is cooking
And they're farming babies
The slaves are all working

And it's on the table
Their mouths are all choking
But I'm going hungry (Going hungry)
I'm going hungry (Going hungry)
I'm going hungry (Going hungry)

[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
This is my December
This is my time of the year
This is my December
This is all so clear

This is my December
This is my snow-covered home
This is my December
This is me, alone

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
(And I) Just wish that I didn't feel
Like there was something I missed
(And I) Take back all the things I said
To make you feel like that
(And I) Just wish that I didn't feel
Like there was something I missed
(And I) Take back all the things
That I said to you

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
And I'd give it all away
Just to have somewhere to go to
Give it all away
To have someone to come home to

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
This is my December
These are my snow-covered trees
This is me pretending
This is all I need

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
(And I) Just wish that I didn't feel
Like there was something I missed
(And I) Take back all the things I said
To make you feel like that
(And I) Just wish that I didn't feel
Like there was something I missed
(And I) Take back all the things
That I said to you

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
And I'd give it all away
Just to have somewhere to go to
Give it all away
To have someone to come home to

[Verse 3: Chester Bennington]
This is my December
This is my time of the year
This is my December
This is all so clear

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Give it all away
Just to have somewhere to go to
Give it all away
To have someone to come home to
Give it all away
Just to have somewhere to go to
Give it all away
To have someone to come home to

[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
Memories consume, like opening the wound
I'm picking me apart again
You all assume I'm safe here in my room
Unless I try to start again

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I don't want to be the one the battles always choose
'Cause inside, I realize that I'm the one confused

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I don't know what's worth fighting for or why I have to scream
I don't know why I instigate and say what I don't mean
I don't know how I got this way, I know it's not alright
So, I'm breaking the habit
I'm breaking the habit tonight

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
Clutching my cure, I tightly lock the door
I try to catch my breath again
I hurt much more than anytime before
I had no options left again

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I don't want to be the one the battles always choose
'Cause inside, I realize that I'm the one confused

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I don't know what's worth fighting for or why I have to scream
I don't know why I instigate and say what I don't mean
I don't know how I got this way, I'll never be alright
So, I'm breaking the habit
I'm breaking the habit tonight

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
I'll paint it on the walls 'cause I'm the one at fault
I'll never fight again and this is how it ends

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I don't know what's worth fighting for or why I have to scream
But now I have some clarity to show you what I mean
I don't know how I got this way, I'll never be alright
So, I'm breaking the habit
I'm breaking the habit
I’m breaking the habit tonight

[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
I've lied to you
The same way that I always do
This is the last smile
That I'll fake for the sake of being with you

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
Everything falls apart, even the people
Who never frown eventually break down
The sacrifice of hiding in a lie
Everything has to end, you'll soon find
We're out of time left to watch it all unwind
The sacrifice is never knowing

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Why I never walked away, why I played myself this way
Now I see you're testing me pushes me away
Why I never walked away, why I played myself this way
Now I see you're testing me pushes me away

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
I've tried, like you
To do everything you wanted to
This is the last time
I'll take the blame for the sake of being with you

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
Everything falls apart, even the people
Who never frown eventually break down
The sacrifice of hiding in a lie
Everything has to end, you'll soon find
We're out of time left to watch it all unwind
The sacrifice is never knowing

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Why I never walked away, why I played myself this way
Now I see you're testing me pushes me away
Why I never walked away, why I played myself this way
Now I see you're testing me pushes me away

[Bridge: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
We're all out of time
This is how we find how it all unwinds
The sacrifice of hiding in a lie
We're all out of time
This is how we find how it all unwinds
The sacrifice is never knowing

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Why I never walked away, why I played myself this way
Now I see you're testing me pushes me away
Why I never walked away, why I played myself this way
Now I see you're testing me pushes me away

[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
Are you lost in your lies?
Do you tell yourself I don't realize
Your crusade's a disguise
Replaced freedom with fear, you trade money for lives

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I'm aware of what you've done

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
No, no more sorrow
I've paid for your mistakes
Your time is borrowed
Your time has come to be replaced

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
I see pain, I see need
I see liars and thieves abuse power with greed
I had hope, I believed
But I'm beginning to think that I've been deceived

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
You will pay for what you've done

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
No, no morе sorrow
I've paid for your mistakes
Your time is borrowеd
Your time has come to be replaced

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
Thieves and hypocrites
Thieves and hypocrites
Thieves and hypocrites

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
No, no more sorrow
I've paid for your mistakes
Your time is borrowed
Your time has come to be replaced

No, no more sorrow
I've paid for your mistakes
Your time is borrowed
Your time has come to be replaced

[Outro: Chester Bennington]
Your time has come to be replaced
Your time has come to be erased

[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
In this farewell
There's no blood, there's no alibi
'Cause I've drawn regret
From the truth of a thousand lies
So let mercy come and wash away

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
What I've done
I'll face myself
To cross out what I've become
Erase myself
And let go of what I've done

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
Put to rest what you thought of me
While I clean this slate
With the hands of uncertainty
So let mercy come and wash away

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
What I've done
I'll face myself
To cross out what I've become
Erase myself
And let go of what I've done

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
For what I've done
I start again
And whatever pain may come
Today this ends
I'm forgiving

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
What I've done
I'll face myself
To cross out what I've become
Erase myself
And let go of what I've done

[Outro: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
(Na-na na na)
(Na-na na na)
(Na-na na na)
What I've done
(Na-na na na)
(Na-na na na)
(Na-na na na)
Forgiving what I've done
(Na-na na na)
(Na-na na na)
(Na-na na na)
(Na-na na na)

[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
I cannot take this anymore
Saying everything I've said before
All these words they make no sense
I find bliss in ignorance
Less I hear, the less you say
You'll find that out anyway

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Just like before

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
Everything you say to me
Takes me one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to break
I need a little room to breathe
'Cause I'm one step closer to the edge
I'm about to brеak

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
I find the answers aren't so clеar
Wish I could find a way to disappear
All these thoughts they make no sense
I find bliss in ignorance
Nothing seems to go away
Over and over again

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Just like before

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
Everything you say to me
Takes me one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to break
I need a little room to breathe
'Cause I'm one step closer to the edge
I'm about to break
Everything you say to me
Takes me one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to break
I need a little room to breathe
'Cause I'm one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to
Break!

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
Shut up when I'm talking to you!
Shut up!
Shut up!
Shut up!
Shut up when I'm talking to you!
Shut up!
Shut up!
Shut up!
Shut up!
I'm about to break!

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
Everything you say to me
Takes me one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to break
I need a little room to breathe
'Cause I'm one step closer to the edge
I'm about to break
Everything you say to me
Takes me one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to break
I need a little room to breathe
'Cause I'm one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to
Break!

[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
Waking in sweat again
Another day's been laid to waste, in my disgrace
Stuck in my head again
Feels like I'll never leave this place, there's no escape
I'm my own worst enemy...

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I've given up, I'm sick of feeling
Is there nothing you can say?
Take this all away, I'm suffocating
Tell me what the fuck is wrong with me

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
I don't know what to take
Thought I was focused but I'm scared, I'm not prepared
I hyperventilate
Looking for help somehow, somewhere and no one cares
I'm my own worst enеmy

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I've given up, I'm sick of feeling
Is therе nothing you can say?
Take this all away, I'm suffocating
Tell me what the fuck is wrong with me

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
God!
Put me out of my misery!
Put me out of my misery!
Put me out of my
Put me out of my fucking misery!

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I've given up, I'm sick of feeling
Is there nothing you can say?
Take this all away, I'm suffocating
Tell me what the fuck is wrong with me

[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
I'm tired of being what you want me to be
Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface
I don't know what you're expecting of me
Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
I'm becoming this, all I want to do
Is be morе like me and be lеss like you

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
Can't you see that you're smothering me?
Holding too tightly, afraid to lose control
'Cause everything that you thought I would be
Has fallen apart, right in front of you

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
And every second I waste is more than I can take

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
I'm becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
And I know I may end up failing, too
But I know you were just like me
With someone disappointed in you

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
I'm becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

[Outro: Chester Bennington]
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
I'm tired of being what you want me to be
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
I'm tired of being what you want me to be

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Crawling in my skin
These wounds, they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing what is real

[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
There's something inside me that pulls beneath the surface
Consuming, confusing
This lack of self-control I fear is never-ending
Controlling, I can't seem

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
To find myself again, my walls are closing in
Without a sense of confidence
I'm convinced that there's just too much pressure to take
I've felt this way before, so insecure

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Crawling in my skin
These wounds, they will not heal
Fеar is how I fall
Confusing what is real

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
Discomfort endlessly has pullеd itself upon me
Distracting, reacting
Against my will, I stand beside my own reflection
It's haunting how I can't seem

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
To find myself again, my walls are closing in
Without a sense of confidence
I'm convinced that there's just too much pressure to take
I've felt this way before, so insecure

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Crawling in my skin
These wounds, they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing what is real
Crawling in my skin
These wounds they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing, confusing what is real

[Outro: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
(There's something inside me that pulls beneath the surface
Consuming) Confusing what is real
(This lack of self-control I fear is never-ending
Controlling) Confusing what is real

[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
Water grey
Through the windows, up the stairs
Chilling rain
Like an ocean, everywhere

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Don't want to reach for me, do you?
I mean nothing to you
The little things give you away
And now there will be no mistaking
The levees are breaking

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
All you've ever wanted
Was someone to truly look up to you
And six feet underwater, I do

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
Hope decays
Generations disappear
Washed away
As a nation simply stares

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Don't want to reach for me, do you?
I mean nothing to you
The little things give you away
But now there will be no mistaking
The levees are breaking

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
All you've ever wanted
Was someone to truly look up to you
And six feet underwater, I do

All you've ever wanted
Was someone to truly look up to you
And six feet underground
Now I, now I do

[Guitar Solo: Brad Delson]

[Bridge: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
The little things give you away
The little things give you away
The little things give you away
The little things give you away

All you've ever wanted
The little things give you away
Was someone to truly look up to you
The little things give you away
All you've ever wanted
The little things give you away
Was someone to truly look up to you
The little things give you away
All you've ever wanted
The little things give you away
Was someone to truly look up to you
The little things give you away
All you've ever wanted
The little things give you away
Was someone to truly look up to you
The little things give you away

[Outro: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
All you've ever wanted
The little things give you away
Was someone to truly look up to you
The little things give you away
All you've ever wanted
The little things give you away
Was someone to truly look up to you
The little things give you away

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
(It starts with one) One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time all I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away, it's so unreal (It's so unreal)
Didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Tryin' to hold on, didn't even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually bе
A memory of a time when I triеd so hard

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end it doesn't even matter

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
To remind myself how I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mockin' me
Actin' like I was part of your property
Rememberin' all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so far
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end
You kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be
A memory of a time when I tried so hard

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end it doesn't even matter

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know
I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end it doesn't even matter

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
Yeah, here we go for the hundredth time
Hand grenade pins in every line
Throw 'em up and let something shine
Going out of my fucking mind
Filthy mouth, no excuse
Find a new place to hang this noose
String me up from atop these roofs
Knot it tight so I won't get loose
Truth is, you can stop and stare
Bled myself out and no one cares
Dug the trench out, laid down there
With a shovel up out of reach, somewhere
Yeah, someone pour it in
Make it a dirt dance floor, again
Say your prayers and stomp it out
When they bring that chorus in

[Chorus: Chester Bennington with Mike Shinoda]
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
Just to throw it away, just to throw it away
I bleed it out

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
Go, stop the show
Choppy words and a sloppy flow
Shotgun opera, lock and load
Cock it back and then watch it go
Mama, help me, I've been cursed
Death is rolling in every verse
Candy paint on his brand new hearse
Can't contain him, he knows he works
Fuck, this hurts, I won't lie
Doesn't matter how hard I try
Half the words don't mean a thing
And I know that I won't be satisfied
So why try ignoring him?
Make it a dirt dance floor again
Say your prayers and stomp it out
When they bring that chorus in

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
Just to throw it away, just to throw it away
I bleed it out

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
I've opened up these scars
I'll make you face this
I've pulled myself so far
I'll make you face this now

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
Just to throw it away, just to throw it away
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
Just to throw it away, just to throw it away

[Outro: Chester Bennington]
I bleed it out
I bleed it out
I bleed it out

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
I am a little bit of loneliness
A little bit of disregard
Handful of complaints, but I can't help the fact
That everyone can see these scars
I am what I want you to want
What I want you to feel
But it's like no matter what I do
I can't convince you to just believe this is real

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
So I let go, watching you
Turn your back like you always do
Face away and pretend that I'm not
But I'll be here 'cause you're all that I've got

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I can't feel the way I did before
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored
Time won't heal this damage anymore
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignorеd

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
I am a little bit insecure
A littlе unconfident
'Cause you don't understand, I do what I can
But sometimes, I don't make sense
I am what you never wanna say
But I've never had a doubt
It's like no matter what I do, I can't convince you
For once, just to hear me out

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
So I let go, watching you
Turn your back like you always do
Face away and pretend that I'm not
But I'll be here 'cause you're all that I've got

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I can't feel the way I did before
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored
Time won't heal this damage anymore
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
No, hear me out now
You're gonna listen to me, like it or not
Right now, hear me out now
You're gonna listen to me, like it or not
Right now
I can't feel the way I did before
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I can't feel the way I did before
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored
Time won't heal this damage anymore
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored

[Outro: Chester Bennington]
I can't feel
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored
Time won't heal
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored

I was broke in the Bronx, but a bitch never hated (Never)
Had to get my weight up, so I patiently waited
House with the palm trees for all the times I was shaded
Niggas out the woodworks, no, we never dated
Stop lyin' on the pussy when you know you never ate it (Pussy)
Took the wig off and braided back my hair (Woo)
Mixtape Cardi, like I ain't a millionaire (Ha-ha)
Big diamond single, big diamonds in my ear
And my stock steady risin', you would never get a share (No)
Ridin' nigga faces, I don't never get a chair (Ahh)

Prayin' on my downfall, you never get a prayer
Had to tighten up my circle, so I never fit a square

[Verse 1: Britney Spears]
My mama told me go on and let you go
Said you would be more problems than I'd ever know
Said if he's gonna go then let him go away

[Verse 2: Britney Spears]
But then I get the urge, it hurts so bad (damn)
When I feel the thirst, it makes me mad
I look up in my bed
I look up and there is your face

[Chorus: Britney Spears & Pharrell Williams]
You love it, you love it
I'm so hooked on it (hooked on it)
You want it, you want it
You're so good on a good day
Sugarfall, your sugarfall
You make my sugarfall (sugarfall)
You know you want it bad, babe (Hey girl)

[Verse 3: Britney Spears]
I heard it in the streets you got another girl
Yes, it did sting
But didn't shatter my world (I'm ok)
You should catch me now
When I'm in a vulnerable state

[Verse 4: Britney Spears]
You're probably thinking to yourself
This just ain't mе
But on the contrary, I was your freak (I was your freak)
Hit mе one more time
And trust me I'll be ok
Hey

[Chorus: Britney Spears & Pharrell Williams]
You love it, you love it
I'm so hooked on it (hooked on it)
You want it, you want it
You're so good on a good day
Sugarfall, your sugarfall
You make my sugarfall (sugarfall)
You know you want it bad, babe (Hey girl)

[Bridge: Britney Spears]
Now I will be a bad chick if I rounded up my clothes
And headed over straight to the door
You wouldn't have a clue of what you should do
If I left you laying longing for more
You'd be like baby don't go (don't go)
Baby, want some more? (You want some more?)
Baby don't go (just don't go)
Said baby please listen
Don't you just go

[Verse 5: Britney Spears]
Why do you lick your lips, Mister Stand-Alone?
You ain't got no x-ray vision, staring through my clothes
Are you sure that you're prepared
For what comes serves on its plate?

[Verse 6: Britney Spears]
Wait a minute
Oooh, I'm having second thoughts
See my hearts on fault
Could you pass my shorts?
Don't you got a girl?
Till then, I'm sorry, you must wait
Especially since I know

[Chorus: Britney Spears & Pharrell Williams]
You love it, you love it
I'm so hooked on it (hooked on it)
You want it, you want it
You're so good on a good day
Sugarfall, your sugarfall
You make my sugarfall (sugarfall)
You know you want it bad, babe (Hey girl)
I'm so hooked on it (hooked on it)
You want it, you want it
You're so good on a good day
Sugarfall, your sugarfall
You make my sugarfall (sugarfall)
You know you want it bad, babe (Hey girl)

[Outro: Britney Spears]
You know you want it
So come and get it

[Verse 1: Madonna]
What are you waiting for? Nobody's gonna show you how
Why wait for someone else to do what you can do right now?
Got no boundaries and no limits
If there's excitement, put me in it
If it's against the law, arrest me
If you can handle it, undress me

[Pre-Chorus: Madonna]
Don't stop me now, don't need to catch my breath
I can go on, and on, and on
When the lights go down and there's no one left
I can go on, and on, and on

[Chorus: Madonna]
Give it to me, yeah
No one's gonna show me how
Give it to me, yeah
No one's gonna stop me now

[Verse 2: Madonna & Pharrell Williams]
They say that a good thing never lasts, and then it has to fall
Those are thе people that did not amount to much at all
Gimme thе baseline, and I'll shake it
Gimme a record, and I'll break it
There's no beginning and no ending
Give me a chance to go, and I'll take it

Don't stop me now, don't need to catch my breath
I can go on, and on, and on
When the lights go down and there's no one left

[Verse 1: Madonna]
I’m no stranger to deception
I have lied and been lied to
I’m no paragon of virtue
But I wanna be with you
I have never been a righteous soul
And I don’t pretend I am
But I walk the line when I’m with you
Because you make me believe I can

[Pre-Chorus: Madonna]
But we’re running out of options
And we’re running out of time
And I don’t know if it’s you or me
But it’s time to speak your mind

Because I’m traveling across the sky
When you’re with me, your hand in mine
Our honesty will make us fly
And wе’ll be traveling across sky
Across the sky (Whoa)

Across the sky (Whoa)
Across the sky (Whoa)

[Verse 2: Madonna]
I’m not good at keeping quiet
And I can’t keep this tied down
But it’s got to count for something now
That we’re still hangin’ around
If you need an explanation for
What is false and what is true
Then I’d rather stop the world than think
That I could not be with you

[Pre-Chorus: Madonna]
But we’re running out of options
And we’re running out of time
And I don’t know if it’s you or me (Don’t know if it’s you)

Take it while you can (Take it while you can)
I'll throw you some rope
If it will give you hope
Want you to understand (Understand)
Here comes your smile (Here comes your smile)
Hope it stays for awhile (Stays for awhile)
You know it's contagious
It might sound outrageous
But I feel so alive (I feel so alive)

Two steps behind, you've got too much pride (So much pride)

[Verse 1]
As quiet as it is tonight, you'd almost think you were safe
Your eyes are full of surprises, they cannot predict my fate
Waiting underneath the stars, there's something you should know
The angels, they surround my heart, telling me to let you go

[Pre-Chorus]
I bet he couldn't, I bet he couldn't recognize
But I played right into it, who am I to criticize?
Somehow I'll get through it and you won't even realize
Falling through your own disguise

[Chorus]
It's like over and over, you'rе pushing me right down to the floor
I should just walk away
Over and ovеr, I keep on coming back for more
I play into your fantasy
Now that it's over, you can't lie to me right through your smile
I see behind your eyes
Now I'm sober, no more intoxicating my mind
Even the devil wouldn't recognize you, I do
Even the devil wouldn't recognize you, I do
Even the devil wouldn't recognize you, I do
Even the devil wouldn't recognize you, I do, I do, I do

[Verse 2]
You almost fooled yourself this time, let all of the saints be praised
You hide your sadness behind your smile and you keep your lost heart raised (Lost heart raised)
With steps that edge along the ledge is much higher than it seems
But I've been on that ledge before, you can't hide yourself from me

[Pre-Chorus]
I bet he couldn't, I bet he couldn't recognize
I still played right into it, who am I to criticize?
Somehow I'll get through it and you won't even realize
Falling through your own disguise

[Chorus]
It's like over and over, you're pushing me right down to the floor
I should just walk away
Over and over, I keep on coming back for more
I play into your fantasy
Now that it's over, you can't lie to me right through your smile
I see behind your eyes
Now I'm sober, no more intoxicating my mind
Even the devil wouldn't recognize you, I do
Even the devil wouldn't recognize you, I do
Even the devil wouldn't recognize you, I do
Even the devil wouldn't recognize you, I do, I do, I do

[Instrumental Breakdown with Male Backing Vocals & Guitars]

[Chorus]
Over and over, you're pushing me right down to the floor
I should just walk away
Over and over, I keep on coming back for more
I play into your fantasy
Now that it's over, you can't lie to me right through your smile
I see behind your eyes
Now I'm sober, no more intoxicating my mind
Even the devil wouldn't recognize you, but I do

[Outro]
Even the devil wouldn't recognize you, but I do
Even the devil wouldn't recognize you, but I do
Even the devil wouldn't recognize you, but I do
Even the devil wouldn't recognize you, but I do, I-I, I do
Even the devil wouldn't recognize you, but I do
Even the devil wouldn't recognize you, you
But I do

[Verse 1: Madonna]
On any given night, catch me on the floor
Workin' up the sweat, that's what music's for
I'd rather not explain, for me, it's just usual

[Pre-Chorus: Madonna]
(You can catch me popping that, dropping that, ain't no stopping that, are you watching that?)
Once I get going, I am gone
(You can catch me popping that, dropping that, ain't no stopping that, are you watching that?)
I'll keep it going all night long

[Chorus: Madonna, Pharrell Williams]
You know I feel it in my heartbeat
It may feel old to you, but to me, it feels new
You know I feel it in my heartbeat
Don't you know? Can't you see? When I dance, I feel free
Which makes me feel like the only one
The only one that the light shines on (Hey!)

[Verse 2: Madonna]
This complicated life, I try to do my best
I always tell myself it's all just a test
For me, it's an escape, 'cause dancing makes me feel beautiful

[Pre-Chorus: Madonna, Pharrell Williams]
(Come on)
(And I can't pretend, it should never end, let the music play, are you watching that?)
Once I am moving, I'm alright
(She's alright, alright, alright)
(You can catch me popping that, it should never end, let the music play, 'cause I'm here to stay)
I'll keep on dancing through the night

[Chorus: Madonna, Pharrell Williams]
You know I feel it in my heartbeat
It may feel old to you, but to me it feels new (C'mon)
You know I feel it in my heartbeat
Don't you know? Can't you see? When I dance, I feel free
Which makes me feel like the only one (The only one, the only one)
The only one (Oh) that the light shines on (Hey!)

[Breakdown: Madonna, Pharrell Williams]
See my booty get down like (Uh)
See my booty get down like (Come on, uh)
See my booty get down like (Lower, uh)
See my booty get down like (Little lower, baby, uh)
Huh, get down
Huh-uh, (Uh) get down (Come on, uh)
See my booty get down like
(Huh? What? What? What?)

[Bridge: Madonna, Pharrell Williams]
You probably think I'm crazy
I don't want you to save me (Dance)
Don't mean to disappoint you, I've never felt so free
If you could stand in my shoes
Then you would feel my heartbeat too

[Pre-Chorus: Madonna, Pharrell Williams]
(You can catch me popping that, dropping that, ain't no stopping that, are you watching that?)
Once I am moving, I'm alright
She's alright, alright, alright
(You can catch me popping that, dropping that, ain't no stopping that, are you watching that?)
I can keep on going through the night

[Chorus: Madonna, Pharrell Williams]
You know I feel it in my heartbeat
It may feel old to you, but to me, it feels new
You know I feel it in my heartbeat
Don't you know? Can't you see? When I dance, I feel free
Which makes me feel it in my heartbeat
It may feel old to you, but to me, it feels new
You know I feel it in my heartbeat
Don't you know? Can't you see? When I dance, I feel free
Which makes me feel like the only one (Only one, the only one)
That the light shines on (Girl!)

[Outro: Pharrell Williams]
M-Dolla
M-Dolla
What?
I was wondering through the streets of the city
Rambling through the avenues of time
When from nowhere my eyes fell onto a girl, and by chance her eyes fell onto mine
So I sat and I acted all nonchalant
She smoked her lavender cigarette
Reading the future that lay in my hands, as my shadow played a bass clarinet
Where are you going with this Bret?
We waltzed down a molded boulevard
Just two silhouettes in thе mist
Oh yes
Days went by and years wеnt by
Moments went by when we kissed
When was this?
She said "your beard is woven of heartache"
And we'll drink for the lonely tonight
And the moon is a horny old drunkard
Uh Bret, could you please move over to your right?
We drank dandelion wine and we reminisced about the moment we first met that day
I'm trying to watch TV
Then we reminisced about how we first reminisced
Oh ya? Sounds a bit gay
She handed me a broken memory
A keepsake to forever more save
That a brief taste of love is as sweet as any
And with that she made her way
She said her name was a secret
Then she said her name was Cherise
Is her middle name Cherise?
So it's a secret Cherise? Maybe?
Hmm maybe
What'd she look like?
She looked like a Parisian river
What, dirty?
She looked like a chocolate eclair
That's weird
Her eyes were reflections of eyes
Oh no
And the rainbows danced in her hair
Oh ya
She reminded me of a winter's morning
Oh frigid?
Her perfume was eau de toilette
What does that mean?
She was comparable to Cleopatra
Quite old?
She was like Shakespeare's Juilet
What 13?
The bohemians of Soho did pirouettes as we waltzed through the streets of Manhattan
The rivers of ribbon and sails of sock
Bret, did any of this actually happen?
The girl I described, she's as real as the wind
It's true, I saw her today
The other details are inventions
Because I prefer her that way

[Verse 1: Madonna]
The madness of love
And what we'll do for it
To walk through the fire
And just go through with it
To cancel your doubt
And fly into the sun
To go without
And feel like you're the lucky one

[Pre-Chorus: Madonna]
The mad things we do for love
We're caught in a world of lies
I just had the strangest dream
We won't get to do this twice

[Chorus: Madonna]
Lela lela lela pala tute
Lela lela lela pala tute
Lela lela lela pala tute
Lela lela lela balla late
Lela lela lеla pala tute
Lela lela lеla pala tute
Lela lela lela pala tute
Lela lela lela balla late

[Verse 2: Madonna]
The madness of love
And where we'll go for it
To travel the world
And lose control for it
To give it away
And never hesitate
Just knowing one day
It will reciprocate

[Pre-Chorus: Madonna]
The mad things we do for love
The heavens are falling through
I'm caught in the world of lie
There's nothing that I can do

[Chorus: Madonna]
Lela lela lela pala tute
Lela lela lela pala tute
Lela lela lela pala tute
Lela lela lela balla late
Lela lela lela pala tute
Lela lela lela pala tute
Lela lela lela pala tute
Lela lela lela balla late

[Bridge: Madonna & (Justin Timberlake)]
It's a mad mad world (Mad mad world)
All the things you make me feel (Ooh-ooh)
It's a mad mad world (Mad mad world)
Had a drink so I could forget (Ooh-ooh)
It's a mad mad world (Mad mad world)
All the noise inside of my head (Ooh-ooh)
It's a mad mad world (Mad mad world)
I would never change this moment (Ooh-ooh)

Huh?
Yeah

[Chorus: BIG30]
Man, this shit crazy (Crazy)
I'm in Miami wit' Gucci, Rolls Royce look like flavors (Like flavors)
This murder shit ain't nothin' to me, whackin' shit on the daily
Lil' bitch say she ain't heard of me (Man, who you?), told the lil' bitch she gave it
Still trappin' up off my flip, wish I could go trap off my pager

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane & BIG30]
I see these niggas hatin', I ain't losin' sleep about it, though (No)
Members creep like TLC, .223 shells out the Jeep (Blrrrd)
No one gon' take care of me the way that I take care of me (Take care of me)
Get booked in from security ('Curity), your bodyguard ain't scarin' me (No)
Put your friend in therapy, you know I did it, barely live (Grrra)
Askin' me, "Take care of it," I squash it if I pay the bill (Pay the bill)
I don't play detective games, they play, no, I don't play with them (Play with them)
I don't free-pick niggas, when I beef, or show no favoritism (No favoritism)
Lil' boy still need training wheels, these army guns, not baby pistols (Baby pistols)
All these folks and babies in my house, I'm like a babysitter (A babysitter)
Gucci Mane and shiesty twins, we bait 'em and then play the nigga (Slime)
Machine gun friends, twin F&N's (Slatt), stand on ten, I raised the nigga (Brrra)
Shootin' first, then did the verse, my bank account go crazy, nigga (Let's go)
Police keep on tazin' niggas, one shot kill, amazed the nigga (Amazed the nigga)
Shiesty, that's my Dirk Nowitzki, ain't no way I'm tradin', nigga (Can't trade 'em in)
No shade, I'm too rich to fade, he ran up, so I blazed the nigga
(Man)

[Chorus: BIG30]
Man, this shit crazy (Crazy)
I'm in Miami wit' Gucci, Rolls Royce look like flavors (Like flavors)
This murder shit ain't nothin' to me, whackin' shit on the daily
Lil' bitch say she ain't heard of me (Man, who you?), told the lil' bitch she gave it
Still trappin' up off my flip, wish I could go trap off my pager

[Verse 2: BIG30]
Sent your mama to snitch on me, man, these niggas some bitches (They bitches)
Makin' posts, sendin' threats and shit, where I'm from, man, that's snitchin' (They snitchin')
Might jump out on your block with the semi and get to tickin' (Brrra, brrra)
Race to you with this choppa, stand over you 'til you finished
My niggas ig'nant (They ig'nant), so many choppas in one car, man, look, this shit ridiculous (This shit ridiculous)
We drove fourteen hours from Memphis (From Memphis) with dope and some Glizzies (Some Glizzies)
We keep steppin' and keep on spinnin', we constantly be sinnin' (Sinnin')
Choppa Gang run the city
Man

[Chorus: BIG30]
Man, this shit crazy (Crazy)

Lil' bitch say she ain't heard of me (Man, who you?), told the lil' bitch she gave it
Still trappin' up off my flip, wish I could go trap off my pager

[Verse 1]
I just woke up from a fuzzy dream
You never would believe the things that I have seen
I looked in the mirror and I saw your face
You looked right through me, you were miles away

[Pre-Chorus]
All my dreams, they fade away
I'll never be the same
If you could see me the way you see yourself
I can't pretend to be someone else

[Chorus]
You always love me more, miles away
I hear it in your voice, we're miles away
You're not afraid to tell me, miles away
I guess we're at our best when we're miles away
So far away, so far away, so far away, so far away
So far away, so far away, so far away, so far away

[Verse 2]
When no one is around, then I have you here
I begin to see the picture, it becomes so clear
You always have the biggest heart
When we're six thousand miles apart

[Pre-Chorus]
Too much of no sound
Uncomfortable silence can be so loud
Those three words are never enough
When it's long distance love

[Chorus]
You always love me more, miles away
I hear it in your voice, we're miles away
You're not afraid to tell me miles away
I guess we're at our best when we're miles away
So far away, so far away, so far away, so far away
So far away, so far away, so far away, so far away

[Bridge]
I'm alright, don't be sorry, but it's true
When I'm gone, you'll realize
That I'm the best thing that happened to you

[Breakdown]
You always love me more, miles away
I hear it in your voice, we're miles away
You're not afraid to tell me miles away
I guess we're at our best when we're miles away

[Chorus]
You always love me more, miles away
I hear it in your voice, we're miles away
You're not afraid to tell me miles away
I guess we're at our best when we're miles away

[Outro]
So far away, so far away, so far away, so far away
So far away, so far away, so far away, so far away
So far away, so far away, so far away, so far away

Hey, uh, c'mon, Madonna

[Verse 1: Madonna, Justin Timberlake]
C'mon, boy
I've been waiting for somebody to pick up my stroll, ah
Ah, well, don't waste time
Give me a sign, tell me how you wanna roll, mmm
I want somebody to speed it up for me, then take it down slow
There's enough room for both
Well, I can handle that, you just gotta show me where it's at
Are you ready to go? Are you ready to go?

If you want it, you already got it
If you thought it, it better be what you want
If you feel it, it must be real just

[Verse 2: Madonna, Justin Timberlake]
Sometimes I think what I need is a "you" intervention, yeah
And you know I can tell that you like it
And that it's good, by the way that you move, oh, hey
The road to hell is paved with good intentions, yeah
But if I die tonight, at least I can say I did what I wanted to do
Tell me, how 'bout you?

[Pre-Chorus: Madonna & Justin Timberlake]
If you want it, you already got it
If you thought it, it better be what you want
If you feel it, it must be real just
Say the word, and I'mma give you what you want

[Verse 1]
Morning comes, she follows the path to the river shore
Lightly sung, her song is the latch on the morning's door
See the sun sparkle in the reeds, silver beads, pass into the sea

[Pre-Chorus]
She comes from the town where they call her the woodcutter's daughter
She's brown as the bank where she kneels down to gather her water
And she bears it away with a love that the river has taught her

[Chorus]
Let it flow, let it flow, wide and clear

[Verse 2]
Round and round, the cut of the plow in the furrowed field
Seasons round, the bushels of corn and the barley meal
Broken ground, open and beckoning to the spring
Black dirt live again, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
The plowman is broad as the back of the land he's sowing
As he dances the circular track of the plow ever knowing
That the work of his days measures more than the planting and growing

[Chorus]
Let it grow, let it grow, greatly yield

[Bridge]
What shall we say, shall we call it by a name?
As well to count the angels dancing on a pin
Water bright as the sky from which it came
And the name is on the earth that takes it in
We will not speak but stand inside the rain
And listen to the thunder shout, "I am! I am! I am! I am!"

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
So it goes, we make what we make since the world began
Nothing more, the love of the women, the work of man
Seasons round, creatures great and small
Up and down as we rise and fall
As we rise and fall

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
What shall we say, shall we call it by a name?
As well to count the angels dancing on a pin
Water bright as the sky from which it came
And the name is on the earth that takes it in
We will not speak but stand inside the rain
And listen to the thunder shout, "I am! I am! I am! I am!"

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
When they come to take you down
When they bring that wagon 'round
When they come to call on you
And drag your poor body down

[Pre-Chorus]
Just one thing I ask of you, just one thing for me
Please forget you knew my name, my darling Sugaree

[Chorus]
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them you know me

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
You thought you was the cool fool
Never could do no wrong
You had everything sewn up tight
How come you lay awake all night long?

[Pre-Chorus]
Just one thing I ask of you, just one thing for me
Please forget you knew my namе, my darling Sugaree

[Chorus]
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell thеm you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them you know me

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
You know in spite of all you gained
You still had to stand out in the pouring rain
One last voice is calling you
And I guess it's time you go

[Pre-Chorus]
Just one thing I ask of you, just one thing for me
Please forget you knew my name, my darling Sugaree

[Chorus]
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them you know me

[Instrumental break]

[Bridge]
Shake it up now, Sugaree
I'll meet you at the Jubilee
And if that Jubilee don't come
Maybe I'll meet you on the run

[Pre-Chorus]
Just one thing I ask of you, just one thing for me
Please forget you knew my name, my darling Sugaree

[Chorus]
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them you know me

[Chorus]
Well now, C.C. Rider
Well now see what you done done
Well now, C.C. Rider
Well now see, see what you done done
Girl, now you made me love you, woman
Now your man is gone

[Verse 1]
Oh, I'm goin' away, and I won't be back 'til fall
Well, I'm goin' away now, baby, and I won't be back 'til fall
If I could find me that good girl, I might not be coming back at all
Maybe not at all

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
Well now C.C. Rider, see how the moon is shining bright, bright
Well now C.C. Rider, see how the moon is shining bright
If I can find me that good girl now, everything would be alright, yes

[Chorus]
Well now, C.C. Rider
Well now see, see what you done done
Well now, C.C. Rider
Well now see what you done done
Well, you madе me love you, woman
I guess your man has comе
And I'm on the run

[Instrumental break]

[Outro]
Well now, C, C.C. Rider
Well now see, see what you done, see what you done done
Well now, C.C. Rider
Well now see, see what you, see what you done done
Well, now you made me love you, woman
Now your man has come

[Verse 1]
Red and white, blue suede shoes
I'm Uncle Sam, how do you do?
Give me five, I'm still alive
Ain't no luck, I learned to duck
Check my pulse, it don't change
Seventy-two come shine or rain
Wave the flag, pop the bag
Skin the boat, skin the goat

[Chorus]
Wave that flag, wave it wide and high
Summertime done, come and gone, my, oh, my

[Verse 2]
I'm Uncle Sam, that's who I am
Been hiding out in a rock and roll band
Shake the hand that shook the hand
Of P.T. Barnum, and Charlie Chan
Shine your shoes, light your fuse
Can you use them old U.S. Blues
Drink your health, share your wealth
I'll run your life, steal your wife

[Chorus]
Wave that flag, wave it wide and high
Summertime done, come and gone, my, oh, my

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Back to back, chicken shack
Son of a gun, better change your act
We're all confused, what's to lose?
You can call this song them old United States Blues

[Chorus]
Wave that flag, wave it wide and high
Summertime done, come and gone, my, oh, my

[Outro]
Summertime done, come and gone, my, oh, my
(My, my, my, my, my, my, oh, my, oh, my, oh, my)
Summertime done, come and gone, my, oh, my

[Verse 1]
Julie catch a rabbit by his hair
Come back stepping, like to walk on air
Get back home where you belong
And don't you run off no more

Don't hang your head, let the two time roll
Grass shack nailed to a pine wood floor
Ask the time, baby, I don't know
Come back later, gonna let it show

[Chorus]
And I say row, Jimmy, row
Gonna get there? I don't know
Seems a common way to go
Get down, row
Row, row, row, row

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
Here's a half dollar if you dare
Double twist when you hit the air
Look at Julie, down below
The levee doing the do-pas-o

[Chorus]
I say row, Jimmy, row
Gonna get there? I don't know
Seems a common way to go
Get down and row
Row, row, row, row

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Broken heart don't feel so bad
You ain't got half of what you thought you had
Rock your baby to and fro
Not too fast and not too slow

[Chorus]
And I say row, Jimmy, row
Gonna get there? I don't know
Seems a common way to go
Get down and row
Row, row, row, row

[Bridge]
That's the way it's been in town
Ever since they tore the jukebox down
Two-bit piece don't buy no more
Not so much as it done before

[Chorus]
And I say row, Jimmy, row
Gonna get there? I don't know
Seems a common way to go
Get down and row
Row, row, row, row
I say row, Jimmy, row
Gonna get there? I don't know
Seems a common way to go
Get down and row
Row, row, row, row
I say row, Jimmy, row
Gonna get there? I don't know
Seems a common way to go
Get down and row
Row, row, row, row

[Outro]
Get down and row
Row, row, row, row
Oh, get down, row
Row, row, row, row

[Verse 1]
Lazy lightning
That sleepy fire in your eyes
Is that desire in disguise?
I keep on trying but I
I can't get through
Lazy lightning
I'd like to find the proper potion
To try to capture your emotion
You're right beside me but I
I can't get through

[Chorus]
You're a loop of lazy lightning
Loop of lazy lighting
Must admit you're kind of frightening
But you really get me high

[Verse 2]
So exciting
When I hear your velvet thunder
You seem so near I start to wonder
Would you come closer if I
If I asked you to
Lazy lightning
The way you're messing with my reason
It's an obsession but it's pleasing
Tell me a liе and I will swear
I'll swear it's true

[Chorus]
You'rе a loop of lazy lightning
Loop of lazy lightning
Must admit you're kind of frightening
You're a loop of lazy lightning

[Bridge]
Rope of fire round my heart (Lightning)
Rope of fire ever tightening (Tightening)
Rope of fire round my heart (Lightning)
It's either lunacy or lightning
It's frightening
You're a loop of lazy lightning, woo

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Lazy lightning
Say you'll never strike the same place
I want a double dose in my case
I'd fly a kite if I thought
Thought that would do
Lazy lightning
The way you always electrify me
Someday I know you'll satisfy me
And all that lightning will be

[Outro]
(My lightning too)
My lightning too
(My lightning too)
You're a loop of lazy lightning
(My lightning too)
Loop of lazy lightning
(My lightning too)
My lightning too
(My lightning too)
My stabilities are frightening
(My lightning too)
My lightning too
(My lightning too)
Come on, let me see your lightning
(My lightning too)
My lightning too
(My lightning too)
My lightning too
(My lightning too)
My lightning too
(My lightning too)
Come on, my lightning too
(My lightning too)
My lightning too
(My lightning too)
Hey, my lightning too
(My lightning too)
My lightning too
(My lightning too)
Oh, my lightning too
(My lightning too)
My lightning too
(My lightning too)
Woo

[Instrumental]

[Verse]
Dizzy ain't the word for the way that you're making me feel now
Help me out now
Well, I need some indication, good Lord, if all of this is real now
You got to tell me
Well, I've heard the thought there may be something wrong with my head now
Got to help me girl now
Could it be infatuation or am I just being misled now?

[Outro]
Little bolt of inspiration
Way you strike me now
It's sparking my imagination
You don't fight me now
Little bolt of inspiration
You got to like me now
Cause me such excitation
You don't you fight me now
My lightning too
My lightning too
My lightning too
My lightning too
AH
My lightning too
Come on, my lightning too
My lightning too
AH

[Instrumental Break]

(Woo!)

[Verse 1]
You told me goodbye, how was I to know
You didn't mean goodbye, you meant please don't let me go

[Chorus]
I was having a high time, living the good life
Well, you know

[Verse 2]
The wheels are muddy, got a ton of hay
Now listen here, baby, 'cause I mean what I say

[Chorus]
I am having a hard time, living the good life
Don't be that way

[Bridge]
I was losing time, I had nothing to do
No one to fight, I came to you
Wheels broke down, the leader won't draw
The line is busted, the last one I saw

[Verse 3]
Nothing's for certain, it could always go wrong
Come on in when it's raining, go on out when it's gone

[Chorus]
I could show you a high time, living the good life
Well, you know

[Verse 4]
Tomorrow come trouble, tomorrow come pain
Now don't think too hard, baby, 'cause you know what I'm saying

[Chorus]
We could have us a high time, living the good life
Well, you know

[Verse 1: The Grateful Dead]
We can share the women, we can share the wine
We can share what we got of yours 'cause we done shared all of mine
Keep on rollin', just a mile to go
Keep on rollin' my old buddy, you're movin' much too slow

[Verse 2: Jerry Garcia, Bob Weir]
I just jumped the watchman, right outside the fence
Took his rings, four bucks in change, ain't that Heaven sent?
Hurts my ears to listen, and it burns my eyes to see
Cut down a man in cold blood, Shannon, it might as well've been me

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3: Bob Weir]
We used to play for silver, now we play for life
One's for sport and one's for blood at thе point of a knife
Now the die is shakеn, now the die must fall
There ain't no winner in this game, he don't go home with all
Not with all

[Verse 4: The Grateful Dead]
Leavin' Texas, fourth day of July
Sun so hot, the clouds so low, the eagles filled the sky
Catch the Detroit Lightning out of Santa Fe
The Great Northern out of Cheyenne, from sea to shining sea

[Verse 5: Jerry Garcia, Bob Weir]
Gotta go to Tulsa, first train we can ride
Gotta settle one old score, one small point of pride
Ain't a place a man can hide, Shannon, will keep him from the sun
Ain't a bed can give us rest now, you keep us on the run, run

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 6: The Grateful Dead]
Jack Straw from Wichita
Cut his buddy down
Dug for him a shallow grave
And laid his body down
Half a mile from Tucson
By the morning light
One man gone and another to go
My old buddy, you're moving much too slow

[Outro: The Grateful Dead]
We can share the women, we can share the wine

[Verse 1]
You tell me this town ain't got no heart
(Well, well, well, you can never tell)
The sunny side of the street is dark
(Well, well, well, you can never tell)
Maybe that's 'cause it's midnight
In the dark of the moon besides

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Maybe the dark is from your eyes
(Maybe the dark is from your eyes)
Maybe the dark is from your eyes
(Maybe the dark is from your eyes)
Maybe the dark is from your eyes
(Maybe the dark is from your eyes)
You know you got such dark eyes
(Woo)

[Chorus]
Nothing shaking on Shakedown Street
Used to be the heart of town
Don't tell me this town ain't got no heart
You just gotta poke around

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
You've seen this town clear through
(Well, well, well, you can never tell)
Nothing here that could interest you
(Well, well, well, you can never tell)
It's not because you missed out
On the thing that we had to start

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Maybe you had too much too fast
(Maybe you had too much too fast)
Maybe you had too much too fast
(Maybe you had too much too fast)
Maybe you had too much too fast
(Maybe you had too much too fast)
Or just over-played your part

[Chorus]
Nothing shaking on Shakedown Street
Used to be the heart of town
Don't tell me this town ain't got no heart
You just gotta poke around

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Since I'm passing your way today
(Well, well, well, you can never tell)
I just stopped by 'cause I wanna say
(Well, well, well, you can never tell)
I recall your darkness when it crackled like a thundercloud

[Pre-Chorus 3]
Don't tell me this town ain't got no heart
(Don't tell me this town ain't got no heart)
Don't tell me this town ain't got no heart
(Don't tell me this town ain't got no heart)
Don't tell me this town ain't got no heart
(Don't tell me this town ain't got no heart)
When I can hear it beat out loud (Woo)

[Chorus]
Nothing shaking on Shakedown Street
Used to be the heart of town
Don't tell me this town ain't got no heart
You just gotta poke around
Nothing shaking on Shakedown Street
Used to be the heart of town
Don't tell me this town ain't got no heart
You just gotta poke around
Nothing shaking on Shakedown Street
Used to be the heart of town
Don't tell me this town ain't got no heart
You just gotta poke around

[Bridge]
Don't tell me this town ain't got no heart
(Nothing's shaking)
You just gotta poke around
Don't tell me this town ain't got no heart
(Nothing's shaking)
You just gotta poke around
You just gotta poke around
Just gotta poke around
(Just gotta poke around)
Just gotta poke around
(Don't tell me this town ain't go no heart)
(Don't tell me this town ain't go no heart)
Just gotta poke around

[Instrumental]

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
I wanna tell you how it's gonna be
You're gonna give your love to me
I wanna love you night and day
You know our love will not fade away
You know our love will not fade away
Not fade away

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
My love is bigger than a Cadillac
I try to show you but you drive me back
Your love for me has got to be real
You're gonna know just how I feel
Our love is real, not fade away
Not fade away

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
I left my home in Norfolk, Virginia
California on my mind
Straddled that Greyhound, it rode me past Raleigh
And on across Carolin'
Stopped in Charlotte and bypassed Rock Hill
And we never was a minute late
And we was ninety miles out of Atlanta by sundown
Rolling across the Georgia state
We had motor trouble, it turned into a struggle
Halfway across Alabam'
The Hound broke down
And left us all stranded in downtown Birmingham

[Verse 2]
Straight off bought me a through train ticket
Right across Mississippi clean
And I was on that midnight flyer out of Birmingham
Smoking into New Orleans
Somebody help me get out of Louisiana
Just help me get to Houston town
Thеre's people thеre who care a thing about me
And they won't let the poor boy down
Well, sure as you're born, they bought me a silk suit
Put luggage in my hands
And I woke up high over Albuquerque
On a jet to the promised land

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Working on a T-bone steak a la carte
Flying over to the Golden State
When the pilot told us in thirteen minutes
We'd be heading in the terminal gate
Swing low sweet chariot, come down easy
Taxi to the terminal zone
Cut your engines, cool your wings
And let me make it to the telephone
Los Angeles, give me Norfolk, Virginia
Tidewater four ten oh nine
Tell the folks back home this is the promised land calling
And the poor boy's on the line

[Instrumental]

[Outro]
Thank you

[Verse 1]
Gone are the days when the ox fall down
Take up the yoke and plow the fields around
Gone are the days when the ladies said "Please
Gentle Jack Jones, won't you come to me"

[Chorus]
Brown-eyed women and red grenadine
The bottle was dusty but the liquor was clean
Sound of the thunder with the rain pourin' down
And it looks like the old man's gettin' on

[Verse 2]
1920 when he steppеd to the bar
Drank to the dregs of thе whiskey jar
1930 when the wall caved in
He made his way selling red-eyed gin

[Chorus]
Brown-eyed women and red grenadine
The bottle was dusty but the liquor was clean
Sound of the thunder with the rain pourin' down
And it looks like the old man's gettin' on

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Delilah Jones was the mother of twins
Two times over, and the rest were sins
Raised eight boys, only I turned bad
Didn't get the lickin's that the other ones had

[Chorus]
Brown-eyed women and red grenadine
The bottle was dusty but the liquor was clean
Sound of the thunder with the rain pourin' down
And it looks like the old man's gettin' on

[Bridge]
Tumble down shack in Big Foot county
Snowed so hard that the roof caved in
Delilah Jones went to meet her God
And the old man never was the same again

[Verse 4]
Daddy made whiskey and he made it well
Cost two dollars and it burned like hell
I cut hickory just to fire the still
Drink down a bottle and be ready to kill

[Chorus]
Brown-eyed women and red grenadine
The bottle was dusty but the liquor was clean
Sound of the thunder with the rain pourin' down
And it looks like the old man's gettin' on

[Verse 1 repeated]
Gone are the days when the ox fall down
Take up the yoke and plow the fields around
Gone are the days when the ladies said "Please
Gentle Jack Jones, won't you come to me?"

[Outro]
Brown-eyed women and red grenadine
The bottle was dusty, but the liquor was clean
Sound of the thunder with the rain pourin' down
And it looks like the old man's gettin' on
And it looks like the old man's gettin' on

[Verse 1]
Bringing me down
I'm running aground
Blind in the light of the interstate cars
Passing me by
The buses and semis
Plunging like stones from a slingshot on Mars
But I'm here by the road
Bound to the load
I picked up in ten thousand cafes and bars
Alone with the rush of the drivers that won't pick me up
The highway, the moon, the clouds, and the stars

[Chorus]
Black-throated wind keeps on pouring in
With its words of a life where nothing is new
Ah, Mother American Night, I'm lost from the light
Oh, Lord, said I'm drowning in you

[Verse 2]
Now, I left St. Louis, City of Blues
In the midst of a storm I'd rather forget
I tried to pretеnd it came to an end
'Cause you wеren't the woman I once thought I'd met
But I can't deny, oh, times have gone by
I never had doubts or thoughts of regret
And I was a man when all this began
Who'd never think twice about being there yet

[Chorus]
Black-throated wind whisper mix in
It's speaking of life that passes like dew
Forced me to see you've done better by me
Done better by me than I've done by you

[Verse 3]
What's to be found, racing around
You carry your bag wherever you go
Full of the blues, trying to lose
You ain't gonna learn what you don't wanna know
So I give you my eyes, and all of their lies
Please help them to learn as well as to see
You capture a glance, oh oh, and make it a dance
Of looking at you looking at me

[Outro]
Black-throated wind keeps on pouring in
With its words of a lie that could almost be true
Ah, Mother American Night, lost from the light
Turn it around, that's what I'm gonna do
Well, going back home, that's what I'm gonna do
I'll turn around, that's what I'm gonna do
Well, I'm going back home, that's what I'm gonna do
Turn around is what I'm gonna do
Well, I'm going back home, that's what I'm gonna do
Well, you've done better by me than I've done by you
Oh oh, I'm drowning in you
Oh oh, I'm drowning in you
I'm going, going, going back home, that's what I'm gonna do
I'm going, going, going back home, that's what I'm gonna do
Lord, you've done better by me than I've done by you
Oh oh, I'm drowning in you
Oh oh, I'm drowning in you
Oh oh, I'm drowning in you

[Verse 1]
As I was walking 'round Grosvenor Square
Not a chill to the winter
But a nip to the air
From the other direction
She was calling my eye
It could be my illusions
But I might as well try
Might as well try

[Verse 2]
She had rings on her fingers
And bells on her shoes
And I knew without asking
She was into the blues
She wore scarlet begonias
Tucked into her curls
I knew right away
She was not like other girls
Other girls

[Verse 3]
In the heat of the evening
When the dealing got rough
She was too pat to open
And too cool to bluff
As I picked up my matches
And was closing the door
I had one of those flashes
I'd been there before
Been there before

[Bridge]
I ain't often right
But I've never been wrong
It seldom turns out the way
It does in the song
Once in a while
You get shown the light
In the strangest of places
If you look at it right

[Verse 4]
Well, there ain't nothing wrong
With the way she moves
Or scarlet begonias
Or a touch of the blues
And there's nothing wrong with
The way she caught my eye
I had to learn the hard way
To let her pass by
Let her pass by

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 5]
The wind in the willows played tea for two
The sky was yellow and the sun was blue
Strangers stopping strangers
Just to shake their hand
Everybody's playing
In the Heart of Gold Band
Heart of Gold Band

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Well, this job I've got is just a little too hard
I'm running out of money, Lord, I need more pay
Gonna wake up in the morning, Lord, I'm gonna pack my bags
Gonna beat it on down the line

[Chorus 1]
Going down the line (Going down the line)
Going down the line (Going down the line)
Going down the line (Going down the line)
Going down the line (Going down the line)
Yeah, I'm going down the line (Going down the line)
Going down the line (Going down the line)
I'm gonna beat it on down the line

[Verse 2]
I'll be waiting at the station, Lord, when that train pulls on by
I, I'm going back wherе I belong
Listen, and I'm going home to my samе old used-to-be
Listen, down in Joe Brown's coal mine

[Chorus 2]
I said coal mine (Coal mine)
Whoa, coal mine (Coal mine)
I said coal mine (Coal mine)
Yeah, coal mine (Coal mine)
Hey, hey, coal mine (Coal mine)
Hey, hey, coal mine (Coal mine)
Coal mine, down in Joe Brown's coal mine

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Yes, I'm going back to that shack way across the railroad track
Uh-huh, and, that's where I think I belong
Yes, I got a sweet woman, Lord, yeah, she's waiting there for me
Hey, that's where I'm gonna make my happy home

[Outro]
I said happy home (Happy home)
Whoa, happy home (Happy home)
I said happy home (Happy home)
I said a happy, I said a happy (Happy home)
Happy, happy home (Happy home)
Hey, hey, yeah, yeah (Happy home)
Now, that's where I'm gonna make my happy home

[Chorus]
Taught that weeping willow how to cry cry cry
Taught the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky
Tears I cried for that woman are gonna flood you, big river
And I'm gonna sit right here until I die

[Verse 1]
Well, I met her accidentally in St. Paul, Minnesota
She tore me up every time I heard her drawl, that Southern drawl
Well, I heard my dream went back downstream, cavorting in Davenport
Well, I follow you big river when you called

[Chorus]
Taught that weeping willow how to cry cry cry
Taught the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky
Tears I cried for that woman are gonna flood you, big rivеr
And I'm gonna sit right here until I die

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
Wеll, I followed her down to St. Louie, later on down the river
Trader said she's been here, but she's gone, boy, she's gone
Then I followed her down to Memphis
But she just walked off the bus
She raised a few eyebrows when she went on down alone

[Chorus]
Taught that weeping willow how to cry cry cry
Taught the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky
Tears I cried for that woman are gonna flood you, big river
And I'm gonna sit right here until I die

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Well, I've gotten on down to Baton Rouge, River Queen roll on
Take that woman down to New Orleans, New Orleans
I give up, 'cause I've had enough
Followed my blues on down to the gulf
She loves you big river more than me

[Chorus]
Taught that weeping willow how to cry cry cry
Taught the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky
Tears I cried for that woman are gonna flood you, big river
And I'ma gonna sit right here until I die

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus]
Well, I taught that weeping willow how to cry cry cry
Taught the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky
Tears I cried for that woman are gonna flood you, big river
And I'ma gonna sit right here until I die

[Outro]
And I'm gonna sit right here until I die
And I'ma gonna sit right here until I die

[Intro]
You can sure tell the ones that won their tickets over the radio

[Verse 1]
Since it cost a lot to win
And even more to lose
You and me bound to spend some time
Wondering what to choose

[Pre-Chorus]
It goes to show you don't ever know
Watch each card you play
And play it slow

[Chorus]
Wait until that deal come ’round
Don't you let that deal go down, no no

[Verse 2]
I've been gambling hereabouts
For ten good solid years
If I told you about all that went down
It would burn off both your little ears

[Pre-Chorus]
It goes to show you don’t ever know
Watch each card you play
And play it slow

[Chorus]
Wait until that deal come 'round
Don't you let that deal go down, oh no

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Since you poured the wine for me
Tightened up my shoes
I hate to leave you sitting there
Composing lonesome blues

[Pre-Chorus]
It goes to show you don't ever know
Watch each card you play
And play it slow

[Chorus]
Wait until that deal come 'round
Don't you let that deal go down, no no

[Verse 1 repeated]
Since it cost a lot to win
And even more to lose
You and me bound to spend some time
Wondering what to choose

[Pre-Chorus]
It goes to show you don't ever know
Watch each card you play
And play it slow, children

[Chorus]
Wait until that deal come 'round
Don’t you let that deal go down

[Outro]
Wait until that deal come ’round
Don't you let that deal go down
Wait until that deal come ’round
Don't you let that deal go down
Don't you let that deal go down
Don't you let that deal go down
Don’t you let that deal go down
Wait until that deal come 'round
Wait until that deal come 'round
Wait until that deal come 'round
Wait until that deal come 'round
Don't you let that deal go down, no no

[Verse 1]
I have seen where the wolf has slept by the silver stream
I can tell by the mark he left you were in his dream
Ah, child of countless trees
Ah, child of boundless seas
What you are, what you're meant to be
Speaks his name, though you were born to me
Born to me, Cassidy

[Verse 2]
Lost now on the country miles in his Cadillac
I can tell by the way you smile he's rolling back
Come wash the nighttime clean
Come grow this scorched ground green
Blow the horn, tap the tambourinе
Close the gap of the dark yеars in between
You and me, Cassidy

[Bridge]
Quick beats in an icy heart
Catch-colt draws a coffin cart
There he goes now, here she starts
Hear her cry
Flight of the seabirds, scattered like lost words
Wheel to the storm and fly

[Instrumental break]

[Outro]
Faring thee well now
Let your life proceed by its own design
Nothing to tell now
Let the words be yours, I'm done with mine
Faring thee well now
Let your life proceed by its own design
Nothing to tell now
Let the words be yours, I'm done with mine

[Verse 1]
Look for a while at the china cat sunflower
Proud walking jingle in the midnight sun
Copperdome bodhi drip a silver kimono
Like a crazy quilt stargown through a dream night wind

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
Krazy Kat peeking through a lace bandanna
Like a one-eyed cheshire, like a diamond-eye jack
A leaf of all colors plays a golden-string fiddle
To a double-e waterfall over my back

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Comic book colors on a violin river crying a lot of
Words from out a silk trombone
I rang a silent bell, beneath a shower of pearls
In the eagle-winged palace of the Queen Chinee

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
I know you, rider, gonna miss me when I'm gone
I know you, rider, gonna miss me when I'm gone
Gonna miss your baby, from rolling in your arms

[Verse 1]
Laid down last night, Lord, I could not take my rest
Laid down last night, Lord, I could not take my rest
My mind was wandering like the wild geese in the West

[Verse 2]
The sun will shine in my back door someday
The sun will shine in my back door someday
March winds will blow all my troubles away

[Verse 3]
I wish I was a headlight, on a northbound train
I wish I was a headlight, on a northbound train
I'd shine my light through the cool Colorado rain

[Chorus]
I know you, rider, gonna miss me when I'm gone
I know you, rider, gonna miss me when I'm gone
Gonna miss your baby, from rolling in your arms

[Instrumental break]

[Outro]
I know you, rider, gonna miss me when I'm gone, gone, gone
I know you, rider, gonna miss me when I'm gone, gone, gone
Gonna miss your baby, from rolling in your arms

[Prelude]

[Instrumental]

[Part 1]

[Verse 1]
Winter rain, now tell me why
Summers fade, and roses die
The answer came
The wind and rain

[Verse 2]
Golden hills, now veiled in gray
Summer leaves have blown away
And what remains? The wind and rain

[Chorus]
And like a desert spring
My lover comes and spreads her wings (Flowing)
Like a song that's born to soar the sky (Flowing)
Flowing 'til the waters all are dry (Flowing)
The loving in her eyes

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Circle songs and sands of time
And seasons will end in tumbled rhyme
And little change
The wind and rain

[Chorus]
And like a desert spring
My lover comes and spreads her wings (Flowing)
Like a song that's born to soar the sky (Flowing)
Flowing 'til the waters all are dry (Flowing)
The loving in her eyes

[Outro]
Winter gray and falling rain
We'll see summer come again
Darkness falls and seasons change
(Gonna happen every time)
Same old friends the wind and rain
(We'll see summer by and by)
Winter gray and falling rain
(Seasons fade and roses die)
We'll see summer come again
(Just a song that's born to sail the sky)
Darkness falls and seasons change
(Gonna happen every time)
Same old friends the wind and rain
(Like a song that's born to soar the sky)

[Part 2: Let It Grow]

[Verse 1]
Morning comes, she follows the path to the river shore
Lightly sung, her song is the latch on the morning's door
See the sun sparkle in the reeds
Silver beads, pass into the sea

She comes from the town where they call her the woodcutter's daughter
And she's brown as the bank where she kneels down to gather her water
And she bears it away with a love that the river has taught her

[Refrain]
Let it flow, greatly grow, greatly yield

[Verse 2]
Round and round, the cut of the plow in the furrowed field
Seasons round, the bushels of corn and the barley meal
Broken ground, open and beckoning to the spring
Black dirt live again

The plowman is broad as the back of the land he is sowing
As he dances the circular track of the plow ever knowing
That the work of his days measures more than the planting and growing

[Refrain]
Let it grow, greatly grow, greatly yield

[Bridge]
What shall we say, shall we call it by a name?
As well to count the angels dancing on a pin
Water bright as the sky from which it came
And the name is on the earth that takes it in
We will not speak but stand inside the rain
And listen to the thunder shout "I am! I am! I am! I am!"

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
So it goes, we make what we make since the world began
Nothing more, the love of the women, the work of men
Seasons round, creatures great and small
Up and down as we rise and fall

[Instrumental break]

[Outro]
What shall we say, shall we call it by a name?
As well to count the angels dancing on a pin
Water bright as the sky from which it came
And the name is on the earth that takes it in
We will not speak but stand inside the rain
And listen to the thunder shout "I am! I am! I am! I am!"

[Instrumental]

Thank you

We're gonna take a short break and we'll be back in just a few minutes, so everybody hang loose

[Verse 1]
Some folks trust to reason
Others trust to might
I don't trust nothing
But I know it come out right
Say it once again now
Oh, I hope you understand
When it's done and over
Lord, a man is just a man

[Chorus]
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on the land

[Interlude after low mics]
Wait a minute, sorry, sorry
How about it? Ah, there it is
A thousand pardons, folks
We'll try it one more time

[Verse 1]
Some folks trust to reason
Others trust to might
I don't trust nothing
But I know it comes out right
Say it once again now
Oh, I hope you understand
When it's done and over
Lord, a man is just a man

[Chorus]
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on the land

[Verse 2]
Some folks look for answers
Others look for fights
Some folks up in treetops
Just looking for their kites
But I can tell your future
Oh, just look what's in your hand
But I can't stop for nothing
I'm just playing in the band

[Chorus]
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on the land

[Verse 3]
Standing on a tower
World at my command
You just keep turning
While I'm playing in the band
And if a man among you
Got no sin upon his hand
Let him cast a stone at me
For playing in the band

[Chorus]
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on the land

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Well, the first days are the hardest days
Don't you worry anymore
'Cause when life looks like Easy Street
There is danger at your door
Think this through with me
Let me know your mind
Whoa-oh, what I want to know
Is are you kind?

[Verse 2]
It's a buck dancer's choice, my friend
Better take my advice
You know all the rules by now
And the fire from the ice
Will you come with me?
Won't you come with me?
Whoa-oh, what I want to know
Will you come with me?

[Bridge]
Goddamn, well, I declare
Have you seen the like?
Thеir walls are built of cannon balls
Their motto is don't tread on mе

[Chorus]
Come hear Uncle John's Band
Playing to the tide
Come with me or go alone
He's come to take his children home

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
It's the same story the crow told me
It's the only one he know
Like the morning sun you come
And like the wind you go
Ain't no time to hate
Barely time to wait
Whoa-oh, what I want to know
Where does the time go?

[Verse 4]
I live in a silver mine
And I call it "Beggar's Tomb"
I got me a violin
And I beg you call the tune
Anybody's choice
I can hear your voice
Whoa-oh, what I want to know
How does the song go?

[Chorus]
Come hear Uncle John's Band
By the riverside
Got some things to talk about
Here beside the rising tide
Come hear Uncle John's Band
Playing to the tide
Come on along or go alone
He's come to take his children home

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Walk me out in the morning dew, my honey
Walk me out in the morning dew today
I can't walk you out in the morning dew, my honey
I can't walk you out in the morning dew today

[Verse 2]
I thought I heard a baby cry this morning
I thought I heard a baby cry today
You didn't hear no baby cry this morning
You didn't hear no baby cry today

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Where have all the people gone, my honey?
Where have all the people gone today?
There's no need for you to be worrying about all those people
You never see those people anyway

[Verse 4]
Thought I heard a young man mourn this morning
I thought I heard a young man mourn today
Thought I heard a young man mourn this morning
I can't walk you out in the morning dew today

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 5]
Walk me out in the morning dew, my honey
Walk me out in the morning dew today
I'll walk you out in the morning dew, my honey
I guess it doesn't matter anyway
I guess it doesn't matter anyway
I guess it doesn't matter anyway

[Instrumental]

[Instrumental]

[Refrain]
Whoa-oh, what I want to know
How does the song go?

[Outro]
Come hear Uncle John's Band
By the riverside
Got some things to talk about
Here beside the rising tide
Come hear Uncle John's Band
Playing to the tide
Come on along or go alone
He's come to take his children home

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
I had a hard run
Running from your window
I was all night running, running
Lord, I wonder if you care
I had a run-in
Run around and run down
Run around a corner, corner, corner
I run smack into a tree

[Chorus]
I had to move
Really had to move
That's why if you please
I am on my bended knees
Bertha, don't you come around here anymore

[Verse 2]
Dressed myself in green
I went down under the sea
Try to see what's going down
And Lord, read between the lines
I had a feeling I was falling, falling, falling
I turned around to see
Heard a voice calling, calling
Is running back to me

[Chorus]
I had to move
Really had to move
That's why if you please
I am on my bended knees
Bertha, don't you come around here anymore

[Verse 3]
Ran into a rainstorm
Lord, I ducked into a bar door
It was all night pouring
But not a drop on me
Test me, test me, test me, test me
Why don't you arrest me?
Throw me in the jailhouse
Lord, until the sun goes down
'Til it go down

[Chorus]
I had to move
Really had to move
That's why if you please
I am on my bended knees
Bertha, don't you come around here anymore

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus]
I had to move
Really had to move
That's why if you please
I am on my bended knees
Bertha, don't you come around here anymore

[Outro]
I had to move
Really had to move
That's why if you please
I am on my bended knees
Bertha, don't you come around here anymore
I had to move
Really had to move
That's why if you please
I am on my bended knees
Bertha, don't you come around here anymore
Anymore, anymore, anymore, anymore
Anymore, anymore, anymore, anymore

[Verse 1]
Old man down
Way down down, down by the docks of the city
Blind and dirty
Asked me for a dime, a dime for a cup of coffee
I got no dime but I got some time to hear his story

[Verse 2]
My name is August West, and I love my Pearly Baker best, more than my wine
More than my wine
More than my maker, though he's no friend of mine
Everyone said
I'd come to no good, I knew I would, Pearly, believe them
Half of my life
I spent doing time for some other fucker's crime
The othеr half found me stumbling around drunk on burgundy wine

[Bridge]
But I'll get back on my feet somеday
The good Lord willing, if he says I may
I know that the life I'm living's no good
I'll get a new start, live the life I should

[Refrain]
I'll get up and fly away
I'll get up and fly away, fly away

[Verse 3]
"Pearly's been true
True to me, true to my dying day," he said
I said to him, I said to him, "I'm sure she's been"
I said to him, "I'm sure she's been true to you"

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 4]
Got up and wandered
I wandered downtown, nowhere to go but just hang around
I've got a girl
Named Bonnie Lee, I know that girl's been true to me
I know she's been, I'm sure she's been true to me

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Sugar magnolia, blossoms blooming
Heads all empty, and I don't care
Saw my baby down by the river
Knew she'd have to come up soon for air

Sweet blossom come on, under the willow
We can have high times if you'll abide
We can discover the wonders of nature
Rolling in the rushes down by the riverside

[Refrain]
She's got everything delightful
She's got everything I need
Takes the wheel when I'm seeing double
Pays my ticket when I speed

[Verse 2]
She comes skimmin' through rays of violet
And she can wade in a drop of dew
She don't come and I don't follow
Waits backstage while I sing to you
She can dance a Cajun rhythm
Jump like Willys in four-wheel drive
She's my summer love in the spring, fall, and winter
She can make happy any man alive

Sugar magnolia, ringing that bluebell
While caught up in sunlight
Come on out singing, I'll walk you in the sunshine
Come on, honey, come on home with me

[Chorus]
She's got everything delightful
She's got everything I need
A breeze in the pines and the sun and bright moonlight
Lazing in the sunlight? Yes, indeed

[Verse 3]
Sometimes when the cuckoo's crying
When the moon is halfway down
Sometimes when the night is dying
I take me out, and I wander 'round
Walk around

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
Sunshine daydream, walk you in the tall trees
Going where the wind goes
Blooming like a red rose
Come on over sweetly
Ride out singing, I'll walk you in the morning sunshine
Sunshine daydream, sunshine daydream
Come on over, daydream
Sunshine daydream, well, coming, coming from a sweet dream
Sunshine daydream, well, come on, come on over, daydream
Sunshine daydream, coming, coming from a sweet dream
Sunshine daydream, woo-hoo
Sunshine daydream, woo-hoo
Sunshine daydream, woo-hoo
Sunshine daydream, woo-hoo (Coming from a sweet dream)
Sunshine daydream, well, coming, coming, coming, coming from a sweet dream
Sunshine daydream, well, come on, come on over daydream
Sunshine daydream, woo-hoo
Sunshine daydream (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Sunshine daydream (Come on over daydream)
Sunshine daydream, woo-hoo
Sunshine daydream (Oh oh)
Sunshine daydream (Yeah, yeah)
Thank you

[Verse 1]
Had no connection, no faith or direction, no
Searching and searching for someone to save my soul (Ooh)

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, I was swept up in a wave, swept up in a wave
Ooh, then I heard you say my name

Run smack into a tree

Heard a voice calling, calling
It was running back to me

Ran into a rainstorm
Ducked into a bar door
It was all night pouring
But not a drop on me
Test me, test me, test me, test me
Why don't you arrest me?
Throw me in the jailhouse
Until the sun goes down
'Til it goes down

[Intro: Coco O. & Meek Mill]
Tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin'
To get you under my pressure
I've been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin'
What's up? Cuz (To get you under my pressure)
Let me pop my shit

[Verse]
I can't cry to get no ho back, I can't get my bro back
Knowin' he died about some shit that we did way before rap
Shit, I survived and made it out and I don't wanna go back
So if you really beat them streets, my nigga, then you should know that
I ain't forgettin' where I come from, but I'ma alert that
It's kill or be killed, if they don't kill you, you gon' have to smoke that
In eighth grade, I had a .40, had to learn to work that
Had to learn to tuck that, metal detector, fuck that
Wе shootin' dice in the bathroom, shoot you out your shoes and lunch pass
Wе're the ones who would've robbed you, anywhere, you chump ass
She fell in love with a gangsta, say I make her cum fast
I fuck her from the back slow and hit her from the front fast
And now I'm rich, these niggas sick, I'm makin' everyone mad
When I was broke, I'm like, "Where was everyone at?" I'm fuckin' up
When I was out there on that corner, tryna sell a O
Timberlands freezin' in that fuckin' snow, I'm 1-O
Real trapper, grindin' all night, I ain't goin' to sleep
Seen niggas get it, lose it all, just in quarantine
POA checks runnin' low, niggas doin' things
Buy a tracker for your Trackhawk and they tryna put 'em on things
'Member I was trappin', I was strapped and had like four fiends
Niggas wanted Chevy, I was young, but I had Porsche dreams
Try to tell my youngins, "Stack this dough, don't buy no more jeans"
And never post his gun when he be postin', but he on lean
And fuck, I'ma really tell him when I was stuck in since like fourteen
He said he into drillin' shit and he ain't got no more dreams
I set him on this million shit, made twenty of 'em, quarantine
And I'ma run this shit back for the whole team, for real
And as the marathon continue, we put niggas on the menu that ain't into what we into
Red beam all on his face, I'm tryna see if niggas Hindu when we aimin' at your headtop
I'm doin' good, I got Reform, I know I'm drawn, but I could still get your man rocked
I can't beef with niggas, I'm too busy in this lamb chop
And I only move with niggas that I with grew up with from sandbox
And niggas know I'm big dog, no Sandlot, for real

[Outro: Meek Mill & Coco O.]
Ha (Tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin')
2021, nigga (To get you under)
Survival of the fittest
I meant for survival of the littest, nigga (My pressure), you already know how we comin' (I been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin')
The biggest stepper, ha
Meek Milly in this bitch (To get you under my pressure)
I want everything on the plate, fuck you

[Verse 1]
Chest to chest (Chest to chest)
Nose to nose (Nose to nose)
Palm to palm
We were always just that close (Just that close)
Wrist to wrist (Wrist to wrist)
Toe to toe (Toe to toe)
Lips that felt just like the inside of a rose

[Pre-Chorus]
So how come when I reach out my finger
It feels like more than distance between us?

[Chorus]
In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I've been California wishing on these stars
For your heart, for me
My California king

[Verse 2]
Eye to eye (Eye to eye)
Cheek to cheek (Cheek to cheek)
Side by side
You were sleeping next to me (Oh, next to me)
Arm in arm
Dusk to dawn
With the curtains drawn
And a little last night on these sheets
Pre-Chorus]
So how come when I reach out my fingers
It seems like more than distance between us?

[Chorus]
In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I've been California wishing on these stars
For your heart, for me
My California king

[Bridge]
Just when I felt like giving up on us
You turned around and gave me one last touch
That made everything feel better
And even then, my eyes got wetter
So confused, wanna ask you if you love me
But I don't wanna seem so weak
Maybe I've been California dreaming
Hey, hey, hey, hey

[Chorus]
In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
Been California wishing on these stars
For your heart, for me
My California king

[Guitar Solo]
My California king

[Chorus]
In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I've been California wishing on these stars
For your heart, for me
My California king

[Intro]
Uh
Just can't get over this

[Verse 1]
Way too many nights, way too many ways, you make it high
I'm way too gone to drive, can't let it ash, I just keep comin' back, girl
Don't play
You've been my jawn too many days
I can't see another way
I just keep comin' back

[Pre-Chorus]
But it's somethin' I should've known
You're somethin' I should've known, oh-oh
You're somethin' I should've known
You're somethin' I should've known, oh-oh, oh-oh, ooh

[Chorus]
I can't stay away, chemical buzz all on my brain
I lit some more to numb the pain
Why do all the right drugs come from the wrong love?
Still don't understand but on it too long to give a damn
Just wanna burn you once again
Why do all the right drugs come from the wrong love?

[Post-Chorus]
Woo-ooh, woah-oh, ooh-ooh, ooh-oh
Why do all the right drugs come from the wrong love?

[Verse 2]
I don't care about the truth, I don't really care what I could losе
Might not make it out alive
But I can't let it ash, I just keep comin' back, girl
So don't play
You know what I'd do just for a tastе
And there ain't no other way
I keep steppin' in that trap

[Pre-Chorus]
But you're somethin' I should've known
You're somethin' I should've known, oh-oh
You're somethin' I should've known
You're somethin' I should've known, oh-oh, oh-oh, ooh

[Chorus]
I can't stay away, chemical buzz all on my brain
I lit some more to numb the pain
Why do all the right drugs come from the wrong love?
Still don't understand but on it too long to give a damn
Just wanna burn you once again
Why do all the right drugs come from the wrong love?

[Post-Chorus]
Woo-ooh, woah-oh, ooh-ooh, ooh-oh
Why do all the right drugs come from the wrong love?
Woo-ooh, woah-oh, ooh-ooh, ooh-oh
Why do all the right drugs come from the wrong love?

[AJ and (Nick)]

You had me thinking right from the start
That our feelings could never keep us apart
(You had me thinking I was the one
But I never knew it was only for fun)

[All, (Brian and Nick)]

Tell me that I’m dreaming
Say you’re never leaving
Don’t you wanna be with me
(Don’t you wanna be with me)
Tell me that I’m dreaming
Say you’re never leaving
You heart will be safe with me
Ooh-ooh

[Howie, (AJ)]
Isn't it true
That my love for you
Is here to stay
It won't ever go away
Isn't it true
That my love for you
Is here to stay baby
It won't ever go away
(girl tell me that i'm dreaming)

[Intro]
D-D-Daytrip took it to ten (Hey)

[Chorus]
You used to say that you love me
You could never prove it, though (Oh-oh)
That's why we can't move forward
Used to say that you love me
Who else do you do this for? (Oh-oh)
'Cause, I cannot be used no more...
...
Woah-woah, woah

[Verse]
Kill my fears and say that you love me
Mix my tears and pray for your...

[Chorus]
You used to say that you love me
You could never prove it, though (Oh-oh)
That's why we can't move forward
Used to say that you love me
Who else do you do this for? (Oh-oh)
'Cause, I can not be used no more...
Morning, caught one hour of sleep
Sun shade brings me down to my knees
Well I've nowhere to be
Was let go, now I'm free
It's 'bout time

Monday's fácil into the week
Orange juice, I lick it off of my cheek
Well I've no gift to bring
But I'll be caroling
Door to door
No well for wishing will help me now

But I find
I've been alive
Nearly half the time

Sunflower rising up through the weeds
Long shaped like crooked hand on the key
Crouched, about to leave
I grab a grain of wheat for my smile
Monday's fácil into the week
Star-crossed, now maybe I've been naive
Well I'm prеpared to say
That I can't bear to stay anymore
No wеll for wishing will help me now

But I find
I've been alive
Nearly half the time

I must stand alone
I'm going to keep my own
No well for wishing will help me now

And I find
I've been alive
Nearly half the time
Barely on the ride
Way to go
Where I speed, I'll rile the leaves

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
This one is for the boys with the boomin' system
Top down, AC with the cooler system

Man, all these times
Haven’t seen one yet
I haven’t wanted this
If I wanted to skit

I’ll Devour to my lady
Fuckin, that is crazy
I’ll be going to the lock
To hug you in the dark

[Verse 2: Lil Baby]
C’mon man
Right in my city
Made a promise I won't use you
Play my cards right, I won't lose you
Got 'em tuned in like I'm YouTube
Got somethin' on me like it's voodoo
I'll go nuts for you, go cuckoo, lose my cool and all
And I know that shit was wrong, I shouldn't've did what I did
Just wipe your eyes and stop this cryin'
I told the truth, that I'd been lyin'
I gave you racks, I tried to buy in
I even did the unthinkable, and I'm sorry for what I did to you

[Verse 3: ChanchoXX]
Man loving the dark
A great thing to hard
Personal Donkey in the start

Forgave a lotta niggas for the fuck shit
Forgave a lotta niggas for makin' up shit
I really hope, I really hope
I'm at your door now, live at your front door
Oh, that's a no-no

[Pre-Chorus]
Simmer, simmer, simmer, simmer down
I've been cashing, cashing, cashing out
Still can't find my way
Damn I miss the way it was before
'Fore, 'fore, 'fore

[Chorus]
Trippin' on tomorrow while I'm still in today
I wonder if I'll eat tomorrow if I spend it today
'Cause it is what it is and I'm takin' my chances
I live on the edge right now, right now, right now

[Verse 2]
Pull another double shift, can't complain, no
'Nother, 'nother double shift, never had a real job
Strip club don't really count for much
I failed out of collegе, just wildin' and doin' the most

[Pre-Chorus]
Simmer, simmer, simmеr, simmer down
I've been cashing, cashing, cashing out
Still can't find my way
Damn I miss the way it was before
'Fore, 'fore, 'fore

[Chorus]
Trippin' on tomorrow while I'm still in today
I wonder if I'll eat tomorrow if I spend it today
'Cause it is what it is and I'm takin' my chances
I live on the edge right now, right now, right now

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Trippin' on tomorrow while I'm still in today
I wonder if I'll eat tomorrow if I spend it today
'Cause it is what it is and I'm takin' my chances
I live on the edge right now, right now, right now

[Intro: Lil Yachty]
Man, I'm on some shit right now
I'm on some, some, some rich nigga shit
Some millionaire shit
'Cause lot of these niggas is pussy
All these niggas is broke
I know these niggas is not doing what they pretend to be
Suck my dick, bitch

[Verse 1: Lil Yachty]
I don't really care about my enemies
My new crib came with amenities
You gotta pay for my energy
You gotta pay for my ohh, ehh
Don't make me pop up the trunk
Don't make me two hand the pump
Don't make me call up my bro
Pull up in that junk and go dump, dump, dump
I dress so these niggas can see me
I know your lil' bro wanna bе me
I know your lil' sister wanna freak mе
That's probably why you wanna shoot me
That's why your auntie is a groupie
Send me pictures of her coochie
She said they nicknamed her juicy
'Cause she keep a wet pussy
Pussy nigga don't push me
I pull up deep, not just me
I brought a brand new chain
That shit dance like N-Sync, Justin
I saw your Rolex, brother
That bullshit started rustin'
None of you niggas impress me
None of you niggas would press me
I get more pussy than Preston
My niggas bang red paisley, that's for real
I made a full million off my deal
I made a full 5 out the next
Stupid bitch tried to front on my name
I screenshotted every single text
Bitch I bite like a T-Rex
My future bitch look better than my next
My next bitch look like a top model
She suck dick like a baby bottle

[Interlude]
I'ma tell you like this, man
Youngest nigga in this motherfucker, man
I'm not askin' for your respect
I give a fuck if you fuck with me, nigga
I got M's, nigga
I'm talkin' 'bout the letter before N, nigga
M's, bitch boy

[Verse 2: Lil Yachty]
I didn't ask for respect, no
All I care about it my check
Louis Vuitton on my sneakers
My main bitch a diva, she is a dick pleaser
Uh, I never miss like I'm Curry
Yeah, can't eat that pussy if it's furry
My bitch pussy pink just like Kirby
My bitch suck it up just like Kirby
She drives whips like it's Kentucky Derby
She tote pistols so no one can hurt me
Don't even try it though
I hit your mama at the Hyatt House
Then I offered her Waffle House
That bitch could never see my penthouse
Shit that's just a fact
I nutted all on her back
I nutted all on her tracks
Slid my black card through her cracks
Nasty young nigga, I'm all in it
Posted on the block in a ball fitted
Posted on the block with the same niggas
I got that guap and it change niggas
Rappin' ass niggas love Dracos
I love the AR 'cause its range different
Ain't supposed to talk about guns
'Cause I gotta lot of shit goin'
I was trying to be the nice guy
Until these niggas thought I was hoein'
These niggas thought I was pussy
I had to show 'em I'm 'bout it
I put that bitch on my Snapchat
Watch how she start feelin' clouted
She gon' suck everyone around me
Fresh as hell like I wash laundry with Bounty
I can't front like I didn't come from my county
I know where I'm from, I'm my daddy's son
I never switched up one time
Pick up that back end now it's ice time
This boujee bitch said that she's hungry
Well stupid lil' bitch it's rice time

[Verse]
You niggas keep wearin' where Louis V 

[?]
I'm cooking like Virgil across a cement
I see a bad bitch and her friends
I look at lil' baby, like, "Where is your mans?"
I make it way more in advance
Thought that I told you that I don't do trends
Hop out the Bentley and then hop in a 

[?]
Fucking around like she just want the bands
I'm more like the beat, I'm more like Japan

[Snippet]
Got you watchin' me
No apology
I do what I want
(?)
Drive fast as I want to
All night as I want to
Drive fast as I want to
Only ever wanted you
We can be strangers again if thats what you wanna do
I dont wanna fight untill they say
I dont wanna trade in my past
Only ever wanted
Only ever x2
Wanted you

[Verse 1]
I'm a dynamite factory
Just light a match baby, you will see
We detonated like fireworks
Watch out 'cause I'm feeling nasty

[Pre-Chorus]
See you looking at me, then you turn to the wall
Wanna know, do I make you uncomfortable?
Breaking all of the rules of the games that we play
When it all comes around you got nothing to say

[Chorus]
Can't stop it
The fire's turning up, you started too late
There's a fever in your head, sweat's dripping
Your tongue's been slipping
Now it's getting dangerous

You're falling
And baby I can hear you calling for me but I look the other way Forget you
No, I won't miss you
Now it's getting dangerous
(It's getting dangerous)

[Verse 2]
Watching you crawling at my feet
I've seen it all and now it's on repeat
I'm razor-sharp and I'm cutting deep
And you love it when I'm getting nasty

[Pre-Chorus]
Now you're begging for me, you don't want me to go
Well then how does it feel to get down so low?
'Cause I gave you my heart and you threw it away
When I came back to you you had nothing to say

[Chorus]
Can't stop it
The fire's turning up, you started too late
There's a fever in your head, sweat's dripping
Your tongue's been slipping
Now it's getting dangerous

You're falling
And baby I can hear you calling for me but I look the other way Forget you
No, I won't miss you
Now it's getting dangerous
(It's getting dangerous)

[Bridge: Coco Morier]
Watch out
I'm coming right at you
There's no sign of warning
Nothing you can do
Rising
The temperature's on now
You better stay at home
'Cause it's getting dangerous

[Chorus]
Can't stop it
The fire's turning up, you started too late
There's a fever in your head, sweat's dripping
Your tongue's been slipping
Now it's getting dangerous

You're falling
And baby I can hear you calling for me but I look the other way Forget you
No, I won't miss you
Now it's getting dangerous
(It's getting dangerous)

[Chorus]
Honestly, I hate all this gravity
Bringing you so close to me
Hard to hide the way I feel
I want you all over me
I want you so close to me
I could give you all you need
But I think the moment's all gone
On my face, find it hard to concentrate
Different when I'm at your place
Send me into anti-space
Got a lot of things to say
Know that it would have to change
Why don't you just tell me straight?
Yeah, I think the moment's all gone

[Verse 1]
I need to breathe, I need to speak
I'm feeling weak, I'm feeling scared
All of the words, tip of my tongue
Tell you the truth, tell you I'm bruised
Tell you my thoughts, I'm not so strong
I wanna be up in the trees, just you and me
Blow me away up to the stars
Want you to know I want it all
Tension building way too long

[Chorus]
Honestly, I hate all this gravity
Bringing you so close to me
Hard to hide the way I feel
I want you all over me
I want you so close to me
I could give you all you need
But I think the moment's all gone
On my face, find it hard to concentrate
Different when I'm at your place
Send me into anti-space
Got a lot of things to say
Know that it would have to change
Why don't you just tell me straight?
Yeah, I think the moment's all gone

[Verse 2]
I never say, you're not okay
Set it off right now 'cus I don't have to look through your eyes
Does it give you pain? Does it bring you shame?
Maybe I'm projecting myself on your mind
Really hate the silence, think we got bad timing
Guess we both let this stuff weigh heavy on our minds
Wrap it in chains, sink it away
Guess we're the same
Tension building up way too long anyways

[Chorus]
Honestly, I hate all this gravity
Bringing you so close to me
Hard to hide the way I feel
I want you all over me
I want you so close to me
I could give you all you need
But I think the moment's all gone
On my face, find it hard to concentrate
Different when I'm at your place
Send me into anti-space
Got a lot of things to say
Know that it would have to change
Why don't you just tell me straight?
Yeah, I think the moment's all gone
I can't believe I'm falling again
Just when I thought never again
Something by the way you make me innocent again
Now you're here making me yours
Like all I have was made to be yours
Like everything that came before
Was waiting to be yours

The way I let you in when I'm letting go
How you make me spin in the afterglow
The way you let me in when you're letting go
Baby did you know? I gotta let you know:

You put the pieces back together
Make me feel like I was never open
You make me feel unbroken

It's the first time that I did this
It's the first time everything is showing
You make me feel unbroken
Uh-uh-uh-uh uh-uh-uh uh
Uh-uh-uh-uh uh-uh-uh uh
Uh-uh-uh-uh uh-uh-uh unbroken

All my stars are coming undone
When you got me coming undone
Like all the damage to my heart is finally undone

The way I let you in when I'm letting go
How you make me spin in the afterglow
The way you let me in when you're letting go
Baby did you know? I gotta let you know:

You put the pieces back together
Make me feel like I was never open
You make me feel unbroken

It's the first time that I did this
It's the first time everything is showing
You make me feel unbroken

Uh-uh-uh-uh uh-uh-uh uh
Uh-uh-uh-uh uh-uh-uh uh
Uh-uh-uh-uh uh-uh-uh unbroken

It's cause you say it like you mean it
It's cause you say it and I believe it
It's kind of like I saved it all up
I saved it all for you
You put the pieces back together
Make me feel like I was never open
You make me feel unbroken

It's the first time that I did this
It's the first time everything is showing
You make me feel unbroken

Uh-uh-uh-uh uh-uh-uh uh
Uh-uh-uh-uh uh-uh-uh uh
Uh-uh-uh-uh uh-uh-uh unbroken

Uh-uh-uh-uh uh-uh-uh uh
Uh-uh-uh-uh uh-uh-uh uh
Uh-uh-uh-uh uh-uh-uh unbroken

[Chorus]
I can't lie, ever since you've been gone, oh
I realize, I hate being alone
Sometimes, I wish we stayed a 'lil longer
But I guess you never know what you got 'til its over
I can't lie (Woah), ever since you've been gone, oh (Woah-oh)
I realize (Woah), I hate being alone (Woah-oh, oh)
Sometimes (Woah), I wish we stayed a lil longer (Woah-oh)
But I guess you never know what you got 'til its over (Woah-oh)

[Open Verse]

[Chorus]
I can't lie, evеr since you've been gone, oh
I rеalize, I hate being alone
Sometimes, I wish we stayed a 'lil longer
But I guess you never know what you got 'til its over
I can't lie (Woah), ever since you've been gone, oh (Woah-oh)
I realize (Woah), I hate being alone (Woah-oh, oh)
Sometimes (Woah), I wish we stayed a lil longer (Woah-oh)
But I guess you never know what you got 'til its over (Woah-oh)

[Intro]
Blowed
Uh

[Verse]
See them thinkin' that I'm tonight's entertainment
I'm insane with the brain just like Lil Wayne is
Now I'm stumblin'
My rhythm's a little bit off-key
So I think that they lost me
I'm hangin' with the posse
We at the party and you sittin' in the lobby
And you lookin' pretty sloppy
See a lot of people always try and boss me around
Thinkin' I'm a cat that don't get tossed in the crowd
But now I'm out, loud
Spittin' out the mind
When I'm tickling the twine how I'm twisting up the dime, all up to a Swisher
Got some liquor and some beer, and it's clear that I'm right here
Full release the year that I'm gonе
Sing along 'cause my song got it goin' on
Break of dawn 'til the еarly morn'
I be right up back my rap shit
When I smack you backwards
And cats is annoying, destroying self-employing
Up on this rap shit
But these tactics is on some wack shit
And I'ma always 'bout the real, keepin' it a hundred percent
And let it get wet, but anyways people talk about the tech and the disrespect
While I sit back, pop in a bean, and smoke a cigarette
But it ain't the same shit
When you hit the deck, my flow's too amazing
BJ get his braids in, and then he grows it right back to the afro
And fa'sho, we back
And that's why the class clown's here for about a couple seconds
When I start wreckin', people steppin' from my presence
'Cause when I walk in the room everybody stop talkin'
They jaw's droppin'
Everybody see they not a option
'Cause it's just me, the world, and everybody against it
Plus my homies who I've always been friends with
I repent shit, it's hard in the struggle
You always gotta hustle 'cause it's living like a jungle
People is lions and tigers and bears and I'm really scared
But I ain't scared, no beware
'Cause Mac is here, yeah
And I got my man, deets and beats
On the sweet feet, Pistol Pete is never gon get sick of me
Check the history, I'm always real with what I do
I appeal all these cats who be sippin' down the brew
Or the cats who in the streets 'cause I'm just spittin' my shit
You gotta love it, ain't getting rid of this shit
'Cause I'm back and I'm gon' stick
So haters run away, some will ride the gun and spray
While others blunts and haze, rolled up
I'm so tough and my clothes scuffed
Your flow's butt, if you thinkin', then so what?
'Cause I ain't listenin', I be thinkin' on my own
Drinkin' when I hit her with the bone
See, she hit up on my phone, and I answer
Tellin' me that she a cute mommy, nice body, a dancer
I'ma romance her, I head up to the crib, be a gentleman
Of course she lets me in
We let the sex begin, and stop talkin'
Then I'm out, before the breakfast I start walkin'
Out the door, headin' to the elevator
My phone ringin' by some bitches, I got hella haters
But I don't care, I just keep my mind movin'
And this the type of freestyle, roll some weed to it
'Cause I think it's never gon' be finished
I'm in it, this shit's gon' go on for about twenty minutes
And if the money's in it, then I'ma get it
Never spend it if you, relentless, attempts
That this lil' mischievous shit, will not hit the flip the bic-blah
When I stumble, but shits, see the kid who never mumble
I'm humble, but now I need a drink of water
I've, had, the time of my life
And I never felt this way before
And I swear, this is true
And I owe it all to you

Oh I’ve, had, the time of my life
And I never felt this way before
And I swear, this is true
And I owe it all to you

You-you-you-you-you-you-you-you
Youyouyouyouyouyouyouyou
Y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y
And I owe it all to you
Dirty bit!
Dirty bit!

I've, had, the time of my life
And I never felt this way before
And I swear, this is true
And I owe it all to you
Oh I've, had, the time of my life
And I never felt this way before
And I swear, this is true
And I owe it all to you

I-I came up in here to rock
Light a fire, make it hot
I don’t wanna take no pictures
I just wanna take some shots
So come on, let's go
Let's lose control
Let's do it all night
'Til we can't do it no mo'

I've, had, the time of my life
And I never felt this way before
And I swear, this is true
And I owe it all to you
Oh I’ve, had, the time of my life
And I never felt this way before
And I swear, this is true
And I owe it all to you

[Verse 1]
I crashed my car right into a tree
I'd risk my life for a chance you'd come back to me (Yah)
You called 999, then left me to bleed (Left me to bleed)
I know you'd never cause an accident for me

[Chorus]
I'll count the stars tonight

[Verse 2]
So last Valentine's (Last Valentine's), you spent it away (Spent it away)
To be with a girl you said you never saw that way
It hurts not to smile, it hurts more to breathe
It makes me so angry, all I do is grit my teeth
I still let this man take over me
But I know that I'm not the one it should be
I should really take some timе instead
To figure why this plays out again and again

[Chorus]
I'll count the stars tonight

We flyin' private on vacay in the tropics (Ooh)
We navigatin' the topics of discussion (Ooh)
From the one that I'm havin' now with the pilot (Ooh)
He said, "Turbulence where we goin', it could get rocky" (Ooh)
But the journey ain't for everybody, I ain't worried 'bout it (Ooh)
It get so damn lame, (Ooh) man, I swear
For some money and some damn fame, (Ooh) they don't care
Throw some mud on your damn name and be a lie (Do-do-do-do)
Fact remains I'ma still be the king 'til I die (Ooh)
Fuck what they talking 'bout (Ooh)

[Chorus: Justin Bieber & Brec Bassinger]
I got my peaches out in Georgia (Oh, yeah, shit)

[Verse 2: Justin Bieber, Brec Bassinger & Both]
And I say, oh (Oh)

It's the way you lift me up (Lift me up), yeah (Yeah)
And I'll be right here with you 'til the end of time

[Chorus: Justin Bieber & Brec Bassinger]
I got my peaches out in Georgia (Oh, yeah, shit)

You ain't sure yet (You ain't sure)
But I'm for ya (But I'm for ya)
All I can want, all I can wish for
Nights alone that we miss more (That we miss more)
And days we save as souvenirs (Souvenirs)
There's no time, I wanna make more time (I wanna make time)
And give you my whole life
I left my girl, I'm in Mallorca (I can't leave you)
Hate to leave her, call it torture (Seems like torture when I go)
Remember when I couldn't hold her (I couldn't hold you)
Left her baggage for Rimowa (O.T., baggage for Rimowa)
(Hey, woah, hey)

[Verse 4: O.T. Genasis & Brec Bassinger]

Hand in my hand because I'm yours (I'm yours), I can't

Don't think you wanna know just where I've been, oh

[Verse 1]
Hit the streets, city beat

Talk to me softly
French restaurant
Every time I turn around
I look at you like what now
I'm telling you, it's all true

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm talking to him while I'm thinking of you
I'm trying my best, I don't know what to do
Talking to you, don't know what it's about

[Chorus]
I know they think that I have everything
If I can't have you, then they can't have me
(I know it looks like I have everything)
If I can't have you, then they can't have me
(I know they think that I have everything)
Why am I crying on the balcony?
(I know it looks like I have everything)
If I can't have you, then they can't havе me
(Honestly)

[Verse 2]
Super cool, swimming pool
Will you paint mе sweet?
Look at you, painting cool in the color room
Every time I turn around
I look at you like what now
Can't one single thing
Be just what it appears to be?

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm talking to him while I'm thinking of you
I'm trying my best, I don't know what to do
Talking to him, I don't know what it's about

If I can't have you, then they can't have me

[Chorus]
Love is a state of grace
Transcending time and space
No other way I can describe
Insanely beautiful
It's almost mystical
’Cause you're mine
And I can't believe that I feel
What I feel
Such a strange kind of real
Love is a state of grace
Between you and I, I

[Verse]
Golden, broken, I didn’t know
One touch could open my body and soul
And we've just begun
Like the moon and sun
We fade to one

[Chorus]
Love is a state of grace
Transcending time and space
No other way I can describe
Insanely beautiful
It's almost mystical
'Cause you're mine
And I can't believe that I feel (That I feel)
What I feel (What I feel)
Such a strange (Such a strange) kind of real
Love is a state of grace
Between you and I, I

[Bridge]
And the way that we feel
Is a dream that we know is real
Love is a state of grace (Yeah)
Love is a state of grace

[Chorus]
Love is a state of grace
Transcending time and space
No other way I can describe
Insanely beautiful
It's almost mystical
'Cause you’re mine
’Cause you're mine
Oh, you’re mine

[Outro]
Love is a state of grace
Lyrics from Snippet

[Verse]
Wasting me, needing me
Bottle me, then bottle your feelings
Wishing me, washing me
If he dumping me, then fuck his opinion
You can hold me down, you could ho around
Cause there's plenty of it to go around
Shower me, bottle me
Get up in it 'til you drown in me

[Chorus]
Thirsty, you wanna just drink me up
You wanna just slurp me (Uh-huh)
I know you just thirsty (Uh-huh)
So pour me up, thirsty
You wanna just drink me up (Oh)
You wanna just slurp me (Uh-huh)

Can we take this off and get nake—?
Baby, you're so anxious
You can't take it
Can we take this off and get naked?
Can we take this off and get naked?

[Verse 1]
I don't think 'bout anybody
But bein' beside your body, baby (La-la-la-la-la, la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la-la)
You can leave open windows
Don't care who see me out my clothes, baby
Yeah, I like bananas and peaches
And some might say it's indecent
That's just crazy (That's just crazy)
Can I slide outta mine and into yours?
Heels on, waitin' at your door
I don't wanna play no more
Leave everything on the floor

[Pre-Chorus]
You don't need a pole to see me strip
Only thing I want zipped is your lips
Take it to the top, boy, skinny dip
(So hot, your body on mine, your body on)
I don't even wanna get a grip
I just like it when you grab my hips
Can you feel it through your fingertips? (How do I?)

[Chorus]
How do I keep this on?
How do I let you know?
Boy, you deserve a show
Deserve to get comfortable
It's only natural
I could tell when you locked the door
Just what was going on
Boy, can we take off all our clothes?
When can we take off all our clothes?
When can we take off all our clothes? (When? Oh whoa)
When can we take off all our clothes?

[Verse 2]
Follow me to my dressin' room
Let me know if you ain't 'bout that NSFW
Now it's safe to finish what we started
First impression of you is you really like to party
Swirlin' all up on you 'cause you know I wanna dance
Let me cordially invite you to this party in my pants
How you got me sprung and don't say sorry in advance?
Show me all your tatts, not just the ones that's on your hands
Who's your designer?
Is that birthday suit one of a kind, uh?
Everything about you look like it's on purpose
God was workin', probably took some extra time though
Ayy, all up in my curves like a puzzle piece, mmm
Jigsaw, let me see your muscleses, mmm
After we fuck, I'ma wanna cuddle
We could take it to the kitchen
I'll be on the island, come and eat, mmm

[Chorus]
How do I keep this on?
How do I let you know?
Boy, you deserve a show
Deserve to get comfortable
It's only natural

Lyrics from Snippet

You need a vacation
To catch up to me, you could kick your feet
Tell a bitch don’t leave if you’re in to me
Oh, you need a vacation
To catch up to me, you could kick your feet
Tell a bitch don’t leave, if you’re in to me

La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

I like your girl, she’s a good one
And you know it’s wrong
Got my instincts, not realistic
It’s not your fault
Tell my verdict
Like a felon
You could break your love if you take it off now

[Verse 1]
Made your acquaintance late one night
You were floating around, you know you gave me quite a fright
You didn't seem like an ordinary man
More like a ray of light
You transcendentally imposed yourself upon my bed
You know you didn't say very much
I'm out of body and I feel so good in my head
You know I'm really quite touched

[Pre-Chorus]
I wake up with your fragrance and it's all over me
What cologne do you wear?
I walk around with a smile on my face, 'cause you're close to me
Well I know you're somewhere

[Chorus]
Gonna take my chance on a different kind of romance
A supernatural thing
Gonna have my fill, it gives me such a big thrill to be with
A supernatural thing

[Verse 2]
I stay uplifted for quite some time
(You say you've lived here for quite some time)
And I'd say that your skills as a lover are very refined
You know just what I want and I don't have to ask
Are you reading my mind?
You're not demanding for a man, that's really quite rare
You're not the least bit obsessed with your hair
You're not upset when I come home later than ten
For a ghost you're a very good friend

[Pre-Chorus]
I've got to be a very careful, never know what the neighbors would say
They already think I'm crazy
I wouldn't like to wake up and find myself in the family way
A ghost baby?

[Chorus]
Gonna take my chance on a different kind of romance
A supernatural thing
Gonna have my fill, it gives me such a big thrill to be with
A supernatural thing
Gonna take my chance on a different kind of romance
A supernatural thing
Gonna have my fill, it gives me such a big thrill to be with
A supernatural thing

[Interlude]
I can't see you
I know you're out there you little rascal
Stop that

[Pre-Chorus]
I've got to be a very careful, never know what the neighbors would say
They already think I'm crazy
I wouldn't like to wake up and find myself in the family way
A ghost baby?

[Chorus]
Gonna take my chance on a different kind of romance
A supernatural thing
Gonna have my fill, it gives me such a big thrill to be with
A supernatural thing
Gonna take my chance on a different kind of romance
A supernatural thing
Gonna have my fill, it gives me such a big thrill to be with
A supernatural thing

[Outro]
Gonna take my pants off for a different kind of romance
That super-duper naturally big thing
It's outrageously large
(Gonna take my chance on a different kind of romance)
(A supernatural thing)
(Gonna have my fill)
(It gives me such a big thrill to be with)
(A supernatural thing)

[Verse 1: Drake]
Money just changed everything
I wonder how life without it would go
From the concrete who knew that a flower would grow
Looking down from the top and it's crowded below
My fifteen minutes started an hour ago
Truth over fame, you know I respect the blatant shit
When I hear 'em talking, I just don't know what to make of it
Hate is so familiar to me, I'm slowly embracing it
Doesn't come natural, bear with me, it could take a bit
Yeah and my dreams are who I'm racing with
But you can see I'm pacing it so that I'm always chasing it
Wayne put me right here, that's who I get the papеr with
I hope that my success nevеr alters our relationship
Yeah, this life is something I would die for
October's Own but it's looking like July 4
I just wish they'd let you try it first
This time I'm really going off, fireworks

[Pre-Chorus: Alicia Keys]
When I go off like July 4
Feels like a fire, gotta go higher

[?] revelation, my sweet celebration
Ride me like a rocket
'Cause can't nothin' stop it

[Chorus: Alicia Keys]
All I see is fireworks
All I see is fireworks
Every night it's fireworks
Every night it's fireworks
All I see is fireworks
All I see is fireworks
Taking off like fireworks
Taking off like—Oh

[Verse 2: Drake]
I'm just such a gentleman, you should give it up for me
Look at how I'm placing all my napkins and my cutlery
I could tell it wasn't love, I just thought you'd fuck with me
Who could've predicted Lucky Strike would have you stuck with me
Damn, I kept my wits about me luckily
What happened between us that night? It always seems to trouble me
Now all of a sudden, these gossip rags want to cover me
And you making it seem like it happened that way because of me
But I was curious
And I'll never forget it, baby, what an experience
You could've been the one but it wasn't that serious
There was smoke in the air before, that was me clearing it
That felt good, all in all, I learned a lesson from it though
You never see it coming, you just get to see it go
Yeah, I should've looked up in the sky at first
Now I can see it in her eyes, fireworks

[Pre-Chorus: Alicia Keys]
When I go off like July 4
Feels like a fire, gotta go higher

[?] revelation, my sweet celebration
Ride me like a rocket
'Cause can't nothin' stop it

[Chorus: Alicia Keys]
All I see is fireworks
All I see is fireworks
Every night it's fireworks
Every night it's fireworks
All I see is fireworks
All I see is fireworks
Taking off like fireworks
Taking off like—Oh

[Verse 3: Drake]
Everything's the same but it feels different
My dad called me up knowing that I still listen
And he's still got his foot out, guilt tripping
It's been years though, I just learn to deal with it
For real, me and my realtor, we built up a better rapport
Got my mother in a place with some better decor
She searched the entire city, I let her explore
And now she's saying she's more lonely than ever before
How many of our parents marriages lasted?
I was only 5, I bet I barely reacted
I'm flying back home for the Heritage Classic
Searching for that feeling, tell me where is the magic
Let's stay together 'til we're ghosts
I want to witness love, I never seen it close
Yeah, but I guess I gotta find it first
That's why I'm really going off, fireworks

[Pre-Chorus: Alicia Keys]
When I go off like July 4
Feels like a fire, gotta go higher

[?] revelation, my sweet celebration
Ride me like a rocket
'Cause can't nothin' stop it

[Chorus: Alicia Keys]
All I see is fireworks
All I see is fireworks
Every night it's fireworks
Every night it's fireworks
All I see is fireworks
All I see is fireworks
Taking off like fireworks
Taking off like—Oh

[Intro]
Before I met you, I had no one
And I could go back to having no one again

[Chorus]
He doesn't want me around, he doesn't want me around
He doesn't want me around, he doesn't want me around
He doesn't want me around

[Verse 1]
Baby, in Bellevue I had no one
And I could go back to being a-lush again
If it would make you proud, if it would make you proud
I know you like to go out and mingle with your friends

[Chorus]
He doesn't want me around, he doesn't want me around
He doesn't want me around

[Verse 2]
And I could change my name, go back to gold lamé
Just like thе good old days, tangos and Tanqueray

[Chorus]
Nothing can hurt me now, nothing can hurt me now
Nothing can hurt mе now, nothing can hurt me

[Bridge]
Now I will wait for you for three hundred years
I play pretend and put my arm around a man who isn't there
I must be insane and now it seems I found
The one to say that I'm scared
Who doesn't want me around

[Chorus]
He doesn't want me around, he doesn't want me around
Ooh, doesn't want me around
He doesn't want me around
He doesn't want me around
Ah, ah

[Intro: Meek Mill]
Yo, Nick Papz, make it slap
Yeah (Brrt)
You gotta turn me up in the headphones some more, a lil' bit more
Just a teeny bit
Turn me up, Cruz
It's so many motherfuckin' hundreds, you gotta make a part two

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
I'm not in competition with my homies
I'm whippin' the competition and the Rollie
I knew my opposition never knew me
They wouldn't be opposition if they know me
I made a proposition to my hitters
I told them to knock 'em down if he owe me
I just be slidin' 'round, hittin' the building
We movin' with Glock, pounds, and them .40s
Them niggas got shot down, we was whorin'
My homie a opp now, so we on him
I was like sixteen with the MAC on me
Deep in the field like it's Pop Warner
Weathered the shit, seen niggas cracked on me
When it got real, tried to slide on him
I made some M's, split the guys on it
We keepin' it real, niggas not
And my homie a savage, got put in a casket, and I'm mad at him 'cause he died on us
Just left his viewing and I told his momma, every time that she cry, "We gon' slide on 'em"
I look you niggas right dead in the eye and I ain't surprised you ain't ride for us
How would you feel if you bust some mill' with some niggas and they switch the side on you?
How would you feel?
When you so lit that you can't tell if the love real
If I can't tell you nothin', I'll tell you how a thug feel
And you ain't rich, nigga, your stash can't pay my drug bill
Pussy (Pussy)
Nigga, this expensive pain, pullin' an expensive Range

[Bridge: Lil Uzi Vert]
Neck got expensive chain
He got drug money (Yeah), that's an expensive game (Yeah)
I got an expensive shooter (Yeah), he got expensive aim (Yeah)
You know it's Lil Uzi (Yeah), that's an expensive name (Yeah)

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
I'm goin' hard and my back to the wall (Wall)
I was like JH, just pumpin' and fakin' us, no way they matchin' me off (Matchin' me off)
Who really gon' stick me if we gettin' busy and we seein' rap when it's bought? (Bought)
I won't even practice, I go triple platinum and they sayin' that was a wash, ayy
I switch my Rollie up to a Richard Mille
In the trenches with some young nigga
Tryna tell him how this rich shit really feel
You ain't never been in the field with them late nights, off Benadryl With them great whites, locked in a cell
Like Shawshank, no redemption
I was the richest nigga in the prison
I was strappin' up when niggas wasn't ridin'
I was the richest nigga on a mission
I was motivated, I was watchin' moves
Yeah, I was the brokest nigga, in the kitchen
I was chasin' million when they said I couldn't
I was hard-headed, I ain't listen
Kinda glad that I never did
Now we all made it out the trenches, yeah
All of my money is new
All of my money is blue, riddle me this?
I'm supposed to go get money, and keep doin' favors, and give all my money to who?
You keep tellin' me niggas keep tellin' you what?
Why they be runnin' to you?
And why every time niggas talk about me and it's bad, they keep comin' to you?

[Interlude: Meek Mill]
I never got that part
Nigga, know you my man
But every time you wanna talk bad 'bout me
They come to you and you come to me like a ho ass nigga
I'll slap the shit out you, fuck it
Woo

[Verse 3: Meek Mill]
Hundreds on hundreds on hundreds on hundreds
My homie a opp, but he know how I rock
So you know that I'm ready, however he comin'
We done went up on these niggas like seventy-nothin'
They talkin' 'bout bodies, we talkin' 'bout millions
We talkin' bout money, they talkin' 'bout killin'
I gotta go to the bathroom as soon as I walk in the building
You know how I'm livin'
Walkin', I'm tuckin' and passin' the glizzy
Don't look all sensitive, you know I ain't slippin'
Come to your trenches, it's just me and one of my savages, nigga, you know I ain't trippin'
I can't get extorted, I'm ballin' like Jordan
We slidin with torches, we totin' and pimpin'
It's fuck what niggas think
I just be laughin' to the bank

[Verse 4: Lil Uzi Vert]
I done pulled up with the presidential on my wrist and this bitch hit like Hillary
I was just in the kitchen, whippin' Hannah Montana like my name was Billy Ray
And I bet that I have me a hundred million dollars on these niggas 'fore I be twenty-eight
Love her back, when bitches wasn't lovin' me
Twenty-thousand at best, she ain't dubbin' me
I'm on point, ain't no bitch out here runnin' me
Lamborghini, the same color Bumblebee
Pull up Cullinan, same color, butter seats
In the game, ain't no young nigga touchin' me
Yeah, she know that I'm the shit and she know that I'm rich
Every time that I fuck, she say, "Nut in me" (Ayy, Lil Uzi)

[Chorus]
You found your way but it's never enough
And though it's been tough for you
Losing touch
But ah, summer has its end sometimes
And although I can't promise you much
You'll be fine, you'll be fine

[Verse 1]
Saw you make your bed up
Somewhere in the darkness
Its hittin' you the hardest
Oh, no one predicted how far we came
It's not what you wanted
How fast the time goes? (How fast)
Living in the moment (Yeah)
Takin' you for granted
It's a new normal, it's up to us to live in it
And not to understand it

[Chorus]
You found your way but it's never enough
And though it's been tough for you
Losin' touch
But ah, summer has its end somеtimes (Yeah)
Although I can't promise you much
You'll bе fine, you'll be fine

[Verse 2]
You don't pick your pages
It's how the story goes
In this life, its what you makin'
It's out of your control
It's almost like you're screamin'
But no one hears your voice
'Cause everything is changin' (Oh)

[Chorus]
(You found your way and it's never enough)
'Cause everything is changin' (Changin')
And I can't stop a thing
(You found your way and it's never enough)
'Cause everything is changin', yeah

[Bridge]
It’s just a season, it’s just a season
It’s just a season, just a

It’s just a season (Just a), it’s just a season
It’s just a season, just a

[Chorus]
Found your way, it's never enough
And though it's been tough for you
Losing touch
Oh ah, summer has its end sometimes, sometimes

[Intro]
Please, allow me to introduce myself

We addicted to that bag
You know where all my niggas stay

[Part 1]

[Intro]
One, two, three
A one to the two

[Verse]
I hope you find somebody more toxic
And y’all go through way more arguments than we did
Y’all go through way more arguments than needed
You better give him the same fuckin' treatment
I know it’s just the intro and this shit get deep, but
I’ve got my reasons
I put my work in, it wasn’t worth it
My stresses turned you to the person for somebody else
I made you perfect for somebody else
Endured all of your flaws ’til I broke through all the walls of your guard
Now you’re perfect for somebody else
I know she’s somewhere with a good guy, no
She’s out with a guy who push a pretty penny
Her friend just let me know, she said he gets more paper than me, yeah
There goes my ego
This shit is weak though
My heart is cold, this shit is brick
My shit is Shaq at the free-throw
Tryna get you back with all these cheap hoes
And you don’t even peep though
I let you take ’til there was nothing left of me
I seen it all ’til there was nothing left to see
I know she would leave me, what you telling me?
‘Cause when it’s said and done, all I got is these melodies
You wasn’t there when I was selling CDs
Juggin’ at the TD, I was selling CiCi's
Now this coming in, the money come in 3D
Told me I’d be nothing, bitch, I’m on the TV
Fast forward, mama, look at me, I'm on TV
Fast forward, baby, look at me and see me
Come and see me, yeah
Baby, come and see me, yeah

Come and see me, come and see me, yeah
Come and see me, come and and see me
If it's on the Gram or on the TV, uh
You gon' have to come and see me
Yeah

[Part 2]

[Intro]
She been fuckin’ rich niggas since nineteen
No money inside her bag, just drugs and Maybelline
Seems like money’s got you doing anything
Anything, anything
Servin' looks, you deaded me all for the finer things
Fuck me good and then you tellin' me all kinda things
It’s like money’s got you doing different type of things
Girl, I heard you fucked that nigga in some shit I bought you
It hurts to know that that’s some different shit I taught you
You left me for someone that was icy
With all that ice, don’t you forget you gotta

[Chorus]
Come and see me, come and see me, yeah
Come and see me, come and see me, yeah
If it’s on the ‘Gram, on the TV, yeah
Bitch, you see me, I know you gotta see me, yeah
Come and see me, come and see me, ayy

If it’s on the ‘Gram, on the TV, yeah
Come and see me, gonna see me, yeah

[Interlude]
Yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, I like that shit right there
That's one arm off the shoulders shit right there
Um, look

[Verse]
What it’s hittin' for? I’m toxic, you know it
Even your friends say I’m not shit, and you know it
She ties tears, she’d rather cry tears in the stars
And she knows them other guys in the double-R ain't like us
They ain’t queuing it like us
Movie is playin’ and they ain’t queuing it like us
Maybe I’m toxic, maybe I’m not shit
Liquor, I’m gon' sip
Sip it 'til I get depressed in this bitch
Then I’ma call you right up on the flip
Fifty reasons why your nigga ain’t shit
Fuck 'bout them niggas I’m not at the top
I come and I'm gon' make this shit hot
DM your nigga and blow up the spot
Fuck up the relationship that you've got
Now that I fucked it up, making you mine
It’s no real intention of making you mine
I just don’t wanna see you with no one else
Like I’m the only one allowed to move on
I’m a fuckboy for sayin’ that shit, girl, I know it
I don’t deserve you for playin’ that like that, I know it
But through these toxic eyes, I see potential
Took advantage of the fact you gotta
Come and see me
You've gotta come and see me
You've got to come and see me, yeah
You gotta come and see me
Come and see me

[Chorus]
Come and see me, come and see me, yeah
Come and see me, come and see me, yeah
If it’s on the ‘Gram, or the TV, yeah
Come and see me, come and see me, yeah, yeah
Come and see me
Baby come and see
Come and see
Come and see me, yeah
If it's on the gram or on the TV, on the TV, baby come and see
Come and see come and see
Come and see come and see
Yeah

[Outro]
Welcome to my experience, I hope you'll have a good time while y'all here
You know, we gon' keep it lit, keep it funky, smooth and swavey at all times
And while you here and while you enjoying it, you know I got Todd on the guitar
Coop on the keys the whole Umbrella in the back of this lit
I just hope wherever you at you having a good time and if you not I hope I bring joy to you with this
And if I don't, then better luck next time
Enjoy this shit, it's gon' be lit

[Part 1: H.E.R.]

[Intro]
Why don't you return my calls?
Why don’t you return my calls?
Why you trip 'bout where I be?
You don't ever come and see me
(Come and see me, come and see me, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Yeah
(I want your love)

[Verse]
What you mean that you ain’t fuckin' me no more? Lil' bitch, is you dumb?
Slackin' on my pimpin' made you leave me for a new one
Girl, I'm way too wavy, let you play me like it's too fun
Malice in my palace, you the salad to my crouton
Keisha, Jenny, Gia, give a fuck about what they say
Listen like Madea with that rah-rah and that ray-tay
Somewherе out there bitch I'm out therе stunting on a A-grade
Pissin’ on that block I’m out there spinnin' like a Beyblade
Don’t get from my exes, but get texts on a late night
Airplane mode, I'm like the wheels when it take flight
And it's five-hundred on the dash
And to them tings I'm tryna bag, I’m on yo' ass, ah
Money is the motive, you got no emotion
Only thing she care about is Benjamin and Borden
Money ain't in hand, then the plan get aborted
Slick with that finesse, I bet she'll make you feel important

[Chorus]
But ain't nothing important to her
Ain't nothing important
But Benjamins and Bordens
But ain't nothing important to her
Ain't nothing important
But Benjamins and Bordens
Yeah

[Outro]
What you mean you went and found another nigga? Bitch, is you dumb? (Is you dumb)

[Part 2: Are You Dumb]

[Intro]
Bitch, are you dumb?
Broke my heart, and found someone, are you dumb?
Are you stupid, psychotic or dumb, my girl, which one?
'Cause it must be one

[Verse]
Is it crack, cocaine or meth you smoke?
What type of drugs you on?
'Cause, bitch, you ain't never left before
Is it make-believe? 'Cause it must be the joke of the summer
You can't leave me so open, had your pussy swollen, it's drippin' all over my covers
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, uh
Couldn't have figured
Heard this nigga get more paper than me
I can't even flex and say I'm richer
Guess I'm just the Rollie, he the Richard
I feel embarrassed
I was thinking 'bout horse and a carriage
Thinking 'bout kids in the backyard
Here you come divorcing a marriage

[Chorus]
Are you dumb? Are you dumb?
Are you dumb? Are you dumb?
Made me put in work when you was tryna find someone
Are you fuckin' dumb? Are you fuckin' dumb?

[Verse 1]
Honestly, I’m embarrassed
I’ve been so fucking careless
Caught in my fucking ways
You should not have to wait
I’ve been so fucking selfish
Insecure ‘cause I’m jealous
I want nobody with ya
Still got my sneaky link ups
I know I’m wrong for that
Guess these are my confessions
I know I lied so many times that I believed my answers
Know I made you wait (Baby)
You shouldn’t have to wait (Baby)
You shouldn't have to stay
You shouldn’t have to stay
You went and found an athlete
Now I hate fuckin’ athletes
I couldn't keep it classy
Bitch, I was way too flashy
You found this nigga wealthy
He gets more paper than me
Honestly, I’m еmbarrassed
Booked a one way to Paris

[Chorus]
‘Causе when it get like this, I need distance
I’m on a twelve-hour flight with just my feelings
It can get like this in an instant
As soon as I get into thinkin’ that nigga done fucked you like I did
Nigga sucked you like I did
Does he touch you like I did? Like I did
Like I did
Did he touch you like I did?
Does he touch you like I did? Like I did

[Post-Chorus]
Now all of a sudden
You don’t owe me nothing to tell me whoever he is
Fuck whoever he is
Fuck whoever he is

[Verse 2]
Depression, obsession is selfish
Somehow just drownin' in summer depression is helpin'
It really ain’t helping, no, it ain’t helpin', no, it ain’t helpin' no
This shit ain’t healthy, this isn’t healthy, this isn’t healthy
Booked you a flight to come out to me, and you didn’t take it
That was the moment I had realized we wouldn’t make it

[Interlude]
Fucking dumb bitch, uh

[Chorus]
‘Cause when it gets like this, I need distance
I’m on a twelve-hour flight with just my feelings
In an instant
As soon as I get into thinkin’ that nigga done fucked you like I did
Nigga sucked you like I did
Does he touch you like I did? Like I did
And does he lick you like I did?
Does he stick you like I did?
Dick you down the way I did?
Does he do that?

[Post-Chorus]
How all of a sudden you don’t owe me nothing to tell me whoever he is?
Fuck whoever he is
Fuck whoever he is

[Intro]
Yeah
Yeah

[Verse]
Fuck in the kitchen, let me fuck, know you with it
You know that you got a spot and I'll hit it
You got a nigga new, you got somebody new
You got somebody and you know that that nigga, he just don't hit it
The way I hit it 'cause if he was hitting it then baby right now you wouldn't be with me
You gotta keep it a buck with yourself
Before I chase you, I'ma fuck with myself
But I don't wan' fuck with myself
'Cause it's lonely when I fuck with myself
Low-key when I fuck with myself
All of these nights of spending alone
When I get to endin' that pussy
You know you gon' low-key have to give me the belt
You told me last night when we fucked, this was the best head you ever got, don't lie
You told me last night when we fucked, this was the best sex you ever got, oh, don't lie
I'm getting chills, you and your latest new nigga cannot be for real
You say you didn't wanna fuck the nigga, but you know you wanted to fuck on your feels
Go spend your time in Texas
Now you just one of my exes
I ain't even 'bout to stress it
'Cause when I go find me somebody better, promise that it's gon' hurt
Yes, it's gon' hurt
It's gon' fuckin' hurt
I promise that you gonna feel how I feel and that's hurt
I'm hurtin', babe
A nigga's so ashamed
I'm so ashamed
I'm so ashamed
Baby
You know my name, yeah
I'm so ashamed, yeah
Should've never left you this way
I should've never left you this way
Fucked around treated you the same
Fucked around treated you the same
Fucked around and didn't do a thing
Fucked around and didn't do a thing
Another nigga came doin' things
Baby now I'm sitting, sitting in this motherfucker sitting and I'm wishing
Wishing that you were right back in my division, baby, I could have you right in my edition
Put you back inside position, baby
I miss you, baby
I wanna lick it and stick it and come back and come back and kiss it, baby
You know I'd dick you baby
I'm calling you
Uh, I give it all to you
Respectfully, though

[Verse]
You believe that I'd just up and forget that shit?
I mean at the start, I thought about letting this go
Adam and Eve, I know they wish they never did that shit
It was still in the garden, but some things we just have to let go
Joke's on me, I gave up all this pussy cat no looking back, and watched you leave from me
But is the joke on me or you? 'Cause that new nigga that you got, he's not flea
He's not flea
And not only that, he's not me
He's not me
You believe at times I mistaked what your worth is
I believe, all I did was try to show you purpose
We believe, oh, we believe
If we would've met at different times in life, then this shit would've been perfect
But it's imperfect, baby
Calling me perfect, baby
Treat me like worth it baby
Send 'em around and and coming around treat me like I'm worthless baby
Then you get mad at me when I come back and it bring it right back up to the surface, baby
The double standard, it get crazy
The double standard, it get wild
I wanted you to have my fuckin' baby
Now I'm standing with this crooked smile
Does that other nigga make you smile?
Do that other nigga make you crazy?
'Cause that other nigga he be hating, uh
It's only your body, shawty, I be scrollin'
Give a fuck who I o-ffend (Oh)
Beat the pussy 'til it's swollen, Uh
Sippin' Don P, got us open
If you're horny, bust it open
Baby, trust me, I'm chosen
But I don't test the odds
'Cause with all the odds against me, I still thought that we were better than we thought
And I don't question God
But God, why did you have to give her someone better than me?
Knife inside my heart and it keep stabbing
Embarrassed of the times when I was bragging
Through all the embarrassment, I want you back in, back in, back in
Oh, no
I know I'm toxic
You know I'm toxic
Your momma know we toxic
Nigga, she insist we stop this
But I insist that we hop on a jet, go to the tropics
'Cause maybe I'm gon' pop it
'Cause you know all I want is you to see, see, see
Damn
Said all I wanted was you to see half of me
And I know you'll see me

[Verse 1]
I know you went and found somebody new
When all my friends are showin' me new pics of you
All on the 'Gram with your man
Smilin', holdin' hands like
He just do you so much better than I do
Knew this day would soon be comin'
Guess I didn't expect that it'd be this soon
I guess what I'm tryna to say is
I know this ain't right for the time, but

[Chorus]
Y'all don't look right together
Y'all don't look right together
Y'all don't look right together
'Cause you look like mine forever, mine
Y'all don't look right together
Y'all don't look right together
Y'all don't look right together
You look like mine forever, ayy

[Verse 2]
Know I sound like I'm hatin' when I'm bein' honest
Just tryna find my feelings somewhere I can't find them
'Cause them shits have me actin' scary
Feel like a knife is scrollin' through my chest and I can't seem to get it out
Feel like, if nothin', we was never this bad
Everything you do, it seem to make me so sad
But that should not mean we should not get time to intervene
'Cause what that means should be, 'cause

[Chorus]
Y'all don't look motherfuckin' right together
Y'all don't look right together
Y'all don't look right together
You look like mine forever, baby, mine forever, baby
Y'all don't look right together, ayy
Said y'all don't look right together, ayy
Y'all don't look right together
You look like mine forever, uh, mine forever

[Outro]
Y'all know, y'all know
Woah
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na-na
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na-na
This that shit my nigga Ken wish he could do, yeah

[Verse]
Shawty, after all the fighting, the fucking's better
You got your left hook and your right in, all of your vendetta
You punched me in my fuckin' jaw, you ain't have to do that
You swung again and hit the wall, then I had to move back
I'm buying Plain Janes, Rollie for my main thing
She still got the nerve to argue, that's the way of sayin' things
All she do is bitch at me like that's the way of sayin' things
Bought this bitch a hunnid bags like they don't do the same thing (Same thing)
Shit don't ever change, it don't ever change
Even when I try to change my ways, you gon' stay the same
Thеn you wanna pop up on me 'cause my feelings David Blaine
Got thеm disappearing niggas, listen up and hear this, nigga
How many of us bought this bitch a bag, and it ain't change shit?
How many of us bought this bitch a watch, and it ain't change shit?
How many of us bought this bitch a car, and it ain't change shit?
Man, it hurts to say, but some of y'all bitches ain't shit
I might need some therapy
The last bitch I fucked with, lied and tried to publicly embarrass me
But this album will not be about her this time
'Cause all that lying she did, fucked with my real bitch
Big time, this the sixth time I done fucked up
Big lyin' got my bitch cryin' in the tub, drunk
She just caught me in 4K getting fucked up
Two bitches going both ways like some nunchucks

[Part 2: Nunchucks]

[Verse]
Two bitches going both ways like some nunchucks
Two bitches going both ways like some nunchucks
Two bitches, maybe a few bitches going both ways like some nunchucks
Going both ways like some nunchucks
Hating on me, I give one fuck
Two chicks, both ways like some nunchucks
I don't like girls that be stuck up
I like girls tell me, "Shut the fuck up"
The way they feel, how I like it
You know it is, how I strike it
You know it is, I'ma snipe it
You know it is
You know what it is
You know what it is
You know what it is
Yeah

[Intro]
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
Ayy, ooh

Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby

[Chorus]
Ooh, loving you right, loving you right, I'm loving you
Touching you right, I’m touching you right, I'm touching you
Feels for the night, best time of our lives
Loving you right, ayy

Loving you right, I'm loving you right,  I’m loving you
Touching you right, I'm touching you right, I'm touching you

Feels for the night, best time of our life

[Verse]
Get in the covers, mami hold down my love and
Oh, yeah, give it to me good-good tonight

[Chorus]
Loving you right, I’m loving you right, I'm loving you
Touching you right, I'm touching you right, I'm touching you

[Outro]
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy

Yeah, yeah
All night, lil' baby, I be touching you right
Touching you right
Licking you right

I don't want nobody else but you, babe
I don't need nobody else but you, babe
I just wanna get you tonight

I don't want nobody else but you, babe
I don't want nobody else but you, babe
'Cause I'm just touching you right
I'm just fucking you right, yeah
I sang that shit with my eyes low, yeah, I like that shit

[Verse]
Said you can go fuck somebody, I did not say to cuff somebody
Still you went and you found somebody
Bitch, I thought there was nobody
I'm on my lonely
I'm on some fuck everybody
I'm on some just let it cool
Put you on this pedestal
Like, "Look what I did, look what I did, look what I did"
I made you a star, gave you your start, look what I did
Gave you your all, that's why you rock your style like this
And all of your friends will know you and you that I'm him
I'm him, this nigga that you be looking for
The one that you wanna be cooking for, I'm him, yeah
This nigga that you be textin' with
The one that you wanna be sexin' with, I'm him
Yes, I'm him, yes, I'm him
Even though I talk crazy, get under your skin, I'm him
Sent you to the streets, I want you back
'Cause all of these niggas that play with thе ball and rap gon' treat you like crap
And this is not the placе for that, and this is not a place for thatr
You are not built for that
No, you are not built for that
Imagine seeing me out and
Having to act like
Like we don't even see each other, like we don't even need each other
When you know I'm needing you back
It's tearing my soul to pieces
I sent you out to the streets and
And now I made my bed, gotta sleep in
And now I my home, gotta stay in it
Now I made my back to the streets
And now these R&B songs are on and
It's starting to make so much motherfucking sense to me
Like lonely, I'm Mr. Lonely
'Cause I have nobody to call my own
Heard that song on the radio, it made me sick
Then I realized that it's half legit
'Cause then I realized that it was accurate
'Cause I'm so fuckin' lonely
I'm so fuckin' lonely
The woman I left you for, disrespected you for
Is somewhere out with some nigga from Atlanta and she's probably out there fucking on me, uh
Nah, let's keep it real, that bitch is fucking on me
And I feel so stupid for leaving you
'Cause every time I told you lies
You looked me in my eyes, with these eyes
And you told me, "I believe in you"
Knowing damn well I didn't want you to
I didn't want you to
Yeah

[Intro]
Uh, welcome to the show
It's curtain call
You ain't gotta do nothin' baby, just relax

[Verse 1]
Sit down, let me take your shirt off
I'm feeling real cocky, I'm about to show off
I'm gonna take my time 'cause I know that's what you want
Sit back and watch me
When I turn the blue light on it's like I'm moving in slow motion
I'm giving you a tease, you're barely seeing me
It's going down in here

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm looking for a standing ovation in here, oh
I want you driving my seat, 'cause you wanted me, oh
I'm gon' have you day-dreaming 'bout this for weeks
Turn on, turn on the strobe light
Turn on the strobe light, strobe light

[Chorus]
Watch me when I turn on the strobe light (Strobe light)
You know it's on when you see thе strobe light (Strobe light)
You want it more whеn you see the strobe light (Strobe light)
Enjoy the private show, I know you want more

[Verse 2]
I want you to cum (Come here), I want you to go down (Stairs) Might let you back up for air
If you're a good boy, I'll give you attention
I got you on the edge of your seat
You say you can't take much more, you want me
Keep your eyes on me, watch me hit my peak
Watch me go faster, watch me go harder

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm looking for a standing ovation in here, oh
I want you driving my seat, 'cause you wanted me, oh
I'm gon' have you day-dreaming 'bout this for weeks
Turn on, turn on the strobe light
Turn on the strobe light, strobe light

[Chorus]
Watch me when I turn on the strobe light (Strobe light)
You know it's on when you see the strobe light (Strobe light)
You want it more when you see the strobe light (Strobe light)
Enjoy the private show, I know you want more

[Bridge]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Yeah, yeah
No, no, oh-ah-ah-ah, ah, ah
Oh

[Chorus]
Watch me when I turn on the strobe light (Strobe light)
You know it's on when you see the strobe light (Strobe light)
You want it more when you see the strobe light (Strobe light)
Enjoy the private show, I know you want more

[Chorus]
Watch me when I turn on the strobe light (Strobe light)
You know it's on when you see the strobe light (Strobe light)
You want it more when you see the strobe light (Strobe light)
Enjoy the private show, I know you want more

[Verse 1: DJ Temperamental]

You're not my girl, not my wife
Got a couple tips from Mike
I'm moon-walkin' out tonight
I close my eyes, you ought of sight

And she wanna call me conceited?
Cause I'm a smooth criminal, I told her to beat it
When a little love was all I needed
You talkin'? I call it how I see it

And now I mean it, I'm out for good
Like a lot of you when I'm movin' out the hood
But if I told you to take me back, you would
Too late, like me, Pete

[?], Pac, you should

Had you in the cars for the metro
With a couple superstars from the get-tuh
Now you feelin' so sorry you let go
Of the T-E-M-P-A-Mental

[Chorus: Michael Jackson] x 2
What you gonna do?
You ain't no friend of mine
Look what you put me through
Now that I'm the Blue Gangsta

What you gonna do?
You ain't no friend of mine
I can never fall in love
The Blue Gangsta

[Verse 2: Pras]
You ain't a friend, a friend you never be
Obviously you never been with a real OG
From the H-I-T, rollin' B-I-G
Pass it through, V-I-P, it's the righteous G

[?]

You going, "Spread some love," like the gold rush
It was the things you did that you used to mean so much
Whatever you touch, the way you used to blush
Not me you brush

[?], I don't believe in such

Nonsense, lovers don't promote violence
Non-cents, just like your dollars -- no sense
No good, I can feel it through my sixth sense
What's this? You wanna suck my existence
But still, I believe in you and me
Quite frankly, that's how it's supposed to be
The kind of love like you endin' your poverty
So I keep me scoped like a Kennedy
Yeah!

[Chorus: Michael Jackson]

What you gonna do?
You ain't no friend of mine
Look what you put me through
Now that I'm the Blue Gangsta

What you gonna do?
You ain't no friend of mine
I can never fall in love
The Blue Gangsta

[Verse 3: Michael Jackson]

What you gonna do? Cause I'm gonna get you
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
All the things you said and the things you done to me
You can no longer make me cry

Look what you done to me, baby
I can no longer smile, baby
And I've waited so long, just to carry on
I'm the Blue Gangsta

[Chorus: Michael Jackson] x 2

What you gonna do?
You ain't no friend of mine
Look what you put me through
Now that I'm the Blue Gangsta

What you gonna do?
You ain't no friend of mine
I'm never gonna fall in love
The Blue Gangsta

[Verse 1]
Staring at her, can't help it
Thinking 'bout her 'cause oh, my God she's beautiful
I can't believe she's mine, yeah
I only wanna be with her
Smile caught me at first sight
Is she even real?

[Pre-Chorus]
So tell me why I feel so hazy
My thoughts are running wild, I'm shaky
Don't wanna waste her time, yeah
I never understood "Why me?" 'cause she's just so good
My God, she's beautiful

[Chorus]
I hope she loves me back
My heart would break if she don't
I hope she loves me back
My heart would break if she don't
I hope she loves me

[Verse 2]
Wonder if this is just a question of time
I'm here waiting for a sign
Want her to be by my side
But what if she finds out I'm a loser?
No, I don't wanna lose her to someone else
I hope she loves me

[Pre-Chorus]
Figure out how to ask her from the same page
Am I allowed to be thinkin' 'bout forever?
Don't wanna waste her time, yeah
I never understood "Why me?" 'cause she's just so good
My God, she's beautiful

[Chorus]
I hope she loves me back
My heart would break if she don't
I hope she loves me back
My heart would break if she don't
I hope she loves me

[Outro]
Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah

[Intro]
There's only one thing you can't forget
You've got only one life
This is one night
And you'll never see her again

[Verse 1]
What time is it?
Do you know what time it is?
You ain't gotta be a scientist
For you to know that I'm down with it
Stop willin'
Hurry up 'cause I'm firin'
Do you wanna be divin' in
You just gotta come 'round with it

[Pre-Chorus]
It's 12:45
Got your body on my mind
And in fifteen minutes
You might be the one
For the night
But my number you can call
And the writing's on the wall
Yeah, yeah
When we get, when we get, get, get together
Ooh

[Chorus]
You make me lose my mind
My heartbeat's out of time
When we get, when we get, get, get together
Ooh
Each time I close my eyes
I see your skin on mine
When we get, get, get together

[Verse 2]
Wind me up, what you gonna do about it, love?
'Cause we could talk about it, love
Or you could show me right now?
I promise ya, if you take it high enough
I might just sign you up
And you won't make it slow down, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
It's 12:45
Got your body on my mind
And in fifteen minutes
You might be the one
For the night
But my number you can call
And the writing's on the wall
Yeah, yeah
When we get, when we get, get, get together
Ooh

[Chorus]
You make me lose my mind
My heartbeat's out of time
When we get, when we get, get, get together
Ooh
Each time I close my eyes
I see your skin on mine
When we get, get, get together

[Bridge]
Broke down and I can't recover
So smooth, make it feel like butter
Take me all the way tonight
Oh, take me all the way tonight
Can see that you seem like trouble
Too hot, make it feel like summer
Take me all the way tonight

[Outro]
When we get, when we get, get, get together
Ooh
You make me lose my mind
My heartbeat's out of time
When we get, when we get, get, get together
Ooh
It's time I close my eyes
I see your skin on mine
When we get, get, get together
Yeah
When we get, get, get together

[Lyrics from Snippet]
I'm lazy, and It's not a trait I like to prove
It shames me when I feel I have nothing to lose
My mum shows me off
'Cause she's proud that I'm her baby even though I'm lazy

[Lyrics from Snippet]
We all know that your girlfriend is too pretty for you
So I gave her my number so she'll tell me when you're through
I don't know how to say it, never felt this way before (Yeah)
I can't believe my eyes 'cause she's the fittest girl I ever saw

[Verse 1]
You've been livin' high, on the benefitin' side of doubt
My heart hijacks my pride
I'll let you in and bail you out
It's gonna be different this time around

[Chorus]
You think I'll keep giving, you keep takin'
Oh no, baby
You're mistaken, it's the end of this dance
And there is no more, no more, no more one more chance
Hey, hey

[Verse 2]
All the rules have changed
'Course you never played by 'em anyway, mmm
It's pourin' rain and I'm draggin' your bags, drenched in the driveway
I'm done, it's the last timе I'm gonna cuss your name

[Chorus]
You think I'll keep giving, you keep takin'
Oh no, baby
You're mistaken, it's thе end of this dance
And there is no more, no more, no more one more chance

[Bridge]
To hold me tight
And lie, lie, lie
Mmm, mmm
Hey, yeah

[Chorus]
I'll keep givin' and you keep takin'
Oh no, baby
You're mistaken, it's the end of this dance
And there is no more, no more, no more one more chance
Hey, hey

[Outro]
No more chances
Hey, hey

[Verse 1]
You've always got one foot out the door
You always leave me wanting more
And waiting
I get too close
You get worried
Just like that you're off in a hurry
I hate it

[Chorus]
I don't need a love like this
What you don't have, you won't miss
So run away
Go ahead and run away
All you ever do is run away

[Verse 2]
What is it you're so afraid of?
I gave it my all
You just gave up what you had
And why are you callin' me up on the phone?
Are you gettin' lonely from bein' alone?
Well, it's too bad

[Chorus]
You don't need a love like this
What you don't have, you won't miss
So run away
Go ahead and run away
All you ever do is run away

[Bridge]
I know you
Never get too far
'Causе you ain't never happy wherе you are

[Reprise]
So baby, just run away
Go ahead and run away
All you ever do is run away
Just run away
Go ahead and run away
All you ever do is run
Away

[Instrumental outro]
When I'm older, I know I would like to say
"You aren't the only one for me"
And when I bite the dust, will you pray on your knees
So that I'm not still lonely
They said we-
We didn't get very far, but we mean a lot to me
Even when it was hard and they said I was too keen
Don't need no money or love, who would alter everything
Sometimes we are moments away from being complete

[Verse 1]
Wake up, I love you
You love me
We say it every day
And I make up some coffee
We go our separate ways
And you come home, you kiss me
Not too much to say, you're busy
I get it

[Chorus]
Just tell me that you're tryin'
That's all I really wanna know
And I'm gonna be alright when
Dad is knockin' on the door
Don't wanna be the only one who's pickin' up the slack
If you're gettin' something, you should give it back
I swear to God I am
So tell me that you're trying, trying
Yeah

[Verse 2]
Come on, we had it
I felt it, look as us now
You wouldn't know it, all the space thats in the middle of the bed that we're layin' in
And I don't need every answer to every fight
I don't need a happy ending tonight
I guess ill throw the clothes in the dryer
I'll let it go 'cause you'e tried

[Chorus]
But tell me that you're tryin'
That's all I really wanna know
And we're gonna be alright when
Dad is knockin' on the door
Don't wanna be the only one who's pickin' up the slack
If you're gettin' something, you should give it back
I swear to God I am
So tell me that you're trying, trying, hey
Tell me that you're trying

[Bridge]
Well, if you're not sayin' goodbye
Please tell me I'm worth the fight
Just tell me that you're trying, trying

[Chorus]
Don't wanna be the only one who's pickin' up the slack
If you're gettin' something, you should give it back
I swear to God I am
So tell me that you're trying, trying, hey
Tell me that you're trying, trying
Lyrics from Snippet

These tears left me now broken, broken
But I shouldn't have to please everyone
Don't show it on my face, turn red
On my face, turn red (I, I)
Looking for excuses I could make so that I could fight the pain and play the game

[Lyrics from Snippet]
I guess it's stupid to hide under my shirt
When my parents always seem concerned
And I know that to them I'm just dirt
And to them I'm just dirt (I'm just dirt)

[Intro]
I'm a livin' little good thing
It's like you never lived for me, yeah
Mama said you was a good thing, uh
Good, good, good, yeah
Yeah
We came a long way, man, we done came a long way
And we sittin' on top of this shit
This shit can go one of two ways
This shit can go up, it can go down
Either way, nigga, I'm prepared
Feel me? Yeah

[Verse]
I be comin' in peace, but fuck me
Best beware of the others
This shit deep, undercovers creep
This Southern heat make unbearable summers
Just last week, seen yo' mama weep
Crying 'cause she don't wan' bury your brother
The blood lеaks while the EMTs
Gotta carry her baby likе surrogate mothers
Woah, thank God we survived around where the terrorists hovered
Though traumatized, wouldn't trade it for nothin'
Through hard times, it was there I discovered
A hustle and makin' the best out the struggle
I kept grindin' 'til this day, up a level
Respect mine, gotta stay out of trouble
'Cause TEC-9s like to air out rebuttals
Cole World, niggas knowin' what it is
Just in case they don't, I show 'em what it is
This summer, I do real numbers
Couldn't dare touch it if they sold a double disc
Block hot, niggas burnin' up the street
Shots poppin' and we heard it up the street
It's a war, niggas runnin' up the score
Jesus said that you should turn the other cheek
Was his niggas gettin' murdered every week?
Dead bodies, smell the odor in the street
My homie' homie got out on parole
He sold more Coca-Cola than the soda industry
Summertime bring the coldest winter breeze
Hella blues like the Rollin' 60s
Christ went to Heaven age thirty-three
And so did Pimp C and so did Nipsey

[Outro]
I told you, I told you
This shit can go up, it can go down, I don't give a fuck
Nigga, I done seen the highest heights
I done seen it twice
And I've seen the lowest of the lows
And still I rose
Now I'm at your neck, nigga, yeah
The way she came into the place, I knew right then and there
There was something different about this girl
The way she moved her hair, her face, her lines
Divinity in motion

As she stalked the room, I could feel the aura of her presence
Every head turned feeling passion and lust
The girl was persuasive, the girl I could not trust
The girl was bad, the girl was dangerous

She came at mе in sections with the eyеs of desire
I fell trapped into her web of sin
A touch, a kiss
A whisper of love, I was at the point of no return

Deep in the darkness of passion's insanity
I felt taken by lust's strange inhumanity
This girl was persuasive, this girl I could not trust
The girl was bad, the girl was dangerous

Hee-hee!
Ooh!
Ooh!
Hoo!
You've been hit by—
You've been struck by—
A Smooth Criminal

Aaow!

You know you want me

Dangerous (Hee!)
The girl is so dangerous (Hee-hee)
Take away my money, throw away my time
You can call me honey, but you're no damn good for me

Dangerous (Hee! Hee!)
The girl is so dangerous (Dog gone!)
I have to pray to God, 'cause I know how lust can blind
It's a passion in my soul, but you're no damn lover friend of mine

Hoo!
Hoo!
My baby

You been, you take, uh
You don't, you don't, don't
You turn, my baby
Dangerous (Dangerous)
Dangerous (Dangerous)
Dangerous (Dangerous)
You don't, you don't, don't
Dangerous (Dangerous)
Dangerous (Dangerous)
Dangerous (Dangerous)
Dan'gerus, dan'gerus
Hoo!

Get the point?
Good, let's dance

Hoo!

Hoo!
Dan'gerus
Dan'gerus, dan'gerus
Hoo!

We keep goin' back and forth, oh
Why can't you just tell me how you're feelin'?
Why can't you admit it?
I told you everything about me

[Verse 1: Adam Levine]
Quick, give me some Novocaine
It's almost like you're pulling me closer to tell me it's over
But I like the change
I know you think that love's temporary

[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]
But please don't compare me to
Anybody, anybody, anybody else now, yeah

[Verse 2: Adam Levine]
So, tell me somethin' about you
Everything you been through
So, what you got to lose?
So, what you got to lose?
It could be about the past
Or something brand new
What do we got to lose?
What do we got to lose?

[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]
But please don't compare me to
Anybody, anybody, anybody else now (Else now), oh (Oh)
Tell me you ain't fallin', but I see you on the way down, woah

In a strip club tryna get all the pretty girls to dance

[Outro: Adam Levine]
So, tell me somethin' about you

[Intro]
Uh, what?
That's right, Bad Boy
Don’t go, don't go, don't go (Baby, don’t go, what?)
I love you so
One more chance (Lyrically, I)
Biggie, give me one more chance (One more chance, lyrically, I)
One more chance (What? Junior M.A.F.I.A.)
Biggie, give me one more chance (Junior M.A.F.I.A., remix)

[Verse 1: The Notorious B.I.G.]
First thing's first, I, Poppa, freaks all the honeys
Dummies, Playboy bunnies, those wanting money
Those the ones I like 'cause they don't get nathan
But penetration, unless it smells like sanitation
Garbagе, I turn like doorknobs
Heartthrob nevеr, Black and ugly as ever
However, I stay Coogi down to the socks
Rings and watch filled with rocks
And my jam knock in your Mitsubishi
Girls pee-pee when they see me
**** creep me in they teepee
As I lay down laws like I lay carpet
Stop it if you think they gonna make a profit
Don't see my ones, don't see my guns, get it?
Now tell your friends Poppa hit it, then split it
In two as I flow with the Junior M.A.F.I.A. 
I don't know what the hell's stopping ya
I’m clocking ya, Versace shades watching ya
Once ya grin, I’m in, game begins
First I talk about how I dress in this
Diamond necklaces, stretch Lexuses
The sex is just immaculate from the back, I get
Deeper and deeper, help you reach the
Climax that your man can't make
Call him, tell him you’ll be home real late and sing the break, uh

[Chorus: Faith Evans & The Notorious B.I.G.]
Baby, here I am (I got that good love girl, you didn't know?)
All I need is one more chance (One more chance)
I can help you find yourself (I got that good love girl, you didn't know?)
'Cause you don’t need nobody else (One more chance)

[Verse 2: The Notorious B.I.G.]
She's sick of that song on how it's so long
Thought he worked his until I handled my biz
There I is, major pain like Damon Wayans
Low-down dirty, even, like his brother Keenan
Schemin', don't leave your girl 'round me
True playa for real, ask Puff Daddy
You ringing bells with bags from Chanel
Baby Benz, traded in your Hyundai Excel
Fully equipped, CD changer with the cell
She beeped me, meet me at twelve
Where you at? Flipping jobs, paying car notes?
While I'm swimming in your women like the breast stroke
Right stroke, left stroke was the best stroke
Death stroke, tongue all down her throat
Nothing left to do but send her home to you
I'm through, can you sing the song for me, boo?

[Chorus: Faith Evans & The Notorious B.I.G.]
One more chance (One more chance)
Biggie give me one more chance (I got that good love girl, you didn't know? Give me one more chance)
One more chance
Biggie give me one more chance (I got that good love girl, you didn't know?)
One more chance

[Verse 3: The Notorious B.I.G.]
So what's it gonna be, him or me?
We can cruise the world with pearls, gator boots for girls
The envy of all women, crushed linen
Cartier wristwear with diamonds in 'em
The finest women I love with a passion
Your man's a wimp, I give that **** a good thrashin'
High fashion, flying into all states
Sexing me while your man ****
Isn't this great? Your flight leaves at eight
Her flight lands at nine, my game just rewinds
Lyrically, I'm supposed to represent
I'm not only a client, I'm the player president

[Chorus: Faith Evans & The Notorious B.I.G.]
One more chance
Biggie give me one more chance (I got that good love girl, you didn't know? One more chance)
One more chance (Baby, here I am)
Biggie give me one more chance (I got that good love girl, you didn't know?)
All I need is one more chance
One more chance (Nine-five)
I can help you find yourself (I got that good love girl, you didn't know?)
'Cause you don't need nobody else

[Intro]
(Hoo!)
(Hoo!)
Come on, girls!
Do you believe in love?
'Cause I got something to say about it
And it goes something like this

[Chorus]
Don't go for second best, baby
Put your love to the test
You know, you know, you've got to
Make him express how he feels
And maybe then you'll know your love is real

[Verse 1]
You don't need diamond rings
Or eighteen karat gold
Fancy cars that go very fast
You know they never last, no no
What you need is a big strong hand
To lift you to your higher ground
Make you feel like a queen on a throne
Make him love you 'til you can't come down
(You'll never come down)

[Chorus]
Don't go for second best, baby
Put your love to the test
You know, you know, you've got to
Make him express how he feels
And maybe then you'll know your love is real

[Verse 2]
Long stem roses are the way to your heart
But he needs to start with your head
Satin sheets are very romantic
What happens when you're not in bed?
You deserve the best in life
So if the time isn't right, then move on
Second best is never enough
You'll do much better, baby, on your own
(Baby, on your own)

[Chorus]
Don't go for second best, baby
Put your love to the test
You know, you know, you've got to
Make him express how he feels
And maybe then you'll know your love is real

Express yourself
You've got to make him express himself
Hey, hey, hey, hey
So if you want it right now, make him show you how
Express what he's got, oh baby, ready or not

[Bridge]
And when you're gone he might regret it
Think about the love he once had
Try to carry on, but he just won't get it
He'll be back on his knees
To express himself
You've got to make him express himself
Hey hey

[Verse 3]
What you need is a big strong hand
To lift you to your higher ground
Make you feel like a queen on a throne
Make him love you 'til you can't come down
(You'll never come down)

[Bridge]
And when you're gone he might regret it
Think about the love he once had
Try to carry on, but he just won't get it
He'll be back on his knees, so please

[Chorus]
Don't go for second best, baby
Put your love to the test
You know, you know, you've got to
Make him express how he feels
And maybe then you'll know your love is real
Express yourself
You've got to make him express himself
Hey, hey, hey, hey
So if you want it right now, make him show you how
Express what he's got, oh baby, ready or not

Express yourself
(You've got to make him) Express himself
So if you want it right now, make him show you how

[Intro]
Woo!
Hoo!
B-b-b-b-baby

Put your love to the test
You know, you know, you've got to
Make him express how he feels
And maybe then you'll know your love is real

[Verse 1]
You don't need diamond rings
Or eighteen karat gold
Fancy cars that go very fast
You know they never last, no no
What you need is a big strong hand
To lift you to your higher ground
Make you feel like a queen on a throne
Make him love you ‘til you can't come down

[Chorus]
Don't go for second best, baby
Put your love to the test

Make him express how he feels

Express what he's got, oh baby, ready or not
Express yourself
Respect yourself, hey hey
(So if you want it right now, better make him show you how)
Express what he's got, oh baby, ready or not
Express yourself

[Chorus 2]
Express yourself
Express himself

[Post-Chorus]
Hoo!
Hoo!
Hey, hey, hey, baby
Baby

[Intro]
Come on, girls!
Do you believe in love?
'Cause I got something to say about it
And it goes something like this
You know, you know you've got to
You know, you know you've got to
You know, you know you've got to
Express yourself
So if you want it right now
Baby ready or not
It goes something like this
It goes something like this

[Chorus]
Don't go for second best, baby
Put your love to the test
You know, you know, you've got to
Make him express how he feels
And maybe then you'll know your love is real

[Verse 1]
You don't need diamond rings
Or eighteen karat gold
Fancy cars that go very fast
You know they never last, no no
What you need is a big strong hand
To lift you to your higher ground
Make you feel like a queen on a throne
Make him love you 'til you can't come down
(You'll never come down)

[Chorus]
Don't go for second best, baby
Put your love to the test
You know, you know, you've got to
Make him express how he feels
And maybe then you'll know your love is real

[Verse 2]
Long stem roses are the way to your heart
But he needs to start with your head
Satin sheets are very romantic
What happens when you're not in bed?
You deserve the best in life
So if the time isn't right, then move on
Second best is never enough
You'll do much better, baby, on your own
(Baby, on your own)

[Chorus]
Don't go for second best, baby
Put your love to the test
You know, you know, you've got to
Make him express how he feels
And maybe then you'll know your love is real

Express yourself
You've got to make him express himself
Hey, hey, hey, hey
So if you want it right now, make him show you how
Express what he's got, oh baby, ready or not

[Bridge]
And when you're gone he might regret it
Think about the love he once had
Try to carry on, but he just won't get it
He'll be back on his knees
To express himself
Express himself

[Verse 3]
What you need is a big strong hand
To lift you to your higher ground
Make you feel like a queen on a throne
Make him love you 'til you can't come down
(You'll never come down)

[Bridge]
And when you're gone he might regret it
Think about the love he once had
Try to carry on, but he just won't get it
He'll be back on his knees, so please

[Chorus]
Don't go for second best, baby
Put your love to the test
You know, you know, you've got to
Make him express how he feels
And maybe then you'll know your love is real

Express yourself
You've got to make him express himself
Hey, hey, hey, hey
So if you want it right now, make him show you how
Express what he's got, oh baby, ready or not
Express yourself

[Outro]
Express himself
So if you want it right now
Oh baby, ready or not
Express yourself
You've got to make him
Respect yourself
Hey, hey, hey
So if you want it right now, make him show you how
Express what he's got, oh baby, ready or not
Express yourself

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
Tearing me apart with the words you wouldn't say
And suddenly tomorrow's a moment washed away
'Cause I don't have a reason and you don't have the time
But we both keep on waiting for something we won't find

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
The light on the horizon was brighter yesterday
With shadows floating over, the scars began to fade
We said it was forever, but then it slipped away
Standing at the end of the final masquerade
The final masquerade

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
All I ever wanted, the secrеts that you keep
All you ever wanted, thе truth I couldn't speak
'Cause I can't see forgiveness and you can't see the crime
But we both keep on waiting, for what we left behind

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
The light on the horizon was brighter yesterday
With shadows floating over, the scars began to fade
We said it was forever, but then it slipped away
Standing at the end of the final masquerade
The final masquerade
The final masquerade
Standing at the end of the final masquerade

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
The light on the horizon was brighter yesterday
With shadows floating over, the scars began to fade
We said it was forever, but then it slipped away
Standing at the end of the final masquerade
Standing at the end of the final masquerade
Standing at the end of the final masquerade
The final masquerade

[Verse 1]
You're like a wave that crashes in
And baby, I'm just like the sand
You're here and then you're gone again
Just like the wind, and baby, I'm just like the sand

[Chorus]
What else can I do but wait for you?
To come back through
It's all I do

[Post-Chorus]
You're like a wave that crashes in
And baby, I'm just like a sin

[Verse 2]
You blow through like a desert wind
And baby, I'm just like the sand
Pick me up and throw me down again
Just like the wind, and baby, I'm just like the sand

[Chorus]
What else can I do but wait for you?
To come back through
It's all I do

[Post-Chorus]
You blow through like a desert wind
And baby, I'm just like the sand (Hey)

[Chorus]
What else can I do but wait for you?
To come back through
'Cause it's all I do (All I do)
It's all I do

[Post-Chorus]
One day, you'll show up again
To find I slipped through your hands

[Outro]
'Cause, baby, I'm just like the sand
Just like the sand
Just like the sand
Just like the sand
Lyrics from Snippets

[Verse 1]
...
You know that we shouldn't move this fast, girl I know
You know, this shit prolly gon’ move past
But all I want...
...it's late, I come through, you missed me
Oh, I just want you here with me, but I

[Chorus]
I think that it's clear to see right now
I can’t be what you ask of me
I can't be, I can't be, I won't be
I left you lonely...

[Verse 2]
...
Yeah, only thing that I need to know

[Chorus]
I think that it's clear to me right now
I can't be what you ask of me
I can't be, I can't be, I won’t be
I left you lonely...

[Verse 1: Matt Champion]
Wake up in a car
Take my ass to the border
Sweep then park the motors
Ridin', ridin', ride it, ride it
I cannot control it
Notice how I load it
I can barely note it
Ridin', ridin', ride it, ride it
Wake up in a car
Take my ass to the border
Sweep then park the motors
Ridin', ridin', ride it, ride it
I cannot control it
Notice how I load it
I can barely note it
Ridin', ridin', ride it, ride it

[Pre-Chorus: Matt Champion]

Before you go
I don't belong here
Hey, hey, hey, aye

[Verse 3: Merlyn Wood]
Tuesday, remind me of a Saturday
And I guess you tryna drive me but it's too late
Cause I was tryna cheat on a one way
Get a fun day, I'm alone anyway
Tuesday, remind me of a Saturday
And I guess you tryna drive me but it's too late
Cause I was tryna cheat on a Monday
Get a fun day, I'm on my own anyway
Tuesday, remind me of a Saturday
And I guess you tryna drive me but it's too late
Cause I was tryna cheat on a Monday
Get a fun day, I'm on my own anyway

Cause I was tryna cheat on a Monday
Get a fun day, I'm on my own anyway

[Verse 1]
Blue are the color of the eyes of the man I love
He's hard to take and hot to touch
Green is the color of the sea in the early months
Of mid-July, I love you much

[Pre-Chorus]
You get so mad when I complain
'Bout it's hard to love
But you don't hear them talk about
They're fucking tired of

[Chorus]
These beautiful people with beautiful problems, yeah
Beautiful people, God knows I've got them
She wants to die (Lie-la-lie)
And she should fucking try (Lie-la-lie)

[Verse 2]
Red is the color of your mouth when you drink fruit punch
You like to lie in yellow sun
And red are the color of your eyes when you drink too much
You like to rage, you like to fuss

[Pre-Chorus]
You get so tired, when I complain
They're fucking tired of

[Chorus]
All these beautiful people with beautiful problems, yeah
Beautiful people, God knows I've got them
She wants to die (Lie-la-lie)
And she should fucking try (Lie-la-lie)

[Bridge]
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
You wanna die? (Lie-la-lie)
Then go on and try (Lie-la-lie)
Lie-la-lie

[Chorus]
All these beautiful people with beautiful problems, yeah
Beautiful people with beautiful problems, yeah
Beautiful people with beautiful problems (Try)
Beautiful people with beautiful problem
Listen, Lady
Let me lie low, lie low with you
To be alive

Slowly, we get good and holy
Helping one another
Just a righteous brother

Nighttime, get me back in the night time
I don't want to be angel
Just a little bit evil
I feel a devil in me

Holy Holy
Hold on to anyone
Hold on to anyone
But just let me be

Holy, holy

Heavy traffic in the street, stay on your toes
Anybody that you meet can leave you exposed, yeah exposed
But it's me that you'll see whenever, whenever you arrive, yeah
I'm the one to set you free to keep you alive

You got to push harder to make it through the night
It's just a little farther until we see the light
So hold on tight and push

Secret passage in the dark open for you
You've been waiting to embark time to go through
When you drown in the sound of a heartbeat everywhere, oh everywhere
Better break for higher ground, high as you dare
High as you dare

You got to push harder to make it through the night
It's just a little farther until we see the light
So hold on tight
Push

When you're lost at sea, just remember, remember what I'm saying
You can follow me all the way home
Push it hard
Keep on pushing, yeah
Keep on pushing, baby
Keep on pushing, yeah
Push!

You got to push harder to make it through the night
It's just a little farther until we see the light
So hold on tight

Yeah... right now
Keep on pushing
Pushing harder
Oh, let me help you
Make it through the night
Pushing harder
Pushing harder
Pushing harder
Come on, push me push me baby
Pushing harder...
Let me run this by you
I know that you've been jivin' me
And you're cold as you can be
But I leave room for something real
Is it something that you ever feel?
You don't live up to the expected
And your true feelings you've neglected
Don't worry about it, your love I can do without it
Move over baby 'cause you're really in the way
Something really good's gonna happen today
If you can't dig on me and really bring it home
Try being a man on your very own
If your love is not for me, at least use some integrity
Why don't you use some integrity?
I know that you got your daddy's way
But your daddy's day was yesterday
Time has moved on and things have changed
Ladies' priorities re-arranged
You wanna be appreciated
What you give is so underrated
Well
One would think there was no one but you
And you're the very thing to make you blue
Do I make you feel insecure?
Do you need control?
Would it help you just to know
You've won my heart and you're on a roll
It ain't been told a woman's love as sweet as mine
You're a star and I help you shine
There's a good woman behind every man
Let's go from one and revise the plan
Do the do for me
And it ain't been told a woman's love as sweet as mine
You're a star and I help you shine
There's a good woman behind every man
Let's go from one and revise the plan
And if your love is not for me, at least use some integrity
Come on
Why don't you use some integrity?
Put the word in your vocabulary (integrity)
Look it up in you dictionary (integrity, well)
Don't run your jive on me (integrity)
Well you wanna be trusted
But your show been busted (integrity)
You think ladies are toys
I like the big boys
Yes I do
With, with integrity
Talkin' about non-commital
All that is, my man, is about givin' a lot for a little
Integrity

[Verse 1]
One look was enough, enough for me
The whole room stops
And it's not me to be one, to be one
One of many

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause it's a hundred others speaking
I've been tryna make a step
A hundred others speaking
I can't make you understand
There's only one out here for ya, one out here for ya

[Chorus]
I'll be the first to say, "Baby, what's your name?"
If I want ya, that kind of woman
I don't pretend, and I won't sit still, gonna show ya
That kind of woman (Woman)
(That kind of woman, woman; that kind of woman)
Hard to pretend, now I can't sit still any longer
That kind of woman

[Verse 2]
I'll pick you from the crowd
Don't come to mе
I want you to myself
No, I won't be, won't be onе
Won't be one, one of many

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause it's a hundred others speaking
I've been tryna make a step
A hundred others speaking
I can't make you understand
There's only one out here for ya, one out here for ya

[Chorus]
I'll be the first to say, "Baby, what's your name?"
If I want ya, that kind of woman
I don't pretend, and I won't sit still, gonna show ya
That kind of woman (Woman)
(That kind of woman, woman; that kind of woman)
Hard to pretend, now I can't sit still any longer
That kind of woman

[Bridge]
(And gonna) Keep you close, next to me, I won't let you go
(You're gonna) Reminisce that you once met a girl like this

[Chorus]
I'll be the first to say, "Baby, what's your name?"
If I want ya, that kind of woman
I don't pretend, and I won't sit still, gonna show ya
That kind of woman (Woman)
(That kind of woman, woman; that kind of woman)
Hard to pretend, now I can't sit still any longer
That kind of woman
You said that I don't care, but of course I do
How come when I'm alone, I only think of you
Only been in love, maybe once or twice
But now that I've had just a taste you've got me so enticed

Used to feel those words that you spoke over me, but now I don't
I used to feel those powder blue eyes stare through mine, but now I guess I won't
And now I don't know, if you want me so, I guess I'll go

You floor me with that style, and if I had a choice
I wouldn't slip up everytime that I hear your voice
And though it doesn't work, I try desperately
To become this great ugly root to a perfect tree

I used to feel those words that you spoke over me, but now I don't
I used to feel those powder blue eyes stare through mine, but now I guess I won't
And now I don't know, if you want me so, I guess I'll go
Lyrics from Snippet

Ooh, baby, that voodoo
Make you move you like this
C'mon baby
Woo, ooh, that voodoo
Make you make- Make you movin’ like-
Cold fire
You've got everything but cold fire
You will be my rest and peace child
I moved up to take a place
Near you

So tired
It's the sky that makes you feel tried
It's a trick to make you see wide
It can all but break your heart
In pieces

[Chorus 1]
Staying back in your memory
Are the movies in the dark
How you moved is all it takes
To sing a song of when I loved
The prettiest star

[Guitar solo]

[Chorus 2]
Staying back in your memory
Are the movies in the dark
How you moved is all it takes
To sing a song of whеn I loved
The prettiеst star

[Verse 2]
One day
Though it might as well be someday
You will rise up high and take us all away
All because of what you are
The prettiest star
Solemn faced
The village settles down
Undetected by the stars
And the hangman plays the mandolin
Before he goes to sleep

And the last thing on his mind
Is the wild-eyed boy imprisoned
'Neath the covered wooden shaft

Folds the rope into its bag
Blows his pipe of smolders
Blankets smoke into the room

And the day will end for some
As the night begins for one

Staring through the message in his eyes
Lies a solitary son
From the mountain called Freecloud
Where the eagle dare not fly
And the patience in his sigh
Gives no indication
For the townsmen to reason why

So the village dreadful yawns
Pronouncing gross diversion
As the label for the dog

Oh, "It's the madness in his eyes"
As he breaks the nights to cry:
"It's really me!
Really you and really me!
It's so hard for us to really be ...
Really you and really me
You'll lose me, though I'm always
Really free!"

And the mountain moved its eyes
To the world of realize
Where the snow had saved a place
For the wild eyed boy from Freecloud

And the village dreadful cried
As the rope began to rise
For the smile stayed on the face
Of the wild eyed boy from Freecloud
And the women once proud
Clutched the heart of the crowd
As the boulders smashed down
From the mountain's hand

And the magic in the stare
Of the wild eyed boy said
"Stop, Freecloud;
They won't think to cut me down"
No, no, no

But the cottages fell
Like a playing card hell
And the tears on the face
Of the wise boy
Came tumbling down
To the rumbling ground
And the missionary mystic of peace-love

Stumbled back to cry among the clouds
Kicking back the pebbles
From the Freecloud mountain track
London bye ta-ta
Strange young town
London bye ta-ta
Brought me down

Don't like your new face
That's not nice
Got to go far, far
London bye ta-ta

Gigi, Gigi
Take me away
Gigi, Gigi
Take me today

The boys in the clothes shop
Sold me curry for a pound
His cardboard face is soggy
And he's selling thorny crowns

I loved her
I loved her
I've got to get away
But I loved her
London bye ta-ta
Strange young town
London bye ta-ta
Brought me down

Don't like your new face
That's not nice
Got to go far, far
London bye ta-ta

Red light, green light
Make up your mind
Red light, green light
You're much too unkind

She loves to love all beauty
And she says the norm is funny
But she whimpers in the morning
When she finds she has no money

I loved her
I loved her
I've got to get away now
But I loved her
Ah-oh-ah
Oh, London bye ta-ta
Strange young town
London bye ta-ta
Brought me down

Don't like your new face
That's not nice
Got to go far, far
London bye ta-ta

Oh, London bye ta-ta
Strange young town
London bye ta-ta
Brought me down

Don't like your new face
That's not nice
Got to go far, far
London bye, ta-ta
(London bye, ta-ta)

Oh, London bye, ta-ta
(London bye, ta-ta)
Ooh, London bye, ta-ta
(London bye, ta-ta)
Hey ...
London bye ta-ta
Strange young town
London bye ta-ta
Brought me down

Don't like your new face
That's not nice
Got to go far, far
London bye ta-ta

Gigi, Gigi
Take me away
Gigi, Gigi
Take me today

The boys in the clothes shop
Sold me curry for a pound
His cardboard face is soggy
And he's selling thorny crowns

I loved her
I loved her
I've got to get away
But I loved her
London bye ta-ta
Strange young town
London bye ta-ta
Brought me down

Don't like your new face
That's not nice
Got to go far, far
London bye ta-ta

Red light, green light
Make up your mind
Red light, green light
You're much too unkind

She says to lovе all beauty
And she says the moon is funny
But shе whimpers in the morning
When she says she has no money

I loved her
I loved her
I've got to get away now
But I loved her

London bye ta-ta
Strange young town
London bye ta-ta
Brought me down
Don't like your new face
That's not nice
Got to go far, far
London bye ta-ta

London bye ta-ta
Strange young town
London bye ta-ta
Brought me down

Don't like your new face
That's not nice
Got to go far, far
London bye ta-ta
London bye ta-ta
London bye ta-ta
London bye ta-ta

[Verse 1]
Right now
He's got his hand on her hand
By now
She's started feeling the wine
Right now
He's probably paying the tab
And they're getting in a cab

[Chorus]
I wonder how this would feel
Turns out it ain't no big deal
It's just the end of the world

[Verse 2]
Right now
He don't remember my kiss
Right now
She says she never does this
Right now
She's asking him if he can stay
And I know what he'll say

[Chorus]
I wonder how this would feel
Turns out it ain't no big deal
It's just the end of the
Sun shining down on me
Breath in and out of me
Time will run out before long
He's gone
And it's just the еnd of the world

[Bridge]
So this is how it goes down
No falling sky, no trumpet sound

[Chorus]
I wondеr how this would feel
Turns out it ain't no big deal
It's just the end of the
Sun shining down on me
Breath in and out of me
Time will run out before long
He's gone
And it's just the end of the world

[Outro]
The end of the world
Right now
He's got his hand on her

Gonna break it down for all you girls out there

You got your ass on your shoulders and you wonder why
Nobody ever really wanna get down and hang with you
(Uh, nobody really wants to get with you)
Cause ya only hang around with fake people that barely even
Know you, kiss your ass, and love to agree with you
(Agree with you, it's all in your mind)
You should take a look around when your down by yourself all
Alone and you'll see who's standin' there next to you
(No one but you)
No wonder why you up and change your number every time
You a blind bitch, you're cryin' and nobody gave a damn but you
(Nobody gave a damn but you baby)

You don't even know my name
So who do you think you are
You a wannabe rockstar (oh)

You call every minute of the day, every second of the hour
Cause you're trying to come back but it's way too late
(That's what you said, not me)
How's it feel all alone on your throne and the crowd
Is gone and you're holdin' on
(Why you wanna hold on baby?)
So i saw you at the bar with your head up high but you're
So down low and it's only cause you don't even know
(You don't even know. It's so sad, you know?)
It's sad when people, they can't even recognize, that they don't have a clue
(Don't have a clue)
You a wannabe rockstar
Xo, No love I'm gonna give you (yeah)
Xo, Oh love I never knew you (yeah)

But I'm not thinking 'bout you

Don't know, go ask all your boys then
(That's really sad)
You talk so much, but so what
Please won't you shut yourself up
(Shut the fuck up!)
So all my girls scream and shout

[Intro]
I'm sick of having these kinda conversations
With my close friends
Falling for Britneys who are toxic
Said you wouldn't but
Oops, I did it again
Hearing that same tune from you
Over and over again
Acting like the only option is the one you're gonna regret
C'mon

[Chorus]
Games with you

She's playing games with you
Games with you
She's playing games
Playing games with you
Games with you

[Verse 1]
I can't keep on blaming her
You keep running back knowing her behaviour
That girl is not a stranger to you nor me
We'vе had this conversation (A million times beforе)
I'm heavy running out of patience
You knew she was dangerous
Now we're sat up on the pavement for the billionth time
Trying to force a revelation

[Verse 2]
I'm sick of having these kinda conversations

Trying to force a revelation

[Verse]
If it's love that you want

Do you feel the same?
If it's love that you want

Do you feel the same?

[Intro: Beedie]
You are now about to witness the strength of street knowledge
Yo, ayo, CapCom, whaddup!
The business is crazy (You can feel it)
East End Empire and all that
Just some good ol' city loving, ya know? (Haha)
PGH, ha, Pittsburgh, whaddup!
Let me get at these fools, yo

[Verse 1: Beedie]
So let me in the deuce, they don't know 'bout the damn triple E's gettin' cheese
Like they infested with disease
I'm on point, every song I do
I never slip man, always standin' on my two
Look, I stretch brains like elastic, bro
And suffocate paper with a plastic flow
I heard your girl wanna smash, yeah, that's fo sho'
And he can get licked like a stash o' dough
My cash low like I stay down
The beat bully on the playground
We stayin' in day in, day out
Hopin' I'ma fade-out, but y'all better get used to me
Switch using brain more usefully
Truthfully, we the best in the 'Burgh
We the East End bitch, give a "Yes" if ya heard
Yessir, we lie from the 412
You won't believe what ya boy gon' do
Homie, ya sent me

[Bridge: Beedle]
Ha, you know how we do it in PGH, man
Steel city, real gritty, and all that; ya dig it?
Yo, I'm glad to be back, yo
I do it for my city, I do it for my people's, and I do it for hip-hop
Ayo, Mac

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
The Empire strikes back
Yeah, it's like that
I keep my clothes clean rockin' it with price tags
See a fine dime I'ma pipe that
Take her over to the crib for the night cap
It's the life that I choose for the music
The Class Clown, hip-hop's Three Stooges
Stew with a reuben, gotta keep it movin'
MCs and beats like this food that I'm chewin'
Shorty what ya doin', oh, you see me lookin' at ya?
Wanna tell all of your friends you fucked a rapper
I'm tryin' to tell ya that I'm down for the cause
So let me see that booty give a round of applause
Oh my God, all these fine women
Liquor in my cup and got my mind spinnin'
Plus a swisher, 'bout to put the piff in
That's the life that I'm livin'! (What?)

[Outro:]
Livin' just to love
Livin' just for the city
Livin'-livin'-livin' just to love
Livin'-livin'-livin' just for the city

[Intro]
DJ CapCom, the youngest in charge
Pay attention, you pussies

[Verse 1]
When I was just a little one (Uh-huh), I did sit still once
My cousins used to call me Hit-N-Run
I learned a lot from my homies and a lot from my fam
All my, all my peoples really made me who I am (Yup)
My grandma passed, I was savin' her a dance
I didn't understand why I never got the chance (Why'd you take her?)
But if it's anything she taught me, never give up
My enemies is waitin' for a slip-up
So when I'm down, I get up (Get up), the clock is tickin'
It's either rap shit or a spot in prison (Uh-uh)
I ain't got no, got no time to spare
Seats is fillin' up, better find a chair (Find a chair)
Sugar-sweet rhymes from the finest pears
And a lot comin' for me 'cause the grind is there (Uh-huh)
Well, I just had a little piece of mind to share
Face-up on Times Square, it look fine there (Chyeah)

[Interlude]
And that's the way it go down
Mac Miller, the motherfuckin' Jukebox
Class Clown comin' soon
But I'ma get back up into the second verse for y'all

[Verse 2]
Aight, what?
There's a lot of speculation on my future as it is
Am I for real or just a can on the computer for the kids? (Uh-huh)
Not a damn thing right now is buzzin' in the biz
In Pittsburgh, "Well, he nothin' next to Wiz"
I address the class with class, a class act (Oh)
That's Mac, only 'bout the facts
Rap gettin' littered on, I'm pickin' up the trash
And this track gettin' shitted on, spittin' out the ass
I got cruel intentions (Uh-huh), usin' weapons (Chyeah)
And you a piece of shit I just stepped in (Stepped in)
I still do it for the city, do it for my block
A movie in your mind, I do it for hip-hop (What, what, what, what?)

[Interlude]
I do it for hip-hop
So we gon' take it to the top, to the top, uh
I do it for hip-hop
So we gon' take it to the top
It don't stop, take it to the top
Yeah, I do it for hip-hop

[Verse 3]
One time
The kid Mac, he be spittin' somethin' special
And I'm ready, hear the whistles from the kettle (Yep)
Shootin' missiles out my pencil with my pedal to the metal (Metal)
Startin' every day with a bowl of Fruity Pebbles
Then I'm gone, things are never gon' change (Change)
Words released out this little thing I call my brain (Yep)
And you're all insane thinkin' I'm in class, 'cause I'm hatin' school (Uh-huh)
Breakin' rules, haven't been to school in a day or two
Then name a few, 'cause it's killin' me to study
It really isn't funny, seemin' sillier than putty (Haha)
I'm just chillin', burnin' Dutchies while I'm supposed to be in class (What?)
I pass grass to get a laugh, s'posed to be in math
I'm an abstract, class-act cat with my hat back
Bitches holdin' onto blunts, better pass that
Gettin' high, findin' anything to laugh at (Haha)
'Cause we gon' take it to the top

[Lyrics from Snippet]

[Verse 1]
Vibin', coolin' and making on a Sunday afternoon
It's empty, I got space for you
Is you feenin'? Do, do you need it?
Jeep for the summer, top goes straight down
And the sun won’t come up
'Cause we say so
This would be the perfect time to bring up being more than friends

[Chorus]
Just for the summer, wanna go undercovers with you, baby
It's you, baby
I know you high, but it's prime time
To love me, love me, don't let this thing go
Please don't wait till we're fallin' apart
Call 'fore its back to lonely hearts
(Echoed)

[Chorus]
Everything
In its right place
In its right place- Everything
In its right place
In its right place
In its right place
In its right place

[Verse One]
Yesterday I woke up sucking a lemon
Yesterday I woke up sucking a lemon
Yesterday I woke up sucking a lemon

[Chorus]
Everything
In its right place- Everything
In its right place
In its right place
In its right place
In its right place

[Verse Two]
There are two colours in my head
There are two colours in my head
There are two colours in my head
There arе two colours in my head
There arе two colours in my head
Tried to say, tried to say
Tried to say, tried to say

[Outro]
Lemon
Lemon
Lemon
Lemon

[Verse 1]
Someone's always comin' around here, trailing some new kill
Says, "I've seen your picture on a hundred dollar bill"
And what's a game of chance to you, it is one
Of real skill

[Chorus]
So glad to meet you, Angeles

[Verse 2]
Pickin' up the ticket shows there's money to be made
Go and lose the gamble, that's the history of the trade
If you add up all the cards left to play
To zero

[Chorus]
And sign up for evil, Angeles
Don't start me tryin' now
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh
'Cause I'm all over it, Angeles

[Verse 3]
I can make you satisfied in everything you do
All your secret wishes could right now be coming true
And be forever with my poison arms around you

[Chorus]
No one's gonna fool around with us
No one's gonna fool around with us
So glad to meet you, Angeles

[Chorus: 070 Shake & Ty Dolla $ign]

Make tracks, getting paid for the poems
Big racks, got figures in my bank
Big racks, hit the rim like Shaq
Big Shaq, hit the rim like Shaq, big Shaq

[Verse: Matt Champion]
No chip on my shoulder, hundred leagues under the sea
We live life like cheetah power up like Hummer diesel
Golden chain for niece and nephew
Pessimistic, I do not hang 'round them boys
Metaphysics, need another dimension I enjoy

[?] but my bag Chanel, told you get up out my shell
Make her bag in piecеs so my money buys some 

[?]
Ridin round the hurt and furnacе, heat when you sit your body out like strag
Got my bullshit, got my bag
Backwards, I ain't fallin like a tailspin on that vehicle
Remind me of my childhood, back when my night's good
Hoppin in that 95, burn for me the real set
Find me in the hills,

[Intro]
I fell back, I had a baby, you know
I did the mother thing, I did the wife thing
All that, yeah (All that shit)
But I think it's quite clear now
You's need the bad guy

[Verse]
Ayo, I'm the one who run the city where they armed and vicious
Accusations on them blogs and they all fictitious
I done bent the realest blocks, pushed the hardest sixes
Keep a couple killers that don't care how far them licks is, look
Bitches act like they want action
Heard they want action
Bitch, we ain't duckin' no action
I'm 'bout to give them that traction, send a distraction
Then I'ma line 'еm like fractions
Took a break, I let 'еm live, look at all 'em eatin'
But these bitches gon' be mad once I call this meetin'
'Cause they gotta move around once the queen is queenin'
'Bout to put out all this crack 'cause my fiends is feenin', uh
I put these bitches on game, they should be kissin' my feet
I tried to give 'em some press, they tried to say it was beef
It's Nicki M, such a little gem
Bitches wanna be around me, but I do not fuck with them
All these diamonds on me flooded, I hope nobody gets stuck
If I pull out the Ferrari, then my shooters in the truck
I could still go to my hood, they know my body is good
Two million dollars to party in Saudi Arabian clubs
Poppin' them things to go up and smokin' Los Angeles bud
These bitches bitin' like Joe; shout out to Kamala, though (What up?)
It's them weak bars thinkin' that she dissin' for me
I graded your homework, bitch, it's incomplete
If you was tryna be my son, then mission complete
I'm the final level bitch they on a mission to beat
It's like COVID when the goat is on the track, the whole game stop
But I ain't playin' with these bitches, this ain't GameStop
If Barbie in the buildin', then she with a gangsta
He ain't gon' hesitate if I tell him to shank sumn
Just put a beauty parlor in my guest house
You mean the pink Lamborghini? That's at the next house
Fuck him so good, I got him walkin' with his chest out
I wish these bitches wanted more talent and less clout
I-I fall back, and just give them some space
'Cause when you already won, what the fuck is a race?
Look at them fuckin' for raps, oh, what a disgrace
I put that on A-rod, none of you bitches is safe (Uh)
Make his dick get hard soon as I brush up, but we tryna be subtle
Whole city go up when a bitch touch down like them niggas in a huddle
Sex game still cold, it's on igloo
Head game slicker than little miss Gorilla Glue
He tryna eat it up, I said, "Come and get it, boo"
While I count a mill', jigga what? Jigga who? (What or why?)

[Verse 1]
Red wine and sleeping pills
Help me get back to your arms
Cheap sex and sad films
Help me get where I belong

[Chorus]
I think you're crazy, maybe
I think you're crazy, maybe

[Verse 2]
Stop sending letters
Letters always get burned
It's not like the movies
They fed us on little white lies

[Chorus]
I think you're crazy, maybe
I think you're crazy, maybe

[Bridge]
I will see you in the next life

[Verse 3]
Beautiful angel
Pulled apart at birth
Limitlеss and helpless
I can't evеn recognize you

[Chorus]
I think you're crazy, maybe
I think you're crazy, maybe
I think you're crazy, maybe
I think you're crazy, maybe

[Outro]
I will see you in the next life

[Verse One]
Why must I be the thief?
Why must I be the thief?
Oh Lord please won't you tell me
Why must I be the thief?

[Verse Two]
Why must I be the thief
He said to the hanging man
And how come you're the only one
That's better off, and always stares

[Hook]
Why must I be the thief?
He asked of the hanging man
And how come you're the only one
Who gives me an open hand
Why must I be the thief?
He cursed and then he cried
And the hanging man held out his hand
And looked beyond the sky

[Verse Three]
The thief that climbed the cross
"We should have shared that other's fate."
But the Jesus man said "Not now"
"My brother, not now, it's far too late!"
(far too late) (7x)

[Outro]
Do what you must
Take what you can
Steal the pride from every heart
Every angered man (3x)
I am the thief!
I am the thief!
And you will run
Yes and you will hide
But I'll get you then
Yes I will
Because of you, because it's justified
I will get you yet
Cause it's justified
I will get you yet
It's justified
I will get you yet
It's justified

[Verse 1]
This is the place
Sit down, you’re safe now
You’ve been stuck in a lift
We’ve been trying to reach you, Thom
This is the place
It won’t hurt ever again

[Chorus]
The smell of air conditioning
The fish are belly up
Empty all your pockets
Because it’s time to come home

[Verse 2]
This is the place
Remember me? I’m the face you always see
You’ve been stuck in a lift
In the belly of a whale at the bottom of the ocean

[Chorus]
The smell of air conditioning
The fish are bеlly up
Empty all your pockets
Because it’s timе to come home
The smell of air conditioning
The fish are belly up
Ah, let it go

[Outro]
Today is the first day
Of the rest of your days
So lighten up, squirt

[Verse 1]
Drift all you like from ocean to ocean
Search the whole world
But drunken confessions and hijacked affairs
Will just make you more alone

[Verse 2]
If you come home I'll bake you a cake
Made of all their eyes
I wish you could see me dressed for the kill

[Chorus]
You’re my man of war
You're my man of war
Yeah, the worms will come for you, big boots
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 3]
So unplug the phones, stop all the taps
It all comes flooding back
To poison clouds and poisoned dwarves

[Chorus]
You're my man of war
You’re my man of war
Yeah, the worms will come for you, big boots
Yeah, the worms will come for you, big boots
For you, big boots

[Verse (???): Kevin Abstract]

[Verse 1: Childish Gambino]
I was making Japanese and she's watching DVDs
In Oakland, in Oakland
Now I'm driving up the 5 and she waits til' I arrive
In Oakland, in Oakland
Everything that I wanted
Only gotta drive for the moment
If you tell me "turn around," then I'm on it
For the moment, but you know me
You know how I get when I'm lonely
And I think about you and the moments
But everything you do is so Oakland, so Oakland

[Chorus: Childish Gambino]
Foot on the gas
I'm just trying to pass
All the red lights
And the stop signs
I'm ready to go
Before I get to The Bay
Babe, that's a problem
Because I'm way too scared to call
And you might get me to stay, and oh

[Post-Chorus: Childish Gambino]
I don't really mind the drive
But I think I'd rather die
In Oakland, in Oakland
With my hands on two and ten
So I guess it all depends
On Oakland, on Oakland
And I'm nervous, truth be told
I never saw me growing old
In Oakland, in Oakland
And if I married you tonight
It would probably start a riot
In Oakland, in Oakland

[Verse 2: Childish Gambino]
Everything, that I needed
Now that I got you in your feelings
Everything you won't say, you tweet it
And a nigga don’t like that shit at all
So treated
Can we just roll with the feeling?
Can we just roll for a minute?
Wait a minute

[Chorus: Childish Gambino]
Foot on the gas
I'm just tryna pass
All the red lights
And the stop signs
I'm ready to go
But I'm really not ready, girl
That's a problem
'Cause I'm way too scared to fall
And I know you choose to stay, and oh oh

[Verse 3: Childish Gambino]
All the girlfriends saying, "Here we go again" (Go again)
Rich kid but he act like a gentleman (Gentlemen)
Last one didn't end like it should've been (Shoulda been)
Two dates and he still wanna get it in
And they're sayin' it's because of the Internet
Try her once and it's on to the next chick
X-O the O face on your exes, right?
And we can do the same thing if you wanna have at it
When your thoughts can't breathe and you thinking asthmatic
And you wanna be a mom and I wasn't mad at it
I was thinking 'bout me, I'd be really bad at it
'Cause I'm thinking 'bout me, (Oh) weeks in Dubai
Fourth of July, house in Kauai, yeah we can try
So let's try

[Outro: Childish Gambino]
(Say some things)
Whoa
Whoa
I took off my nine to five
But you still don't have the time to kiss me, just hit me
And if I left you all alone, would you still pick up the phone?
It's iffy, you miss me
I got furniture to move
And we'll both be thirty soon
In Oakland, in Oakland
The only one I know is you, so the fuck I'm supposed to do?
In Oakland, in Oakland
In Oakland, in Oakland
In Oakland, in Oakland
In Oakland, in Oakland
In Oakland, in Oakland
In Oakland, in Oakland

Algorhythm

[Verse 1]
Supercomputer status, walkin' along streets
Everyone is an addict, stumbling concrete
What was the motivation? Constant communication
Everybody wanna get chose like Moses
Came out Mother Earth smelling like roses
Summon the new edition, made it way too efficient
Made us the guinea pig and did it with no permission
Told it to call a friend, didn't tell it to listen
So very scary, so binary, zero or one
Like or dislike, coal mine canary
I dream in color, not black and white
You sell your daughter on that data stream
Dopamine makе it hit now
Humans don't understand, humans gon' sell a lie
Humans gotta survivе, we know we gon' die
Nothing can live forever, you know we gon' try
Life, is it really worth it? The algorhythm is perfect, uh

[Chorus]
Everybody (Everybody), move your body, now do it (Now do it)
Here is something (Ooh), that's gonna make you move and groove
(Please don't lose that tempo)
Algorhythm
(Moving how they say so)
Algorhythm

[Interlude]
We done sold everything
Y'all might as well put your hands together
You might as well lift them too

[Verse 2]
Step, step, slide, slide
Move your body from side to side
Clap your hands, don't spite the vibe
Keep on moving, you might survive
Pressure is to evolve, take a bite of the apple
We crush it into the sauce, how do we know the cost?
How do we know the truth without feeling what could be false?
Freedom of being wrong, freedom of being lost
Wait a minute, wait a minute (Wait a minute, wait a minute)
Feelin' like the devil did it (Devil did it, ooh)
Lord willing, I'ma step to it (Step to it)
You gon' fall behind if you can't do it (Ooh, yeah)
Ooh, we eating good over here now (Yeah)
Is you eating good over there now? (No)
Human ain't the move, do I care now? (No)
Looking for something worth it, the algorhythm is perfect, mmh

[Chorus]
Everybody (Everybody), move your body, now do it (Now do it)
Here is something (Ooh), that's gonna make you move and groove
(Please don't lose that tempo)
Algorhythm
(Moving how they say so)
Algorhythm (Woo)
Everybody (Everybody), move your body, now do it (Now do it)
Here is something (Ooh), that's gonna make you move and groove
Algorhythm (Woo)

Brothers and sisters
We are gathered here today, brothers and sisters

[Intro]
Michael Phelps, this for you, baby!

[Verse 1]
I'm goin' for the gold, my heart is in control
My mind is on succeed and I am in the lead
Don't buy into the schemes, the science or strategy
Just giant N-U-Ts brings triumph and belief
I'm a lion or a dean, inspired by the green
Never tired or fatigued, never defiant to my team
Never lying on the thing until I'm lying on the thing
Hooked to wires and things; I'ma die as a king
If I don't do it now, I'ma try it again
And when I do accomplish it, I'ma try it again
I'm a riot, insane; I'm a lion, my mane
Hangs down to my strings and they're tied to the game
I stay dry when it rain, I'm tired of the fame
Got everything to gain and I'm proud of the pain
The pride and the plain, the wise and the strange
Denied by the sane; besides, we're the same
Who's guiding the train? Who's flyin' the plane?
Who's driving the lane? Who dies when it bang?
Who fires when it bang? Who lies in the aim?
Two lives in the drain; who cries when they sang?
You hide but you can't; you high but you ain't
I advise you to think; you'll find what you can't
Revive what you taint, survive what you paint
Super-size what you shrank: the fries and the drank
Admired as a saint, defined by my rank
Combined with my strength, my time and my length
I'ma iron out the kinks; yes, I'm on the brink
And in the eye of my wink, I'ma retire in the bank

[Chorus]
Yeah, and I'm no quitter
'Cause I'm a go, I'm a go, I'm a go getta
And I'm no quitter
'Cause I'm a go, I'm a go, I'm a go getta
Yeah, I'm gon' get it, I'm gon get it
Yeah, I'm gon' get it, yeah
'Cause I'm a go, I'm a go, I'm a go getta

[Verse 2]
Victory consistantly
Train all year to be the enemy's misery
No stress visibly, neither does it enter me
I think positively; you can't harm me mentally
Not physically, not spiritually; you'll never get rid of me
I am the epitome of "this is what you did to me"
Nothin's what you did for me, nothin's what you give to me
I take whatever I'm visualizing, now break all of the limiting
Now shake all of the gimicking, the fakery, the trickery
"Nurse, how sick is he?" "Worse, I am sickening!"
I'll be at the finish line first, "how quick is he?"
I'ma make sure they mention me for the next century
I ain't with the bickering, I am full of dignity
I am full of energy, pull out the inner me
Or bull after dinner meat, I stood in the winter heat
It could be the end of me, but good be defending me

[Chorus]
Yeah, and I'm no quitter
'Cause I'm a go, I'm a go, I'm a go getta
And I'm no quitter
'Cause I'm a go, I'm a go, I'm a go getta
Yeah, I'm gon' get it, I'm gon get it
Yeah, I'm gon' get it, yeah
'Cause I'm a go, I'm a go, I'm a go getta

[Verse 3]
I'm allergic to cheatin'
I hate failure and I'm in love with achievement
Above and beneath it, a hug when I greet it
My eyes on the prize and I love when I seek it
Done with the speakin', begun with the preachin'
Now pray, until I am one with the deacon
Now play, until I have won whatever we win
I play, until I have won, and then I re-win

[Chorus]
Yeah, and I'm no quitter
'Cause I'm a go, I'm a go, I'm a go getta
And I'm no quitter
'Cause I'm a go, I'm a go, I'm a go getta
Yeah, I'm gon' get it, I'm gon get it
Yeah, I'm gon' get it, yeah
'Cause I'm a go, I'm a go, I'm a go getta

[Verse 1]
All my life, I've seen myself through your eyes
Wonderin' if I am good enough for your time
You love me but for all the wrong reasons
Am I somethin' to you and not someone?
'Cause I feel trapped on this pedestal you put me on
You tell me that I'm beautiful but I think that's an understatement

[Chorus]
'Cause I am more than what I am to you
You say I'm perfect but I've got thorns with my petals, too
And I won't be confined to your point of view
I'm breakin' through the glass you put me in
'Cause my beauty's from within

[Bridge]
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
My beauty's from within
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

[Verse 2]
So, I am done livin' my lifе just for you
You watched me wither and now you'll watch mе bloom
You're hidin' in the dark but I'm reachin' for the sun, woo-ooh

[Chorus]
'Cause I am more than what I am to you
You say I'm pretty but I've got magic that you never knew
And I won't be confined to your point of view
I'm breakin' through the glass you put me in
'Cause I am more than what I am to you
You say I'm perfect but I've got thorns with my petals, too
And I won't be confined to your point of view
I'm breakin' through the glass you put me in
'Cause my beauty's from within

[Intro]
You want me, I want you baby
My sugarboo, I'm levitating

[Verse: Love Again]
I never thought that I would find a way out
I never thought I'd hear my heart beat so loud
I can't believe there's something left in my chest anymore
But goddamn, you got me in love again

[Verse: Physical]
Common love isn't for us
We created something phenomenal
Don't you agree?
Don't you agree?
You got me feeling diamond rich
Nothing on this planet compares to it
Don't you agree?
Don't you agree?

Who needs to go to sleep when I got you next to me?

[Chorus]
All night, I'll riot with you
I know you got my back and you know I got you
So come on (Come on), come on (Come on), come on (Come on)
Let's get physical
Lights out, follow the noise
Baby, keep on dancing like you ain't got a choice
So come on (Come on), come on (Come on), come on
Let's get physical

(Physical, physical)

All night, I'll riot with you
I know you got my back and you know I got you
So come on (Come on), come on (Come on), come on (Come on)
Let's get physical
Lights out, follow the noise
Baby, keep on dancing like you ain't got a choice
So come on (Come on), come on (Come on), come on
Ph-ph-ph-physical

[Verse: Pretty Please]
Somewhere in the middle, I
Think I lied a little, I
I said if we took it there, I wasn't gonna change
But that went out the window, yeah (Gonna break, gonna break)

[Pre-Chorus]
I know that I seem a little stressed out
But you're here now, and you're turning me on
I wanna feel a different kinda tension
Yeah, you guessed it, the kind that's fun
Hate it when you leave me unattended
'Cause I miss ya, and I need your love
When my mind is runnin' wild
Could you help me slow it down?

[Chorus]
Put my mind at ease (hey!)
Pretty please
I need your hands on me
Sweet relief
Pretty please
(Trickle down my spine)

[Verse: Hallucinate]
Pocketful of honey and I'm ready to go
No, I ain't got no money, but I'm letting you know
That I'ma love you like a fool
Breathe you in till I hallucinate (Mmm)

[Chorus]
I hallucinate when you call my name
Got stars in my eyes
And they don't fade when you come my way
I'm losing my mi-mi-mi-mind, mi-mi-mi-mind
Mi-mi-mi-mind, mi-mi-mi-mind
I hallucinate when you call my name
Got stars in my
(Girls will be women)

[Dance Break]

[Verse: Don't Start Now]
If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me
(BRITs let's go!)

[Chorus]
Don't show up
(Don't show up)
Don't come out
(Don't come out)
Don't start caring about me now (-bout me now)
Walk away
(Walk away)
You know how
(You know how)
Don't start caring about me now

[Outro]
(No matter what you do, I'm gonna get it without ya
(I know you ain't used to a female alpha)
(No matter what you do, I'm gonna get it without ya

Walk away, walk away
Walk away, walk away
Future nostalgia
Part I: "'93 'Til Infinity" by Souls of Mischief

[Verse]
Yeah, rest assured
The best is here in the flesh, and that's for sure
The rest should wear 'em a vest, I'm set for war, nigga, press record
I send niggas to address the Lord
Same flow that put your neck to sword
The same flow that just undressed your whore
Takeover, nigga, check the score
This is chess, better check your board
Who gave the world more fire but got less reward?
No stress, my only guess is that less is more, more or less
Hundred G's in my dresser drawer, I'm blessed
Hope IRS don't arrest me for it, I'm new to it
My new crib got the Times Square view to it
While two bitches lay in my bed, I'm used to it
That's your best friend givin' me head, now you do it
See, mami? It's not so weird
After I hit, I cut you off like Picasso ear
Van Gogh or whoever, Goddamn, Cole, you're too clever
Like a fucking James Brown sample, you're two-ever
Times two, that's forever, more treble
Meanin' more high-end shit on your level
Put the fear of God in niggas, I'm pure Devil
Walkin' contradiction, my description
Off the top, magician, compositions nonfiction
Shitted in the competition's
Pot to piss in, gone, uh, so long, uh
Saturdays, a nigga used to mow lawns, uh
Nowadays a nigga be eatin' prawns
Fuck my bitch by the window, wave to the peeping Toms, ugh
Yes, I'm Carolina's finest
Southern nigga with New York stamps, honest
Out in Queens with the fiends, I'm your highness
Cole World, don't mistake it for a sinus—
Infection, at this point, I'm just flexin'
Bas is next in line, and the test is time
Play the game right, nigga, he gon' rest his mom
In the sands of Sudan where she rest her mind
And find peace, 'cause her son'll be fine
He got the city on his back, and I got him on mine
You think I'm lyin'? Shit, step one: got the 'Ville on map
Shit I predicted in my raps, I done did all that
Next, please, eat rappers, mm, check please
Here's a tip while niggas grip my testes
You wan' shoot? Then shoot, don't play with me
Hardest shit out the South since slavery, nigga
Hardest shit out the South since slavery, nigga
Part II: "Still Tippin'" by Mike Jones

[Verse]
Ugh, woke up this morning and wondered
"Hey, should I get fresh or should I keep it humble?"
My closet like Dover Street, used to be bummin'
Some days, I'm still bummin', the difference is now, it's by choice
Got dressed and peeped out the window, these lil' niggas different
They don't play Nintendo, they play with extendos
I hope you can limbo
That chopper gon' spin you around like a judge on The Voice
I'm from a city where most niggas never get lucky enough
To see somethin' outside county limits
I ran up the digits, I don't have no muh'fuckin' business
Complainin' about nothin'
Ain't got no time or no patience for lists they be makin'
Or who they debatin' is better
Let's face it, he one of the greatest
No Bill Cosby shit, but if niggas is sleepin', then fuck 'em
Most niggas don't understand me
I don't do the GRAMMYs, I be in my jammies on sofa
Most niggas don't understand me
Ferrari or Camry, I bet I look good in 'em both
Most niggas don't even get this
Cole, How you on top but you don't got no bitches? I know
Most niggas don't even get this
If given the chance, they trade family for riches, I know
Look at my ceilin', it's endless
I'm sick and these bitch niggas feelin' the symptoms
It ain't enough vitamin C in they system to get rid of me
I'ma kill 'em relentless
On top, but I sound like I'm still in the trenches
I come from the 'Ville, I turn villains to victims
Reach and see "R.I.P." fill up your mentions
A message for niggas that's feelin' ambitious
How come a nigga still ain't hit his prime?
Ahh, you bitch, Off-Season comin' May 14th
Fuck all y'all niggas, it's over for you
I swear to God

[Chorus]
Don't get any big ideas
They're not gonna happen

[Verse 1]
You paint your eyes white
And fill up with noise
But there'll be something missing

[Verse 2]
Now that you've found it, it's gone
Now that you feel it, you don't
You've gone off the rails

[Bridge]
She stands up naked and she beckons you to bed
Don't go you know rain pours so come back again

[Refrain]
Ooooh, ooooh, oooooh
Ooooh, ooooh, oooooh
Ooooh, aaaaah, aaaaah

[Chorus]
So don't get any big ideas
They're not gonna happen

[Bridge]
You'll go to hell for what you're dirty mind is thinking

[Outro]
Now that you've found it, it's gone
Now that you feel it, you don't
You've gone off the rails

[Verse 1]
Calling myself a car
Stumbling from the bar
I think of you in the dark
And I'm falling apart
Rolling the windows down
My head's spinning all around
The rain makes soft sound
And it's breaking my heart
'Cause honey it's hard

[Chorus]
Please don't let me go
I'll be in control
I'll be like everybody else is
I can play it safe
Save the kissing in the rain
If it means I'm all you ever wanted to find

[Verse 2]
This feeling won't ever end
I'm texting your phone again
I miss you, I love you, send
Oh, I'm falling apart
Remember the way it felt
Bеfore you could make me mеlt
Before you knew all too well
How I'm falling apart
'Cause honey it's hard

[Chorus]
Please don't let me go
I'll be in control
I'll be like everybody else is
I can play it safe
Save the kissing in the rain
If it means I'm all you ever wanted to find
Baby, it's all right
You can leave me for the night
Oh, I know I'm more than you had bargained for
Give it to me straight
Are you going to make me break?
Do you think I'm all you ever wanted to find?

[Verse 1]
We took it all apart, but I'm wishing I'd stayed
In the back room, something I heard you say
We didn't want to call it too early
Now it seems a world away, but I miss that day
Are we ever gonna feel the same?

[Chorus]
Standing in the light 'til it's over, out of our minds
Someone had to draw a line
We'll be coming back for you one day
We'll be coming back for you one day
I don't even care if I know ya, out of our minds
Sad to leave it all behind
We'll be coming back
We'll be coming back for you one day

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
You could see it from afar, we were riding that wave
Blinded by the lights, and it's something I cravе
We didn't want to call it too early
Now it seems a world away, but I miss that day
Are wе ever gonna feel the same?

[Chorus]
Standing in the light 'til it's over, out of our minds
Someone had to draw a line
We'll be coming back for you one day
We'll be coming back for you one day
I don't even care if I know ya, out of our minds
Sad to leave it all behind
We'll be coming back for you one day
We'll be coming back for you one day

[Bridge]
Gonna rise, gonna fall, getting pulled apart
And we all do it all 'cause it stole our hearts
Gonna light up the skies, so ignore the stars
And we all do it all 'cause it stole our hearts

[Chorus]
Standing in the light 'til it's over, out of our minds
Someone had to draw a line
We'll be coming back for you one day
We'll be coming back for you one day
I don't even care if I know ya, out of our minds
Sad to leave it all behind
We'll be coming back for you one day
We'll be coming back for you one day
I’d love to tell you how i’ve been getting on
But i don't think that you would recognise me
And i’d love to hear ‘bout how you’ve been getting on
But i don't think that you’re the same as you used to be

I can feel a new beginning dawning
Just like when the sun rises up in the morning
Waking up to you felt flawless

I can feel a new beginning dawning
Just like when the sun rises up in the morning
Waking up to you felt flawless

I’d love to tell you how i’ve been getting on
But i don't think that you would recognise me
And i'd love to hear bout how you’ve been getting on
But i don't think that you’re the same as you used to be

Please don't hit me with the guilt trip
That game we loved to play to find out
Our internal emotions
I think that we should leave this
Don’t feel like what we’ve done in the past
Deserves any more attention

[Intro: Swizz Beatz & DMX]

As long as I'm in His graces, it's gon' get ugly (Hey)
But, only He can judge mе so

Ain't nan' nigga badder with the mic than the dog (Uh)
From the right to the wrong (Uh)
Still bite and go hard (Yeah) spaz to the left (Yeah)
And with the last of my breath (Yeah)
I'll beat that ass to death (C'mon!)

[Chorus: Alicia Keys & DMX]
Hold me down (Uh, uh, uh, yo)
Hold me down
Even when the rain falls (Hey, hey, yeah)
Hold me down (Down), oh (Nigga don't need much)
Hold me down
I'm just so thankful (C'mon, get it)

[Verse 2: DMX & Alicia Keys]
I pulled in opposite directions, my life's in conflict (Uh huh)
That's why I spit words that depict the convict (Okay, ooh)
Man, if you not able to see
What I'm saying to you, then you not able to be (C'mon, ooh, yeah)
Just like reading the Bible to a baby (Uh-uh)
Some of y'all will get it (Uh)
But most of y'all gon' think I'm crazy (Oh no, no, no)
I ain't never gave a fuck about what you think (Okay)
What you think don't matter if you think yo' shit don't stink (Baby)
Man, it hurts when people that I love don't want me (Oh)
Want it all from me, then think they can judge me (Yeah)
Treat me like I'm ugly
I done did some dumb shit but I never been a dummy
'Cause I know God love me

[Chorus: Alicia Keys & DMX]
Hold me down (Even when the rain falls)
Hold me down (Hey)
Hold me down (I'm just so grateful)
Hold me down (Hey, hey)
Hold me down (A nigga don't need much)
Hold me down (I'm just so thankful)
Hold me down (Even when the rain falls)
Hold me down (I'm just so grateful)

[Outro: Alicia Keys]
Nobody, nobody gonna take me down (Hold me down)
'Cause I been through it all (Hold me down)
Woah (Hold me down, hold me down)
Nobody, nobody gonna take me down (Hold me down)
Oh Lord, you wanna know how I survive
And it's all because of you, yeah
And I'm just so grateful

[Verse 1]
When you love a sinner
You hate the sin
You hate the temptress in the bottle
For choosin' him again
And you blame the cold
For the winter
When you love a sinner

[Chorus]
I tell myself that everything's okay
I paint a pretty smile on my face
Your lovin' says, "he'll change"
But on his breath and in his veins
The truth stil remains

[Verse 2]
Deep down, you know
That it's a crime
You know you didn't pull the trigger
But you're the one who does the time
And you pay the debt
You'rе the lender
Whеn you love a sinner

[Chorus]
I tell myself that everything's okay
I paint a pretty smile on my face
But I'm slowly lettin' go
Cause in my heart I know
That I can't make him better
Ooh

[Bridge]
And I've been goin' under
And now I understand
That you can't tread water
With a drownin' man

[Outro]
I love a sinner
I justify it how I can
So, it's the sin
I'm leavin, not the man

[Intro]
Yeah (Yeah)
Yeah, nigga (One two, one two, one)
The Off-Season (One two, one two, one two, one)
The Off-Season, nigga
We offing niggas (Ayy, that's right)
Fuck you talkin’ 'bout? (That's right, ayy)
Offing niggas (Yeah, hey, yeah)
(Vocal up a little more, hey)

[Verse]
Uh, applying pressure
Started my grind where crime festers
And nines showing like they in they second trimesters (Pregnant)
That’s why when niggas throw a shot or two online, I pay no mind to their benign gesturеs (Mm)
Nigga, please, I got my mind on much bigger things, to say thе least
My latest speeches sound like they was released by David East (What up, East?)
Verses hit hard, never pitched hard or played the streets
These niggas' whips hard, behind closed doors, can't pay the lease (Uh)
Ain't nothin' wrong with livin' check to check 'cause most have to (I understand that)
Instead of cappin', why don’t you talk about being a broke rapper? (I don’t understand that)
That's a perspective I respect because it’s real
What it's like to be nice as fuck but got to stress to pay the bills
That was me in '08, seein' no cake
Not even on dates I celebrated my birth
Just did the mental math and calculated my worth
Shit crazy, didn’t know I got more M's than a real Slim Shady video (I'm the real Shady)
Big Boss, less Rick Ross, more like a wavy Hideo
Kojima, they tote steamers around the way we tippy-toe
'Round crack vials and cold-blooded killers, no reptiles
Just projectiles from niggas salty, you rockin' the fresher textiles
I seen best pals grow up and switch (I hate to see it)
Sometimes over a couple dollars, more often over a bitch (Ah, I hate to see it)
I can cap and say that I never scratched my jealousy's itch
But thank God I conquered that 'cause if not I'd never be rich
Envy keep your pockets empty, so just focus on you
If you broke and clownin' a millionaire, the joke is on you
Money ain't everything, I never say that (Never)
But niggas throw stones knowin' they sell they soul to get wherever they at (Come on, man)
Just know these verses is some shit they gon' forever playback, nigga (Come on, nigga)

[Outro]
Hell yeah (Ooh)
Fuck, you know what it is, nigga
Don't even dare
Niggas try to act like they don't—, bitch
That's why I gotta flex sometimes
'Cause niggas just try to act like you just not that motherfuckin' nigga, like
Like you just really don't do it how you do it
Like niggas will really try to act like you don't do what you do
Nigga look you dead in your face
And really act like you don't do it to the level that you do it
That's why sometimes you gotta come through and just do it at the level that you do it in front of every nigga face
So they know the difference between you, the real niggas, and the mothafuckin' fraudulent niggas, man
Don't never get it fucked up
If a nigga can't do it like you do it sometimes you gotta do it in front of his fuckin' face so he'll know forever
"Damn, that nigga did it how I always wanted to do it and I'll never be able to do it like that"
Bitch, it's a difference (Ah)
(These are the same ones telling our people what we are and we aren't because we're just not working hard enough
And that mentality is what we're up against today
But this is good to know because this time, when we march on the Capitol
You can go ahead and let 'em know long before we get there, we're coming to get that check)

[Intro: Cam'ron & J. Cole]
Killa, it's The Off-Season
Let's keep it tall, y'all ain't fuckin' with my man
And don't check your watch, you know the time
Cole World, Killa Cam', niggas is fuckin' finished (Yeah)

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
This shit too easy for me now
Nigga, Cole been goin' plat' since back when CDs was around
What you sold, I tripled that, I can't believe these fuckin' clowns
Look how everybody clappin' when your thirty-song album do a measly hundred thou'
If I'm bettin' on myself, then I completely double down
If you hated on a nigga, please don't greet me with a pound
I be stayin' out the way, but if the beef do come around
Could put a M right on your head, you Luigi brother now
Trace my steps all in this game, you could see we cover ground
Back and forth from NC to New York when Jeezy had the crown
Vivid memories, niggas start to squeeze, we duckin' down
So many shells left on the ground, it make the Easter Bunny proud
I get up, dust my clothes off, sleep is the cousin of death
No plans to doze off, the streets, it don't come with a ref'
I never sold soft, just creeped where the hustlers crept
And got they O's off, you reach, niggas uppin' like Steph
To blow your nose off, gesundheit, and then resume flight
As if it never happened, shit we witnessed full of so much sickness
Angels sheddin' tears in Heaven, word to Eric Clapton
Off this clever rappin', bitch, my pockets gon' forever fatten

[Interlude: J. Cole & Cam'ron]
They gon' forever fatten
See, we tried to tell niggas
They act like they don't even fuckin' speak English

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Bitch, my pen to the paper's lethal
I'm sendin' 'em straight to meet the
The nigga that made them, peep the reaper
Creepin' on ya, the scent of failure reekin' on ya
Check your genitalia, pussy-niggas bleedin' on yourself
Fuckin' with Cole is bold, but it's impedin' on your health
All yo' niggas eatin' off your wealth
All my niggas feedin' all they selves, and it feels swell
Krispy Kreme dreams, sometime my dawgs wanna kill 12 (Uh)
'Cause they steady harassin'
We seen dilemmas like Nelly and Kelly that end in the deadliest fashion
My young niggas nutty, they blastin'
Bullets be hummin' like Cudi but one of yo' hoodies Spaghetti-O splashin'
All over the driveway, y'all talkin' all sideways
Shots poppin' off, y'all laid down
Cops chalkin' off y'all legs now
(Shit) God watchin', "Hey, Yahweh"
My niggas looked up to the sky like we sendin' 'em y'all way (Y'all way)
We sendin' 'em y'all way (Y'all way)

[Outro: Cam'ron & Lil Jon]
That's what the fuck I'm talkin' 'bout
Y'all see what the fuck goin' on out here (Killa, Harlem)
I-95 shit, Carolina, 2-6, stand up, nigga
Put your hood up
Put your hood up
Put your hood up
Put your hood up
Put your clique up
Put your clique up
Put your clique up
Put your clique up
Represent your shit, motherfucker
Represent your shit, motherfucker
Represent your clique, motherfucker
Represent your clique, motherfucker
If you scared to throw it up, get the fuck out the club
If you scared to throw it up, get the fuck out the club

[Intro: J. Cole & Damian Lillard]
It ain't nothing I want more
Ain't nothing I want more
I ain't c–
I told you, when I first came here, I said, "I ain't come here to waste my time"
I came here
They gave us a chance to get in, like we asked for
And that's, that's what we here to do
Yeah, nigga, 26
The job still ain't done
Straight up
But I, I said, "You, you know what I'm here for"

[Verse: J. Cole]
Back on top, punchin' the clock, clutchin' sanity
I got more cribs than Habitat for Humanity
Shit profound, we propagating more profanity
Paid off collections from recollections of calamity (Oh shit, look, that nigga gonna shoot)
The shit pop off, I learned to duck under the canopy (Oh shit, run, nigga, run)
'Til it cool off, they murked a nigga right in front of me
Told him to come off his chain for tryna floss
Died over a cross just like the start of Christianity
When I was a boy, the teacher often reprimanded me (Jermaine)
Thought it was toys, it was a Glock this nigga handed me
I busted the trees, was barely strong enough to squeeze
Bullets traveled through leaves, it probably killed somebody randomly
Ran in the crib and played it off amongst the family
Nightmare scenes, the police finally apprehended me
Woke up screamin', seen a demon had his hand on me
Still sport the scar on my arm from where he branded me
Like a Que Dog, my niggas burnin' with the mute off
Loud pack smoke through the cracks, I catch a contact
Triggerin' a paranoid mindset, now I'm back
Teeterin' between enlightened and insanity
Now that I'm rich, I feel nobody understandin' me
All I can do is cut the mic on, holler at you
Can't let the fame scare me off from speaking candidly
All them niggas is so Kane, they started singin' like Danity
Now I'm left here, paid like I planned to be, damn

[Outro: Damian Lillard]
A lot of times, those situations are, um, are handled way before the time comes
In the summer, I think when you truly prepare yourself, and
With training and conditioning, and things like that
When you cheat yourself, you fail in those moments
You know, you crash, and when you really put the time in and
Whether people see it, or whether people know it or not
You know, it always come to light

[Intro]
Yeah
Close
Ville-matic, one, one
One, one, one-two, one
One-two, one, one-two, one
One-two, one, one, listen

[Verse]
Close, I stare at my dreams as they approach
Gotta be patient and trust in God, He the coach
Temptations are taking a shortcut, but I don't
'Cause I ain't tryna be a almost, when I get it, I'ma float
Gone are the days we was close
Now when I see you, I look at you just like a ghost
A shell of your former self, so caught up with that dope
Two niggas singin' two diffеrent notes and you know I gotta coast
Nothin' but a dollar and some hopе
Up in NY, but damn, what hurts me the most
You was a good nigga, we knew each other's folks
Now you gotta ride around with the toast and you keep that shit close
'Cause niggas plottin' on you since you chose
To roll around with the candy paint on spokes
You know 'Ville niggas don't like it when you boast
You know twelve be takin' notes and they watchin' you close
But maybe you don't see 'em 'cause the smoke
Cloudin' your vision from every cigar that you toke
Plus the lean you sippin' which started as a joke
Got you now fiendin' for your next dose, meanwhile I'm so close
Don't even give a fuck that I'm broke
'Cause in my mind I'm rich with shit I done wrote
Therefore I'm convinced that this is supposed to happen
And in time I'ma blow, they gon' label me the GOAT
How long has it been since we spoke?
Last night I jumped up from my sleep, I was soaked
Call it a nightmare, the scene that awoke me
Involved you and niggas I ain't know, they was creepin' up close
I saw the heat tucked in they coats
You didn't notice 'cause you was busy countin' dough
I tried to yell, but nothin' came out of my throat
Niggas cocked back the hammers and you froze, in your eyes I saw hope
Hope of a better way to cope with the pain
And the scars, than the lean and the coke
And I swear in that moment I wish we were still close
Maybe I could've saved you, but no, trigger squeeze, gun smoke
I opened up my eyes with a jolt
Heart pumpin' like Usain Bolt
Reached for my phone, missed calls and a text message note
From my mama sayin' you just got smoked, damn, this life is no joke

[Outro]
Close
Fuck

[Intro]
Better check your resources
Yeah, yeah

[Verse]
Bitches see me in the club like it's all you
Call her friend, tell her bop through
Me and my niggas, yeah, we gon' bop too
Turnt up, hit the mall too
They see my new chain like, "What the fuck?"
Type of shit, but we ain't heard of you ducks
Starvin', my niggas ain't even ate
I wake up in the mornin' gettin' crazy cake
Flexin', we ain't even hit the gym yet
Nigga ain't even seen a M yet
Yеah, just a couple niggas from the alley
Down South, gold grill, fuckin' off of Cali
Got too many bad bitchеs, I ain't keep a tally
Yo' bitch couple million, crib in the valley
In the club throwin' money like I'm 'posed to do
You can't see it, SOD, nigga, over you
Yeah, I hit the hood, turn my block up
Disrespect Car Crib Club, get shot up
All eyes on me since my knot up
Niggas workin' in the street wit' the product
And e'rybody know a nigga live a crazy life
Real shit, get it to you for a crazy price
Pulled up to the club, the Mercedes white
Somebody bitch gettin' slayed tonight
All cameras on me when I'm walkin' in
Gucci on my belt buckle in my cardigan
Yeah, I'm the man in my town
Welcome to my city, we smoke purp by the pound

[Chorus]
Throwin' money
Yeah, bitch, I'm throwin' money, yeah, bitch, I'm throwin' money
We throwin' money
Yeah, bitch, we throwin' money, yeah, bitch, we throwin' money
Bitch, I'm throwin' money
Yeah, bitch, I'm throwin' money, yeah, bitch, I'm throwin' money
Bitch, I'm throwin' money
Yeah, bitch, I'm throwin' money, yeah, bitch, I'm throwin' money

[Intro]
Bada-ba, bada-ba
Bada-ba, da-da
Off-Season
Let's work, hey

[Chorus]
Plottin' my escape, this game rot a nigga's faith
Got a couple M's hidin' in the safe
Imagination turned a Honda into Wraith
I was doin' eighty on the interstate
Tryna make it back before my class started
Country nigga never seen a passport
'Til I popped off and got a bag for it
Now I'm at the Garden sittin' half court
Watchin' Jr. catch it off the backboard
'Ville nigga never seen nothing
'Cept a fucking triple beam jumping
Good dope leave a fiend krumping
Made it out, it gotta mean something

[Verse]
Either you gon' hustle or that nigga Uncle Sam got yo' ass re-enlisting
2-6, murder scene pumping
Better leave it tucked if you ain't dumping
Pow, pow, nigga, he slumping
Twelve comin', we ain't seen nothing
Time change, niggas ain't rumbling no more
Nah, what for? Hungry for more
If you solo these vocals, listen close and you can hear grumbling
Multi' and I'm still munching
Big bag, never fear fumbling
Want smoke? Nigga don't choke
I'm a whole fuckin' nicotine company
Dreamville the Army, not a Navy
How could you ever try to play me?
Kill 'em on a song, walk up out the booth, do the Westbrook rock-a-baby
I never fall out with the bro
Hate when your family turn into foe
We had a penthouse on the road
Interior decorated with the hoes
Just like a multiple-choice getting chose
My niggas like "Eenie, meenie, miney, moe"
Scoop up a dime-piece like we homeless
Then we gon' send 'em back pigeon-toed
Out of the concrete was a rose and winters was cold
Had to go over and stand by the stove
We from the Southeast, niggas know
This where the opps creep real slow
Won't vote but they mob deep with the poles
I punch the time sheet, not no more
And now my assigned seat is the throne

[Chorus]
Plottin' my escape, this game rot a nigga's faith
Got a couple M's hidin' in the safe
Imagination turned a Honda into Wraith
I was doin' eighty on the interstate
Tryna make it back before my class started
Country nigga never seen a passport
'Til I popped off and got a bag for it
Now I'm at the Garden sittin' half court
Watchin' Jr. catch it off the backboard
'Ville nigga never seen nothing
'Cept a fucking triple beam jumping
Good dope leave a fiend krumping
Made it out, it gotta mean something
Made it out, it gotta mean something
Made it out, it gotta mean something

Your boyfriend broke
I spent $10,000 on a Louis V coat
Wore that bitch right out the store
Let that boy talk then my shooter come right out the scope
I get to walkin' my bitch get to throwing them flowers
Them hoes land right at my toes
I get to walkin' inside of the party
My chain, it shine like the light on the phone
None of my hoes gon' bop
I'ma take 60 and the bitch take 40 off top
Drops with the scammers if a nigga try to zone me I'm taking out the 40 and I'm blowing your block
Keep this one thing clear:
When I walk through, bitches love my hair
How I sold rock, my monеy is 

[?]

Ayy, goin' out to Starlets

[Verse One]
Traveling the streets of Rome,
weary feet, morning glow...
In this city painters young and old
have stories to be told.

[Verse Two]
Brushes scattered on the floor,
a heart's still longing for...
Standing silently before those shores.
Your endless dreams will soar...

[Bridge]
You just need...

[Chorus]
..to open your eyes, see the sunrise
on a canvas paint the colours of your life!

[Verse Three]
All of winter's cold and blue,
you've swept away with summer hues...
And a picture long ago we drew,
will beam under a new moon...

[Bridge]
If you believe...

[Chorus]
..and open your eyes, see the sunrise,
behold the skies far and wide...
Then you will find a vision in the light,
on a canvas paint the colours of your life...

[Outro]
Open your eyes, see the sunrise.
Behold the skies far and wide...
Then you will find a vision in the light,
on a canvas paint the colours of your life!

[Verse 1: Jadakiss]
This is dog for life, somethin' you don't know about
No pot to piss in, no window to throw it out
You know what we do to bitch-ass niggas, we ho 'em out
You ain't gotta worry 'bout the score, we gon' blow 'em out
Earl, David, Jason, gotta be Sean
Gots to keep on keepin' up, I gotta get on
In the hood right now when the economy strong
These my niggas that I'm talkin' 'bout, follow the song (Listen)
Yeah, everybody wanna be down, they playin' spades
To me, all y'all niggas is clowns playin' charades (Clowns)
You hit a couple chicks in the town, playin' with AIDS
It's hot over there, my nigga, play in the shade
You see, we playin' with bullets, y'all playin' with blades
No handguns, we all playin' with Ks (Brrt)
For one of these niggas, I'll come with fuckin' grenades (Boom)
Exactly how many times do I have to say

[Chorus: Swizz Beatz & Sheek Louch]
That's my dog, yeah, yeah (Oh), that's my dog, yeah, yeah (Oh)
That's my dog, yeah, yeah (Oh), that's my dog, yeah (Dog)
That's my dog, yeah, yeah (Oh), that's my dog, yeah (Yeah)
That's my dog, yeah, yeah, that's my dog, yeah (Here we go), ayo

[Verse 2: Sheek Louch]
We ain't cool like that, homie, we barely even talk (Facts)
Every rapper ain't close 'cause they comin' out New York
I ain't get a call from you when my mom was in the morgue
Or a nigga needed money, so how the fuck is you my dog?
Got a little older, seen shit for what it was
Yeah, I known you longer, but I like him for what he does
No talk, .38 revolver just because
Straight liquor, that cranberry fuckin' up my buzz
That's my dog, yeah, we done got it off the ground
Turned it to Ruff Ryders, gave niggas a new sound
You heard I was from Yonkers like it was a new town
I'm lookin' at these labels, like, "Who the fuck is these new clowns?"
Silverback, nigga, can't wait for me to fall
Same time, their bitches can't wait for me to call
These hatin' motherfuckers I be tryin' to avoid
Let's do it for Breonna, let's do this shit for Floyd

[Chorus: Swizz Beatz]
That's my dog, yeah, yeah (Oh), that's my dog, yeah, yeah (Oh)
That's my dog, yeah, yeah (Oh), that's my dog, yeah (Dog)
That's my dog, yeah, yeah (Oh), that's my dog, yeah (Yeah)
That's my dog, yeah, yeah, that's my dog, yeah (Here we go)

[Verse 3: Styles P]
You can feel the love or all the evil that men do
Either playin' God or a dog that needs a menu
I was born a wolf, my nigga, let me continue
Come from a town where niggas fly out the window
Either they got thrown or the dust did it
Nah, the knife didn't kill him, but the rust did it
Lookin' at the new McLaren, need a clutch in it
That gun probably got a homi', but I fucks with it (I fucks with it)
All these niggas been my dogs since the lowlife days (My dogs)
Got a .45, shit'll probably blow like haze
You don't want a homi', you should let me go my way
I'm like Doughboy, you gon' wanna roll like Tre (Yeah)
All my niggas know the ticket on the heroin price
Every bar that I say is sort of like Klondike (Hah)
Yeah, that's cold motherfucker, get a hold motherfucker (Get a hold)
That's my dog, if he asked, I'll take your soul motherfucker

[Chorus: Swizz Beatz]
That's my dog, yeah, yeah (Oh), that's my dog, yeah, yeah (Oh)
That's my dog, yeah, yeah (Oh), that's my dog, yeah (Dog)
That's my dog, yeah, yeah (Oh), that's my dog, yeah (Yeah)
That's my dog, yeah, yeah, that's my dog, yeah (Here we go)

[Verse 4: DMX]
It just takes one shot from one gun by one dude
A reason to get it, what's up? Then fuck you
You know how a nigga move, it's how a nigga move
Fuckin' snake, you should have ate when your plate had food
I'ma say what the fuck I want, let it do what it do
And wherever the fuck you at, nigga, we comin' through
I ain't playin' with you niggas, I got kids your age
I ain't your father that shoulda stayed, too late, you shoulda prayed
You ain't know, motherfucker? I'm from the home of the brave
Where we played in the mountains 'cause we lived in a cave
When I came into the game, I crashed through the wave
I'm the best, somethin' that I'm takin' to the grave
Motherfuckers' jeans is too tight to be fuckin' with dog
So stop fuckin' with me, 'cause I ain't fuckin' with y'all
I might have dropped the ball, but I got it right back
My man dove for the out of bounds save and shot it right back

[Chorus: Swizz Beatz]
That's my dog, yeah, yeah (Oh), that's my dog, yeah, yeah (Oh)
That's my dog, yeah, yeah (Oh), that's my dog, yeah (Dog)
That's my dog, yeah, yeah (Oh), that's my dog, yeah (Yeah)
That's my dog, yeah, yeah, that's my dog, yeah (Here we go)

[Post-Chorus: Swizz Beatz]
Do it for the have-nots, do it for the lowlifes
Do it for the have-nots, do it for the lowlifes
Do it for the have-nots, do it for the lowlifes
Do it for the have-nots, do it for the lowlifes (Yeah)

[Chorus: Swizz Beatz]
That's my dog, yeah, yeah (Bounce), that's my dog, yeah (Bounce)
That's my dog, yeah (Bounce), that's my dog, yeah (Dance)
That's my dog, yeah (Yeah), that's my dog, yeah (Woah)
That's my dog, yeah (Woo), that's my dog, yeah (Woo woo)

[Verse 1: JAY-Z & Swizz Beatz]
Haute is the livin', Coca-Cola's the sponsor (Woo)
I run up with your boo, uh, Hov is a monster (Oh)
Yeah, uh, they like me like that
Every girl I see wanna be wifey like that
I'm the King of Zamunda, uh, King of the Summer (Woo)
Come be my Kardashian, queen of the come up
Uh, to be loved, Shakespearean
Experience to be us
Jumpin' off boats, hoppin' off another cliff (Woo)
Every six months, I think I need a new bucket list (Oh)
Yeah, I think I might need a harem (Say, say)
I'm way too much, y'all should share 'em (Hands in the air)
I'm feeling like a baron, all I need is a castle
Be my Halle Berry, all you need is a catsuit
All I need is Heaven, I don't want the hassle
God bless the child that can hold his own, achoo (Queens, stand up)

[Verse 2: Nas & Swizz Beatz]
My instincts guide me through this Kurtis Blow culture (Woo)
Good angel, bad angel sittin' on both shoulders (Uh)
One be trying to gas me, manipulate me, tempt me (Ow)
Make me have no soul, so I like to take a tally
All the favor of the days when the paper wasn't major
But love was abundant
Before the God got the "God's Son" upon the stomach
Let these niggas know it was a feeling I would get
From music that they would come with (Talk to 'em, Nas)
Hate start with H 'cause the H come after a G (Right)
They won't say it face to face, they say it after I leave
After the first night at my place, she asked for the keys
It's my season, Garden of Eden, we Adam and Eve
Now we're naked in savage hedonism from a lack of belief
I ain't a pastor, pass the Lafite
We ain't in no relationship, but do relationship things
No ring, but she slide through when I ring (Hands in the air)
Ha, let's put success to the side
I'd still be this fly if I worked at Popeyes
That's a whole lotta spinach, whole game full of gimmicks
Make a fool out of yourself for a post on Akademiks
We are not the same, I am a alien
Hovering over your city, shutting down all the stadiums
Wiping out everything in my radius
Don't play with us, y'all ain't made enough

[Verse 3: DMX]
Shit pop off, we don't blow it up 'til we blow it up
Cats better slow it up, y'all niggas know what's up
My niggas throw it up, we all know that
Got niggas missing in action, where are they at?
See you niggas never really been duffed out
But you've got enough mouth to get snuffed out
Duke, the rough route
We don't play around here, nigga, we grown
Start applying the pressure, give a dog a bone
I'm taking half, it's just that simple
Or I can start poppin' niggas like pimples
I'ma let you call it, you ballin'
'Til you get hit with them hot things, now you staggerin' and fallin'
Holding up the wall, you got more than enough holes in you to fall
You're just wasting a nigga time, come on, man
I got shit to do like hit your crew
Might hit your crib, what that bitch gon' do?
Not a damn thing, but go with the program
Beast on that bitch like Conan—bo-nan
I'ma go where no man has ever gone, nigga
When it's on, it's on, I'll let you know in a fuckin' song
I got nothing to hide, but you got a reason to run
Come through like (*gunshots*) 'til the squeezin' is done
And that's just squeezing one, imagine if we all let go
And turn your whole block into death row (Woo)

[Intro: Marvin Gaye & DMX]
Wake up, wake up (Get up)
Get up, get up (I got something for you baby, rrr)
Wake up, wake up (Rrrr)
Oh baby, now, let's get down tonight
Ooh, ooh, uh

[Chorus: Marvin Gaye & DMX]
'Cause when I get that feeling, ooh

I need some loving (Get up, get up, ay)
I need some loving (Wake up, wake up, rrr, ay, uh)

[Verse 1: DMX]
Look here, bitches come and bitches go (Uh-huh)
Got 'еm flying in from L.A. to Y-O (Yeah)
Kinda surprised when you was knocking at thе door
'Cause I ain't even know you was gone
I'm like, "Where the fuck'd you go?"
What was that? Do I miss you? Do you want me to?
I'ma say yes, it must be what you want me to do
With them bullshit questions, ignorant suggestions
You don't give a nigga the impression that you wanna see me stressin'
You about to learn a lesson, get on some new shit like
One more fuckin' headache, I'ma get me a new bitch who care
Relax, boo-boo, keep shit moving (Shh)
'Cause what you see in the mirror is what I don't mind losing (Okay)

[Chorus: Marvin Gaye]
'Cause when I get that feeling, ooh
I can tell you, darling, come take control
Of my body and mind, just grab a hold
I need some loving (Get up, get up)
I need some loving (Wake up, wake up)
I need some loving (Get up, get up)
I need some loving (Wake up, wake up)

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
Lovey-dovey, you love me, love me, you're thinking of me
I put my dick on your back, see, ain't no sleeping on me
Block-block, knock-knock, it don't stop
I lift your shirt up, skirt up and make your ass drop
On all fours, red wine with a blue rose
Shit cool, a Pitbull with a red nose
Man, it's so hectic
I slip out and slip back in to redirect it, connect it
From the hip to the dip
She say she wanna fuck with a Crip like Nip so I dip
Yeah, I bark and I bail
And get back into the ocean like a shark or a whale, don't tell (Shh)

[Chorus: Marvin Gaye & DMX]
'Cause when I get that feeling, ooh
I can tell you, darling, come take control
Of my body and mind, just grab a hold
I need some loving (Get up, get up, ay, okay)
I need some loving (Wake up, wake up, ay)
I need some loving (Get up, get up, ay)
I need some loving (Wake up, wake up, okay)

[Verse 3: DMX]
What you hate about me is what you love about me
Worship the ground I walk on, don't give a fuck about me
Playing with my heart, man, that's a dangerous game (For real)
Put this dick up in your stomach, have you saying my name
Have you like (Ayy, papi) nothing gon' stop me
I'll gorilla-fuck that ass, leave the pussy sloppy
Sucker for love, not me, I ain't that nigga
Send you back to your baby father, hatin' that nigga
He like, "Why you always mad?" You know why
Because he’s not me, you know I
Would never be that nigga that's home watching the kids
While my wife was in the street sucking another nigga dick, damn

[Chorus: Marvin Gaye]
'Cause when I get that feeling, ooh
I can tell you, darling, come take control
Of my body and mind, just grab a hold
I need some loving (Get up, get up)
I need some loving (Wake up, wake up)
I need some loving (Get up, get up)
I need some loving (Wake up, wake up)

[Outro: DMX]
Man, that's when you come in and
Wake her up with the dick, hahaha
You don't say a motherfuckin' word
Just slide in the bed and wake her up with the dick
Get up, boo-boo (Rrr)
Get up, boo-boo (Rrr) haha
Get up! X, baby!
You know what it is

[Intro: DMX & Moneybagg Yo]
Grr
C'mon (Go)

[Verse 1: Moneybagg Yo & DMX]
Ain't no such thing as enough money, I want it all
A nigga showin' me how to go get it, that's somethin' I can't recall (What?)
How you never did nothing for me but tell me one for all?
"How the fuck you run up all them Ms without a Adderall?" (Uh)
That's what they ask me, came up from nothin' now I'm established (Made)
Reach for these karats and get your ears stretched, silly rabbit (Played)
I'm a dog, all bite, no bark (Grr), no fear in my heart
Lambo truck with the stars, I paid two hundred some' large
Money, bitches and chains (Ice), niggas jackin' the slang
Rose gold Rollie the only thing 'bout me plain (Pipin')
Rolls-Royce Cullinan today 'cause it might rain (C'mon)
That shit came with an umbrella, trap jumpin' like Coachella (Woo)
I'm sippin' on some clean, half my money still dirty (Woah)
They know I got a bitch, but these hoes still flirtin' (So?)
I'm in the field pissed, feel like Mike Vick, I'm quarter backin'
We be talkin' slick so charges don't stick, never lackin' (C'mon)

[Chorus: DMX]
Money, money, money (Uh), bitches, bitches, bitches (What?)
All these fucking killers, but the jail's full of snitches (Snitches)
A dollar ain't got a fucking thing to do with riches
Say cheese, now I got pictures of what a bitch is (Woo, c'mon)
Money, money, money (Money), bitches, bitches, bitches (Bitches)
All these fucking killers, but the jail's full of snitches (Raow)
A dollar ain't got a fucking thing to do with riches
Say cheese, now I got pictures of what a bitch is (Woo)

[Verse 2: DMX]
When the dog get hungry, the dog gon' eat
That's when I slide my plate right under a nigga feet
Like the lines in the road, I get down in the street
Come through like "brrap," put them cats to sleep
Stay with the heat, cook niggas (Uh), shook niggas (Uh)
Me and mine come through, we nothing but crook niggas (Uh, uh)
We off the hook, nigga (What up?), everybody strip (Yeah)
Everybody get down 'cause my niggas flip (Raow)
On Jake niggas, fake niggas, snake niggas (Uh)
Make niggas rape niggas, I hate niggas (Uh)
Talking that riff-raff, get back (What?)
They call me "Extortion", nigga, I get half (Woo)

[Chorus: DMX]
Money, money, money (Money), bitches, bitches, bitches (Bitches)
All these fucking killers, but the jail's full of snitches (Snitches)
A dollar ain't got a fucking thing to do with riches
Say cheese, now I got pictures of what a bitch is (C'mon)
Money, money, money (Money), bitches, bitches, bitches (Bitches)
All these fucking killers (C'mon), but the jail's full of snitches (What?)
A dollar ain't got a fucking thing to do with riches
Say cheese, now I got pictures of what a bitch is (Woo)

[Intro: DMX, Lil Wayne & Swizz Beatz]
Yo Swizz, this what we doing?

Go extra hard out, y'all ask your dog 'bout me (Woo)
Lil Tunechi baddest dog up in the dog house (Uh)
Keep a bad bitch walk around with my bone out (Uh)
She swallow puppies, you know we got PETA on the phone now (Okay)
I make her pussy rain cats and dogs, ooh, it's pourin' down (Damn)
Gave my dog a pound 'causе he hit me with a couple pounds (Rrr)
Tеll your big dog I'll break him down to puppy chow (Oh!)
Bow, I left your skull out
I DM'd DMX and said they never X'd the dog out

[Chorus: Swizz Beatz]
(Here we go, woof) Let the dogs out

(Goddamn, woof, let it go) Let the dogs out

[Verse 2: DMX]
Who let the dog out? They let the dog out (Uh)
Straight out the dog house, now get the fuck out!
What y'all niggas know about making a movie? Show 'em out
Careful, what you're saying will get you punched in your mouth (C'mon)
When it's time to roll out, my niggas is goin' out (Uh, uh)
Coming with that hardware that y'all niggas don't know about
Let off and blow 'em out, that's how we show 'em out (Uh, uh)
Put a couple of bodies on them things then we throw 'em out (What?)
Serious niggas spittin' serious shit (Uh)
When I hear y'all niggas spit, all I hear is a bitch
When it's time to get active (Uh), my niggas get into it
I ain't saying you a sucker, I'm just sayin' don't do it (Please!)

[Chorus: Swizz Beatz]

Yo, yo nigga, you wanna see somethin'? (Up in here, up in here)
See what?
You see my two niggas right there on the wall?
(Y'all gon' make me go all out)
Yeah
Watch this, nigga (Up in here)
This is a motherfucking stick-up, niggas
Lay yo' ass on the motherfuckin' floor
All the bitches get on the left
All the niggas, on the motherfuckin' right
And the handicapped, get your ass in the motherfuckin' middle
And if you move I'll pump one in your motherfuckin' ass
And if your ass got heart trouble, lean your motherfuckin' ass up against the motherfuckin' wall

[Intro: Swizz Beatz & DMX]
Ah (Right), ah
It's time for us to reach for the stars (Grr)
Talk to 'em

[Chorus: Bono]
I've seen coal turn to diamonds
And blind man's visions become skyscrapers
What began as a seed is no longer a dream
Let's become skyscrapers, skyscrapers

[Verse 1: DMX]
Whenever I went through something, it brought me closer to God (Come on)
And I stayed in somethin', so now I'm closer to God (Come on), but
Close to his heart 'til the attacks get stronger (Uh-huh)
Become much harder to fight and they last longer (Yeah)
That's what it's always been, joy with the pain (Ooh)
Dark with the light (Ooh), sun with the rain (What?), but
With the right perspective there's somethin' to gain
Look for the good in the bad, like the sun when it rains

[Chorus: Bono]
I've seen coal turn to diamonds
And blind man's visions become skyscrapers
What began as a seed is no longer a dream
Let's become skyscrapers, skyscrapers

[Verse 2: DMX]
I don't like better, better get you comfortable (Uh-huh)
Comfort puts you to sleep, need to know what's up with you (What?)
Hate and love relationship, but what I love (Yeah)
Hate it because it kills me, love it for what it does (Why?)
Every day I live (Ugh), every day I die (Ugh)
Don't always laugh (Ugh), but every day I cry (What?)
Used to wonder why, now I enjoy the rain (Ahh)
Get stronger with the struggle, can't live without the pain (What?)
I just wanna be heard, fuck the fame (Yeah)
My words will live forever (Come on), fuck my name
Father God, please give me the strength I need
I was born in the dirt, so it's like you planted the seed, let me grow

[Chorus: Bono]
I've seen coal turn to diamonds
And blind man's visions become skyscrapers
What began as a seed is no longer a dream
Let's become skyscrapers

[Bridge: Bono & DMX]
Put your hands high and touch the sky (Huh, huh, huh)
Put your hands high and touch the skyscrapers
Put your hands high and touch the sky (Huh, huh, huh)
Put your hands high and touch the skyscrapers (Rrr)
Breezes in the summer comet sky
And jungle city lights go flashing by
Feel full of—
Feel full, full

[Outro: DMX]
Reach for the sky (Ooh, yeah)
Reach for the sky
Reach for the sky (Ooh, yeah)
Reach for the sky
Reach for the sky
The sky ain't gon' hold you
The sky is not gon' hold you

[Intro: Exodus Simmons]
Dear God, watch over me
Watch over mommy, watch over daddy
Watch over all God's children, amen

[Chorus: DMX]
Huh, walkin' in the rain
Huh, walkin' in the rain
Huh, walkin' in the, rrr

[Verse 1: DMX]
Look here, I grew up with the thing, hard living (Uh-huh)
Found out the source of the pain God givin' (Ooh)
He left me with no shelter in the rain
But I learned to stay dry, so it wasn't in vain
Every time you go through somethin', there's somethin' to gain
And you only truly suffer if you remain the same (Come on)
Let the dirt you go through change you (What?)
Don't forget, evеn Satan was an angel
You can't go through life walkin' blind
Gotta not only speak your hеart but talk your mind (Uh)
One thing lead to another (Yeah)
How I get down is I will bleed for my brother (What?)
Man, I'm a different nigga (Man)
I'ma say it once (Please stop) all that riffin', nigga (Woo)
For the sake of all the people that love you, I'm a goon (Man)
Leave your family in the park lettin' go of balloons
We miss you

[Bridge: dEnAun]
I don't always get my share of roses
For me, sunny days are always comin', goin'
I know we all got our share of trials and tribulations, yeah
But I done rode for some of y'all
When you ain't even have a ride yourself
So tell me why I'm walkin', walkin', walkin'?

[Chorus: DMX & dEnAun]
Huh, walkin' in the rain
Walkin', walkin', walkin'
Huh, walkin' in the rain
Walkin', walkin', walkin'
Huh, walkin' in the rain
Walkin', walkin', walkin'
Huh, walkin' in the, rrr (Walkin')

[Verse 2: Nas]
We in the new dark ages
We reject who we really are, adaptation
Accept no cheap imitations
I am the streets meet civilization, police precinct 114 chased him
Who should be held accountable
For the hell I encountered just explorin' the town I knew?
You pray a predator choose, I fared better than many
Y'all fear some career gun-slangin' youngsters
Coulda went to war, probably wouldn't have overcome it
I coulda been still bitter now, 'cause there's no middle ground
Locked up juveniles make grown men doubt
Made me wanna get myself knocked in jail just to get you inside
Can't even wait 'til you get out to air you out
As a teen, it's just a few things I cared about
Facts, I made it, impact behavior like the eternal flame
In Martin Luther's grave, yeah, gotta keep burnin', unabated
Turn a man to a millionaire
Just to tell you how good that my day went
My life should be an Ava DuVernay flick
Denzel plays a younger Nas with some CGI
If you rock with your day ones, bless
If you do not, don't let it stress
There's friends I only see once a year
Nothing changed, love is there
Some brothers you outgrow, you leave 'em there, yeah

[Chorus: DMX & dEnAun]
Huh, walkin' in the rain
Walkin', walkin', walkin'
Huh, walkin' in the rain
Walkin', walkin', walkin'
Huh, walkin' in the, rrr
Walkin', walkin', walkin'

[Outro: DMX & Exodus Simmons]
Walkin' in the rain
Walkin' in the rain
Walkin' in the rain
Walkin' in the rain

[Intro: DMX]
Huh, rrr (Woo)
Ooh, rrr
This is one of those
You already know what it is
Rrr

[Verse: DMX]
Dear son, I look in your eyes, I see my own
You look in my eyes, you see my throne
As many times I tried to talk to you, explain to you
See it didn't mean a thing to you
Love you, but right now I wanna bite you
I wanna give you a hug, but I might bite you
Be a man about it, we can admit when we're wrong
Come on, get off that kid shit you on
If you'd have paid attention, you'd have saw it coming
But you a man lookin' through the eyes of a woman
Always gon' love your mama (Always), we just drifted apart
And my kids, y'all my heart
And you got more brothers and sisters
Because I got more kids, and hey, it's just what it is
You the oldеst, I known you longer, but I don't love them lеss
Had to get that off my chest
And I don't know what you thought about my use of drugs
But it taught you enough to not use them drugs
When you were a kid, you play with toys, okay
But you a man, put them toys away
What I'm saying is stop thinkin' like a child
'Cause what if it's when I'm gone (Damn)
That you gotta realize you're wrong? (Damn)
And we could've been best of friends all along
But it would kinda defeat the purpose of the song
917-915-4804
Give me a call, I love you boy (That's the truth, call me)

[Chorus: Usher]
Yeah, ay, I let you down
Should've been there but I let you down
Not too late, not too late
I can't give you yesterday
But I can learn from my mistakes
Not too late, it ain't too late
Call your father
Call your father

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge: Brian King Joseph]
Dear father, should've been there when I needed you
Should've been there when the devil had a hold of your soul
(Hold of your soul, hey, hey)

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus: Usher]
Ayy, I let you down
Should've been there but I let you down
Not too late, not too late (Not too late)
I can't give you yesterday
But I can learn from my mistakes
Not too late, it ain't too late
Call your father
Call your father
It's a God-awful small affair
To the girl with the mousy hair
But her mummy is yelling, "No"
And her father has told her to go

But her friend is nowhere to be seen
Now she walks through her sunken dream
To the seat with the clearest view
And she's hooked to the silver screen

But the film is a saddening bore
'Cause she's lived it ten times or more
It's about to be lived again
As they ask her to focus on

Sailors fighting in the dance hall
Oh man, look at those cavemen go
It's the freakiest show
Take a look at the lawman
Beating up the wrong guy
Oh man, wonder if he'll ever know
He's in the best selling show
Is there life on Mars?

It's on America's tortured brow
Mickey Mouse has grown up a cow
And the workers have struck for fame
'Cause Lennon's on sale again

See the mice in their million hoards
From Ibiza to the Norfolk Broads
Rule Britannia is out of bounds
To my mother, my dog, and clowns

But the film is a saddening bore
'Cause I wrote it ten times or more
It's about to be writ again
As they ask me to focus on

Sailors fighting in the dance hall
Oh man, look at those cavemen go
It's the freakiest show
Take a look at the lawman
Beating up the wrong guy
Oh man, wonder if he'll ever know
He's in this best selling show

Is there life on Mars?
All of my life I've tried so hard
Doing my best with what I had
Nothing much happened all the same

Something about me stood apart
A whisper of hope that seemed to fail
Maybe I'm born right out of my time
And it's breaking my life in two, yeah

Throw me tomorrow, oh-oh
Now that I've really got a chance
Throw me tomorrow, oh-oh
Everything's falling into place
Throw me tomorrow, oh-oh
Seeing my past to let it go
Throw me tomorrow, ooh, oh-oh
Only for you, I don't regret
That I was Thursday's child
(uh, oh, oh; uh, oh, oh)
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, born I was
(uh ooh ooh oh)
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, born I was
Sometimes I cry my heart to sleep
Shuffling days and lonesome nights
Sometimеs my courage fell to my feet

Lucky old Sun is in my sky
Nothing preparеd me for your smile
Lighting the darkness of my soul
I'm innocense in your arms, yeah
(love me, why me, why -yeah, yeah)

Throw me tomorrow, ah yeah
Throw me tomorrow, oh, oh
Now that I really got a chance
Throw me tomorrow, oh, oh
Everything's falling into place
Throw me tomorrow, oh, oh
Seeing my past to let it go
Throw me tomorrow, ooh, ooh
Only for you, I don't regret (ooh)
That I was Thursday's child
Oh, no, no, no yeah

Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, born I was
Thursday's child (ooh ooh)

Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, born I was
Thursday's child (ah, ah, ah)
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, born I was
Thursday's child (uh ah ah)

Ooh-oh, ah-ah-ah, Ooh-oh-ah-ah
(applause)
Thank you very much ...
Your coat and hat are gone
I really can't look at your little empty shelf
A ragged teddy bear
It feels like we never had a chance
Don’t look me in the eye

We lay in each other's arms
The room is just an empty space, oh
I guess we've lived it out
There’s something in the air
We smiled too fast then can't think of a thing to say

We've lived with the best times
Though left with thе worst
I've danced with you too long
And therе's nothing left to save

Let's take what we can, I know
You'll hold your head up high
We've raced for the last time
It’s a place of no return
And there’s something in the air
Something in my eye
I've danced with you too long, yeah
Something in the air
There’s something in my eye

Abra-ca-doo; I lose you
We can't avoid the clash
The big mistake
Now we're gonna pay and pay
The sentence of our lives
I can't believe I’m asking you to go

We used what we could
To get the things we want, oh!
But we lost each other on the way
I guess you know I
I've never wanted anyone else but you

We've lived with the best times
Now we're left with the worst
I've danced with you too long
You can say what you will

We've raced for the last time
But I know you'll hold your head up high
But it's nothing we have to say
There's nothing in our eyes ...
But there's something in the air
Something in my eye
And I've danced with you too long, yeah
(oh-oh)
Something in the air
(oh-oh)
Something in my eye
(oh-oh)
I've danced with you too long, yeah
(oh-oh)
Something in the air
Oh-oh
Something in my eye
Something in the air!
Oh-oh-oh-oh, little China Girl
Oh-oh-oh-oh, little China Girl

I could escape this feeling with my China girl
I feel a wreck without my little China girl
I hear her heart beating
It's loud as thunder
I saw the stars crashing down

I'm just a mess without my little China Girl
Wake up in the morning, where's my little China Girl?
I hear her heart beating
It's loud as thunder
I saw the stars crashing

I'm feeling tragic like I'm Marlon Brando
When I look at my China girl
I could pretend that nothing really meant too much
When I look at my China girl
Oh boy ...

[Guitar solo]

I -
I stumble into town just like some sacred cow
Visions of swastikas in my head
Plans for everyone
It's in the white of my eyes
Oh - you

My little china girl
You shouldn't mess with me
I'll ruin everything that you are, or
I'll give you television
I'll give you eyes of blue
I'll give you a man who wants to rule the world

And when I get excited
My little China Girl
She says
Oh baby, just you shut your mouth
She says... shh
She says... shh
She says...

[Chorus 2]
And when I get excited
My little China Girl says
Oh baby, just you shut your mouth
And when I get excited
My little China Girl
Says
Oh baby, just you shut your mouth
She says... shh
She says...

[Outro]
Oh-oh-oh-oh, little China Girl
Oh-oh-oh-oh, little China Girl
Oh-oh-oh-oh, little China Girl
Oh-oh-oh-oh, little China Girl
Question time dad says
I brought dishonour
My head's bowed in shame
It seems that I've blackened the family name

My mama says
She can't stand the neighbours talking
I gotta pack my bags
Leave this home, start walking
Yeah

I'm guilty!
I wish that I was sorry this time
I wish that I could pay for my crime

Can't help thinking about me
Can't help thinking about me
Can't help thinking about me

Remember when
We used to go to church on Sundays
I would lie awake at night
Terrified of school on Mondays
It's too late now!
I wish I was a child again
I wish I felt secure again
But I can't help thinking about me

Can't help thinking about mе
Can't help thinking about me
(ooh yeah)

As I pass a rеcreation ground
I remember my friends
Always been found
But I can't

Can't help thinking about me
Can't help thinking about me
Can't help thinking about me

Now I leave them all
In this never-never land
The station seems so cold
The ticket's in my hand

My girl calls my name
She says, "Hi Dave
Come back, drop in
See you around
If you're this way again"
I'm on my own
I've got a long way to go
I hope I make it on my own

Can't help thinking about me
Can't help thinking about me
Can't help thinking about me
Can't help thinking about me
Can't help thinking about me
Can't help thinking about me
Can't help thinking about me
Can't help thinking about me
Every chance
Every chance that I take
I take it on the road

Kilometers
And the red lights
Always looking left and right
Oh, Always crashing
In the same car

Jasmine, I saw you peeping
As I put my foot down to the floor
Going 'round and round the hotel car-park
Must have been done by 94

And I’m always crashing
In the same car (oh-oh)

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na
La-na-la-na-la-na-la
Always crashing in the same car
Always crashing in the same car
Oh my
Naked eyes
I should have kept you
I should have tried
I should have been a wiser
Kind of guy
I loved you

Give me wings
Give me space
Give me money for change of face
Those noisy rooms and passion pants
I loved you

Where's the morning in my life
Where's the sense in staying right
Who said time is on my side

I've got ears and eyes
And nothing in my life
But I'll survive your naked eyes
I'll survive
You alone across the floor
You and me
And nothing more
You're the great mistake
I never made

I never lied to you
I hated when you lied
But I'll survive your naked eyes
I'll survive

Beatle boys
All snowy white
Razzle dazzle clubs
Every night
Wish I'd sent
That valentine
I loved you
But I'll survive
Your naked eyes
I'll survive

I'll survive ...
I'll survive ...
I'll survive
Ya dah-dah diy la la
Ya la da da la la la
Ya da da da la la la
La-la-la da la la la
Ya dah dah diy la
La la la
This week went past me so slowly
The days fell on their knees
Maybe I'll take something to help me
I hope someone takes after me

I guess there's a change in the weather
Maybe this time we could get it together
If I did mention tonight
That would be crazy tonight

[Chorus]
Stay -
That's what I meant to say
Or do something
But what I never say is
Stay this time
I really meant to so bad this time
Plus you can never really tеll
When somebody wants something, you want too

[Verse 2]
Hеartbreaker, heartbreaker
See me tonight
Life is so vague when it brings someone new
This time tomorrow, I'll know what to do
I know it's happened to you

[Chorus]
Stay — that's what I meant to say
Or do something
But what I never say is
Stay this time
I really meant to so bad this time
But you can never really tell
When somebody wants someone to
Stay — that's what I meant to say or do something
But what I never say is
Stay this time
I really meant to so bad this time
But you can never really tell
When somebody wants something, you want too

[Outro]
Stay
Won't you stay?
Won't you stay?
Won't you stay?
Won't you stay? Hey
Stay, stay, stay, stay
Stay, stay, stay, stay
Stay, stay, stay, stay
Stay, stay, stay, stay
Stay, stay, stay, stay
Stay, stay, stay, stay
Stay, stay, stay, stay
Stay, stay, stay, stay
Stay, stay, stay, stay
I forgot what my father said
I forgot what he said
I forgot what my mother said
As we lay upon your bed

A city full of flowers
A city full of rain
I've got seven days to live my life
Or seven days to die

I forgot what my brother said
I forgot what he said
I don't recall anything at all
I remember how we wept

On a bridge of violent people
I was small enough to cry
I got seven days to live my life
Or seven ways to die

Hold my face before you
Still my trembling heart
I've got seven days to livе my life
Or seven ways to diе
The gods forgot they made me
Well, I forget them too
I listen to their shadows
And I play among their graves

My heart was never broken
And my patience never tried
I got seven days to live my life
Or seven ways to die

Seven days to live my life
Or seven ways to die

Seven
Seven
Seven

Seven
Seven
Seven

I've got seven
Seven
Seven
(I do)
Oh, yeah-mmm
Ooh-mmmm
Ooh-mmmm

Still don't know what I was waiting' for
And my time was running' wild
A million dead end streets and
Every time I thought I'd got it made
It seemed the taste was not so sweet

And I turned myself to face me
But I've never caught a glimpse
Of how the others must see this faker
I'm much too fast to take that test

Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
Turn and face the strange
Ch-ch-changes
Don't want to have to be a richer man
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
Turn and face the strange
Ch-ch-changes
Just wanted to be a better man
Time may change mе
I can't trace time

Oooh yeah
Oooh, ooh

I watch thе ripples change their size
You never leave the stream
Of warm impermanent sand
And so the days float through my eyes
And still the days don't seem the same

And these children that you spit on
As they try to change their worlds
Are immune to your consultations
They're quite aware of what
They're going' through

Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
Turn and face the strange
Ch-ch-changes
Don't tell them to grow up and out of it
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
Turn and face the strange
Ch-ch-changes
Where's your shame?
You've left us up to our necks in it
Time may change me
I can't trace time

Strange fascinations fascinate me
Changes are taking
The pace I'm going' through
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
Turn and face the strange
Ch-ch-changes
Ooh, look out, you rock 'n' rollers
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
Turn and face the strange
Ch-ch-changes
Pretty soon we're going to get older

Time may change me
But I can't trace time
I said that time may change me
Can't trace time
What to wear
What to say
What to do
On a sunny day

Who to phone
Who to fight
Who to dance with
On a Sunday night

I'm reaching the very edge, you know
I'm reaching the very edge
I'm going to the other side this time
I'm reaching the very edge

You're still breathing
But you don't know why
Life's a bitch
And sometimes you die
You're still breathing
But you just can't tell
Don't hold your breath
But the pretty things are going to hell
I am a drug
I am a dragon
I am the best jazz you've ever seen

I am the dragon
I am thе sky
I am the blood
At the corner of your еye
I found the secrets
I found gold
I find you out
Before you grow old
I find you out
Before you grow old

What is eternal
What is damned
What is clay
And what is sand

Who to diss
Who to trust
Who to listen to
Who to suss

I'm reaching the very edge, you know
I'm reaching the very edge
I'm going to the other side this time
I'm reaching the very edge
You're still breathing
But you don't know why
Life's a bit
And sometimes you die

You're still breathing
But you just can't tell
Don't hold your breath
But the pretty things
Are going to hell

The pretty things are going to Hell
They wore it out
But they wore it well

The pretty things are going to Hell
They wore it out
But they wore it well

The pretty things are going to Hell
They wore it out
But they wore it well

The pretty things are going to Hell
They wore it out
But they wore it well
Oh yeah
Move it, move it

[Guitar solo]

You're still breathing
But you just can't tell
Don't hold your breath
But the pretty things are going to hell

You're still breathing
But you don't know why
Life's a bit
And sometimes you die

You're still breathing
But you just can't tell
Don't hold your breath
But the pretty things are going to Hell
Yeah!
(Do it)

Haute is the livin', Coca Cola's the sponsor
I run up with your boo, uh, Hov is a monster
Yeah, huh, they like me like that
Every girl I see wanna be wifey like that
I'm the King of Zamunda, uh, King of the Summer
Come be my Kardashian, queen of the come up, uh
To be loved, Shakespearean
Experience to be us
Jumpin' off boats, hoppin' off another cliff
Every six months, I think I need a new bucket list
Yeah, I think I might need a harem
I'm way too much, y'all should share 'em
I'm feeling like a baron, all I need is a castle
Be my Halle Berry, all you need is a catsuit
All I need is Heaven, I don't want the hassle
God bless the child that can hold his own, achoo

[Verse 2: Nas]
My instincts guide me through this Kurtis Blow culture
Good angel, bad angel sittin' on both shoulders
One be trying to gas me, manipulate me, tempt me
Make me have no soul, so I like to take a toll
All the favor of the days when the paper wasn't major
Me and my nigga Mr. Tunnel
Razor in the mouth for when thinking shit was south (Slumped)
Better tuck your chain in, that's a warning, warning (Woo)
When the woodies come out, you know the goons is swarming

[Hook: Swizz Beatz & Nas]
This that street shit nigga, fuck that weak shit

Quarantine something that you can't get enough of
Nah, life is bitch but you can't snuff her
Something to think about the shit is only gettin' rougher

Shit pop off, we don't blow it up 'til we blow it up
Cats better slow it up, y'all niggas know what's up
My niggas throw it up, we all know that
Got niggas missing in action, where are they at?
See you niggas never really been duffed out
But you've got enough mouth to get snuffed out
Duke, the rough route
We don't play around here, nigga, we grown
Start applying the pressure, give a dog a bone
I'm taking half, it's just that simple
Or I can start poppin' niggas like pimples
I'ma let you call it, you ballin'
'Til you get hit with them hot things, now you staggerin' and fallin'
Holding up the wall, you got more than enough holes in you to fall
You're just wasting a nigga's time, come on, man
I got shit to do like hit your crew
Might hit your crib, what that bitch gon' do?
Not a damn thing, but go with the program
Beast on that bitch like Conan—bo-nan
I'ma go where no man has ever gone, nigga
When it's on, it's on, I'll let you know in a fuckin' song
I got nothing to hide, but you got a reason to run
Come through like (*gunshots*) 'til the squeezin' is done
And that's just squeezing one, imagine if we all let go
And turn your whole block into death row (Woo!)

[Chorus]
See, my nigga don't dance, make you switch up your
Plans and put your rocks away
I take that
I take that
We take that
We take that

Ask your niggas in hood, they know i shut your down

[Spoken]
We're the orchestra to your board
And we beg for the scraps from your table
All we want is to be like you
Music to play your 

[?]
Pump pumping sounds through the speakers below
Hello
I've tried so hard to keep still
They will chew you up
They will spit out your bones
Standing in the shadows at the end of the bed
I never said anything
I live a wallpaper life of playing guitar in a band
It seems so volatile
Oh my, oh my
He was a good man
And he said he was the best
They said that even when lifе spat in his face
He put evеrything back in its right place
A conflict of interest, you might say
Are you trying to bribe me?

[?] for my sins
We are plants, happy plants
Superhuman builders' day
See

[?]
I leave you for bitch of 

[?] and go green
Loved to death like egg mayonnaise
With a grin like roadkill
Fine, let's stay
Everything is alive
There is nothing but blue skies from now on
No ghosts, no skeletons
A man hovers in the dust, dust, dust
Thank you very much, thank you
Everybody drive home safe and carefully tonight
And we'll see you in our lounge in a few weeks time
Goodnight! God bless!
Let's go home, Jonny

[Verse 1]
A green plastic watering can
For a fake Chinese rubber plant
In a fake plastic earth
That she bought from a rubber man
In a town full of rubber plants
To get rid of itself

[Chorus 1]
It wears her out
It wears her out
It wears her out
It wears her out

[Verse 2]
She lives with a broken man
A cracked polystyrene man
Who just crumbles and burns
He used to do surgery
For girls in the eighties
But gravity always wins

[Chorus 2]
And it wears him out
It wears him out
It wears him out
It wears

[Verse 3]
She looks like the real thing
She tastes like the real thing
My fake plastic love
But I can't help the feeling
I could blow through the ceiling
If I just turn and run

[Chorus 3]
And it wears me out
It wears me out
It wears me out
It wears me out

[Outro]
And if I could be who you wanted
If I could be who you wanted
All the time
All the time

[Verse 1]
Rows of houses all bearing down on me
I can feel their blue hands touching me
All these things into position
All these things we'll one day swallow whole

[Chorus]
And fade out again
And fade out

[Verse 2]
This machine will, will not communicate
These thoughts and the strain I am under
Be a world child, form a circle
Before we all go under

[Chorus]
And fade out again
And fade out again

[Verse 3]
Cracked eggs, dead birds, scream as they fight for life
I can feel death, can see its beady eyes
All these things into position
All these things we'll one day swallow whole

[Chorus]
And fade out again
And fade out again

[Outro]
Immerse your soul in love
Immerse your soul in love

[Chorus: Bianca Bonnie]
I get crazy
I-I get crazy
I-I get crazy
I-I get crazy

[Intro: Nicki Minaj]
I mean, you know
It's like when I feel really crazy
I just get my broom and fly away
I go real, real far away
Young Money
That’s-that's-that's just what we do
You know, I mean we-we wear straightjackets
And we-we-we-we stay in, you know, padded rooms
And, you know, and we fly away

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Ayo, I mean, I’m brand new, and I can't stand you
I show these bitches how to do it like a manual
I got Nathaniel and my nigga Daniel
My bodyguards will be quick to pull a hand out
I need a man, though, laid, eating mangoes
I keep a couple pink toes in my sandals
I got some bangles all over my ankles
I'm such a star, they singing thе "Star Spangled
Banner," I am the rap Hannah
Mo-Mon-Montana, so fix your antеnna
I keep three hoes, but don't call me Santa
A-And I'm, and I'm flyer than reindeers in the winter

[Chorus: Bianca Bonnie]
I get crazy
I-I get crazy
I-I get crazy
I-I get crazy

Yo bartender, keep on bringing out the “Malibi”

Yo, why you looking at me like you got a attitude?
And why you got them toes hanging out your Prada shoes?
Your Fred Flintstone feet, yabba-dabba-doo

’Cause I'm looking for some good brains from a thinker

[Bridge: Nicki Minaj]

[Verse 1]
Here comes Mary, girls well now you better just hide your love
She don't wanna aim arrows at unattached men
It don't matter too much that it hurts, so you better know what's what
Here comes Mary, girls just turn your backs and then
She is heeled in flash to hurt, it's all a game
She's win and then she'll walk away

[Chorus]
(And the boys say)
Mary goes round (then the girls say)
Mary goes round (round round)
Mary goes round (then the girls say)
Mary goes round (round round)
(Turn a corner right, turn a corner left, step by step)

[Verse 2]
Mary had a little lamb, his fleece was white as snow
Mother's helper, daddy's little angel
And everywhere she went, uh huh, the men was sure to go
There is just another walk for danger
Don't let her get too close, or you'll add one more part
To Mary's trail of broken hearts

[Chorus]
Mary goes round (then the girls say)
Mary goes round (round round) (then the boys say)
Mary goes round, oh (then the girls say)
Mary goes round (round round)

Don't let her get too close, or you've add one more part
To Mary's trail of broken hearts, ooh, oh oh

[Chorus]
Mary goes round (na na na na na)
Mary goes round (round round)
Mary goes round, help me sing it (na na na na na)
Mary goes round (round round)
Mary goes round (na na na na na)

[Outro]
Oh, you've got to slow your own up to the dawn (round round)
Party time, ooh, your party it's sho', talking, talking
Party time, you've got to slow your own up to the dawn
Mary goes round, oh (na na na na na)
Mary goes round
He loves me
He loves me
He loves me now
I reminisce, about how we use to be
Me so close to you, you so close me
We lost our love, and then we want it back
All of our yester years, hello we stayed intact
You are the great love of my life
Precious moment so tender and feel
He said that every boy has wrong
Oh my God, I'm so glad don't you

Monsieur, monsieur, avec tu, mon amour
We could be the very best of friends and maybe lovers
We could be on all the pages and the cover
A robin never sang a sweeter song
And our melody is like no others'
Love is where we are
And there's no denying
That we touched each other dearly
And I love it when you're near me
I gave to you, what did you give about your reasons why?
You didn't even try, yeah
You believe in games, yes, you believe in ploys
Ah, ah
And you can't see the love in your life
You've allowed your past sorrows
To rob you of your future joy
How can a jewel that shines so bright not see the path that enlightens us?
Believe in yourself as a man
My love, you are all but smitened
Broken wings can fly
They can fly again
And with a beauty unknown to you
Higher than you've ever, than you've ever been
Don't give up so quick, sweet baby
And what have you given of yourself lately?
I gave to you
What did you give?
About your reasons why
You know you know you didn't even try
I know you love me, why don't you say you do?
I'll be your everything kind of woman
And baby I'll give beaucoup love to you
Open up, baby
Open up and let the world back in
I am your woman

So please have mercy on me, babe

It's crazy in my mind

[Verse ]
I picked myself up off the floor
And found something new worth living for
And a, old dusty hand-me-down six string
And a couple chords

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm getting over her
A little more with every song
So you all sing along

[Chorus]
And she got the best of me
She broke my heart
Now all that's left of me
Is beating in this guitar
Every night, a different town
She follows me around
So you get what's left of me
Yeah, you get what's left of me
'Cause she got the best of me, Oh

[Chorus]
She got the best of me
She broke my heart
Now all that's left of me
Is beating in this guitar
Every night, a different town
She follows me around
So you get what's left of me
Yeah, you get what's left of me
'Cause she got the best of me

[Outro]
Yeah, she got the best of me

[Intro]
Yeah
Yeah

[Verse 1: bearface]
So familiar with the back of your head
Watching all your curls entangle in lies
Whisper in my ear "Te quiero" all night
Sittin' on the yard, swerve, fall into mine, oh yeah
Always what you want to see
Move it to the back, and it's pulling on my heart
That I'm never coming back to you now
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah

[Refrain: bearface]
Sittin' on your porch, across parking lots and you
Light it up, better dodge the cops
And I'll never get sick of playing with your locks
I, I miss you lots, I, I miss you lots, I, I
Sittin' on your porch, across parking lots and you
Light it up, better dodgе the cops
And I'll never gеt sick of playing with your locks
I, I miss you lots, I, I miss you lots, I, I

[Verse 2: Matt Champion]
Keep my temp 'round 99 Fahrenheit
Every touch, every breath, make me paralyzed
Helped me out of a hole, I was scared to cry
Took me out of a world to a better life
Didn't know who I was, eyes coated with the fuzz
Afraid to let go, afraid to face a world so cold
Wrapped up in the past, I didn't know
Pull it out of me
I need adrenaline, need a little ventilation
No thoughts, a violation, till my pupils dilating
Send a text to everybody that inspire me
Let 'em know they inspire me, bitch!

[Outro: Dom McLennon & Kevin Abstract]
You don't even know yourself, uh
You don't even know yourself, uh, uh
(Who are you)
You don't even know yourself, uh
You don't even know yourself, uh, uh

You don't even know yourself, uh

[Verse 1]
Gotta be more careful with the shit I'm manifesting
Is this is all a dream or am I really being tested?
Out of five thousand people, of course you're standing there
Weighing all the options, running through my head
I think I'll take the chance, 'cause after all, what are the chances? (Just saying)

[Chorus]
Here we go again
Last time it took us down to the bitter end
I might need some more healing
But it's worth it for the feeling
Here we go again
Now I'm not looking back 'causе that pain is dead
If history's repeating
It's worth it for thе feeling

[Verse 2]
Might not look the same 'cause now we're both a little different
Had to find ourselves so we could find out what was missing
Gotta be honest, I'm scared to lose myself
After all the drama, I felt like someone else
But I'm stuck inside this dream, got trouble sleeping 'til we fix this

[Chorus]
Here we go again
Last time it took us down to the bitter end
I might need some more healing
But it's worth it for the feeling
Here we go again
Now I'm not looking back 'cause that pain is dead
If history's repeating
It's worth it for the feeling

[Bridge]
Forever, I've been asking for everyone's opinion
Never learned to trust my own intuition
Don't care if it's a bad decision

[Chorus]
Here we go again
Last time it took us down to the bitter end
I might need some more healing
But it's worth it for the feeling
Here we go again
Now I'm not looking back 'cause that pain is dead
If history's repeating
It's worth it for the feeling

[Outro]
Feeling
(Worth it for the) Feeling
(Worth it for the) Feeling
The lights are getting dimmer as she blows away
Fuck it, I'm blazed
Yeah, I'm blazed

And maybe I've been dreaming for a bit too long
We're all strangers to ourselves

She wake up, put the make up and get up and get dressed up
But we had no where to go
And my palms were getting sweaty
And my mind was getting heavy
Come closer to me

And tell me if its okay that we don't behave
Just one day with you
And I hеard there was a party up on the wеst side
Would you stop on by around two

Yeah, she's probably in the bathroom getting higher than a vacuum
It's an altered state of mind
Maybe when we're thirty
We'll stop being so flirty
Settle down
And I promise by tomorrow I'll be out the door
No I won't bore you
But whether I was here we'll never know for sure
I'm looking for a clue

(Y'all are pretty nasty. Y'all are pretty nasty. Well hopefully there will be more shows and you know, maybe, maybe there won't be another show again. Thanks for being-)
Take me with you
Everywhere you go, honey
Take me with you
So better far, no one will know, they won't know, oh

Take me with you, come on, take me along
Everywhere you go

Sweet to me, sweet, sweet music all the time, ooh, ah, ah, ah
I think your live will have me only giving you the best
I wanna be the number one thing of you there
I've got to hold on tied to you baby (tied, tied)
Cheer but don't, your love just might be away (be away)

With you (honey)
Yeah, yeah, yeah (you know)
Whatever it is, it's only the beginning
Whatever it takes, it's everything you're giving
No one but you could ever let me see
This woman inside of me was never really free
And if I cry, understand my reasons
You take my hand and touching is believing
When I was sure that I had loved before
You came into my life and brought me so much, so much more
Whatever it is
I hope that we can love this way forever
Darling, it just gets bеtter
Whenevеr we kiss
The magic of the moment keeps returning
Darling, I keep learning
Whatever it is, it's all I'll ever need
Lost in a dream that paints a perfect picture
You know my heart has gone from rags to riches
You give so much that words could never measure
And time could not erase this feeling that I treasure
Oh, whatever it is
I hope that we can love this way forever
Darling, it just gets better
Whenever we kiss
The magic of the moment keeps returning
Yes, yes, yes, and I keep learning
Whatever it is, it's all I'll ever need
Whatever it is, ooh, ooh, ooh, it's all I'll ever need
Well, here we are after so many years
Together again, yes, we're together again
She's a superstar, ooh and it all gone far, yeah, yeah, yeah
Together again, we're together again

We've always held on to a little bit of each other
Together, together, oh
And we had to be more than friends
Because we're together again, yeah, yeah
Together, eh, eh... ooh, we're together

Together, forever, we're back together again
What a happy reunion, we're back together again

When I look into your eyes
I can see we were both so happy about it
And now we're together again, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, we're together again
And we were meant for each other

School days
School days
Dear ole golden
Rule days
Reading (Reading)
Writing (Writing)
Arithmetic (Arithmetic)
Were taught to the tune of
Tight skirts, big socks, pony tails and silk suit sales, now
Those really were the days, we had a lot of fun
And I remember that very special one
See him walking in the hall when classes would change
And I don't think he ever really knew my name
Ooh boy, school boy, ooh boy, yeah yeah yeah yeah
We were stylish and young, second to none
Coming on up the right way, yes, those were the days
That was the way things in the 50’s were done, now
With my bucks and checker boots I was really steppin' tough
With my fringed suede jacket I was just about tough enough, ya'll
But I couldn’t get this guy to even look my way
Wonder what he looks like right now to this very day
Ooh boy, school boy, ooh boy, yeah yeah yeah yeah
We were stylish and young, second to none
Coming on up the right way, yes, those were the days
That was the way things in the 50's were done, now
Art was my favorite class and I had to get a pass
To fool around in the hall, he was so cute and tall
I loved to race to lunch and science was more'n a hunch
Sure loved to go to gym, loved it when I saw him
We were stylish and young, second to none
Coming on up the right way, yes, those were the days
That was the way things in the 50's were done, now
Hey
Remember those big hoop skirts and petticoats
That we wore in the summer, guess that's what I wore the most
And remember when you'd sit they'd fly up in the air
And you'd have to hold them down while sitting in your chair
Hoop skirts, petticoats, dirty sneakers
And blue jeans were cheaper
We were stylish and young, second to none
Coming on up the right way, yes, those were the days
That was the way things in the 50’s were done, now
We were stylish and young, second to none
Coming on up the right way, yes, those were the days
That was the way things in the 50’s were done, now
We were stylish and young, second to none
Coming on, coming on, coming on, yes, those were the days
That was the way things in the 50's were done, now
Oh, ain’t you glad you made it
Oh, oh, ain't you glad you made it now
Oh, ain't you glad you made it
Ain't you glad you made it now, oh, oh, oh, oh
Ain’t you glad you made it
Ain't you glad you made it, oh, oh, oh, yeah
Ain't you glad you made it, oh, oh
Ain't you glad you made it, oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ain't you glad you made it, yeah, yeah
Ain't you glad you made it, oh yeah
Ain't you glad you made it now, oh
Ain't you glad you made it
Ain't you glad you made it now

And there's nothing that I can do
So I won't try, I won't try holding on to you
Just answer one question before you go
'Cause there's just one thing it would help to know

[Chorus]
(So tell as you're leaving) Tell me as you're leaving
(Where you're going and how far) Where you're going, how far
('Cause what if I should ever need you) What if I should ever need you?

(And I'm not where you arе) And I'm not where, wherе you are

[Verse 2]
Oh, oh, oh, we were so close to each other
And we shared so much
It scares me to think that, that we might lose touch
There's so many lights in the city, and so many motors
I'd just like to know, yes I would, I wanna know which one is yours

[Outro]
(So tell as you're leaving) Tell me as you're leaving
(Where you're going and how far) Where you're going and how far

Come on, baby, I need your love
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, I need your love
Yeah, come on, baby, I need your love
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, I need your love, yes

Ooh, hurry, my darling put the ring on my finger
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah

[Verse 1: Aretha Franklin]
Without you, darling, I'm no good
I'm just as hopeless, one sad look
Your place is here with me, here's your home
Don't leave me, darling, don't do wrong

Aretha:
I was made for you boy, tell me now
Eric:
And you were made for me, girl, and how
Aretha:
I'm gonna love you forever, I'm by your side
Eric:
And I'm your man for life

[Chorus: Aretha Franklin & Eric Robinson, Eric]
There's no one for me, only you
I'm blind to all others, that's the truth
Ain't thinking 'bout leaving, I'm here to stay
Believe me when I say I won't go away

[Bridge: Aretha Franklin, Eric Robinson]
I was made for you, girl, ain't that right?
And you wеre made for me, boy, you know it's tight
And I'll bе there when our love is felt, I sure will
Oh, I believe it, and it's swell, it's swell

[Outro: Aretha Franklin, Eric Robinson]
I was made for you, boy, ain't that right?

Without you, darling, I'm no good
I'm just as hopeless, one sad look
Ooh, ooh, ooh, without you, darling, I'm no good
I'm just as hopeless, one sad look

[Intro]
Rock, let's rock, yeah

[Verse 1]
I used to wonder 'bout a lot of things
Things that I didn't understand
I've given on up in what I used to take
I know I'm giving all I can
Life is too short to be taken
Taken for a jolly ride, yeah
Everything I do from now on in, hoo
I got to be satisfied

[Pre-Chorus]
I ain't living sun up to sun down
Just to have a frown on my face, ooh
I have my feet planted on the ground
I like it better that way, for

Hey, hey, darling
Love it, love it, love it, love it, love it, love it
Oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah

[Verse 2]
Bright lights, big city, it's like a spidеr web, y'all
Caught up in the glitter and thе pretty
Never have I seen it so bad
Life is too short to be taken
Taken for a jolly ride, ooh
Everything I do from now on in, hoo
I've got to be satisfied

[Pre-Chorus]
I ain't living from sun up to sun down
Just to have a frown on my face (Frown on my face)
I have my feet planted on the ground
I like it better that way, ho

[Chorus]
(Oh-ooh-oh-ooh-oh) I love the reasons why
(Oh-ooh-oh-ooh-oh) I love the reasons why

[Outro]
You can love any man when you wanna

[Intro]
Well, oh yes, mhm
Oh baby, oh, oh baby
Yeah, make it pretty for me now
Do that for me

[Chorus]
Half a love just won't do
It just ain't good enough, no, oh oh oh oh
Half a love (Just won't do), it will not do
It just ain't good enough, no, it ain't, baby

[Verse 1]
Don't turn me on just to turn me off
We've got to work this out together
Don't build me up just to bring me down, hey
Tell me that you're not that kind of fella

[Chorus]
Because half a love (Just won't do), it won't do
It just ain't good enough, no no, no no, no no, no no, no no
Half a love (Just won't do), it just won't do
Just ain't good enough, no, no no

[Verse 2]
Don't squeeze me baby if you can't hold on
Oh yeah, I want a love that's truly mine
Now don't you make me weak (Weak) when I feel so strong, yeah
Now that I got love all mine

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's not get started if we can't go all the way
Don't play with fire if you're afraid of getting burned
Don't play the teacher if you're not willing to learn
I want you to stop (Hey), look (Hey), listen to me (Hey)
Hear my plea, yeah, hear my plea

[Chorus]
Because half a love just won't do
(Just ain't good enough) It ain't good enough, not for me
No no no no no no no no no
Half a love (Just won't do), it just won't do
It just ain't good enough

[Bridge]
Mmm, hey, hey, hey, hey
It won't do, it won't do, it won't do, it won't do
Hey, hey, hey, hey
It won't do, it won't do, it won't do, it won't do
Hey, hey, hey, hey
It won't do, it won't do, it won't do, it won't do
Hey, hey, hey, hey
It won't do

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's not get started if we can't go all the way
Don't play with fire if you're afraid of getting burned
Don't play the teacher if you're not willing to learn
I want you to stop (Hey), look (Hey), listen to me (Hey)
Hey, hear my plea, yeah, yeah, hear my plea

[Chorus]
(Half a love) Half a love (Just won't do) will not do
(Just ain't good enough) It ain't good enough, no no, no, no
(Half a love) Half a love (Just won't do), will not do
(Just ain't good enough) It ain't good enough, not for me, no no, oh oh oh

[Outro]
Hey, hey
It won't do, it won't do, it won't do, it won't do
Hey, hey, hey, hey
(Bring it down to a low gravy, yeah)
It won't do, it won't do, it won't do, it won't do (Nah, baby)
Hey, hey, hey, hey (Nah, baby)
It won't do, it won't do, it won't do, it won't do
(I don't want a part-time lover)
Hey, hey, hey, hey
I want a man, that I can truly call mine
Who'll be right here with me
And give me that good ol' lovin', right on time, yeah
Hey, baby, there's a whole lotta things in love that I can understand
But one of them that I cannot is sharing a man
Said that a half a love, no, will not do, it won't do
It just ain't good enough, no, oh no

[Verse 1]
I guess you could call it textbook
I was lookin' for the father I wanted back
And I thought I found it in Brentwood
It seemed only appropriate you'd easily have my back

[Pre-Chorus]
And then there was the issue of her
I didn't even like myself, or love the life I had
And there you were with shining stars
Standin' blue with open arms
You touched the detriment most of the friends I knew already had

[Chorus]
You've got a Thunderbird, my daddy had one, too
Let's rewrite history, I'll do this dance with you
You know I'm not that girl, you know I'll never be
Maybe just the way we're different could set me free
And there we were, screamin' "Black Lives Matter" in the crowd
By the Old Man River, and I saw you saw who I am
God, I wish I was with my father
He could see us in all our splendor
All the things I couldn't want for him
I screamed for them, oh-oh-oh
I screamed for them, ah-ah

[Verse 2]
Could we do this dance again?
Do you think if I go blonde, we could get our old love back?
I guess this is really the end
I never felt jealous before this year, but I'm jealous now

[Pre-Chorus]
People say we're too much alike
But maybe, finally, that'll make it right
In the end of all these sleepless nights
Other men I met felt right
Would smile at you and stick a knife
In your back
Finally, I met you so I'm not wonderin' why

[Chorus]
You've got a Thunderbird, my daddy had one, too
Let's rewrite history, I'll do this dance with you
You know I'm not that girl, you know I'll never be
Maybe just the way we're different could set me free
There we were, screamin' "Black Lives Matter" in the crowd
By the Old Man River, and I saw you saw who I am
God, I wish I was with my father
He could see us in all our splendor
All the things I couldn't want for him
I screamed for them, oh-oh-oh
I screamed for them, ah-ah

[Outro]
Old Man River keeps rollin'
With or without him
Old Man River keeps rollin'
Without him, oh, my old man
Old Man River keeps rollin', oh

[Intro]
I talk to you today
We've loved each other for so long
In that special way
And if circumstances should keep us apart
I just want you to know
That you will remain forever here in my heart

[Verse 1]
Sweet, sweet bitter love
The taste still lingers
Go through my helpless fingers
You slipped away
Ooh, yes you did

[Verse 2]
Sweet, sweet bitter love
What joy you taught me
What pain you didn't mean to but you brought me
So short
Baby, so short of a stay

[Chorus]
Our magic dreams have lost their spells
And where there, where there was hope
There's an em-- an empty shell

[Verse 3]
Oh, sweet, my my my my my bitter love
Why have you awaken
And then you forsaken
A trusting heart like mine

[Chorus]
Oh, oh, my magic dreams, oh my magic dreams have lost their spells
And where there, where there was hope
There's an empty shell

[Verse 4]
Oh sweet, my my my, my my my bitter love
Why have you awaken
And then, and then, and then, and then, you have forsaken
A trusting heart, yeah yeah yeah
A trusting heart like mine
I love you boy, yes I do
A trusting heart like mine

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Here's to the ones that we got
Cheers to the wish you were here, but you're not
'Cause the drinks bring back all the memories
Of everything we've been through
Toast to the ones here today
Toast to the ones that we lost on the way
'Cause the drinks bring back all the memories
And the memories bring back, memories bring back you

[Verse 1: YG]
Tequila drinkin', double shot, yeah, I need you
I know this life it look nicе but it get deeper
I run from reapеrs, dodge bullets from Glock, Ninas
I live my life tryna prove myself to non-believers, gotta stop that
The devil talkin', I block that
Got some homies in Heaven now, they watch my back
For all this pain, we numb it with champagne
Hunnid bottles in the club, that's a goddamn shame

[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine & YG]
Everybody hurts sometimes
Everybody hurts someday, ayy-ayy (4Hunnid)
But everything gon' be alright
Go and raise a glass and say, ayy

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Here's to the ones that we got
Cheers to the wish you were here, but you're not
'Cause the drinks bring back all the memories
Of everything we've been through
Toast to the ones here today
Toast to the ones that we lost on the way
'Cause the drinks bring back all the memories
And the memories bring back, memories bring back you

[Post-Chorus: Adam Levine]
Doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Memories bring back, memories bring back you

[Verse 2: Nipsey Hussle]
Look
I done lost love, lost fifties, lost dubs
Lost fights, nigga, lost life of loved ones
Lost time, pressin' rewind, it won't budge
It's alright, you can tell me your truth, I won't judge
I done lost too, relationships you could call true
You hit me up and I'm gon' fall through
Tellin' lies to sound true, like it's all you
Learn to love what's imperfect, that's what God do

[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]
Everybody hurts sometimes
Everybody hurts someday, ayy-ayy
But everything gon' be alright
Go and raise a glass and say, ayy

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Here's to the ones that we got (Oh-oh)
Cheers to the wish you were here, but you're not
'Cause the drinks bring back all the memories
Of everything we've been through (No, no)
Toast to the ones here today (Ayy)
Toast to the ones that we lost on the way
'Cause the drinks bring back all the memories (Ayy)
And the memories bring back, memories bring back you

[Post-Chorus: Adam Levine]
Doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Memories bring back, memories bring back you
Doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo (Ooh, yeah)
Memories bring back, memories bring back you

[Outro: Adam Levine]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, no, no
Memories bring back, memories bring back you

[Verse 1]
Here's the deal
’Cause I know you wanna talk about it
Here's the deal
I promise you, like, a million tomorrows
Here's the deal
What I can promise is I’ll lie down
Like a bed of wildflowers
And I'll always make the sheets
Smell like gardenias wild at your feet
And I nourish you hazily

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, I, I, I, I've been runnin' on stardust
Alone for so long
I wouldn't know what hot fire was
Hot fire, hot weather, hot coffee
I'm better with you
It's strange, but it's true, darling

[Chorus]
Not to turn into a wildfire
To light up your night
With only my smile and nothing that burns
Baby, I’ll be like a wildflower
I live on sheer willpower
I’ll do my best never to turn into something
That burns, burns, burns
Like the others, baby, burns, burns, burns

[Verse 2]
Here's the deal
’Cause I know you wanna talk about it
Here's the deal
You say there's gaps to fill in, so here
Here's the deal
My father never stepped in when his wife would rage at me
So I ended up awkward but sweet
Later then hospitals, stand still on my feet
Comfortably numb, but with lithium came poetry

[Pre-Chorus]
And baby, I, I’ve been running on star drip
IV's for so long
I wouldn't know how cruel the world was
Hot fire, hot weather, hot coffee, I'm better
So I turn, but I learn (It from you, babe)

[Chorus]
Not to turn into a wildfire
To light up your night
With only my smile and nothing that hurts
Baby, I run like a wildflower
I live on sheer willpower
I promise that nothing will burn you
Nothing will burn, burn, burn
Like the others, baby, burns, burns, burns
Burn, burn, burn (Like the others, baby)
Like the others, baby, burns, burns, burns

[Outro]
It's you from whom I learn, learn, learn
It's you from whom I learn, learn, learn
Love you
Oh I love you baby, yes I do
I love you baby yeah
Make me feel so good sometimes
I love
With everything I feel in me
Oh I love you baby
With everything I feel in me, yeah
I said I love you baby yeah

[Verse 1: Adam Levine]
You lit the neon inside of my chest
There was no vacancy
I felt the flick of the light that she left
You left a space in me

[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]
Novocaine
I thought I couldn't feel no pain
But it still feels like, ooh, when I hear your name
I can't escape, tryin' but I can't escape
(Let me go)

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
I got this echo (Echo, echo, echo, echo, echo, echo)
Where my heart used to be, be, be (Be, be, be, be)
I got this echo (Echo, echo, echo, echo, echo, echo)
Where my heart used to be, heart used to be, be
I got this echo (Echo, echo, echo, echo, echo, echo)
Where my heart used to be, be, be (Be, be, be, be)
I got this echo (Echo, echo, echo, echo, echo, echo)
Where my heart used to be, heart used to be, be

[Verse 2: Adam Levine]
You flipped the beat 'round inside of my chest
Changin' the frequency
You had me trippin' the night that you left
Lost electricity

[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]
Novocaine
Thought I couldn't feel no pain
But it still feels like, ooh, when I hear your name
I can't escape, tryin' but I can't escape
(Let me go)

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
I got this echo (Echo, echo, echo, echo, echo, echo)
Where my heart used to be, be, be (Be, be, be, be)

Where my heart used to be, heart used to be, be
I got this echo (Echo, echo, echo, echo, echo, echo)
Where my heart used to be, be, be (Be, be, be, be)
I got this echo (Echo, echo, echo, echo, echo, echo)
Where my heart used to be, heart used to be, be

[Verse 3: blackbear]
Yeah, I got this heart-shaped hole inside of me
I try to fill with anything
Like taking trips and buying things
Burn bridges that once guided me
And I hate the way I watched you leave
My ego got the best of me
I gave you insecurities, these tears fall on my Bentley seats
And now all I feel is depressed, all that I taste is regret
I cannot tell what is real, only the pain that I feel
You give me nothing but stress and this echo (Echo, echo, echo)
You left in my chest

[Chorus: Adam Levine & blackbear]
I got this echo (Echo, echo, echo, echo, echo, echo)
Where my heart used to be, be, be (Be, be, be, be)
I got this echo (Echo, echo, echo, echo, echo, echo)
Where my heart used to be, heart used to be, be
I got this echo (Echo, echo, echo, echo, echo, echo)
Where my heart used to be, be, be (Be, be, be, be)
I got this echo (Echo, echo, echo, echo, echo, echo)
Where my heart used to be, heart used to be, be

[Chorus]
Lovesick, you know I can't fight it anymore
'Cause I love it, the way my heart drops to the floor

[Verse 1]
Baby, baby, where'd you go?
My starlight, my firefly
I've been searchin' high and low
Like all night, my whole life

[Pre-Chorus]
For someone like you to really take my breath away
And I can't be lonely, no, you gon' be the death of me

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm lovesick, you know I can't fight it anymore
'Cause I love it, the way my heart drops to the floor

[Post-Chorus]
You got me lovesick
But I love it
Yeah

[Verse 2]
Lovesick, I'm falling, I can't be trusted
If that's what you want, thеn rush in
Trust me when I say, I want this, want this

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm lovеsick, you know I can't fight it anymore
'Cause I love it, the way my heart drops to the floor

[Post-Chorus]
You got me lovesick (Yeah)
But I love it

[Pre-Chorus]
For someone like you to really take my breath away
And I can't be lonely, no, you gon' be the death of me, oh

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm lovesick, you know I can't fight it anymore (Anymore)
'Cause I love it, the way my heart drops to the floor

[Post-Chorus]
You got me lovesick (Lovesick)
You got me lovesick, lovesick
You got me lovesick, lovesick (But I love it)
You got me lovesick, lovesick

Ooh, take it from the start

Give no fucks, I never did, livin' like I never lived
That's the remedy, that's the remedy for everything

[Refrain: Adam Levine]
Sometimes, I feel out of my mind, but I'm not
Feels more like I'm out of my body
Sometimes, I'm in my own way, but I'm not

Ooh, weekend (Weekend), oh
Weekend, I'm beggin' you, love
Stay for the weekend
But if you try, weekend
But if you try, weekend
Weekend, no weak links, no weak links, no weekends
Feel like a kid after school on the weekend

[Chorus]
I've been livin' it up, try breakin' me down, I'll take it back up
They've been wonderin' where, wonderin' what, I stay in the cut
Don't wanna wait in vain, I'm turnin' the page, I'm learnin' to trust
You're my starlight and moonshine and burnin' sun
I've been livin' it up, try breakin' me down, I'll take it back up
They've been wonderin' where, wonderin' what, I stay in the cut
Don't wanna wait in vain, I'm turnin' the page, I'm learnin' to love
You're my starlight and moonshine and burnin' sun

[Verse]
You wanna leave, I won't stop ya
But you're the one I would die for
The other ones come with sad stories
You're the one I go ride for
Waitin' to fall for over two seasons
In spring, I'm sprung for the wrong reasons
Baby, forgive me for rivers that I can't stop
'Cause my heart freeze in winter
I don't wanna be a savage
Done with summertime madness
Your sunshine works magic
Never thought I would ever know what that is

[Chorus]
I've been livin' it up, try breakin' me down, I'll take it back up
They've been wonderin' where, wonderin' what, I stay in the cut
Don't wanna wait in vain, I'm turnin' the page, I'm learnin' to trust
You're my starlight and moonshine and burnin' sun
I've been livin' it up, try breakin' me down, I'll take it back up
They've been wonderin' where, wonderin' what, I stay in the cut
Don't wanna wait in vain, I'm turnin' the page, I'm learnin' to love
You're my starlight and moonshine and burnin' sun

Don't wanna wait in vain, I'm turnin' the page, I'm learnin' to trust (Yeah)
You're my starlight and moonshine and burnin' sun (Yeah, you're)
I've been livin' it up, try breakin' me down, I'll take it back up
They've been wonderin' where, wonderin' what, I stay in the cut (Oh yeah)
Don't wanna wait in vain, I'm turnin' the page, I'm learnin' to love (Wait in vain)
You're my starlight and moonshine and burnin' sun

One light, one light, one light

Long as I'm with you, then it's alright
It used to feel like life was an endless midnight
But now I got one light

[Verse 1: Adam Levine]
Here's to the brokenhearted, yeah

[Verse 1]
If you wanna roll me
Then you gotta roll me all night long
And if you wanna use me
Then you gotta use me till I'm gone

[Chorus]
I'm not a fallen angel, I just fell behind
I'm out of luck and I'm out of time
If you don't wanna love me, let me go
I'm runnin' for the last train
I'm runnin' for the last train home

[Verse 2]
If you wanna know me
Then you gotta know me through and through
(Da-da-da, da-da-da

[Intro: Lil Wayne]
Young Money!
Yeah
Four
Ahem!

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
I tell her, "Now go and pop that pussy for a real nigga!"
I already know that life is deep, but I still dig her
Niggas is jealous, but really I could care less
I'm in Hell's Kitchen with an apron and a hairnet
Devil on my shoulder, the Lord as my witness
So on my Libra scale I'm weighin' sins and forgiveness
What goes around comes around like a hula hoop
Karma is a bitch? Well, just make sure that bitch is beautiful
Life on the edge, I'm danglin' my feet
I tried to pay attention but attention paid me
Haters can't see me: nose-bleed sеats
And today I went shoppin' and talk is still cheap
I rock to the bеat of my drum set
I been at the top for a while and I ain't jump yet
But I'm Ray Charles to the bullshit
Now jump up on that dick and do a full split!

[Hook: Drake]
Uh, she just started to pop it for a nigga
And looked back and told me, "Baby, it's real."
And I say, "I ain't doubt you for a second."
I squeeze it and I could tell how it feel
I wish we could take off and go anywhere but here
Baby, you know the deal
And she bad, so maybe she won't, ugh
But shit, then again, maybe she will, yeah
Do it for the realest niggas in the fuckin' game right now
She will, yeah
Do it for the realest niggas in the fuckin' game right now
She will, she will, she will, ugh
Maybe for the money and the power and the fame right now
She will, she will, she will (Ugh)
Do it for the realest niggas in the fuckin' game right now
She will

[Interlude: Lil Wayne]
Yeah

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
I tell her, "Now go and pop that pussy for me!"
Haters can't see me, but them bitches still lookin' for me
And you could take it to the bank and deposit that
Put your two cents in and get a dollar back
Some people hang you out to dry like a towel rack
I'm all about I, give the rest of the vowels back
I like my girl thick, not just kinda fine
Eat her 'til she cry—call that "wine 'n' dine"
Try to check me and I'ma have 'em checkin' pulses
They say, "Choose wisely," that's why I was chosen
Rockin' like asphalt, it's the cash fault
Looked in the face of Death and took its mask off
Now, I like my house big and my grass soft
I like my girl face south and her ass north
But I'm Ray Charles to the bullshit
Now hop up on that dick and do a full split!

[Hook: Drake]
Uh, she just started to pop it for a nigga
And looked back and told me, "Baby, it's real."
And I say, "I ain't doubt you for a second."
I squeeze it and I could tell how it feel
I wish we could take off
And go anywhere but here, baby, you know the deal
‘Cause she bad so maybe she won't
Uh, but shit, then again, maybe she will
Do it for the realest niggas
In the fuckin' game right now, she will
Do it for the realest niggas
In the fuckin' game right now, she will
Maybe for the money and the power
And the fame right now, she will
Do it for the realest niggas
In the fuckin' game right now, she will

[Outro: Drake]
Uh, she just started to pop it for a nigga
And looked back and told me, "Baby, it's real."
And I say I ain't doubt you for a second
I squeeze it and I could tell how it feel (I feel like the sky is opening, and I'm get to it)
I wish we could take off and go anywhere but here baby you know the deal
(Feel like like the world is falling and I am rising)
'cause she bad, so maybe she won't
Uh, but shit then again maybe she will
Carter 4 Tunechi
Do it for the realest niggas in the fuckin' game right now
She will
Do it for the realest niggas in the fuckin' game right now
She will, she will, she will
Maybe for the money and the power and the fame right now
She will, she will, she will
Do it for the realest niggas in the fuckin' game right now
She will, she will, she will
I think I love her
She was tryna flex
Starting to finesse
Fucking up my cheque
Tables turned, Bridges burned
Now I'm runnin' up my cheque
Up in saks
Now I've got bout' fifty thousand on my neck
You must be crazy if you think I'm really worried by my ex

She know I'm next
She gon' give me neck
Then onto the next
She say I'm the best
Shawty come here and collect
You tried to wipe that lil' hoe
Ion even reply to her texts
Ion еven like that lil' hoe
I gеt the head, then i head

She was tryna flex
Starting to finesse
Fucking up my cheque
Tables turned, Bridges burned
Now I'm runnin' up my cheque
Up at Saks
Now I've got bout' fifty thousand on my neck
You must be crazy if you think I'm really worried by my ex
She know I'm next
She gon' give me neck
Then onto the next
She say I'm the best
Shawty come here and collect
You tried to wipe that lil' hoe
Ion even reply to her texts
Ion even like that lil' hoe
I get the head, then i head

[Verse 1]
All your life you bang, you rage
You spit it out and hit the gym
Maybe someday you'll find the thing
To make it better

[Chorus]
Better
Better
Better
Better

[Verse 2]
We can feel like you're bound by chains
You have it all but still complain
Nobody can pronounce your name
Could life been better?

[Chorus]
Better
Better
Better
Better

[Refrain: Maud Nadal]
Frail as people and innocent as lines
Between the islands rocking me to white

[Verse 1: Nicholas Allbrook]
Beethoven is really about something
I go to sleep when it gets dark
I get up with the morning light like a chicken
Let's go to lunch

[Chorus: Nicholas Allbrook]
Nothing but blue skies from now on, baby
Nothing but blue skies
Nothing but blue skies from now on
Nothing but blue skies

[Refrain: Maud Nadal]
Frail as people and innocent as lines
Between the islands rocking me to white

[Verse 2: Nicholas Allbrook]
Traces a net cradle hung from a steeple
Counting every time her fingеrs brush the grass
Behind closed еyes, where the little snowflakes dance
Her silken hair and the rocking chair

[Chorus: Nicholas Allbrook]
Nothing but blue skies from now on, baby
Nothing but blue skies, I swear
Nothing but blue skies from now on, baby
Nothing but blue skies

[Refrain: Maud Nadal]
Frail as people and innocent as lines
Between the islands rocking me to white

[Verse 3: Nicholas Allbrook]
Beethoven is really about something
Now a seething lunatic and finally can't think at all
I've jumped the ship, I've kissed goodbye
My vacant skull and my glassy eye

[Outro: Nicholas Allbrook & Maud Nadal]
Nothing but blue skies
Happiness is being on the beam with life
Nothing but blue skies
Catching joy like a butterfly (Lines, lines)
Innocent as lines (Lines, lines)
Lines (Lines, lines)
Lines (Lines, lines)
Oh, lines (Lines, lines)
(Lines, lines)

[Verse 1]
She was talking at the speed of ice
As I emptied the organic waste
She was jacking a car, but she seemed quite nice
So I let her use the toilet in my place
I need the Daily Mail to get off of my street
But they're turning grey and they need red meat
Wasting away, gaunt and sallow
But they can't be drowned 'cause they're too damn shallow

[Pre-Chorus]
I need some human connection
I need some human touch
Been behind these screens so long
I'm leading with my crotch (Woo)
I need some human connection
If you're not too busy
I've been looking around so long
I'm getting dizzy, dizzy, dizzy and I need

[Chorus]
Static
I need static
Ecstatic
I wanna be static, static, static
Ecstatic

[Verse 2]
Like a wounded animal
You try to scream, but you just wanna sin
You're jolted awake with cum in your jeans
And a silent silver morning in a Comfort Inn
She was holding the spark plugs, making fire
I was watering my girlfriend's plants
Off her fucking face, but not a liar
She ripped out the glass with her bare hands

[Pre-Chorus]
I need some human connection
If you're not too busy
I've been looking around so long
I'm getting dizzy, dizzy, dizzy and I need

[Chorus]
Static
I need static
Ecstatic
I wanna be static, static, static
Ecstatic

[Verse 1]
Winnie Pooh lying with his legs in the air
Impotent, saying, "Those were the days
I was young and hungered for flesh like a bear"
An outgrown toy on a turning display out of sight
Yeah, out of sight
An overgrown boy watching his day turn very, very slowly to night
Yeah

[Verse 2]
On the first day of spring, they danced in the clover
Collapsing with a grin, saying, "Thank God it's over"
Staring, red-cheeked, to the white cliffs of Dover in the sun
And it's begun

[Chorus]
Saying, "Take me, Avalon, I'm young"
Take me, Avalon, I'm young
Avalon, I'm young

[Verse 3]
Drunk stupid on moonlight, I wanna be quarantined
A twentieth-century sprite stalking the moors with greasy jeans
I don't wanna see your Lindy Hop
All across these blood-slicked eaves
We're here to finger God
With dirty dreams and they're done dirt cheap, yeah

[Bridge]
Here's looking at Euclid
I really thought I was being funny
I was steaming, I was Cupid
Life was Cher when life was sunny

[Chorus]
Better take me, Avalon, 'cause I'm young
Take me, Avalon, I'm young
Said, take me, Avalon, I'm young

[Verse 1]
Sweet Dana and the Czech Locomotive
The locomotive with pistons of steam
Throwing Cupid's arrows at each other across the frozen park
After sentry duty in the dark
Stuck on the asphalt with the team
All Dana could do was cry
The StB won't silence the dream
If Standa's not coming, then neither will I

[Verse 2]
Can we still run under the freezing shadow of a thirty-metre Stalin?
His face twisted, hurting
He burst through the Iron Curtain
With Dana on his back, with a quiver of darts
Steaming and dreaming all across the frozen park

[Verse 3]
In war and peace and frozen weather
Put your fingertips and your thumb together
Put your lover on your back and run into the night
And forget about the burning trees in the East
And forests in the West, and blackened sky
And sun like a, sun like a, sun like a bloodshot eye up there
And we're right here, happy New Year
Too bad it's covered in smoke

[Chorus]
Sweet Dana and the Czech Locomotive
Sweet Dana and the Czech Locomotive
Sweet Dana and the Czech Locomotive
Sweet Dana and the Czech Locomotive
Sweet Dana and the Czech Locomotive
Sweet Dana and the Czech Locomotive
Sweet Dana and the Czech Locomotive
Sweet Dana and the Czech Locomotive

[Verse 4]
Can we still run under the freezing shadow of a thirty-metre Stalin?
His face twisted, hurting
He burst through the Iron Curtain
With Dana on his back, with a quiver of darts
Steaming and dreaming all across the frozen park

[Verse 1: Nicholas Allbrook]
If you're a poet, then I'm happy as a fraud
But you really know it, you're so well-informed
But your ancient precedent has got me so damn bored
I'm happy to be basic, right now, that's all I can afford
And she said, "I don't know about you
But Europe has a long artistic legacy
And if you can't see the problem with that
Then honestly, your poetry's no good to me"

[Chorus: Nicholas Allbrook]
I should run and hide
Or die in the generational divide

[Verse 2: Nicholas Allbrook]
I've never read Rambo, I'm terrified of guns
And if ignorance is sexy, then I've got to run (Run, run)
Was I born too late for the golden days of my nanny statе?
We never criеd on my side of the generational divide

[Chorus: Nicholas Allbrook]
I should run and hide
Or die in the generational divide
I don't know why we never cried
On my side of the generational divide

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus: Nicholas Allbrook]
I should run and hide
Or die in the generational divide
I don't know why we never cried
On my side of the generational divide

[Verse 3: Jay Watson & Shiny Joe Ryan]
Looking up, I thought I had a friend
Praying that the moment wouldn't end then
Somebody is laughing with me, right?
Counting down the moments 'til my hair turns white

[Outro: Nicholas Allbrook, Jay Watson & Shiny Joe Ryan]
If you're a poet, then I'm happy as a fraud
(Looking up, I thought I had a friend)
But you really know it, you're so well-informed
(Praying that the moment wouldn't end then)
But your ancient precedent has got me so damn bored
(Somebody is laughing with me, right?)
I'm happy to be basic, right now, that's all I can afford
(Counting down the moments 'til my hair turns white)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, ooh

[Verse 1]
Gold cup, plastic sole
What toxic rot and tragedy
Bubbles in your factory alone
Gold cup, plastic sole
I, a lowly chorus
Lionising the Ramones
But now, even little Pan here's getting old
Fill my plastic sole

[Chorus]
Gold cup, plastic sole
The olive tree laps the steppe as winter’s fingers fold
Fill my cup, melt my sole
If you could melt my sole

[Verse 2]
A water sprite of desert skin
A Cheshire Cat, an open door, a hot northern wind
A perfect plum rolling six feet 'pon dusty road
Rolling to my plastic sole
The goats' bells twinkle, twinkle, twinkle up thе glen
They pirouettе as water’s very, very slow friend
And faintly sing the Stones
Fill my plastic sole
Sing my plastic sole
Ooh

[Chorus]
Gold cup, plastic sole
The olive tree laps the steppe as winter's fingers fold
Fill my cup, melt my sole
You could melt my sole

[Verse 1]
Glasses chink
We applaud the setting sun
Bloated with champagne
We assumed we'd see another one
If the water dries
Like the morning dew
Life's too short
To be away from you

[Chorus]
Toast
I'm toast
Let's toast

[Verse 2]
Sat upon Cable Beach
Cheeks like a robin's breast
With four horsemen shod with flames in the west
And all I can give is all that I've got
I'm sorry, but it's true
Life's too short
To be away from you

[Chorus]
Toast
I'm toast
Toast
Just can’t get it together now without you baby
Oh I just can’t reach to heaven without you yeah

Oh how can I miss your kissing night and days
Oh tell me baby
All I thought I had to do was get off and run baby run
How can I? How come a feeling’s feelin’ no desire tell me baby
All all I had to do was find somebody oh a little sweeter than you

But I just can’t get it together baby without you yeah
Oh I just can’t reach to heaven now no no no no without you yeah

Oh how can I miss your kisses night and days tell me baby
All I thought I had to do was get off and run baby run

Girls, beware of the bandit from Westchester County
I can't offer you no reward, 'cause all he left me was a broken heart
He kidnapped me excitingly, and then he robbed me off my dignity
And when enough of his time had been spent, he left me
(Sha-la-la-la, la...) moaning... (Sha-la-la-la, la...) Yeah
He left me (Sha-la-la-la, la...) moan, moaning... (Sha-la-la-la, la...) Yes, he did... hey

Be careful, my sisters, yeah - he's armed with an innocent smile
With a dangerous love record that can stretch for miles and miles
Hey, girls! Take a hint - he don't leave no fingerprints
And if he gets his hands on you, he's gonna leave you
(Sha-la-la-la, la...) Wanting... (Sha-la-la-la, la...) Yes, he will
And he'll leave you... (Sha-la-la-la, la...) moan, moaning... (Sha-la-la-la, la...) Oh, yeah... yeah

Any female information concernin' this bandit person
He may be sitting right next to you, and Westchester County is right there too
Hey, girls! I've got a confession to make if they put that bandit in jail
I'll be the first one to go on his bail
He left me (Sha-la-la-la, la...) Wanting, oh, yeah... (Sha-la-la-la, la...) I'm a wanted woman this evening
He left me (Sha-la-la-la, la...) wanting, oh, yeah... (Sha-la-la-la, la...) Sha-la bandit, yeah, it's all about his

I can see no reason why you wanna leave, baby
Well I don't beg but I'm begging you, pin me oh baby
If I left you now you wouldn't dig by the door
Put them clothes back in the closet baby
Hold on would you do it?
I'm gonna lay my cards on the table
I can't win this hand I ain't able
You know why?

Cause you got all the aces in the deck baby
And I can't let you quit me not yet, no honey
You got all the aces in the deck baby, yes you do
I can't let you quit me not yet, no baby

I told you I'll love you always
Rainy shiny stormy weather cloudy days
And I ain't go back all my words Lord I swear
If you walk out the door now just wouldn't be fair no
If you leave me now I'm a loosеr
Play just one more hand I demand
You know why
Causе you got all the aces in the deck baby
And I can't let you leave me not yet, no honey
You got all the aces in the deck sugar, yes you do
And I can't let you leave me not yet, no baby

You got all the aces in the deck baby
And I can't let you leave me not yet, no honey
You got all the aces in the deck sugar, yes you do
And I can't let you leave me not yet, no baby

You got all the aces in the deck baby
And I can't let you quit me not yet, no honey
You got all the aces in the deck sugar
And I can't let you leave me not yet, no baby

[Snippet]

Funny how life is turning out
I don't have much to talk about
Don’t have much to write about
Got a shitload to cry about
Funny the words I do kick
Funny the niggas I do pick
It’s funny what sticks
(Go figure)
Mama said I’m sensitive
I gotta work on that
Not really
Tired of using adjectives, I gotta build on that
You feel me?
Not really

Young man, tryna hold the world in a broken hand, hand
Young man, tryna find the world in a broken hand

[Verse: Tory Lanez]
Yeah, right off the bat I need y'all to flex
All of this stuntin' look good for my ex
All of these zeroes look good on my checks
I got like 2 or 3 phones for business and bitches and still can't even answer a text (Texts)
Yeah, we in the spot, we won't give it a rest
They keep saying they niggas gonna catch up to your nigga, they ain't caught up to me yet (Yet)
I hit the Rolls, I look like the mayor
Counting up 50s and 20s and 10s
I'm 'bout to save and get me get me a Benz (Benz)
Ballin' again and again and again and again and again
Ballin' again and again and again and again and again
Y'all wasn't planning it, bitch, I'm the man again
Walk out of Louis and look like a mannequin
All the store management wanna know how much I spent, I spent
Yeah, I don't fuck with her, she feisty
Know that the niggas that's with me are shiesty
This is the reason these niggas don't like me, yeah
I got her wet, I gotta hit from the back when it's pricey
I gotta fly on the tropics it's icy
She wanna fuck with an R&B singer, I hit her, I duck her, I send her to Nyce B
I'm on a roll like the motherfuckin' dice be
I'm catchin' pussy like I'm Jerry Rice
I'm catchin' pussy like it was a flight
I'm in your city, what's up for the night?

[Bridge: Tory Lanez]
I, I had like too much to drink

Ex calling up my phone fucking up the vibe

So all my ladies, say, "Hey, hey, hey, daddy" That's it right there
Hey, hey, hey, daddy {Ted Smooth, straight face, you remember!} Haha

[Verse 1: Jadakiss]
Hard day on the job bank account heavy
Please have a remote and my flip flops ready
3 course dinner followed by SportsCentеr
After the games go off I'm all in hеr
She feel it in her stomach she feelin' like a woman
I'm bringin home the baking and I'm doin the plumbin'
I'm multitaskin' chrome or plastic
Either way daddy is back home ya bastards
What!

[Verse 2: Usher Jadakiss]
I just wanna get your attention Haha! I see you peepin my style!
I really wanna be all up in your head (turn the lights on) Straight face, you remember Kiss and Tedsmooth
'Cause what I got, you going to get some
But girl, that's only if you ain't scared

[Bridge: Usher (Eric. B sample)]
And I won't knock, won't ring no bells (I said it before)
You just float that bottom up in the air
I'll get you hot, I know you oh so well
And when I walk in, all that I wanna hear

[Chorus: Usher & Ladies]
Is you say, "Daddy's home, home for me"
And I know you've been waiting for this loving all day
You know your daddy's home and it's time to play
(Daddy's home, so it's time to play)
So you ain't got to give my loving away
So all my ladies, say, "Hey, hey, hey, daddy"
Hey, hey, hey, daddy
So all my ladies, say, "Hey, hey, hey, daddy"
Hey, hey, hey, daddy
(Hey, south side)

[Verse 3: Usher]
I ain't gotta do a lot of flexing
Shorty, you already know what it is, yeah
And girl, tonight we gonna do a lot of sexing, yeah
Can't nobody do your body like this

[Bridge: Usher]
Oh, I won't knock, won't ring no bells
You just float that bottom up in the air
Said I'll get you hot, I know you oh so well
And when I walk in, all that I wanna hear
Oh, Is you say, "Daddy's home"

[Verse 4: Jadakiss]
Haha
2 hours straight wearin her out
Old robe on lookin' like the man of the house
Stacks on deck it's nothin' I'm handin' them out
Cause if I ain't stoppin' the banks then I'm airin' them out
Got the clubs in a frenzy, jealous thugs envy
Rub it in on em and make love on the benjis
Neighbors know my name cause I make the bed move
Straight face, you remember Kiss and Tedsmooth
Now all my ladies say

[Chorus: Usher & Ladies]
Hey, daddy
Hey, hey, hey, daddy

So all my ladies, say, "Hey, hey, hey, daddy"

Poke it on out, poke it out right there

Do your damn thing, let the neighbors hear
Hey, hey, hey, daddy
Poke it on out, poke it out right there
I'ma fall back while you work that chair
Do your damn thing, let the neighbors hear
Hey, hey, hey, daddy

[Intro]
Yeah
Damn, man this is what it's come to, mmm
Shit, ain't it fucked up?
This is what it's come to
Damn, damn
Man, I guess this is what it's come to
Shit, huh, huh

[Verse 1]
In the fire, I reside like the money do
Niggas'll try wearin' wires at the rendezvous
Don't nothin' kill niggas like needin' money do
For nothin', peel niggas, you sweet as honey dew
Ain't never been ashamed to look off in the mirror
At all my fears and imperfections, made 'em disappear, huh
People weird, be projectin' all they insecurities
Whatever thеy said he did he did that shit, I'm fuckin' sure of it, hеy
Behind the foreign cars, clothes, and expensive jewelry
I got a heart made of gold, motive be the purest
And they say hell have no fury like a woman's scorn
Fuck that, I'm crankin' up the jury, who you lyin' on shawty?
Extortion, is that what you got your mind on, shawty?
Tell 'em, "Get it how you live, shawty, I ain't goin' for it"
I'ma take it all away, every day of the week
Bet you thought this shit was sweet and I would pay in a week
And you could take this shit or leave it, I'm just sayin' my piece
Best look at all the traffic when you play in the street
Go put your face and reputation on it
These kinda claims deserve more than anonymous provocative conversations, don't it?
They say let's hit him with the one-two
You see how many other niggas this been done to?
Speak for the people, all you did, we can undo
Welcome to the COINTEL-PRO Part Two
Damn, this is what it's come to?

[Chorus]
Yeah
Damn, man this is what it's come to?
Mmm, shit
Ain't it fucked up? This is what it's come to
Damn, man, ayy, ayy-ayy
Man, I guess this is what it's come to
Haha, shit
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha

[Verse 2]
Okay
Yachts on the Atlantic, please, let's not misunderstand it
I keep none against they will, if they leave, that's they disadvantage
Bitch, I'm above and beyond, Libra scales to set my key on
Heebie Jeebie, be gone and see all the bullshit she on
Approach me with that hoe shit, high step on that hoe like Deion
I see chivalry and misogyny is quite adjacent obviously
The object of the game is kill the king
So 'til the blade meet my neck on the guillotine
But I'ma be standin' tall like a statue (Huh)
Nigga fuck that, "He say, she say"
If the receipts, say that shit ain't factual
I was built for all this shit, God sent me here with a mission
That's somethin' can't let no human or no demon interfere with
In your feelings, can't conceal it, broke your spirit tryna heal it
That's the real Atlanta
Lot of rich white folks up in Buckhead wanna steal Atlanta
Kill and destroy everything that feel Atlanta
Fuck that, I'm still Atlanta
Since Meech was puttin' up billboards, facin' double bodies
And 12 was askin' me about him, but I stayed solid
They bust my house and found a gun, I was on probation
All 'cause I wouldn't participate in they investigation
I went to jail for a year, height of my career
But by the time I made it home, he got his case thrown out
Told him then, "Maybe you should chill"
He said, "Listen Tip, if ballin' why they want me
I'ma be ballin' 'til they get me"
Had to digest what he said, let it sit a minute
Had to respect it, shit, like it or not at least he committed
Willing to face whatever consequences for his vision
While I'm up against some lyin' ass bitches
Damn, this is what it's come to

[Chorus]
Yeah
Damn, man, this is what it's come to, mmm
Ain't it fucked up? This is what it's come to
Ayy, damn
Man, I guess this is what it's come to
Shit

What do you mean?
You can't possibly be meaning the words that come out of your mouth
You wanna go home, but I just wanna have fun
You say that you're tired and want me to calm down
I was shy at first, but they welcomed me
There's way too many reasons to stay here
Just 'cause you want to, I don't think that it's fair
I'm putting my foot down, I'm staying here

[Chorus]
I don't wanna go home, I'm fine right here, leave me alone
'Cause I just wanna dance and be in the zone, eat some candy
Just leave me alone

[Verse 2]
Are you sеrious now?
Are you leaving now?
The truth is that I don't wanna stay without you
And if wе go, we'll miss it all
I'm sleepy too, I promise this will be worth it
It's getting late, but I'm not nearly done
I miss my bed, let's hang out, come on
(Are you really sure you don't wanna come with us?)
Yeah

[Chorus]
I don't wanna go home, I'm fine right here, leave me alone
'Cause I just wanna dance and be in the zone, eat some candy
Just leave me alone, 'cause I just wanna

Wild, boy, wild

I just pray that you don't do me like the other ones did (Oh-oh)

[Pre-Chorus]

[ Verse 3] You know Out of anyone that its hard for me to show my love

[Chorus: Sean Kingston]
I've been thinking 'bout my darkest days
Remember all the times we had away
I'm so scarred, you can see it in my face, oh-oh
Oh, I don't know why I'm holdin' on, holdin' on
Oh, I don't know why I'm holdin' on, holdin' on
Oh I, need you in my darkest times
Oh-woah, oh, I, know I won't let time go by

[Verse 1: Sean Kingston]
Sometimes we  walk through the rain, ah (Rain)
Can't feel no pain, ah (Pain)
Took a couple years of my life, to run a check, ah
What did you face, ah? Demons in my way, ah
Did it but I had to fight with no favor
When I was sixteen that's when I buss down straight VVs
Now this shit so crazy, I say, "Look, ma', we on TV"
Let me tell you what it is, I just hope you niggas feel me (Yeah)
And let me know if it's a problem 'cause we late-night creepin'
Nothin' you could tell us
Grew up in the struggle, that's what turned us in to some fellas (Hey)
And we shoot it all off
Get you an umbrella, someone is smokin' that air, dawg
Need a Sunday hella
Fly like propeller
Lambo doors turn into butterfly (Hey)
Too much money on me, I throw it in the sky
But I can't fuck with too many niggas 'cause they switchin' sides
So many of my niggas dyin', it left me terrified

[Chorus: Sean Kingston]
I've been thinking 'bout my darkest days
Remember all the times we had away
I'm so scarred, you can see it in my face, oh-oh
Oh, I don't know why I'm holdin' on, holdin' on
Oh, I don't know why I'm holdin' on, holdin' on
Oh I, need you in my darkest times
Oh-woah, oh, I, know I won't let time go by

[Verse 2: G Herbo]
I can't love you if you go away (I can't love you if you go)
You know what I'm goin' through, I know you wanna stay (I know)
Nigga tryna duck the past like a runaway
Faithful but I finger fuck the cash, every other day
I know bitches loyal to the bag (What?)
I know you'll be down, if I get down to my last (What?)
Real street nigga, got a lick for all of that (Got a lick for all of that)
Havin' M's, don't know what it took for all of that (What it took for all of that)
Thug love, I can write a book on all of that, girl (I swear)
Still a street nigga, got the hood on my back, girl (Hood on my back)
I don't like change, I be good where I'm at, girl (I be good where I'm at)
Tap into my heart, knew I could when I rap, girl
Jump into the car, with some stars, see the stars (Stars)
Look into the future, ain't no good lookin' back
Backwoods in the 'Raq
Chillin' with a real nigga, know you could get a Tesla
Day ones, Draco, wood on my lap, yeah

[Chorus: Sean Kingston]
I've been thinking 'bout my darkest days
Remember all the times we had away
I'm so scarred, you can see it in my face, oh-oh
Oh, I don't know why I'm holdin' on, holdin' on
Oh, I don't know why I'm holdin' on, holdin' on
Oh I, need you in my darkest times
Oh-woah, oh, I, know I won't let time go by

[Intro]
Are you still thirsty or would you rather have the water?
C'mon
Yeah, ooh

[Verse 1]
Come and take my coffee, we gonna have one, not seven cups
And then two packs of cigarettes a day, two packs too much
Open up your window, cuss the whole world, if you please
When the day comes no-one listens, get down on your knees

[Chorus]
Pray, the voice inside, it don't stop
Pray, the reason to be, don't stop
Listen to what it say and picture one more day
Live a different way 'cause it's your play, it's your play
Yeah, ooh

[Verse 2]
Listеn
Don't take my word about it, my rap is cut and dry
I'll walk a thousand crooked roads while standing on thе line
Yes, some people love to cry, I never close my eyes
Never have I stopped listening to the voice inside

[Chorus]
Pray, the voice inside, it don't stop
Pray, the reason to be, don't stop
Talk and listen to what it say and picture every day
Live a different way, it's your play, it's your play
Oh, it's my play now
Yeah, ooh
Say it

[Bridge 1]
Maybe we'd all be better off listening to the voice inside
We listen to the voice inside

[Verse 3]
Take another piece of candy, have a hundred if you like
Just don't cry, but wait and I'll free this bike
Just don't you cry, just don't you cry
Get on your knees and pray to the voice inside

[Chorus]
Pray, the voice inside, it don't stop
Pray, the reason to be, don't stop
Listen to what it say and picture one more day

[Bridge 2]
Then we could all just listen unto the voice inside, the good
Will not be evil when we could all take this mother higher, higher, higher, yeah!
The voice inside
The voice inside
Now come on!
Shout it out, the voice inside!
Shout it out, the voice inside!
Shout it out, the voice inside!
Shout it out, the voice inside!
I got to
The voice inside
The voice inside (Shout it out now)
Oh yeah

[Outro]
Thirsty?
Chill out
Thirsty, thirsty
Get on your knees
Pray it don't stop
Get on your knees
Pray it don't stop, pray it don't stop

[Intro: Lil Yachty & YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
Uh-huh
With some bad bitches, Yeah
Uh-huhhh, huh, oh

[Chorus: Lil Yachty & YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
Sunset Boulevard,  with some bad bitches  (Uh-huh)
Several foreign cars,  overseas engines
I told my momma I’m a star,  she happy I did it (I did it)
She always believed in me,  when nobody didn’t

[Verse 1: Lil Yachty & YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
I went and chased my dreams, momma look what I achieved (Uh-huh)
I got down on my knees, thank the Lord for everything
I’m chasing money, feed my hungry, that’s by any means
These niggas dissin’, but it’s funny, they ain’t shit to me  (Glaw)
I’m a big Bentley owner and a bank breaker
Shit talker, money walkеr and a shit starter
I came from nothing, now I ball like I’m Vincе Carter (Swish)
Talkin’ shit, on my soul, imma fuck yo’ daughter

[Chorus: Lil Yachty & YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
I'm on Sunset Boulevard,  with some bad bitches  (Uh-huh)
Several foreign cars,  overseas engines
I told my momma I’m a star,  she happy I did it
She always believed in me,  when nobody didn’t

[Verse 2: Desiigner]
Ha, I’m on Sunset boulevard, boulevard, everybody workin’ hard (Glaw)
Drivin’ round’ like it’s a job
I’m pourin’ ACT over bad bitches
I’m in the trap, got my cats with me
Niggas pull up, got my mask with me
AK pull up and it blast fitted’s
I don’t know nothin’ but stack with me
I got the party and dance with me
I got the molly stash with me
I got the trap with the real niggas
I’m in the back with the feel niggas
I’m on Sunset Boulevard, livin’ life, I ain’t livin’ hard
This is the life, I swear to God (Skrt)
I’m in the trap with some real niggas

[Chorus: Lil Yachty & YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
I'm on Sunset Boulevard,  with some bad bitches
Several foreign cars,  overseas engines
I told my momma I’m a star,  she happy I did it
She always believed in me,  when nobody didn’t

[Outro: Lil Yachty]
Woooo
Woo, Woooo
Woooo

[Verse]
Oh I can't stop myself
From thinking of all the way things had to go
She said "is something wrong?"
Then I bent my neck and rubbed the aches out and took my (?)

[Pre-Chorus]
It’s calling me (it's calling to me)
My diary from the days I once belonged
She's calling me (she’s calling to me)
I call her B, you know I think that I'm in love

[Chorus]
And now with other friends
That up and left
There's nothing loyal like them
Kicking it with best friend clover
Looking over your shoulder

[Verse]
No, I can't help myself
From messing up, ain't time for me to fold
And if only I could darn my socks I
Wouldn't stitch a hole from the nights dancing alone

[Pre-Chorus]
It's calling me (it's calling to me)
My driver’s seat where to go when nowhere to belong
She’s calling me (she's calling to me)
B, you know I think that I’m in love

[Chorus]
Now with other friends
I haven't met
There's nothing loyal like them
Kicking it with best friend clover
Looking over your shoulder

And now with other friends
That up and left
There's nothing loyal like that girl
Kicking it with best friend clover
Looking over your shoulder

[Chorus: Nick Jonas & Joe Jonas]
Used to pray for a moment just like this
There's a fire in your eyes I can't resist
Baby, we're gonna wanna remember this
Baby, we're gonna wanna remember this
I can taste the forever on your lips
There's a lifetime livin' inside that kiss
Baby, we're gonna wanna remember this
Baby, we're gonna wanna remember this

[Verse 1: Nick Jonas]
We ain't gettin' any younger, to be honеst, I don't care
I'm not tryna live forevеr, I'm just tryna be right here

This I know, mmm

Just one more dance
Two more drinks
It'll go by fast

[Pre-Chorus: Nick Jonas]
Just one more dance
Two more drinks
It'll go by fast

[Intro: Drake & Charlotte Day Wilson]
I don't understand why you blame me
Just take me as I am, it's the same me
We should be (Yeah)
Senseless sight to see
Yeah
Senseless sight to see
Ayy

[Verse 1: Drake]
Feelin' young but they treat me like the OG
And they want the tea on me, I swear these bitches nosey
Said he put some money on my head, I guess we gon' see
I won't put no money on his head, my niggas owe me
I gotta be single for a while, you can't control me
Uno, dos, tres, in a race, they can't hold me
And I show my face in a case so you know it's me
Imitation isn't flattery, it's just annoyin' me
And I'm too about it
And the dirt that they threw on my name
Turned to soil and I grew up out it
Time for y'all to figure out what y'all gon' do about it
Big wheels keep rollin', rollin'

[Chorus: Drake]
I'm outside, twenty-nine, G5, seaside
I've been losin' friends and findin' peace
But honestly that sound like a fair trade to me
If I ever hurt one and I'm still here
Outside, frontline, Southside
I've been losin' friends and findin' peace
Honestly that sound like a fair trade to me

[Verse 2: Drake]
Look, don't invite me over if you throw another pity party
Lookin' back, it's hard to tell you where I started
I don't know who love me, but I know that it ain't everybody
I can never love her, she a busy body
Baby, if you want me, can't be turnin' up with everybody, nah
Can't be fuckin' on just anybody, yeah
I got feelings for you, that's the thing about it, yeah
You know that it's somethin' when I sing about it, yeah
Mama used to be on disability but gave me this ability
And now she walkin' with her head high and her back straight
I don't think you feelin' me, I'm out here
Bein' everything they said I wouldn't be and couldn't be
I don't know what happened to them guys that said they would be
I said see you at the top and they misunderstood me
I hold no resentment in my heart, that's that maturity
And we don't keep it on us anymore, it's with security

[Chorus: Drake, Travis Scott, Both]
I'm outside (Yeah), twenty-nine (Yeah), G5, seaside
I've been losin' friends and findin' peace
But honestly that sound like a fair trade to me
If I ever hurt one and I'm still here
Outside, frontline, Southside (Southside)
I've been losin' friends and findin' peace
Honestly that sound like a fair trade to me

[Bridge: Travis Scott & Charlotte Day Wilson]
I don't understand why you blame me
Just take me as I am, it's the same me (I'm trying)
Senseless sight to see
Senseless sight to see (Outside)

[Verse 3: Travis Scott]
Rollin' 84s, it ain't no safety
Ridin' rich and wavy
Gotta roll over to you, gotta get my release
Spread your legs downtown, as I'm goin' out to eat
Even hear the raw sounds when that raw got me in sleep (Oh, oh)
I'ma roll on 'em 'fore I ever let 'em roll on me
Split this one down the middle, wake up in the harmony (Sick)
Worry, sick, I'm sick of worryin' (Sick, sick)
It's just the world we in, I'd rather bury them
I'm talkin' fake friends and skeletons (Yeah)
Early-mornin' shoulder rubs, the lawyer sounding celebrant (It's lit)
I'm never settlin', this shit get darker than my melanin (Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh)
At the crib all by myself, this shit be cavin' in
Scrollin' through my call log, by emojis, how I'm savin' 'em
Them heart eyes, that peach one, my old ones, but I favorite them
That butterfly emoji hold me down and all my babies them (Yeah)
Purple demon face one push away, he got the K on him
I broke bread instead of watchin' niggas break down (Break it)
And saved a couple bitches too like I'm from Cape Town
Know their position, you know ass up with the face down (Let's go)
I'm never content, two mil' a event, I get it frequent
I'm make an expense, to me, it's just cents
I'm droppin' the top, not to feel the wind
I'm droppin' the top 'cause bro tryna spin
She droppin' her top, she back again
Publicly she at the crib again, company (Yeah, yeah)
I let it slide when I really shoulda slid (Oooh, ooh)
After all the shit I did
Look at how they repayin' me back (Oh, oh-oh, oh)
Now follow my lead
Tell me what type of payment is that? (Oh, oh-oh), I put that on my kid
And my trust, yeah, it is what it is (Oh, oh)

[Chorus: Drake, Travis Scott, Both]
I'm outside (Ah-ah, ah-ah), twenty-nine, G5 (Ah-ah, ah-ah), seaside
I've been losin' friends and findin' peace (Ah-ah, ah)
But honestly that sound like a fair trade to me
If I ever hurt one and I'm still here
Outside, frontline, Southside (Southside)
I've been losin' friends and findin' peace (Oh, oh)
Honestly that sound like a fair trade to me

[Outro: Charlotte Day Wilson]
I don't understand why you blame me
Just take me as I am, it's the same me
We should be, senseless sight to see
Senseless sight to see
Up on a mountain (Up on a mountain)
Search through the valley (Search through the valley)
You hear me calling (You hear me calling)
Won't you come find me? (Won't you come find me?)
Please don't forsake me (Please don't forsake me)
All of a sudden (All of a sudden)
My heart is breaking (Breaking)
I feel it coming, I, I

Where there's a will, there's a way, kinda beautiful
And every night has its day, so magical
And if there's love in this life, there's no obstacle
That can't be defeated
For every tyrant a tear for the vulnerable
In every lost soul the bones of a miracle
For every dreamer a dream we're unstoppable
With something to believе in


Monday left me broken
Tuеsday I was through with hopin'
Wednesday my empty arms were open
Thursday waiting for love, waiting for love
Thank the stars it's Friday
I'm burning like a fire gone wild on Saturday
Guess I won't be coming to church on Sunday
I'll be waiting for love
Waiting for love to come around


We are one of a kind, irreplaceable
How did I get so blind and so cynical?
If there's love in this life we're unstoppable
No, we can't be defeated


Monday left me broken
Tuesday I was through with hopin'
Wednesday my empty arms were open
Thursday waiting for love, waiting for love
Thank the stars it's Friday
I'm burning like a fire gone wild on Saturday
Guess I won't be coming to church on Sunday
I'll be waiting for love
Waiting for love to come around
(Come around)

[Intro]
And I try to guide my eye to you
Tonight you and I could do more than we do
I don't care, I wanna go right there
Tonight I swear, your mine, your mine and I'm

[Verse: 1]
And I'm faded
So drunk I might need a facelift
And I got bottles in my bag that I'm facing
Girl I've gotta hit you up, I'm not waiting
And I really try to feel fine but I don't though
I got a place in my mind where I don't go
I really try to feel fine but I don't though
I've gotta battle emotions, I know it doesn't show

[Bridge]
And when time hits 3AM
I'm like shit, I'm sad again
Shit I'm sad again
Shit I'm sad again

[Chorus]
And I try to guide my eye to you
Tonight you and I could do more than we do
And I try to guide my eye to you

I don't care, I wanna go right therе
Tonight I swear, your mine, your mine and I'm

Posted in the back of the party

That's why we all fucked up here
Took another shot, now I'm on it

[Verse 1: Lady Gaga]
Am I still alive? Where am I? I cry
Who was it that pulled the trigger, was it you or I?
I'm completely numb, why you actin' dumb?
I won't blame myself 'cause we both know you were the one

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
I don't know what to do, you don't know what to say
The scars on my mind are on replay, r-replay

Replay, r-replay, eh-eh

[Verse 2: Dorian Electra]
Every single day, yeah, I dig a grave
Then I sit inside it, wondering if I'll behave
It's a game I play, and I hate to say
You're the worst thing and the best thing that's happened to me
These demons, these demons, I must slay, I must slay
Never stop like a song playing and I can't escape
On rewind, on repeat, incessant, all day
Spinnin' it like you're a DJ, torture me on replay

[Chorus: Dorian Electra]
I don't know what to do, you don't know what to say
The scars on my mind are on replay, re-replay
The monster inside you is torturing me

[Bridge: Dorian Electra, Lady Gaga & Both]
Psychologically, it's somethin' that I can't explain
Scratch my nails into the dirt to pull me out okay
Does it matter, does it matter? Damage is done
Does it matter, does it matter? You had the gun
You had the gun
You had the gun
You had the gun

[Chorus: Lady Gaga & Dorian Electra]
I don't know what to do, you don't know what to say
The scars on my mind are on replay, r-replay

But when it’s time to get the fuckin’ mula, he clean up, pristine, oh, aye

[Outro]
Frrd, slatt, aye

[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract]
Yeah, I can't sleep like I used to
The world will try to tell you who you are before you get to
Explain yourself, your thoughts
Your motives and all of your reasons
Two albums every season, what the hell do y'all believe in?
Why the hell do y'all keep reachin'?
In the evenings when I see 'em
I tell myself that love will be the thing to keep us from grieving
Need something new to believe in
'Cause these new niggas'll change on you
I mean they change on you
Why the hell did BBC only write about me
When it comes down to controversy?
What about three CD's in one year with no label?
Then we signed and our story turned into a fucking fable
I was that nigga in a room
With no motherfuckin' cable and no table
Now my mom call me whenever she need her car note
Cellphone, whatever bill paid too, y'all niggas losers
You don't understand why I do what I do, so let me do it
Get the hell on, let me do it, get the hell on, let me do it

[Refrain 1: Kevin Abstract]
You don't understand why I can't get up and shout
I keep tellin' ya
You don't understand why I can't get up and shout

[Bridge: Merlyn Wood]
Stay rough, get buff, get out, hey, boy
Stay rough, get buff, get out
The monsters swarm 'round with them toys
The monsters swarm 'round with them toys
Hey, boy, stay rough, get buff, get out
Hey, boy, stay rough, get buff, get out
The monsters swarm 'round with them toys
The monsters swarm 'round with them toys

[Verse 2: Matt Champion, (Joba)]
I been so pissed off, I can't even think straight
Weight hefty on the shoulders, forget the accolades
Two face (Masquerade)
Foreplay (Found a way)
Face switch, rorschach, got different personalities
I been off the grid lately, I been planning trips with Tavi'
I been feeling insane, the roof need some ventilation
'Body need a celebration, got a cup high up
There's a toast for your pussy ass

[Refrain 2: Matt Champion]
I don't really care cause I'm living my life
Fuck your opinion, I'mma do what I like
If you love me then just love me, no games played tonight
So the color on her neck, it look like a lightbrite
I don't really care cause I'm living my life
Fuck your opinion, imma do what I like
If you love me then just love me, no games played tonight
So the color on her neck, it look like a lightbrite

[Verse 3: Joba]
I'm used to feeling good as dead
I'm used to needing, a helping hand
I'm used to, feeling, useless man
I used to, wanna, be a garbage man
Somebody different and, I still feel out of place
It's like I'm god's mistake, if he even exists
I can't tell these days, I wish I could cause then I'd pray
Maybe I'll find some relief, Maybe I'll find a way to break free
From all the fucked up parts of me
That they don't see, but they tryna see
I can hardly breathe, it's too much for me
I'm too much for me, when will it end
I don't even know where to begin

[Outro: Joba]
Don't mind me, I'm just killin' time (You can pick me to pieces)
But if you've got a lifeline, throw it, throw it

[Verse: Lil Duke]
Young nigga gotta get paid, so

[Chorus: Young Thug & Lil Duke]
I can't do nothing for free (Duke)
I can't do nothing for free (No, no, no, no, no)
I can't do nothing for free (Nothing)
I can't do nothing for free (Wow, woo)
I can't do nothing for free

[Verse: Gunna]
I can't do nothing for free
Rollie talk, it cost a couple of G's
Hit your block and I go down a whole P
...
That shit won't fly where I stay (Fly where I stay)
Niggas dyin' every day (Dyin' every day)
My brother got shot in the face (Shot in the face)

[?] we tryna get paid (Tryna get paid)

[Verse: Young Thug]
...might cop me a Viper (Skrrt)
I might pull up on your wifey
Spittin' shit crazy like psycho, nigga (Yeah)

[Verse 1]
You're waking up my neighbors crying, screaming out my name
I guess somebody must've let the dog off of his chain
You're telling me you love me through a wild turkey slur
No sir, no sir

[Chorus]
Get outta my yard
Get outta my life
Go back to the bar
Go back to your wife

[Verse 2]
I guess you didn't get the message when I didn't call you back
If you think that what we did means anything, then you're on crack
Said you wanted to get married, boy, but you already were
No sir, no sir

[Chorus]
Get outta my yard
Get outta my head
Get off a my street
Go back to your bed
Forget where I live
(You're waking up my neighbors crying, screaming out my name)
Forget what we did
(I guess somebody must've let the dog off of his chain)
This ain't a motel
This ain't a bar
Get outta my yard

[Bridge]
When she was rocking babies, where did she think that you were?
They're the only thing that's keeping me from tellin' her
Yes sir, oh, yes sir

[Chorus]
Get outta my yard
Get outta my head
Get off a my street
Go back to your bed
Forget where I live
(You're waking up my neighbors crying, screaming out my name)
Forget what we did
(I guess somebody must've let the dog off of his chain)
This ain't a motel
This ain't a bar
Get outta my yard

[Outro]
Get outta my yard
'Cause this ain't a motel
This ain't a bar
Get outta my yard

[Intro]
Call, call my name
Call it, call my name

[Verse 1]
I've heard your voice this morning
Calling out my name
It had been so long, since I've heard
That it didn't really sound quite the same, no

But it let me know that my name
Had never really been spoken before
Before the day I carried you
Through the bridal path door

And ever since that day I haven't wanted anyone but you
And anybody who really knows me knows the truth
That I

[Chorus]
I just can't stop writing songs about you
I love you so much
I just can't wait to get my arms around you
And feel your touch
If I don't see you real soon, baby girl
I might go insane
I know it's only been three hours
But I love it when you call my namе, yes I do

[Verse 2]
I heard a voice on thе news saying
People wanna stop the war (stop the war)
If they had a love as sweet as you
They'd forget what they were fighting for

What's the matter with the world today?
The land of the free, somebody lied
They can bug my phone and peep around my home
They'll only see you and me making love inside

[Chorus]
I just can't stop writing songs about you
I love you so much
I just can't wait to get my arms around you
And feel your touch
If I don't see you real soon, baby girl
I might go insane
I know it's only been three hours
But I love it when you call my name, yes I do

[Verse 3]
I never seen the moon look so lovely
As the night I saw it with you
Let me know I'd never seen the moon before
So many speak of the moon
As though it had no flaws
But to compare it to a beauty like yours
Would give one pause
Nothing about you is false
That's why your love is real
That's why your love is real love
God forbid if you belonged to another
I'd have to steal you

I'd have to take you from your man
I might be tempted to break the law 'round here
Because your beauty it gives one pause
It slows me down

[Chorus]
I just can't stop writing songs about you
I love you so much
I just can't wait to get my arms around you
And feel your touch
If I don't see you real soon, baby girl
I might go insane, right
I know it's only been three hours
But I love it when you call my name, yes I do

[Outro]
I love it when you call my name
Call, call my name
Call it, call my name

[Verse 1]
What’s going on mama?
Something’s just dawned on me
I ain’t been home in some months
Been chasing songs and women
Making some bad decisions
God knows I’m drinking too much
Yeah, I know you’ve been worrying ‘bout me
You’ve been losing sleep since ’93

[Chorus]
I thought you should know that all those prayers you thought you wasted on me
Must’ve finally made their way on through
I thought you should know I got me a new girl down in Jefferson City
And she lets me fish whenever I want to
Yeah, I’m still proud of where I came from
Still your only damn son
Can you believe I’m on the radio?
Just thought you should know, Thought you should know, Thought you should know

[Verse 2]
Oh by the way momma didn’t mean to ramble on ya
How’s evеrything back at home?
Yeah, how’s that garden coming?
Is dad still doing dumb shit?
How’d hе keep you this long?
Yeah, I’m sorry to call you so late
I just miss you but anyway

[Chorus]
I thought you should know that all those prayers you thought you wasted on me
Must’ve finally made their way on through
I thought you should know I got me a new girl down in Jefferson City
And she lets me fish whenever I want to
Yeah, I’m still proud of where I came from
Still your only damn son
Can you believe I’m on the radio?
Just thought you should know, Thought you should know, Thought you should know

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, I’m sorry to called you so late
I just miss you but anyway

[Chorus]
I thought you should know that all those prayers you thought you wasted on me
Must’ve finally made their way on through
I thought you should know that I really like this girl down in Jefferson City
And it turns out she’s a lot like you
Yeah, I’m still proud of where I came from
Still your only damn son
The bus is leaving so I gotta roll
Just thought you should know, Thought you should know, Thought you should know

[Hook: Kevin Abstract]
I got my money saved
I’m with them boys my momma hate
I take the time to celebrate
My hands to the sky, my hands to the sky

[Verse 1: Joba]
If there was money in the bag
That you can just have
No strings attached
What would you have to ask?
I take some time, make up my mind
And disappear, and not say shit
Just go away for a while
Might do my dance, might throw some bands with both hands
Go all in, just give in for a while
I been beat up, beat down, fed up, bugged out over paper
Money ain’t shit when it’s meant to be
Money just came, in this case, for me
And I can’t complain
Nor will he, nor do we, I’m just saying

[Bridge: Kevin Abstract]
Damn, damn, damn, paper man, where you been?
Lights going down, and it’s time to make bands

[Hook: Kevin Abstract]
I got my money saved
I’m with them boys my momma hate
I take the time to celebrate
My hands to the sky, my hands to the sky
I got my money saved
I’m with them boys my momma hate
I take the time to celebrate
My hands to the sky, my hands to the sky

[Verse 2: Matt Champion & Kevin Abstract]
Threw my fist up
Man, lil’ hood shit, that’s good shit, right
Fuck the small talk, push the big rocks
Rub some dirt on, right
I’m on Parker, I’m on Denzel

[?]
Fuck opinions, y’all can keep them
Think about it, do what I want, fuck a price tag
Flew my mom all way up to Italy
Let her build up a whole winery
Find a new side of me
You love me, love me, love me
Always there right beside me
Might check in with my grandpa’s bags (Weighing on my mind, yeah)
Still ain’t call me back
Ride, ride, ride, where my dawgs at?
Jealousy gon’ creep up on me
Wish the worst things on me
I was born the way I was, can’t do nothing ‘bout it

[Hook: Kevin Abstract]
I got my money saved
I’m with them boys my momma hate
I take the time to celebrate
My hands to the sky, my hands to the sky
I got my money saved
I’m with them boys my momma hate
I take the time to celebrate
My hands to the sky, my hands to the sky

[Verse 3: Merlyn Wood]
Make your bread, invest
Put your egg in nest
They is hating, they is not your friends
Don’t need their respect, you can learn self respect

[?] but hate the set, over your screaming fans
This for my people, man, always for my people, man
Log in WhatsApp just to see my favorite fans
This for my people, man, always for my people, man
This for my people, man, always for my people, damn
Thank you mommy, you help people, and that’s why I rap
Black nurse in the South, when they hate, you hope
I’mma break myself, make myself a better self
Make my beat, I be Eli 

[?]

[Hook: Kevin Abstract]
I got my money saved
I’m with them boys my momma hate
I take the time to celebrate
My hands to the sky, my hands to the sky
I got my money saved
I’m with them boys my momma hate
I take the time to celebrate
My hands to the sky, my hands to the sky

[Verse 1]
Down the street, you can hear her scream, "You're a disgrace!"
As she slams the door in his drunken face
And now, he stands outside
All the neighbors start to gossip and drool
He cries, "Oh girl, you must be mad
What happened to the sweet love you and me had?"
Against the door, he leans, and starts a scene
But his tears fall, burn, and gard-all green

[Chorus 1]
And some castle made of sand
Fall in the sea eventually

[Verse 2]
An Indian brave, who before he was ten
Played war games in the woods with his Indian friends
And he built a dream, that when he grew up
He would be a fearless warrior, Indian Chief
Many moons passed, and more, the dream grew strong
Until tomorrow, he would sing his first war song
Fight his first battle
But somethin' went wrong
Surprise attack killed him in his sleep that night

[Chorus 2]
And some castle made of sand
Melts into the sea eventually
Take it, Johnny

[Guitar Solo 1:49-2:02]

[Verse 3]
There was a young girl who was heart with a frown
She was crippled for life, and she couldn't speak a sound
And she wished and prayed she could stop livin'
So she decided to die
She drew her wheelchair to the edge of the shore
And to her legs she smiled, "You won't hurt me no more."
But then, a sight she'd never seen made her jump and say
"Look a golden-winged ship is passin' my way."
But it really didn't have to stop
It just kept on goin'

[Chorus 3]
And some castles made of sand
Slips into the sea, eventually

[Verse 1]
I got my driver's license last week
Just like we always talked about
'Cause you were so excited for me
To finally drive up to your house
But today I drove through the suburbs
Crying 'cause you weren't around

[Verse 2]
And you're probably with that blonde girl
Who always made me doubt
She's so much older than me
She's everything I'm insecure about
Yeah, today I drove through the suburbs
'Cause how could I ever love someone else?

[Chorus]
And I know we weren't perfect
But I've never felt this way for no one
And I just can't imagine
How you could be so okay now that I'm gone
Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street

[Verse 3]
And all my friends are tired
Of hearing how much I miss you, but
I kinda feel sorry for them
'Cause they'll never know you the way that I do
Yeah, today I drove through the suburbs
And pictured I was driving home to you

[Chorus]
And I know we weren't perfect
But I've never felt this way for no one, oh
And I just can't imagine
How you could be so okay now that I'm gone
I guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street

[Bridge]
Red lights, stop signs
I still see your face in the white cars, front yards
Can't drive past the places we used to go to
'Cause you know I still love you, babe (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh)
Sidewalks we crossed
I still hear your voice in the traffic, we're laughing
Over all the noise
God, I'm so blue, know we're through
But you know I still love you, babe (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh)

[Chorus]
I know we weren't perfect
But I've never felt this way for no one
And I just can't imagine
How you could be so okay now that I'm gone
Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street

[Outro]
Yeah, you said forever, now I drive alone past your street

You say you do, but you don’t want me (Aye, aye)

I, wish that this shit would work
Wish you would put me first, communicate your words
Will you leave me in the dark?
That’s when I swear, it hurts
I think I’ll bang over your love, but is it worth it first
I gotta ask myself “Am I trippin’ too hard?”
I’m tryna’ go through your phone, but I was up at your home
Why you ain’t lovin’ me hard, there must be someone else
I’m tryna’ give you it all, therе must be no love left
Damn, damn, ayе, fuck

[Chorus]
You say you do, but you don’t want me (Aye, aye)

Man, I made it through the storm
Yeah, I made it through the mess (Mess)
And I praise all high, Goddamn, boy I’m blessed
Boy I’m blessed, had to get that shit up off my chest
Ice up on my neck, keep me cool when I’m stressed

Gotta make sure that he watch me through the night

[Verse]
Lil Boat
Niggas lost in the sauce
Pickin’ up all this, tryna get they money right (Blessed)

I wanna take a ride on your disco stick
Huh!

But if I do, then I might miss you, babe
It's complicated and stupid
Got my ass squeezed by sexy Cupid
Guess he wants to play, wants to play
A love game, a love game

[Pre-Chorus]
Hold me and love me, just wanna touch you for a minute
Maybe three seconds is enough for my heart to quit it

Hold me and love me, just wanna touch you for a minute

[Verse 1: Lizzy McAlpine]
All my exes live in Boston, so I don't go there anymore
I kept all the notes they gave me, is that weird? I'm not quite sure
All my exes are musicians, they write songs and they slam doors
I have playlists of the songs about me, I like to keep score

[Verse 2: Alexander 23]
All my exes take up all the real estate inside my phone
I can't delete the pictures, is that weird? I just don't know
All my exеs keep their distance, we spеak once a year, no more
Happy birthdays are (?) like trophies, I guess I like to keep score

[Chorus: Lizzy McAlpine & Alexander 23]
You say I'm different, call me pretty names
How do you call someone else the same thing?
'Cause love's not a game, but still I find a way to lose it every time
This floorboard never lies (?)

[Verse: Lizzy McAlpine, Alexander 23]

[?] just another ex or are you maybe something more?

[Chorus Lizzy McAlpine & Alexander 23]
You say I'm different, call me pretty names
How do you call someone else the same thing?
'Cause love's not a game, but still I find a way to lose it every time
This floorboard never lies (?)
But maybe just this time

[Verse]
Just once in a lifetime
A woman knows a moment
One wonderful moment
When fate takes her hand
And this is my moment
My once in a lifetime
When I can explore a new and exciting land
Just once in my lifetime
I feel like a giant
And I soar like an eagle
As though I had wings
For this is my moment
My destiny calls me
And though it may be just once in a lifetime
I'm gonna do great things

[Outro]
Just once, once in my lifetime
Ooh, I feel like a giant
And I soar like an eaglе
Just as though I had wings
For this, this is my moment
My destiny calls me
And though it may bе just once in my lifetime
I'm gonna do great things
I'm gonna do real things
I'm gonna do real big things
Real, big, things

[Verse]
More than the greatest love the world has known
This is the love I give to you alone
More than the simple things that I try to say
I only live to love you more each day
More than you'll ever know
My arms long to hold you so
My life is in your keeping
Laughing, sleeping, crying, weeping
Longer than always is a long time
But far beyond forever you'll be mine
I know I've never lived before
But my heart is very sure
No one else could love you more

[Outro]
More than the simple things that I try to say
I only live to love you more each day
More than you'll ever know
My arms long to hold you so
My life is in your keeping
Laughing, sleeping, crying, weeping
Longer than always is a long time
But far beyond forever you'd be mine
I know I've never lived before
But my heart is very sure
No one else could, no one else could love you
No one else could, no one else could love you more
No one else could love you more
No one else could love you, love you more
No one else could love you more, no no
No one else could love you, no no
No one else could love you, no no
Now that's a fade

[Verse 1]
If I had a hammer
I'd swing it in the morning
Swing it in the evening
All over this land
I'd swing out a warning
Then swing out danger
And the love I have for my brothers and sisters
All over this land, ooh yeah

[Verse 2]
If I had a bell
Well, I'd ring that bell in the morning
I'd ring it in the evening
All over this land
I'd ring out danger
Then sing out a warning
And the love that I have for my brothers and sisters
All, all over this land, yes, I will

[Verse 3]
If I had a song
I'd sing it in the morning
Sing it in the evening
All over this land
See me hammer out my justice
See me ring out my warning
And the love that I have for my brothers and sisters
All over this land, yes, I would

[Outro]
All over this land, woo, yes, I would
All over this land, ooh hoo hoo, yes, I would
All over this land
All over this land
All over this land

[Verse]
I think the sky is blue
Just as far as I can see
But should you say the sky is gray
Well, it still looks blue to me
I know the road is light
And I've known this all along
But should you say the sky is gray
Then I won't say that you're wrong

[Chorus]
Because today, I love everybody
Everybody I see
Today, I think that all folks are great and
Everybody here loves me
Ooh, today, I'd give almost anybody
Anything that I've got
Today, I'd state all folks are great
Including them that are not

[Bridge]
Well, if joy can be contagious
Why not catch this real outrageous thing
This glorious thing
This marvelous thing

[Chorus]
Oh, today, I'd give anybody
Anything that you see
And today, I think that all folks great and
Everybody here loves me

[Bridge]
Well, if joy can be contagious
Why not catch this real outrageous thing
This, this glorious thing
This marvelous thing

[Outro]
Oh, today, I'd give anybody
Anything that you see
And today, I think that all folks are great and
And everybody here loves
Everybody here loves
Everybody here loves me

[Verse 1]
There is no greater love
Than what I feel for you
No greater love
No heart so true
There is no greater thrill
Than just what you bring to me
No, no sweeter song
Than what you sing, sing to me

[Bridge]
You're, you're the sweetest thing
That I, I have ever known, mhm
And to think, just to think that
You are mine, you are mine alone

[Verse 2]
There is, there is no greater love
In all the world, in all the world, it's true, ooh hoo
No greater love
Than just what I feel for you

[Bridge]
You're, you're the sweetest thing
That I have ever, ever known
And to think that you are mine
You're mine all alone, all alone

[Outro]
There is no, no greater love
In all the world, all the world, and it's true
No greater love
Than what I feel, what I feel for you
Ooh hoo, yeah, no greater love
Than just what I feel for you, ooh hoo
For you

[Verse 1]
Won't you come home, Bill Bailey
Come on home
I know that I’ve done you wrong
Now, I'll do the cookin', honey
And I’ll even pay your rent
I know I've done you wrong

[Bridge]
Do you remember that rainy evening
I threw you out
With nothing but a fine tooth comb
And I know that I'm to blame
And it's a low down dirty shame
Bill Bailey, come on home

[Verse 2]
I wonder will you come on home, Bill Bailey
Come on now
I know that I've done you wrong
I'll do all the burnin', honey
'Cause I can’t cook
I know that I’ve done you wrong

[Bridge]
Do you remember that rainy evеning
I threw you out
With nothing but a fine tooth comb
And I know that I'm to blame
And it’s a low down dirty shamе
Bill Bailey, come on now

[Outro]
My Bill, come on home
I'm sitting here a little troubled in mind
The way I am, I didn't think that you would leave me behind
Come on home, Bill, right now
Come on home, Bill, right now
You oughta put on your coat, come on home now
You oughta put on your shoes, I said come on home now
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, come on, Bill
Woo hoo hoo, come on now
Please, Bill, everything's alright
Bill Bailey, try to make it home by tonight
Please, Bill, I need you here
My Bill, come on now
Bill Bailey, won’t you please come home
Oh oh oh oh oh oh, yeah

[Verse 1]
Ooh look, just look at me
I'm as helpless as a kitten up a tree
I feel like I'm clinging to a cloud
I can't understand
Why I get misty, holding your hand
Walk my way
And a thousand violins begin to play
Or is it the sound of your hello dear
That music I hear
Ooh, why I get misty whenever you're near

[Bridge]
You can say that you're leading me on
But it's just, just what I want you to do
Can I help it, how hopelessly I'm lost
That's why I'm following you

[Outro]
And on my own, said on my very own
Woo, that I wander through this great big wide world all alone
Never knowing my right hand from my left
My hat from my glove
Ooh, I'm too misty, too much in love
Ooh, I say I'm just too misty
Very, very, very much in love

[Chorus]

[Verse]
Just once in a lifetime
A woman knows a moment
One wonderful moment
When fate takes her hand
And this is my moment
My once in a lifetime
When I can explore a new and exciting land
Just once in my lifetime
I feel like a giant
And I soar like an eagle
As though I had wings
For this is my moment
My destiny calls me
And though it may be just once in a lifetime
I'm gonna do great things

[Outro]
Just once, once in my lifetime
Ooh, I feel like a giant

For this, this is my moment
My destiny calls me
And though it may bе just once in my lifetime
I'm gonna do great things
I'm gonna do real things
I'm gonna do real big things
Real, big, things

[Verse]
I think the sky is blue
Just as far as I can see
But should you say the sky is gray
Well, it still looks blue to me
I know the road is light
And I've known this all along
But should you say the sky is gray
Then I won’t say that you're wrong

[Chorus]
Because today, I love everybody
Everybody I see
Today, I think that all folks are great and
Everybody here loves me
Ooh, today, I'd give almost anybody
Anything that I’ve got
Today, I'd state all folks are great
Including them that are not

[Bridge]
Well, if joy can be contagious
Why not catch this real outrageous thing
This glorious thing
This marvelous thing

[Chorus]
Oh, today, I'd give anybody
Anything that you see
And today, I think that all folks great and
Everybody here loves mе

[Bridge]
Well, if joy can be contagious
Why not catch this real outragеous thing
This, this glorious thing
This marvelous thing

[Outro]
Oh, today, I'd give anybody
Anything that you see
And today, I think that all folks are great and
And everybody here loves
Everybody here loves
Everybody here loves me

[Verse]
If they had ever
Ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever told me
If they had ever, ever told me how sweet a kiss could be
I would have said impossible, impossible for me
And if they said that I'd find you beyond the rainbow's end
I would have said it's impossible, impossible, my friend

[Bridge]
To dream about what might have been is strange enough for me
But now it seems that I'm living in a dream too beautiful to be

[Outro]
And if thеy'd said that I'd find you beside a stormy sea
I would havе said it's impossible for now I, I see
That nothing is impossible if you are here with me

[Verse]
You're walking along the street or you're at a party
Or else you're alone and then you suddenly dig
You're looking in someone's eyes and suddenly realize
This could be the start of something big
You're lunching at twenty-one's and watching your diet
Declining a Charlotte Russe, accepting a fig
When out of the clear blue sky, suddenly it's gal and guy
And this could be the start of something big

[Bridge]
There's no controlling the unrolling of your fate, my friend
Who knows what's written in thе magic book
But when a lover you discover at thе gate, my friend
Let him in without a second look

[Outro]
You're up in an aeroplane or dining at Sardi's
Or else at Malibu alone on the sand
Suddenly hear a bell, suddenly you can tell
This could be the start of something
This could be the start of something
This could be the start of something big
Oh, this could be the start of something big

[Verse]
More than the greatest love the world has known
This is the love I give to you alone
More than the simple things that I try to say
I only live to love you more each day
More than you'll ever know
My arms long to hold you so
My life is in your keeping
Laughing, sleeping, crying, weeping
Longer than always is a long time
But far beyond forever you'll be mine
I know I've never lived before
But my heart is very sure
No one else could love you more

[Outro]
Morе than the simple things that I try to say
I only live to lovе you more each day
More than you'll ever know
My arms long to hold you so
My life is in your keeping
Laughing, sleeping, crying, weeping
Longer than always is a long time
But far beyond forever you'd be mine
I know I've never lived before
But my heart is very sure
No one else could, no one else could love you
No one else could, no one else could love you more
No one else could love you more
No one else could love you, love you more
No one else could love you more, no no
No one else could love you, no no
No one else could love you, no no
Now that's a fade

[Verse 1]
There is no greater love
Than what I feel for you
No greater love
No heart so true
There is no greater thrill
Than just what you bring to me
No, no sweeter song
Than what you sing, sing to me

[Bridge]
You're, you're the sweetest thing
That I, I have ever known, mhm
And to think, just to think that
You are mine, you are mine alone

[Verse 2]
There is, there is no greater love
In all the world, in all the world, it's true, ooh hoo
No greater love
Than just what I feel for you

[Bridge]
You're, you're the sweetest thing
That I have ever, ever known
And to think that you are mine
You're mine all alone, all alone

[Outro]
There is no, no greater love
In all the world, all the world, and it's true
No greater love
Than what I feel, what I feel for you
Ooh hoo, yeah, no greater love
Than just what I feel for you, ooh hoo
For you

[Verse 1]
If I had a hammer
I'd swing it in the morning
Swing it in the evening
All over this land
I'd swing out a warning
Then swing out danger
And the love I have for my brothers and sisters
All over this land, ooh yeah

[Verse 2]
If I had a bell
Well, I'd ring that bell in the morning
I'd ring it in the evening
All over this land
I'd ring out danger
Then sing out a warning
And the love that I have for my brothers and sisters
All, all over this land, yes, I will

[Verse 3]
If I had a song
I'd sing it in the morning
Sing it in the evening
All over this land
See me hammer out my justice
See me ring out my warning
And the lovе that I have for my brothers and sisters
All ovеr this land, yes, I would

[Outro]
All over this land, woo, yes, I would
All over this land, ooh hoo hoo, yes, I would
All over this land
All over this land
All over this land

[Intro]
One, two, one, two, three

[Verse 1]
Baby, we’ve got to have us a little talk
Gonna have to pack up my things, I'm gonna walk
You say a dollar goes from hand to hand
But before I see you go from woman to woman

[Chorus]
I'd rather drink muddy water
Sleep out in a hollow log
Yes, I would

[Verse 2]
I love you, baby, but you just won't be fair
I don't believe you know how to be on the square
Now go on and have your fun and if you must
But before I have another man that I cannot trust

[Chorus]
I'd rather drink muddy water
Sleep out in a hollow log

[Bridge]
Yeah, real, real soulful right now, Dirty Harry
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 3]
You promised me you were gonna live by the golden rule
I work all day and walk just like a fool
For you my kisses are sweet as they can be
But before I see you make a stone fool out of me

[Chorus]
I'd rather drink muddy water
Yes, I'd rather drink muddy water
I'd rather drink muddy water
Oh oh oh yes I would, woo hoo

[Outro]
I'd rather drink muddy water
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yes I would
Show me the way, way, way, way, way down
To that place I can find that muddy water
I'll go ahead and turn it on up
I say I'd rather drink muddy water
I'd rather drink muddy, muddy, muddy water
Sleep out in a hollow log

[Intro]
One, two, three

[Verse 1]
What is romance without the one you love?
Well, it's heartbreak and misery without the one you love
You fool yourself and say "I'll forget him"
And knowing all the time that it's not so
You play the lonely role of Pagliacci
Crying all day and sad and hurting and much more
Life can seem so cruel
Without that one you love

[Bridge]
You're like a dying rose in summer without the one you love
One telephone call
One line, one line or so
Could mean a world of difference
Just lovebirds, you'll never
You'll never, ever, ever, ever know
But life can seem so lonely without the one you love

[Outro]
One, one telephone call
You know that charge'll brighten me one line or so
All of this could mean a world of difference
Just lovebirds, you'll never, ever, ever know
But life can seem so low, so lonely
Without the one you, you love, mmm, mhm

[Intro]
One, two, three, four
One, two

[Verse 1]
Trouble in mind
Yes, I'm blue
But I won’t be blue always
Sun is gonna shine
In my back door someday
Trouble in mind
Yes, it's true
I have almost lost my mind
Never had so much trouble
In my life before

[Bridge]
Now, if it don't stop
I’m going right on down to the river
I'm gonna take my easy chair
And if the blues don't get me
I'm gonna rock on away from here

[Verse 2]
Talkin' 'bout I'm trouble in mind
Oh, yes, I'm blue
I have almost lost my mind
Never had so much trouble
In my life before

[Bridge]
Now, if it don’t stop
I’m going right on down, ooh, to the river
I'm gonna take my easy chair
And if the blues don’t get me
I'm gonna rock on away from here

[Verse 3]
You better believe me
I'm trouble in mind
Oh oh oh, yes, it's true
I have almost lost my mind
Never had so much trouble
In my young life before

[Bridge]
If it don’t stop
I'm going right on down, woo, to the river
I'm gonna take my old easy chair
And if the blues don't get me
I'm might have to rock on away from here

[Outro]
Saying that I'm trouble in mind
Oh, yes, I'm blue
But I just refuse to be blue always
The sun is gonna shine
In my back door someday
I said I it is, I know it is
Sun is gonna shine in my back door someday
Well, I said that I believe that
The sun is gonna shine in my back door someday
Oh, trouble in mind, hey

[Intro]
- Six eight six nine seven, take two
- Intro alone. No drums at all, right? John, no drums at all?
- The drums are alright, just not the guitar, that's all
- Okay, here we go
- Ready?

[Instrumental]

[Verse]
Oh, one more time right now, yeah
I said one more, one more time right now, yeah
And oh yeah, oh, oh yeah
Ray Charles said it was hard times but I feel alright
Oh, yeah, yeah
Oh yeah
Mmm, mhm
Ah yeah
Hard times but I'm feeling mighty nice

[Verse 1]
When I go for a walk
I meet old friends we knew
We sit around and talk
(Yes, we sit and talk)
Oh, then they ask about you
(Then they ask about you)
What's the good if I say
That you and I are through
I simply tell them you're okay
(Tell them you're okay)
Oh, when, when they ask about you
(When they ask about you)

[Bridge]
They wonder where we've been
And why we fail to call
(And you don't ever call)
And I take it on the chin
Until the teardrops fall
(When the teardops fall)

[Verse 2]
They, they, they don't mean to be smart
Mmm, but if they, if they only knew
That they're stepping on my heart
(Stepping on my heart)
When they ask, when they ask about you
(When they ask about you)

[Outro]
They're stepping and walking on my heart
Oh, when they ask, when they ask about you, yeah yeah yeah
(When they ask about you)

[Verse 1]
We played the game of stay away
But it cost more than I can pay
Without you I can't make my way
I surrender, dear

[Verse 2]
Now, I may seem proud, I may act gay
But it's just a pose, oh, I'm not that way
'Cause deep down, deep down in my heart, I say
I surrender, dear

[Bridge]
Mmm, little mean things we were doing
Must have been part of the game
Lending a spice to the wooing
Oh, but I don’t care who's to blame, blame

[Verse 3]
When stars appear and shadows fall
Why didn't you hear my poor heart call?
To you my love, my life, my all
I surrender, dear

[Outro]
Oh, I, I surrender, dear
Oh, yeah yeah, I
Oh, I surrender, yeah, dear, yeah, yeah

[Intro]
Now, listen here, girls
I'm gonna tell you what I want right now

[Verse 1]
I want a rough lover
I want a man
I want a rough, tough lover
And I'll find him if I can
He's got to bite nails
Fight bears
And if I get sassy
Be a man who dares
To shut me up and kiss me
So I know he cares
I want a man

[Verse 2]
Don't want a mean daddy
I want a boss
I want a mean, sweet daddy
Who the devil wouldn't cross
He's got to spit fire
Chew iron
Get mad and start roaring like a mountain lion
Then whisper that he loves me
So I know he's mine
I want a man

[Bridge]
I'm looking for a guy who's big and strong
But weak for me
I'm looking for a guy who'll ride around
But never, never set me free

[Verse 3]
I want a rough lover
I want a man
I want a rough, tough lover
With a sentimental plan
So he can kiss nice
Hug tight
He's gotta be sweet and gentle day and night
But mean enough to make me want to treat him right
I want a man, oh yeah

[Bridge]
I'm looking for a guy who's raving strong
And weak for me
I'm looking for a guy who'll ride around
But never, never set me free

[Verse 4]
Oh, I want a rough lover
I want a man
I want a rough, tough lover
With a sentimental plan
So he can kiss nice
Hug tight
He's gotta be sweet and gentle day and night
But mean enough to make me wanna treat him right
I want a man

[Outro]
I want a man
I don't want no creampuff, baby
Yeah, I don't want no butterfly
I want a man
Oh, yes, I do
Oh, yes, I do

[Intro]
Take it, take it just like you give it, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Take it like you give it

[Verse 1]
Baby, can I say that I'm sorry
For the things I said last night
But I'm human, too, just like you
And I don't always do things right
And sometimes you are so very nice
But I smile and still pay the price
Now, if you love me let me see you live it
And just take it like you give it, yeah

[Chorus]
(Take it, take it just like you give it)
Yeah, take it like you give it, yeah
(Take it, take it just like you give it)
Yeah

[Verse 2]
Baby, there's a whole lot of people (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Who just can't see the forest for the trees (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
And you just don't know how sad I am (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
To think you might be one of these, hey, yeah

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
I wanna make up for this reason (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Whether it be wrong or right (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
I'm in misery, and I know you miss me (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Undo the switch, I'd rather fight
So don't make it hard for me to come back
And if you love me, let me see you live it
And just take it like you give it, yeah

[Chorus]
(Take it, take it just like you give it, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Take it like you give it (Take it like you give it)
Yeah, take it like you give it, yeah
(Take it, take it just like you give it, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Yeah, take it like you give it

[Verse 1]
Here we all work, on one jar or another
Why should I work while he rolls blaze?
I get tired, so tired and weary
Got to keep tolling day by day

[Chorus]
Ol' man river, ol’ man river
He don't say nothin', but he must know somethin’
Ol' man river keeps on rollin' along, ah ah
No, he don't plant cotton, he don't plant taters
Them what plants 'em is soon forgotten
Ol' man river keeps on rollin' along, mhm

[Bridge]
Well, you and me, we sweat and strain
Our bodies all achin’ and wracked with pain
Tote that barge, you better lift that bale
Get a little drunk and you land in jail

[Verse 2]
I get weary, so sick of tryin’
I'm tired of livin’, but afraid of dyin'
Ol' man river, he keeps on rollin' along, mhm
Mhm, mmm, yeah

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
Well, you, you and me, we sweat and strain
Our bodies all achin’ and wracked with pain
Oh, tote that barge, you better lift that bale
Get a little drunk and you land in jail

[Verse 3]
I get weary, so sick of tryin'
Tired of livin', but afraid of dyin'
Ol' man river, he keeps on rollin' along, mhm

[Outro]
Ol' man river keeps on rollin' along, yeah
Ol' man river keeps on rollin' along

[Verse 1]
I have seen a rainbow
Circle across the sky
And I have stood on a mountain
And watched an eagle fly

[Chorus]
I have seen trees in a meadow
Shelter a morning dove
But I haven't seen anything
To match the wonder of a mother's love

[Verse 2]
I have seen a sunset
More beautiful than gold
And I have stood by a rosebed
And watched the leaves unfold

[Chorus]
I have seen so many wonders
And blessings from above
But I haven't seen anything
To match the wonder of a mother's love

[Outro]
No, I still haven't seen anything
To match the wonder of a mother's love

[Verse]
Swanee
How I love ya, how I love ya
My dear old Swanee
I'd give the world to be
Among my folks in
D-I-X-I-E-ven now my (Swanee)
People are
Waitin' for me, prayin' for me
Down by the Swanee
The folks up north (North)
Will see me no more
When I get to that Swanee shore
Oh, Swanee
How I love ya, how I love ya
My dear old Swanee
I'd give the world if I could only be
Among my folks in
D-I-X-I-E-ven now my (Swanee)
People are
Waitin' for me, prayin' for me
Down by the Swanee
The folks up north (North)
Will never (Will)
Just see me no more
When I get to that Swanee (Swanee)
Well, let me get through that Swanee (Swanee)
When I cross that Swanee shore

[Verse 1]
Only the one you love can hurt you (Can hurt you)
Only the one you trust in most of all (Most of all)
Nobody else you know (You know)
Could ever hurt you so (You so)
Or tear you all apart

[Verse 2]
Only the one you love can fool you (Can fool you)
Only the one you who's closest to your heart (To your heart)
And that's 'cause you can't believe
He ever would deceive
Or leave you or let you fall or let you die (Ooh ooh, ooh ooh)

[Outro]
Strangers can harm you
It's been proven many times before
Only the one you love can hurt you
But each hurt makеs you love him more and more
(Morе and more, more and more)
But each hurt can makes you love him more and more
(More and more, more and more)
Every little hurt makes you love him more and more and more and more and more

[Verse 1]
I'm only one step ahead of heartbreak
One step ahead of misery
One step is all I'd have to take backwards
To be the same old fool for you I used to be

[Verse 2]
I'm only one step ahead of your arms
One kiss away from your sweet lips
I know I can't afford to stop for one moment
'Cause I'm just out of reach of your fingertips

[Bridge]
Your warm breath on my shoulder
Keeps reminding me
That it's too soon to forget you
It's too late to be free, can't you see?

[Outro]
I'm only one step ahead of your love
I try and yet I can't take two
Seems like I'll have to takе that one step backwards
'Cause onе step ahead is a step too far away from you
'Cause one step ahead is a step too far away from you
Just one step ahead is a step too far away from you

[Verse 1]
Strangle your darling with diamonds
Drown her in sparkling champagne
Dresses from all the sublime ones
Will drive the lady insane
Oh, Mediterranean villa
Wears down resistance for life

[Chorus]
And then shroud your endowed in Chinchilla
You're just about free now
Ooh, she's too weak to see now
So finish her off, tell her you love her
And that's how to murder your wife

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Smother that girl in all of that Chinchilla
You're just about free now
Ooh, she's too weak to see now
So finish her off, tell her you love her
And that’s how to murder your wife

[Outro]
Just smother that girl down in Chinchilla
Ooh, and that's how you bump off your wife
Just smother her down in those minks and Chinchilla
And that's how you murder your wife

[Verse 1]
Sitting here thinking
I'm trying to write a song
Now, if I don't get me a hit soon
I won't be here long
I got a lyric writer
Got me a piano man
And we're making these words
Just as tight as we can

[Chorus]
Now we want these words
Tender and bold
They don't have to be strong
Just give us a whole lot of soul

[Verse 2]
Now, hey little boy
Come over here with me
Can you show me how
To do that dance called The Flea
Can you show me how to wobble?
Can we do it together?
Come on and let's bend over
Come on and let's shake a tailfeather

[Chorus]
We want these words
Tender and bold
Now they don't have to be strong
Just give me a whole lot of soul

[Bridge]
Soul (Soul), soul (Soul)
Soul (Soul), soul (Soul)
A little soul (Soul), soul (Soul)
A little soul (Soul), soul (Soul)

[Verse 3]
Now, how am I doing? (Doing alright now)
Am I doing alright? (Doing alright now)
I got this song (Doing alright now)
And I got this boy (Doing alright now)
I got a piano man (Uh-huh)
And a great big band (Uh-huh)
Now, I wanna hear the trumpets (Uh-huh)
Blowing out loud
Let me see the action
Coming in from the crowd
And take me right by my hand (Doing alright now)
A little bit of soul, and

[Outro]
A little soul (Soul), soul (Soul)
A little soul (Soul), soul (Soul)
A little soul (Soul), soul (Soul)
A little soul (Soul), soul (Soul)
Tell me how am I doing? (Doing alright now)
Am I doing alright? (You're doing alright now)
Tell me how am I doing? (You're doing alright now)
Am I doing alright?

[Verse 1]
Nobody knows except my pillow at night
All through the day how many tears I have to fight

[Chorus]
And oh, when I'm alone, yeah
I just cry like a baby
I cry like a baby
Oh (I cry)
Oh oh (I cry)
Yeah

[Verse 2]
Nobody sees except my mirror on the wall
I'm not the fairest, I'm the bluest of them all

[Chorus]
And oh, when I'm alone, yeah
I just cry like a baby
I cry like a baby
(I cry)
Oh oh (I cry)
Yeah

[Bridge]
Each day I say, "Tomorrow will be my lucky day"
Ah ha yeah
And my pillow will be surprised when I come home with glad eyes
And the mirror on the wall will see that I am the happiest of them all, ooh

[Verse 3]
No more nights staring at that empty chair
Because I know that you'll be standing there

[Chorus]
And oh, when I'm alone, yeah
I won't cry like a baby
Cry like a baby

[Outro]
Oh yeah (I cry)
Said I won't cry (I cry)
No, I won't cry like a baby
Woo-hoo (Cry like a baby, I cry)
Ooh, no, oh oh, yeah
I won't (Cry like a baby)

[Verse]
Her little heart went to Loveland
His little heart stayed at home
Her little heart gave all the love it could impart
His little heart gave none
She took the road to forever
Would she leave him? Never
Maybe she wasn't too clever
But when love finds one, it blinds one
He made her journey so exciting
Oh, how her world spun around
Lockеd in his embrace, lost in time and spacе
But he's never left the ground
This little girl is a sad little girl
Who must endlessly roar
Her little heart went to Loveland
That is because his cold heart stayed home

[Verse 1]
Where, where are you?
Where have you gone without me?
I thought you cared about me
Where, where are you?
Where's my heart?
Where is the dream we started?
Oh, I just can’t believe that we've parted
Where, where are you?

[Bridge]
When we said goodbye love, was it just a game?
And when I gave you my love, was it all in vain?

[Verse 2]
All life through
Must I go on pretending?
Where is, where is, where is my happy ending?
Where, where are you?

[Bridge]
When we said goodbye love, was it just, was it just a game?
And when I gave you my love, was it all in vain?

[Outro]
All night through
Must I go on pretending?
Where is, where is my happy, happy ending?
Where, oh, where, oh, where, honey, where are you?

[Verse]
Sweetheart, the night is growing old
Sweetheart, my love is still untold
A kiss that is never tasted
Forever and ever is wasted

[Bridge]
For all we know we may never meet again
Before you go, make this moment, ooh, sweet again
We won't say goodnight, not until the last, the very last minute
I'll hold out my hand and nothing but my heart will be in it

[Outro]
For all, for all we know, this may only be a sweet dream
But we come and we've got to go, just like the ripples on a stream
Oh, love me, love me tonight, tomorrow was madе for some
But for us tomorrow may, may never comе, for all we know

[Verse 1]
Make someone happy
Make just one someone happy
Make just one heart the heart you sing to
One smile that cheers you
One face that lights when it nears you
One man you're everything to

[Verse 2]
Fame if you win it
Oh, it comes and it goes in a minute
Now, where's the real stuff in life to cling to?
Love is the answer
Someone to really love is the answer
And once you've found him
Keep trying to build your world around him

[Outro]
Oh, make someone, someone happy
Make just one, one someone happy
And I guarantee you will be happy, too
Oh oh oh oh, make someone, someone happy
Oh, sometime in life you ought to try and make someone happy
And you will be happy, too, mhm

[Verse]
Haunt my house, Mr. Ugly
I know how beautiful you are
When you hold me tight
Rainbows fill the night
Tell me, are you my lucky star?
Play your guitar, my Mr. Ugly
Your melodies are so divine
Winter is spring to me
When you sing to me
You serenade this heart of mine

[Bridge]
You don't scare me, just to look at you
I'd crawl across the great divide
Although you're small
To me you’re so tall
When you kiss me, my heart opens wide, oh, wide

[Outro]
Oh, don't make me cry, my Mr. Ugly
Cling to me, never, never, ever let me go
Make my life complete
Dance me off my feet
Tell me the things I need to know
Mr. Ugly, you're, you're not ugly to me anymore

[Verse 1]
I wanna be around to pick up the pieces
When somebody breaks your heart
Somebody twice as smart as I

[Bridge]
A somebody who will swear to be true
Like you used to do with me
Oh, but who'll leave you to learn
That misery loves company, oh, wait and see

[Verse 2]
And I do mean, I wanna be around to see how she does it
When she breaks your heart to bits
Now let's see how the puzzle fits so fine

[Outro]
And that's when I'll discover that revenge is so sweet
As I sit there applauding from a front row seat
When somebody breaks your heart like you broke mine
Oh, yeah, like you, oh, like you broke mine, yeah

[Verse 1]
I'm gonna smile and take it, baby
Until I get tired of you
When I've had enough of this business
You'll be the first one to know we're through

[Bridge]
(Ooh) I'm turning over a brand new leaf
(Ooh) Now you're gonna see a smile on my face
(Ooh) Doesn't matter to get into something
And you're not even in the race

[Verse 2]
I'll keep on smiling
'Cause what good does it do
To try to explain to an unconcerned lover
That he's mistreating you

[Bridge]
(Do it) You think it's great to have whole lot of chicks
(Ah, do it) So show me the one that can teach an old dog new tricks
(Do it) I, I'll keep right on smiling

[Verse 3]
I'll keep on smiling
Although you hurt my pride
'Cause I wanna be the first one to see you
When all of those chicks toss you aside, yeah
(Do it) Now, they say a man just ain't supposed to cry
(Ah, do it) But I'm gonna watch you show the world that crying was a lie

[Outro]
I, and just for now
I'm gonna keep on smiling, yeah
You know you've hurt me, but I'm gonna keep on smiling
You've done me real dirty, but I'm gonna keep on smiling
Yeah, I'm gonna keep on smiling
Looking straight ahead, just smiling

[Intro]
Take it, take it just like you give it, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Take it like you give it

[Verse 1]
Baby, can I say that I'm sorry
For the things I said last night
But I'm human, too, just like you
And I don't always do things right
And sometimes you are so very nice
But I smile and still pay the price
Now, if you love me let me see you live it
And just take it like you give it, yeah

[Chorus]
(Take it, take it just like you give it)
Yeah, take it like you give it, yeah
(Take it, take it just like you give it)
Yeah

[Verse 2]
Baby, there's a whole lot of people (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Who just can't see the forest for the trees (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
And you just don't know how sad I am (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
To think you might be one of these, hey, yeah

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
I wanna make up for this reason (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Whether it be wrong or right (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
I'm in misery, and I know you miss me (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Undo the switch, I'd rather fight
So don't make it hard for me to come back
And if you love me, let me see you live it
And just take it like you give it, yeah

[Chorus]
(Take it, take it just like you give it, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Take it like you give it (Take it like you give it)
Yeah, take it like you give it, yeah
(Take it, take it just like you give it, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Yeah, take it like you give it

[Verse 1]
I have seen a rainbow
Circle across the sky
And I have stood on a mountain
And watched an eagle fly

[Chorus]
I have seen trees in a meadow
Shelter a morning dove
But I haven't seen anything
To match the wonder of a mother's love

[Verse 2]
I have seen a sunset
More beautiful than gold
And I have stood by a rosebed
And watched the leaves unfold

[Chorus]
I have seen so many wonders
And blessings from above
But I haven't seen anything
To match the wonder of a mother's love

[Outro]
No, I still haven't seen anything
To match the wonder of a mother's love

[Verse]
I won't cry anymore, now that you've left me
I won't cry anymore, now that you've gone
I've shed a million tears since we've been apart
And now that it's got to end, the tears can never mend a broken heart
I won't sigh anymore, oh, I'll just forget you
For I'm closing the door of memories
And although you're the one love my heart is longing for
Mmm, mmm, mmm, this is goodbye, you can't make me cry anymore

[Verse 1]
Don't get too comfortable, my boy
I'm expecting company
Don't you have somewhere else to go
Or do you just like to visit me?
You can't come around any time you please
Just like you did before

[Chorus]
So tighten up your tie (Tighten up)
Button up that jacket (Button up)
And make it for the door (Make it for the door)

[Verse 2]
Don't get too close to me, my boy
I'm not playing around with you
Can't you leave well enough alone
Why can't you just realize we're through?
I couldn't start again, oh no sir-ee
I couldn't take it any more

[Chorus]
So tighten up your tie (Tighten up)
Button up that jacket (Button up)
And make it for the door (Make it for the door)

[Bridge]
Oh, the bell might ring any minute
And he just wouldn't understand
You had romance but you blew your chance
Tryin' to play a double hand

[Verse 3]
You know that I'm weak for you, my boy
Oh, did you just come around to see
If your sweet and tender charms
Would still work out on me?
Well, even if it did (If it did)
You can still grab your hat (Grab your hat)
'Cause now I know the score

[Chorus]
Tighten up your tie (Tighten up)
Button up your jacket (Button up)
And make it for the door (Make it for the door)

Let it hit you in the back, make it for the door
(Tighten up your tie, woo, uh-huh)
You gotta choke yourself with that tie
(Button up your jacket, woo, uh-huh)
Go on and button up that shark skin
(Make it for the door, woo)
Baby, and make it for the door
(Tighten up your tie, woo, uh-huh)
Tighten up that tie right now

[Verse 1]
Don't get too comfortable, my boy
I’m expecting company
Don't you have somewhere else to go
Or do you just like to visit me?
You can't come around any time you please
Just like you did before

So tighten up your tie (Tighten up)
Button up that jacket (Button up)
And make it for the door (Make it for the door)

[Verse 1]
Dear, when you smiled at me, I heard a melody
It haunted me from the start
Something inside of me started a symphony
Zing went the strings of my heart
'Twas like a breath of spring, I heard a robin sing
About a nest set apart
And all nature seemed to be in perfect harmony
Zing went the strings of my heart

[Bridge]
Your eyes made skies seem blue again
But what else could I do again
But keep repeating through again
"I love you, I love you"

[Verse 2]
I still recall the thrill, and I guess I always will
I hope that we’ll never part
Dear, with your lips to mine, a rhapsody divine
Zing went the strings of my heart

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
I still recall the thrill, and I guess that always will
I hope that we'll never part
Dear, with your lips to mine, a rhapsody divine
Zing went the strings of my heart
Zing, zing, zing went the strings of my heart

[Intro]
Shangri-La, Shangri-La

[Verse 1]
Your kisses take me to Shangri-La
Each kiss is magic
That makes my little world a Shangri-La

[Bridge]
A land of bluebirds, fountains
And nothing to do
But cling to a lover just like you

[Outro]
And when you hold me, how warm you are
Be mine, my darling
And spend your life with me in Shangri-La
For anywhere you are is Shangri-La
(Shangri-La, Shangri-La)

[Verse]
Jim doesn't ever bring me pretty flowers
Jim never tries to cheer my lonely hours
I don't know why I'm so crazy for Jim

[Bridge]
Jim never tells me I'm his heart's desire
I never seem to set his love afire
Gone are the years that I've wasted on him
Sometimes when I get to feeling low
And I say "Let's call it quits"
Then I hang on and let him go
Breaking my heart into bits

[Outro]
Someday, someday I know Jim will up and leave me
But if he does, you can believe me
I'll go on carrying the torch for Jim (Jim)

[Verse 1]
The clown with his pants falling down
Or the dance that's a dream of romance
Or the scene where the villain is mean
That's entertainment
The lights on the lady in tights
Or the bride with the guy on her side
Or the ball where she gives them her all
That's entertainment

[Bridge]
The plot can be hot, simply teeming with sex
A gay divorcee who is after her ex
It can be Oedipus Rex
Where a chap kills his father and causes a lot of bother

[Verse 2]
The clerk who is thrown out of work
By the boss who is thrown for the loss
By the skirt who is doing him dirt
The world is a stage, the stage is the world of entertainment

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
The world is a stage, the stage is the world of entertain, entertain, entertainment

[Verse 1]
Love is funny or it’s sad
It’s quiet or it’s mad
It’s a good thing or it’s bad
So beautiful

[Bridge]
Beautiful to take a chance
And if you fall, you fall
And I’m thinking that I wouldn’t mind at all

[Verse 2]
Love is tearful or it’s gay
It’s a problem or it’s play
It’s a heartache anyway
But it’s still so beautiful

[Outro]
And I’m thinking, ooh, ooh, if you were mine
Why I’d never let you go
And this would be so beautiful, I know
This would be beautiful, I know

[Verse 1]
People, let me tell you, I work hard every day
I get up out of bed, I put on my clothes
'Cause I've got bills to pay
Now, it ain't easy, but I don't need no help
I've got a strong will to survive
I've got a deeper love, deeper love
Deeper love inside and I call it

[Chorus]
Pride, (A deeper love) pride, a deeper love
(Pride) A deeper love, woah woah woah woah
It's the power that gives you the strength to survive (Pride, pride)
(Pride, a deeper love, woah woah woah woah)

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, ooh yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
Now, I've got love in my heart, it gives me the strength
To make it through the day
Pride and love (Pride is) oh, respect for yourself
And that's why I'm not looking for
Handouts, charity, welfare, I don't need
Stealin', killin', not my feelin'
No backstabbin', greedy grabbin'
Lyin', cheatin' 'cause I've got a

[Pre-Chorus]
Deeper love, a deeper love
A deeper love inside
I, I, I, I, I've got a deeper love (Deeper)
A deeper love (Deeper)
Deeper love inside, and I call it

[Chorus]
(Pride) A deeper love, (Pride) a deeper love
(Pride, a deeper) Love, woah woah (Woah woah)
It's the power that gives you the strength to survive (Pride, pride)
(Pride, a deeper love, woah woah woah woah)

[Bridge]
And I wanna thank you for helping me see
There's a power that lives deep inside of me
Give me the strength (Give me the strength)
To carry on (To carry on), always be strong
Whoa oh oh oh whoa

[Outro]
(Pride) A deeper love, (Pride) a deeper love
(Pride) A deeper love, woah woah woah woah
(Pride) A deeper love, (Pride) a deeper love
(Pride) A deeper love, woah woah woah woah
(Pride) A deeper love, (Pride) a deeper love
(Pride) A deeper love, woah woah woah woah
It's the power that gives you the strength to survive (Pride, pride)
(Pride, a deeper love, woah woah woah woah)

[Verse 1]
In my solitude
You haunt me
With memories
Of days gone by
In my solitude
You taunt me
With memories
That never die

[Bridge]
I sit in my chair
I'm filled with despair
No one could be so sad
I sit and I stare
There's gloom everywhere
I know that I'll soon go mad

[Verse 2]
In my solitude
I pray
Dear Lord above
Please send back my love

[Bridge]
I sit in my chair
I'm filled with despair
No one, no one could be so sad
I sit and I stare
Oh, there's gloom everywhere
I know that I'll soon, I'll soon go mad

[Outro]
Oh, in my solitudе
I pray
Oh, dear Lord, dear Lord above
Sеnd back my love

[Intro]
My soul can't last
My soul can't last

[Verse 1]
Once in a while I will dream dear (I will dream dear)
Knowing dreams will seldom come true (I will dream dear)
Yes, but once in a while I will dream dear
And I hope you'll be thinking of me too
Yes, I must confess that I will miss you (I will miss you)
Like the stars would miss the sky (I will miss you)
Like a whale would miss its water
If it should ever happen to run dry

[Bridge]
Although I cried when you left me
Yes, I cried for a year and a day
You know my soul can't last, my soul just can't last
Please answer me right away

[Outro]
You know that my soul just can't last
My, my, my, my, my soul just can't last
Soul just can't last
Plеase answer me, plеase answer me
I said that my soul just can't last

[Verse]
I saw, I saw the harbor lights (Harbor lights)
They only told me we were parting
Same old harbor lights (Harbor lights)
That once brought you to me
I stood there and watched the harbor lights (Harbor lights)
How could I help if tears were starting
Goodbye to tender nights (Harbor lights)
Beside the silvery sea

[Bridge]
I long to hold you
And kiss you just once more
But you were on the sea
And I was on the shore

[Outro]
Now I, now I know lonely nights (Lonely nights)
For all the while my heart is whispering
Some other, other harbor lights (Harbor lights)
Will stеal your love from me

[Intro]
(Here's where I came in and here's where I walk out, oh, oh)

[Verse 1]
The scene looks familiar, only the cast has changed
And I know what the plot is all about
We're coming to the part where someone breaks a trusting heart
Here's where I came in and here's where I walk out (Oh, oh)

[Verse 2]
The part she is playing is the part I once played
The end will be the same without a doubt
He'll make you turn and go from the one who loves you so
Here's where I came in and here's where I walk out (Oh, oh)

[Outro]
Oh, oh, you reap just what you sow
Someone's stealing you away from me now (Oh, oh, oh)
So all that's left for me is to bow out gracefully
Here's where I came in and here's where I walk out (I walk out)
So all that's left for me is to bow out gracefully
Here's where I came in and here's where I walk out (I walk out)

[Intro]

Someone's stealing you away from me now (Oh, oh, oh)
So all that's left for me is to bow out gracefully
Here's where I came in and here's where I walk out (I walk out)
So all that's left for me is to bow out gracefully
Here's where I came in and here's where I walk out (I walk out)

[Intro]
(You've got her, so why not let me be? Let me be)

[Verse 1]
You said she means nothing to you
Yet she's always by your side
Now, just what do you expect me to do?
Just ignore it and be satisfied?

[Chorus]
Well, you've got her, so why not let me be? (Let me be)

[Bridge]
I know, I know, I'd never
Never have the nerve to say we're through, oh no, never
But if you say it, maybe I could find happiness, too, mmm, mmm, mmm

[Verse 2]
You said you never let me go
But do you think that's, that's being fair?
Now you take all, all the love I can give
And only give me yours to share

[Chorus]
Oh oh, you've got her, so why not let, why not let me be? (Let me be)

Give me just one chance, oh, one chance at happiness

You've got her, so why, why not, why not, why not let me be? (Let me be)
Let me be

[Verse 1]
Say it isn't so, say it isn't so
Everyone is saying that you don't love me
Say it isn't so
Everywhere I go, everyone I know
Whispers you're growing tired of me
Say it isn't so

[Verse 2]
People say that you, you found somebody new
And it won't be long before you leave me
Say it, say it, say it, say it isn't true
Tell me everything is still okay
That's all I need to know and what they're saying
Say it isn’t so

[Outro]
Say that everything is still okay, yeah, yeah
That's all I need to know, if you just say it to me
Please say it isn't so

Keep your hands off of him

No matter what you say or do, don't mean a thing

[Verse 1]
Kinda tall and lanky
About six foot two
What he does for me, sweetie
He ain't gon' do for you

[Chorus]
Keep your hands off of him
He don't belong to you, said he don't
He is mine, all mine
No matter what you say or do

[Verse 2]
Don't let my being quiet
Give you the nerve to go ahead
If I have to say it again
I'm gonna back of what I've said

[Chorus]
Keep your hands off of him
He don't belong to you, woo, alright
He is mine, all mine
No matter what you say or do, don't mean a thing

[Outro]
Hands off of him, mine, all mine
Keep your hands off of him, mine, all mine
Keep your potato peelers off him, girl, mine, all mine, yeah yeah
Hands off of him, he belongs to me, yes, he does
Woo, don't mean a thing
Woo, don't mean a thing
Yeah, hands off of him
Better beware, keep your hands off him

[Verse 1]
People, people who need people
Are the luckiest people in the world
We're children, needing other children
And yet letting our grown-up pride
Hide all the need inside
Acting more like children than children

[Verse 2]
Lovers are very special, special people
'Cause they're the luckiest people in the world
One person, just one very special person
A feeling so deep in your soul
Says you were half now you're whole
No more hunger and thirst
But first, be a person who needs people

[Outro]
People, people who need people
Are the luckiest people in the world

About you I was cryin'

[Verse]
Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like eskimos
Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

[Bridge]
They know that Santa is on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly

[Outro]
And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry, Merry Christmas to all of you

[Verse 1]
This is the end station
But I can't move away from you
This is the edge of patience
But you won't prove yourself to me
Still you drain my soul and

[Chorus]
Even though it hurts, I can't slow down
Walls are closing in and I hit the ground
Whispers of tomorrow echo in my mind
Just one last time
Even though it hurts, I can't slow down
Walls are closing in and I hit the ground
Whispers of tomorrow echo in my mind
Just one last time

[Chorus]
Even though it hurts, I can't slow down
Walls are closing in and I hit the ground
Whispers of tomorrow echo in my mind
Just one last time
Even though it hurts, I can't slow down
Walls are closing in and I hit the ground
Whispers of tomorrow echo in my mind
Just one last time
Just one last time
It's not a competition
But maybe it is
And I think I'll win when you least expect it
Slip off your socks and then
Take her to bed
I will show up when you least expect it

I always do

But I think I found someone to buffer the pain
I think I found what you have in your veins
So I'll never lose
And it's never true
I lie every day
But I will always hate losing to you

It's not a competition
But I moved on first
And you must have something to say about it
Tell all your friends that I hurt you worse
Cause you know I'll have something to say about it
I always do

But I think I found someone to buffеr the pain
I think I found what you have in your veins
So I'll nеver lose
And it's never true
I lie every day
But I will always hate losing to you

I thought I found someone to buffer the pain
But it didn't last and it wasn't the same
Still I'll never lose
But he's never you
I lie every day

I thought I found someone, or that's just what I say
To help keep the devil and his dogs away
It's an ego thing, true
But it's time you knew
I die every day
Cause I will always wait for you
Hey, I barely know you
But is it cool if I say hello?
Hey, I want to know you
Is that okay? Are you comfortable?

And if I fall
I blame the whiskey, I blame my mind
And if your lips happen to kiss me
I will be fine, fine, fine
Pour me another glass of wine

Hey, you barely know me
But is it cool if I talk for hours?
Hey, you could show me
What it is that's in that head of yours

And if I fall
I blame the moonlight, I blame your smile
And if I fall, I know that soon I'll be alright
Pour me another glass of wine
And if I cry
You won't mind

Who knows where?
Who knows where love goes when it dies?
How can a new lovе, tangled in you love, arise?
Who can say?
Who can say how wе fell for each other?
Every day I notice your gray eyes and I am pulled into another dream Another wish
A place in my mind where you and I can exist
I dream about it all the time
I see you and I wish you were mine
I don't know who you are anymore
I can't keep fighting this unwinnable war
I'm tired, and hopeless, but I'd do it
A million times more

I don't know if I'm right anymore
You are the one thing I constantly look for
In the crowd, I'm broken, but I'll find you
So don't close the door

I have loved you
Since the first day we met
I will always love you
I'm gonna tell you, but not quite yet

Cause I know you're broken
And I'm sorry for that
Love is war, love is pain
Hey wait, what's your name?
I can't remember what you told me a few minutes ago
Do I think that life is fair?
Do I think that fuckboys care somewhere deep inside them?
Do you want to know?
Do you want to go there?

I hate a lot of things, but you're not one of them
You wanna know why?
Bet you wanna know
I like you
A lot I guess
It's weird and I'm awkward but i don't know
You just make sense
Maybe it's just me being me
And weird and awkward and quiet and shy
And sometimes extroverted but a lot of times introvеrted
And why am I still talking about me?
Let's talk about you
I likе you
So let's talk about you, okay
Love is war, love is pain
Love is too much too explain
I'd like to try but I don't think I'm qualified for that kind of a job
All I know is that it's not a hobby, a gig on the side
It's something you feel inside
Deep down
Maybe even so far down you really have to dig around down there to find it
It might keep getting lost in the dirt but
Do you want to know something?
I found it when I stopped to search
(yea, that's crazy)
Yea, that love is in the past
Buried in an unmarked grave but
I don't need to search for it anymore because I'm finally center stage
With someone I care about
That's crazy man
That life can work like that
It really fucks you up
But sometimes it can feel
It can feel sometimes
Life can feel like the greatest fuck up ever
Whether or not you're crying doesn't determine if you're happy or sad
It just means you like to cry
And that's cool because so do I
Whoops, my God
I just exposed myself
That's okay though, this is honest and real
Honestly real
Like, I'm honestly...
Honestly I'm real scared of feeling feelings again
Singing again about those feelings I'm feeling again
Really, that shit again?
I hate a lot of things, but you're not one of them
You wanna know why?
Bet you wanna know
I like you
A lot I guess
It's weird and I'm awkward but I don't know
You just make sense
Maybe it's just me being me
And that's cool, but can me and you do something too?
I don't know

[laughs] Let's talk about you
I don't really know where this is going
Just trying to be Hobo Johnson
Shout out to the man, the myth, the legend
The inspiration for this train of thought that should have ended hours ago
Weeks ago
Oh wait, then there's you
I almost forgot
No I didn't, I'm just saying that so I don't look weird for thinking about you all the God damn time
(all the time)
Rhymes are hard, I think I'm done for the night
You're cute let's hang out sometime

I hate a lot of things, but you're not one of them
You wanna know why?
Bet you wanna know
I like you
A lot I guess
It's weird and I'm awkward but I don't know
You just make sense
Maybe it's just me being me
But who else should I be?
I like being me and alone
And I like pizza
And calzones
(calzones are so fucking good, man)
And you're pretty cute, I don't know
Let's talk about you
Let's talk about you
I want to know about you
Let's talk about you
Happy lies
Sheltered lives
Who knows where
We go when we die?
If we're good do we get a prize?

Can I say
By the way
I like the way you smile when I cry
Do you need to know why?

We fall and then we fall again
We talk but do we really make amends
Tell me what's wrong I'll write a song
You light the bong and we'll forget, again

We wanna change but do we know how?
We're comfortable and so we stay out of it
Let it run its course
Say no more and I'll pretend it doesn't exist
We're perfect
Perfectly fucked, certainly screwed
But isn't that how you sing the in denial blues
We can argue then sit
Staring up at walls too thick to punch through
But that's what happens with the in denial blues

Happy lies
Bloodshot eyes
I'm okay but are you alright?
If I guess do I get a prize?

Say my name
No more blame
I like the way you yell when I cry
I don't know why

We fall and then we fall again
We talk but do we really make amends
Tell me what's wrong I'll write a song
You light the bong and we'll forget, again

We wanna change but do we know how?
I love you but it seems we've grown out of it
I care about you, always got you
Never doubt my love cause it's that real shit
We're perfect
Perfectly fucked, certainly screwed
But isn't that how you sing the in denial blues
We can argue then sit
Staring up at walls too thick to punch through
But that's what happens with the in denial blues

[Intro: Busta Rhymes & Haddaway]
Yeah (Yeah, yeah)
I-I-I'm in a different space in my life, you know
It's a real good space too
Ayo Eminem, I like this song, man (No love)
By the time y'all hear this, Weezy probably be home
Welcome home, Weezy
Reek Da Villain, what up? (Don't hurt me, don't hurt me, no more)
Ayo
Let me tell y'all niggas about one of the little tough guy dreams
I just had the other night
Look (No love)

[Verse 1: Busta Rhymes & Haddaway]
First I, stop it, then I drop it, then I cock another heater
Pop another leader, from another cliquе that thought he was a creature
That could nеver never (Ever) ever ever (Ever)
Ever get his shit popped off (GET HIS BLOCK KNOCKED OFF!)
When a nigga come and when a nigga front
Gotta give it to 'em good, give a nigga what he want (Huh!)
And if a nigga act up, shoot 'em in the hand
In the face, in the stomach, in the foot, or the heart (Love)
You don't want it, homie, you don't wanna start
Especially when a motherfucker see the gun fire spark
(You don't want no problems)
When I got the gun up in your mouth, I make a nigga gun talk
Bus Rhymes Reek (Black!)
I'mma hit 'em in the front, homie hit 'em in the back (Huh)
Keep on hittin' that nigga in the chest cavity
Till that motherfucker lay down flat (Freeze motherfucker, look!)
Trust me, I'mma make a nigga sit still (Still)
Anytime I gotta defend the food, nigga
It don't matter what it is, homie, I will (Will)
Beat a nigga till your brother can't figure it out
Or i-dentify the motherfucker on the real (Real)
Word on everything a nigga really love
It don't matter who it is, homie, I kill
But now I'm finally waking up outta the dream
And I realize that life is so beautiful
And I ain't gotta put my hand on a nigga
Unless it's definitely necessary, otherwise, it's unsuitable (Ha)
Going through a lot of different little things
That make a nigga wanna go and wanna get in when I bring
A couple goons, that can handle couple situations
And I let 'em eliminate all the bullshit so I can (Sing!)
Run though every city, run though every state
Though we get a lot of love, I love to get a lot of hate
Though the ones who will try to hate will start to love
'Cause it's undeniable that everything I do is great
Even when I do it wrong, I'mma share it in a song
And I question, is it worth it in the end all along?
I guess I gotta die first return reincarnated
Just to really witness it in another form
But until that time, I'll embellish it and shine
While I set in wit' the grind, give me credit when it's mine
Boy, I dead it like a nine millimeter, see the sign and the heater
That I'm givin all my people get in line now
Yeah, for the ones that hate
Or try to stop my growth in the light from above
When I fight I hold a grudge, it's a Kanye shrug
See the way I make 'em bug, motherfucker, don't no (Love)

[Chorus: Eminem, Lil Wayne Both & Haddaway]
It's a little too late to say that you're sorry now (*Yeah*)
You kicked me when I was down
But what you say just don't Hurt me
*That's right*, it don't Hurt me
And I don't need you No more
Don't wanna see you No more
*Ha, bitch*, you get no Love
You showed me nothing but hate (*Haha!*)
You ran me into the ground
But what comes around goes around (*Yeah*)
And I don't need you Don't hurt me
That's right, you don't Hurt me
And I don't need you No more
Don't wanna see you
*Ha, bitch*, you get No love
No! No love No! No love No! No love
*Ha, bitch*, you get No love
No! No love No! No love
*And I don't need you *No more
*Get 'em!*

[Verse 2: Eminem, Lil Wayne, & Both]
I'm alive again, more alive than I have been
In my whole entire life, I can (Yeah)
See these people's ears perk up as I begin to spaz with the pen
Uh, I'm a little bit sicker than most
Shit's finna get thick again, they say the competition is stiff
But I get a hard dick from this shit, now stick it in
I ain't never giving in again (Yeah)
Caution to the wind, complete freedom
Look at these rappers, how I treat 'em
So why the fuck would I join 'em when I beat 'em? (Yeah!)
They call me a freak, 'cause I like to
Spit on these pussies 'fore I eat 'em (Haha)
Man, get these wack cocksuckers off stage!
Where the fuck is Kanye when you need him? (Oh!)
Snatch the mic from 'em, bitch, I'ma let you finish in a minute
Yeah, that rap was tight, but I'm (Yeah!)
'Bout to spit the greatest verse of all time
So you might want to go back to the lab tonight and, um (Yeah!)
Scribble out them rhymes you were gonna spit
And start over from scratch and write new ones
But I'm afraid that it ain't gonna make no difference
When I rip this stage and tear it in half tonight
It's an adrenaline rush to feel the bass thump
From the place all the way to the parking lot, fellow
Set fire to the mic and ignite the crowd (Yeah)
You can see the sparks from hot metal (Yeah)
Cold-hearted, from the day I Bogarted
The game, my soul started to rot, fellow (Yeah)
When I'm not even in my harshest
You can still get roasted, ‘cause Marsh is not mellow
'Til I'm topplin' from the top, I'm not gonna stop
I'm standin' on my Monopoly board (Uh)
That means I'm on top of my game
And it don't stop 'til my hip don't hop anymore (Shit)
When you're so good that you can't say it
‘Cause it ain't even cool for you to sound cocky anymore (Shit)
People just get sick ‘cause you spit
These fools can't drool or dribble a drop anymore (Ow!)
And you can never break my stride (Nope)
You'll never slow the momentum at any moment
I'm 'bout to blow, you'll never take my pride
Killin' the flow, slow venom
And the opponent is gettin' no mercy, mark my words
Ain't lettin' up, relentless, I smell blood
I don't give a fuck, keep givin' them hell
Where was you when I fell and needed help up?
You get no love

[Chorus: Eminem, *Lil Wayne*, Both, & Haddaway]
It's a little too late to say that you're sorry now (*Yeah*)
You kicked me when I was down
But what you say just don't Hurt me
*That's right*, it don't Hurt me
And I don't need you No more
Don't wanna see you No more
*Ha, bitch*, you get no Love
You showed me nothing but hate (*Haha!*)
You ran me into the ground
But what comes around goes around (*Yeah*)
And I don't need you Don't hurt me
That's right, you don't Hurt me
And I don't need you No more
Don't wanna see you
*Ha, bitch*, you get No love
No! No love No! No love No! No love
*Ha, bitch*, you get No love

My anaconda don't, my anaconda don't
My anaconda don't want none unless you got buns, hun

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Boy toy named Troy used to live in Detroit
Bi-big, big, big money, he was gettin' some coins
Was in shootouts with the law, but he live in a palace
Bo-bought me Alexander McQueen, he was keeping me stylish
Now that's real, real, real
One in my purse, 'cause I came dressed to kill
Who wanna go first? I had them pushing daffodils
I'm fly as hell, I got 'em thirsty, track and field
I'm on some dumb sh-

And he telling me it's real, that he love my sex appeal
Say he don't like 'em boney, he want something he can grab
So I pulled up in the Jag, and I hit him with the jab like

Real country anaconda, let me play with his rifles
P-p-put his butt to sleep, now he calling me NyQuil
Now that bang, bang, bang

All in his- like his name Romaine
And when we done, I make him buy me Balmain

[Spoken Word]
In the name of Jesus, let us pray
Father, please walk with us through the bad times, as well as the good
May we be heard and understood, from the suburbs to the hood
May you judge us by our hearts and not by our mistakes
And see that we get our breakthrough, however long that it takes
May you fill that void in our souls and lay our fears to rest
For there's no way we could live with Jesus, when we're living in the flesh
So I pray that you will allow our spirits to be born
Grow strong, move on, know right from wrong
First John, chapter two, versе fifteen
"Do not love the world or anything in the world," and wе know what that means
But listen
We know that distance we need to be away from fire to keep it missin'
But that doesn't mean we'll listen
Lord, you take care of fools and babies
You teach women to honor their men and men to respect their ladies
But lately, so many of us have gone astray
Doing wrong for so long that we've forgotten the way
Please, bring us back home
And instill in us the Word which is our backbone
We're just children that act grown
There is so much we're entitled to
Yet, we receive so little
Because this time in our spiritual warfare
We are comfortable in the middle
So I pray that you open our eyes
Give us the anointing to recognize the devil and his lies
If we keeps our actions wise, our prayers sincere
Our heads to the sky, you will diminish our fears
In Jesus' mighty name, we are brave, amen
She's everything thing for me
There ain't nothing she won't do for me
And every man wants a girl like her
No price compares to what she's worth, oh

She saved my life in so many ways
Cause when darkness come she my break of day
And I know I'm blessed with what I got, yeah
But still I can't seem to tie that knot
Somebody help me

How do I tell my girl that something came up
And the plans has changed?
How do I?
How do I tell my girl that I'm not gonna be able to make it?
I'm going away
Tell me how?
How do I tеll my girl that I'm sorry, baby but I just can't?
Tell me how do I look her in hеr face
And have the nerve to say that I'm not ready?
On our wedding day
Now we have both been together since our rawing pascal days
We done walk through all kind of stormy weather
And we have both shared each others things
No one can ever come between us two
And I bet my breath that things would never, ever change
Now this were a marriage we vowed to
All of a sudden seems so strange
Somebody help me, yeah

How do I tell my girl
(How do I?)

Ohh ohh yeah


I love the way you hate the way i steal your bed
I love the way you dont say my name its calming baby
If i said your name is bulletface and act like your offended
If you dont say love you
Sometimes you're happy sometimes you frown
With your hormones bouncing up and down
Sometimes you're happy sometimes you're sad
It's a weird nine months with you I've had
There is shit going down that you can't disguise
When you boobs gone up ten times in size
Your cups gone up from an A to D
Its bad for you but its fun for me

Now just because a little rumpy pump
Now you're walking round with a great big bump
You might think a bit of French and you should have said non
Or at least you would have made me put a condom on
I think you might find that its really fun
I know its no use unless you make it bun
Its something to learn yeah it really is
Now you know what that sticky stuff is

[Chorus]
I'll be there with you baby through the thin and the thick
I'm gonna clean up all the poo and the sick
I'll be there to make you happy and keep everything clean
I'll change the nappies through the washing machine
'Cause I ain't no baddy, I ain't no baddy
I ain't no baddy, I am your baby's daddy
Oh! Who!

Sometimes you think "what a fool I am"
And "Why did i marry this awful man?"
Now a baby's part of my family plan
Can it kick me? Well, yes it can
My name's Ken and I've got three
Do you like being a daddy?
Yeah, definitely!
Well I have to warn you although it's fun
There are times when you wish you had been a nun

[Chorus]
I'll be there with you baby through the thin and the thick
I'm gonna clean up all the poo and the sick
I'll be there to make you happy and I'll bring in the bread
I'll be the nanny you can go out instead

I know that you'll be grumpy, that's what everyone says
And you're not going to hump me for 43 days
If you don't want more babies and you cannot disguise it
Then I'll take my cock and vasectimize it

'Cause I ain't no baddy, I ain't no baddy
Sometimes I make you saddy
I ain't no baddy
I ain't no baddy I ain't no baddy I am your baby's daddy
Mother!
Mother!
I ain't no baddy I ain't no baddy
I ain't no baddy I am your baby's daddy
Ho!
Break it down now
She told me to crawl this way, bawl this way
She told me to crawl this way, bawl this way
She told me to crawl this way, bawl this way
She told me to crawl this way, bawl this way

[Chorus: Luke & Tyga]

Press on your bitch and I press on the gas
My bitch bad, body bad
She bounce on my dick and she do it no hands
Fuck up the ceilin', I'm throwin' up bands
My bitches is naughty (Hey, we want some pussy), they curvy and grimy
They step on a nigga and make a deposit
They, "Beam me up, Scotty" (Hey, we want some pussy), they always beside me
The Glock is behind me, boy, don't you remind me, bitch (Let me hear you say)
Wait, all in my face (Ayy, we want some pussy)

She call me Superman, no cape
Hit it once, then I skate, bitch (Bitch, bitch)

Make it splash (Splash), pop that (Go), ass

[Verse 2: Moneybagg Yo & Luke]
Gon' do it off the rip, but she get wetter when I beg for it (Please)
Backshots 'til she tap out, arch her back and push her head forward (Go, go)
Fucked her 'til her nigga got off work, snuck out when he wasn't lookin' (Shh, shh)
He like, "Bae, why it smell like badussy?" (What?) Booty, dick, and pussy (Let me hear you say)
I'm closer to a pimp than a simp
Big racks make me walk with a limp
That's your bitch? For now, she a temp
See me poppin' shit and flipped the script on you (Ha)
Want her a nigga right now with some different type of money
Take her somewhere out the country (Go)
Made her nut more than twice, she high off of life
Now eat me like you got the munchies (Mmm, let me hear you say, "Hey, we want some pussy")
Twerk like she need to be fucked good (Fucked good)
Yeah (Hey), she (We), want some ooh-ooh (Ooh-ooh, pussy, let me hear you say, "Hey, we want some pussy")
You can tell her last nigga didn't lay wood (Not at all, hey, we want some pussy)
Got her out here lookin' for a good jugg

[Chorus: Luke, Tyga, Luke & Tyga, (Luke & Moneybagg Yo)]
(Let me hear you say), "Hey, we want some pussy" (Yeah)

[Intro]
I've been drinking liquor
I've been drinking liquor, before I called you on the phone
I think that you should kick her out
Kick her out the house, so you and I can be alone

[Verse]
You will be amazed, I can flip your brain
Make you feel what you’ve been missin'
Know it’s really wrong, but what if it’s love?
I just gotta ask you again

[Bridge]
Cause lately, lately
I’ve been drinking baby, baby
Yeah, I've been sipping all day
Yeah, I've been sipping all day

[Chorus]
I've been drinking liquor
I've been drinking liquor before I called you on the phone
I think that you should kick her out, kick her out the house
So you and I can be alone
Wish you'd answer my call, get in my bed
Come to my house, fuck with my head
I've been drinkin', yeah
I've been drinking liquor
I've been drinking liquor before I called you on the phone

[Bridge]
Cause lately, lately
I’ve been drinking baby, baby
Yeah, I've been sipping all day
Yeah, I've been sipping all day

[Pre-Chorus]
And maybe, maybe, I was thinking you could save me
Yeah, I've been sipping all day, thinking you would call me

[Chorus]
I've been drinking liquor
I've been drinking liquor before I called you on the phone
Think that you should kick her out, kick her out the house
So you and I can be alone
Wish you'd answer my call, get in my bed
Come to my house, fuck with my head
I've been drinkin', yeah
I've been drinking liquor
I've been drinking liquor before I called you on the phone

[Verse 1]
Here I am, oh
All night, all night, takin' me, oh
Lay awake in bed and I'm alone
(Remembering)
Runnin' through my brain and I'm searchin' for you, oh no
(I'm remembering)
Missin' someone in my life, see, I'm in trouble
And every time I close my eyes, I see her face, see I'm in trouble
No, I can't forget her at all, haunting me
And I'm wishin' you were mine, all for me

[Chorus]
Life goes by
Search for your love wherever it be
Life goes by
I need your love all over me
Life goes by
Search for your love wherever it be
Life goes by
Oh, I need your love all over me

[Post-Chorus]

[Verse 2]
You're a star, I worship you
Didn't you know? How couldn't you?
As she laughs, sun's shinin' through
You're my drug, my dose of truth
Anywhere, all you
As you lay beside me
Just us two, who knew
You'd be my everything?
(Here I am, oh, here I am, oh)
All night, all night, takin' me, oh
(Girl, you're takin' me, oh, girl, you're takin'—)

Search for your love wherever it be
Life goes by
I need your love all over me
Life goes by
Search for your love wherever it be
Life goes by
Oh, I need your love all over me

Oh, I can't trust a soul shit get *UNAUDIOBLE*
My last bitch with a new man doing shit I did
Going places I...

[Chorus: Britney Spears & (Shayne Ward)]
Must be a reason why I'm king of my castle (Oh)
Must be a reason why I'm free in my trapped soul (And I)
Must be a reason why I'm king of my castle (Oh)
Must be a reason why I'm making examples of you

[Verse 1: Shayne Ward & (Britney Spears)]
It started in my mind
Not limited by where I'm at in my life
Only I can ever change it up
Kinda stuck but I made my luck (Of you)
And I know I gotta take control
I don't wanna ever lean on you
You're defined by what you own
But my soul is rich on its own
I don't ever wanna bow down a lot
All I wanna do is call the shot (Oh)
Ain't nobody got me on speed dial
In my head, I'm ahead by a mile (Of you)
Moving on to bigger, better things
In my brain, I'm the only king (Oh)
Don't need you
That's how I get through

[Chorus: Britney Spears & (Shayne Ward)]
(Oh) Must be a reason why I'm king of my castle (Oh)
Must be a reason why I'm free In my trapped soul (And I)
Must be a reason why I'm king of my castle (Oh)
Must be a reason why I'm making examples of you
Of you, of you, of you, of you

[Verse 2: Shayne Ward & (Britney Spears)]
Independent song
Only I can ever right my wrong (Oh)
I don't jump when you hit the gong
And in my mind, I design how long (Ooh)
Don't you start thinking I'm working for you?
Deep in my heart, yo, I do what I do (Oh)
Gotta 'cause I gotta eat when I'm free
Feeling the heat underneath my feet
Moving on to bigger, better things
In my brain I'm the only king (Oh)
Don't need you
That's how I get through

[Chorus: Britney Spears & (Shayne Ward)]
(Oh) Must be a reason why I'm king of my castle (Oh)
Must be a reason why I'm free In my trapped soul (And I)
Must be a reason why I'm king of my castle (Oh)
Must be a reason why I'm making examples of you

[Bridge: Britney Spears & (Shayne Ward)]
Must be the reason
Why I'm king of
Must be the reason
Why I'm king of (Let's go, Let's go)
Ooh, I want that soul control (It's mine)
Ooh, I want that soul control
Ooh, I want that soul control (Let's go, Let's go)
Ooh, I want that
Ooh, I want that
Soul

Huh
Yeah, yeah, yeah (Aw man), yeah

[Verse]
If the bitch got a paper plane by her bed, that mean that she fuck with Khalifa
Rollin' up Js and pourin' out shots, I figured you'd know the procedure
I got a son at home that really need me
I got a baby-mom, know how to treat her
I got a bitch that pray that I don't leave her
I got a team that's gon' win every season
I got a pound to smoke, now I don't need one
Double-R, customized features
Work sixteen hours, seven days a week
Money, we count it 'cause that's the routine to us
If the bitch got a paper planе by her bed, that mean that shе fuck with Khalifa
Zoomin' on pictures to check the details 'cause bitches these days'll deceive ya
Yeah, yeah
Always keep a trick on my sleeve and I'm always in the air, air
Floatin' past, make 'em notice when they see me
I can take a nigga bitch, man, that's so easy
To go out and get these mills, I got more reasons
I be in the crib playin' with my kid
Playin' ball on Zoom calls with his teachers
I'ma give 'em more than a little teaser
Playin' fourth quarter, I know how to clean up
She blowin' biscotti, say she wanna beam up
I stay organizin' and they wanna team up
Then I be like "Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah"
Aim first class but her legs in the air
Stay on her mind when I fuck up her hair
Don't fuck for a check, baby, fuck for respect
Fuck up a check on a comfortable set
Yeah, yeah, ride for my niggas, I love 'em to death
If the bitch got a paper plane by her bed, that mean that she fuckin' a Taylor
Niggas be sayin' they comfortable just to disguise the fact that they lazy
Niggas be tellin' they bitch that they know that I fucked just to hope she debate it
The way you see me and my niggas come up, you would think that we all was related
Came from the bottom, my circle is small, can't come to my crib 'cause it's gated
Look at my checks and I get hella paid, I don't care if I get underrated
Look at the pool in the back of my crib, see me smokin' a joint, meditatin'
Lot of young Wiz immitations
Nobu, I need reservations
They be like "Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah"
Pulled up in a red low-rider, put the yellow tail right there (Yellow tail right there)
Pussy real good when I go down on it, she smell like air (She smell like air)

[Outro]
That's hard

[Chorus: Ryan Beatty & Kevin Abstract, & Kevin Abstract]
Chicago was everything I wanted
(I feel so outside of the moment, all I know is you're better for me)
Whichever way you go, you know I run
(I want someone better for me
I always wanna see you when I wake in the morning)
Chicago was everything I wanted
(I feel so outside of the moment, all I know is you're better for me)
Whichever way you go, you know I run
(I want someone better for me
I always wanna see you when I wake in the morning)

[Verse 1: Matt Champion]
'Cause you're all out thе door for me, I need a hot dog
Causing havoc in the streets, I tell my nеighbors "pipe down!"
Talkin', movin' through the sound, it's on the kitchen table now
Say you like the honest feel, conversation out of here
I like when my hair lay inside the sun, I don't run
It's not winter, it's not spring
I am sprung, I am sprung
Somethin' feel right, somethin' feel right

[Interlude: Ryan Beatty]
Always keeping your heart with me, babe
Well, it appears that you must begin from two experiences, on which our visual world is based
Always keeping your heart with me, babe

[Verse 2: bearface & Ryan Beatty]
I miss the fog
You're caught in the dark
I miss the fog
You're caught in the dark
I miss the fog
You're caught in the dark
(Always keeping your heart with me, babe)

[Bridge: Ryan Beatty, JOBA, & Kevin Abstract]
Always keeping your heart with me, babe
Always keeping your heart with me, babe (Ooh)
Always what you wanted, ain't it?
Always what you wanted, ain't it?
-wanted, ain't it?
-wanted, ain't it?

[Chorus: Ryan Beatty & Kevin Abstract, Kevin Abstract]
Chicago was everything I wanted
(I feel so outside of the moment, all I know is you're better for me)
Whichever way you go, you know I run
(I want someone better for me
I always wanna see you when I wake in the morning)
Chicago was everything I wanted
(I feel so outside of the moment, all I know is you're better for me)
Whichever way you go, you know I run
(I want someone better for me
I always wanna see you when I wake in the morning)

[Verse 1]
I think of you when the wind blows
I see your face almost everywhere
Sure, maybe Salt Lake is not close
But I'm still breathin' you in the air

[Chorus]
Because the best part is knowin'
There's somethin' in my dreams that always makes me smile
It's you
The best part is knowin'
There's someone in my life that makes it all worthwhile
It's you

[Verse 2]
When I don't know what to do
Know I'm never givin' up, never givin' up on you, baby
There's no need to be blue

[Chorus]
Bеcause the best part is knowin'
Thеre's somethin' in my dreams that always makes me smile
It's you
The best part is knowin'
There's someone in my life that makes it all worthwhile
It's you

[Outro]
You, you
You, you, it's you
It's you

I'm 'bout to turn my Air Force 1's into a Gucci shoe (Yeah)
I'm 'bout to turn my Timberlands into a Yeezy boot (Oh)
My president black, bandana is blue (You know what I'm sayin'?)
Diamonds hittin', got me glistenin' like I came out the pool
I'm so exotic, like I came out the zoo (No)
But I shot out the coupe (No)
Got the scope with a clear eye view, woo
My boy Swizz hit me up I'm like, "Hallelujah" (Yo Swizz)
They know I'ma do you, aimin' for medulla
Turn my blunt Medusa ('Dusa)
Cooler than a cooler (Cooler)

And we don't do it on the net we do it face to face
But if you talkin' on that net I put you on your face (On your face)
Cartier's and Pierre's for a week straight (Cartier)
But if you lookin' for me you know where I'm at (You know where I'm at)
No more hot dogs, only steak and mash (Yeah, yeah)
I got like a hundred guns in the stash (Grr)
Never went to school, huh, but I always passed (Pow)

[Chorus: DMX]
Money, money, money (Uh), bitches, bitches, bitches (What?)
All these fucking killers, but the jail's full of snitches (Snitches)
A dollar ain't got a fucking thing to do with riches
Say cheese, now I got pictures of what a bitch is (Woo, c'mon)
Money, money, money (Money), bitches, bitches, bitches (Bitches)
All these fucking killers, but the jail's full of snitches (Raow)
A dollar ain't got a fucking thing to do with riches
Say cheese, now I got pictures of what a bitch is (Woo)

[Verse 2: DMX]
When the dog get hungry, the dog gon' eat
That's when I slide my plate right under a nigga feet
Like the lines in the road, I get down in the street
Come through like "brrap," put them cats to sleep
Stay with the heat, cook niggas (Uh), shook niggas (Uh)
Me and mine come through, we nothing but crook niggas (Uh, uh)
We off the hook, nigga (What up?), everybody strip (Yeah)
Everybody get down 'cause my niggas flip (Raow)

Make niggas rape niggas, I hate niggas (Uh)
Talking that riff-raff, get back (What?)
They call me "Extortion", nigga, I get half (Woo)

[Chorus: DMX]
Money, money, money (Money), bitches, bitches, bitches (Bitches)
All these fucking killers, but the jail's full of snitches (Snitches)
A dollar ain't got a fucking thing to do with riches
Say cheese, now I got pictures of what a bitch is (C'mon)
Money, money, money (Money), bitches, bitches, bitches (Bitches)
All these fucking killers (C'mon), but the jail's full of snitches (What?)
A dollar ain't got a fucking thing to do with riches
Say cheese, now I got pictures of what a bitch is (Woo)

[Verse 1: Pusha T]
Mama Mavis, oh, Mama, they tried my patience
Obama is gone, who is left to save us?
Orlando, we mourn, I'm praying for my neighbors
They say the devil's at work and Trump is calling favors
You say I'm dangerous, I speak for the nameless
I fly with the vultures, I be with them bangers
If change don't come, then the change won't come
If the bands make 'em dance, then the rain gon' come
. (Woo!)

[Chorus: Mavis Staples]
Am I passing into the light, am I looking into your eyes? (Look into you eyes!)
All the world is outta your hands
At the pass of Another light. (Another night!)
You got to die a little, if you wanna live. (If you wanna live!)
Change- Oh change is coming
You best be ready for it

[Verse 2: Pusha T]
Look into my eyes, mama, tell me what you see
Tell me there's a chance for me to make it off the streets
Tell me that I won't die at the hands of the police
Promise me I won't outlive my nephew and my niece
Promise me my pastor isn't lyin' as he preach
Tell me that they'll listen if it's lessons that I teach
Tell me there's a heaven in the sky where there is peace
But until then, I keep my piece in arm's reach

[Chorus: Mavis Staples]
Am I passing into the light, am I looking into your eyes? (Look into you eyes!)
All the world is outta your hands
At the pass of Another light. (Another night!)
You got to die a little, if you wanna live. (If you wanna live!)
Change- Oh change is coming
You best be ready for it

[Verse 3: Pusha T]
Mama, you birthed a soldier
Born ready, born colder
Transformed to a heat holder
Ghetto teenagers with the world on our shoulders
They wonder why some are bipolar
They say it's high risk for high rollers
I've been one, so I'd know 'em
Experienced in the black market so I'd show 'em
How to build it from ground up and bounce up
Ownin' everything that surrounds up from ounces. (Aaah!)

[Chorus: Mavis Staples]
Am I passing into the light, am I looking into your eyes? (Look into you eyes!)
All the world is outta your hands
At the pass of Another light. (Another night!)
You got to die a little, if you wanna live. (If you wanna live!)
Change- Oh change is coming
You best ready-ady-ady-ady
Uh, uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh
Day and night (what, what)

The pain is deep (what, what)
A silent sleeper you won't hear a peep, peep (what, what)
The girl he wants don't seem to want him to (what, what)
It seems the feelings that she had are through, through
'Cause day and night (day and night)

Memories surround me
But sadness has found me
I'd do anything for more time
Never before has someone meant more
And I can't get you out of my mind

There is so much that I don't understand
But I know

[Chorus]
You're dancing with the angels
Walking in new life
You're dancing with the angels
Heaven fills your eyes
Now that you're dancing with the angels

You had love for your family
Love for all people
Love for the Father, and Son
Your heart will be heard
In your unspoken words
Through generations to come
There is so much that I don't understand
But I know

[Chorus]
You're dancing with the angels
Walking in new life
You're dancing with the angels
Heaven fills your eyes
Now that you're dancing with the angels

[Bridge]
We're only here for such a short time
So I'm gonna' stand up, shout out
And sing Hallelujah
One day I'll see you again

[Chorus]
You're dancing with the angels
Walking in new life
You're dancing with the angels
Heaven fills your eyes
Now that you're dancing with the angels

[Part 1: FRAGMENTS]

[Intro: bearface]
Ooh, ahh
Oh no, no, no
Nothing will matter
Nothing will matter

[Verse 1: Dom McLennon]
I watched a lot of niggas lie like it's the truth
I've been staying down to Earth, digging deeper by the roots
Have a conscious and my confidence, they down to make a truce
When they stop aiming at each other, that's the strongest I'ma shoot, look
I'm from the trenches, but I never get salutes
All these fragments of myself make the human y'all dispute
Turned the memories to melodies, my life was like a loop
When you ballin' for a reason you see more than just the hoop, nigga
I'm out for dead presidents for every dead homie
They throwin' anchors on my boat but that shit can't hold me
Dedicate this shit to anyone who think they know me
Living off of how it sounds but never listened closely
Before you tell me who I am, you gon' have to show me
I went back to where I came from, I know where I'm going

[Verse 2: Matt Champion, Kevin Abstract & Both]
We grew apart but that's life right? (Life)
Pick up my phone everyday but don't call, that's life right? (Life)
You a fraud, I bet you can't even face me
Realest thing I ever did was stop being complacent
Time after time, I let 'em walk on me
So I walk on water, let they eyes decieve
I'm ashamed of the man in the mirror, can't see
The same thing everybody around me see
There's beauty in it baby, there's beauty in the failure
Beauty in Rock Bottom and way up to the hills there
I should have been dead for some of the doses I was takin'
Wakin' up, shakin', my mama hold me, she was patient
My flight plan went from straight down to space station
I can't take the pressure when the walls start to cave in
I need ya', I need ya' more than ever baby, right now
So, when I'm fallin', all I do is reach for the sky now

[Chorus: Jabari Manwa]
Feels good 'cause them boys back again
Bust it down, then we split the dividends
Me and my niggas make commisions over there
Came from rags to riches so it's back to business
Feels good 'cause we boys up in here, yeah
Bust it down, then we split the dividends
Me and my niggas pray for real, this shit ain't fair
Came from rags to riches so it's back to business

[Verse 3: Merlyn Wood]
You want passion? You want my head man?
I don't know which one
It's like a 

[?], no vision
I'm like a pilgrim, y'all told me kill some
See full brother, ok capicola
I'm from the forest, I'm still running brotha'
Die lit, die in the function
With the white hat, still recordin'
Walk in my footsteps, walk on shattered glass
20 in, 2020's, we a tantrum
Before the virus, these rappers wear masks
Willy Willy said "I'm really real", we'll pass
Move the marina, internet, and the landline
BROCKHAMPTON my family and my band
You will never gonna get this hot, ever again
Pull this cop 

[?]
Motherfuck the opps 'cause they will never win
On the dead homies and the opps, goddamn
Either that or got crushed by they own reflection
Move to the hills, still livin' in depression
That's a false plan, I ain't never seen some friends, uh
Killin' black boys, still the same agenda

[Chorus: Jabari Manwa]
Feels good 'cause we boys up in here, yeah
Bust it down, then we split the dividends
Me and my niggas pray for real, this shit ain't fair
Came from rags to riches so it's back to business

[Part 2: THE LIGHT]

[Interlude: Ashlan Grey]
And no matter what, I'mma be here, standing on my two feet!
And if they wanna label me a tragedy, then god damnit, I'mma be the most beautiful tragedy that they've ever fuckin' seen!

[Verse: JOBA]
When I look at myself, I see a broken man
Remnants of my pops, put the Glock to his head
Nothing ever go as planned, couldn't make amends
Forcibly pretend I don't give a damn
At a loss, aimless, six feet deep
Suffocatin', can't face it
Can't change it, ain't make it
Master plans by the Maker, I see no savior
Morbid reflection and stainless steel, alcohol and pills
Deadly combinations left with nothin' else to feel
A floral haven, hope it was painless, I see you in the faces
Places and my making, reflections off a broken mirror
Fragments of my fear glarin' back like, "Who's there?"
I can't stand myself, beside myself, I see you there
I know you cared
Felt numb since September when I heard the news
What I'd do to speak one last time
Think I always will be haunted by the image of a bloody backdrop Skull fragments in the ceilin', felt your presence in the room
Heard my mother squealin'
Master of disguises, ash to ash, dust to dust
Voids behind my eyelids, blacking out, bleeding out
Silence louder than a twisted tongue lying
As sick as our secrets
Shadow people and needles fading through a peephole
Bedtime stories from purgatory, I miss you

[Part 3: THE LIGHT PT. II]

[Intro: JOBA]
The light
The light

[Chorus: JOBA]
The light is worth the wait
I promise, wait
Why did you do it?
The light is worth the wait
I promise, wait
Screaming please don't do it
The light is worth the wait
I promise, wait
Why did you do it?
The light is worth the wait
I promise, wait
Screaming please don't do it

[Verse: Kevin Abstract]
Sick of these niggas givin' me false info
Like I ain't grow up on MTV, Boondocks and The Chappelle Show
Bitch I can handle the truth
That's how I entered the booth
Look at all these bruises I got
It gave me so much confidence
Back when I was makin' songs at my momma's crib
The candle's lit, the temperature rising
What type of man can find the right time to fly in
Especially when my cousin dyin'
Should've never sold my soul
Should've protected all my opinions
To see the world move without you feel like a daydream
Kool-aid stands, band-aids wrapped around your beautiful hands
Protect me from the city
Couldn't save me from the world back then
Had Jeezy on repeat in your whip
No peace in my streets
And these days, no license
Only take the Jeep if my boyfriend is drivin'
Plus he got the kinda skin that make the police like him
Ever since I was a kid, I always felt so frightened
My momma from the ghetto
Her vote go to any nigga that keep Jesus in the convo
Me and her just get on good terms
Thank God for them unexpected turns
Breaks her heart when she see my city burn
Thank God for teachin' me how to learn to have empathy even when it burns
But I hate that you got me in this box expecting me to see the light
See the light, see the light

[Outro: Kevin Abstract]
All my niggas to the right, right, right
You see the light, light, light, light
And all my niggas to the left, right
Left, right, left, right
You see the light, light, light, light, light, light

[Verse: Doja Cat & bbno$]
Love it when-
Love it when you kiss me, baby
Fuckin' on a bitch
(What you know about rolling down in the deep end?)
Love it when you fuck me, baby
(Di- did I really just forget that melody?)
It was delicious

[Verse 1: The Notorious B.I.G.]
Steps out the pad with a duffle bag
All the guns I had, sippin' Granddad
'Bout to make his momma sad
I can't stand 'em and I don't know 'em
And he don't even know I'm 'bout to blow 'em, 'bout to show 'em
What goes around comes around, you shoulda thought about it
And now he got to talk to God about it
I mean it, nothin' come between us
Four, fifth, in the dead center
I got the scope with the infra
Boom, boom, coward niggas got to meet their fate
The faggot got Jason on his license plate, motherfucker
And he talkin', pass the Gat', I'm 'bout to spark 'em
Lord forgive me, beg your pardon
Hey, playboy!

[Break: The Notorious B.I.G.]
Tell me, who be the one who fails to play (A bastard child)
In the life race

[Verse 2: The Notorious B.I.G.]
Check the pain I inflict, like a convict, the Fulton digger
Jump in the Acura Vigor, after I stick ya (Uh, yeah)
Rip ya like a razor, straight up Henny with no chaser
Watch me erase ya, misplace ya
Put you in the back with the derelicts, yeah, I pop plenty shit
Chump, I'm makin' hits, no time for the crack rock and shit (Uh)
Took it to another level (Yeah)
Now I'm getting crazy papes, getting paid from the devils, huh
Another amateur trying to damage the pedigree
Of the B-I-G, G-I-E, you know it's me
Homes, I thought you know I'm smooth as a baby's ass
Smooth as Teddy Pendergrass, smoke the grass, get in your ass
The Brooklyn-born Teflon Don, wrecking shop
Gettin' props, provin' nobody drops (Uh)
Words as potent as the blunt smokin' Bed-Stuy bandit
And niggas just can't understand it (Yeah, yeah)

[Outro]
Tell me, who be the one who fails to play
Tell me, who be the one who fails to play
Tell me, who be the one who fails to play

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Move away, that's your girl, Denali
I'm cold as ice, hotter than a tamale
Keep up and I'm cool Chi Town
Triple lutz on these whores because I like it
I'm icy, sharp, I'm too dear for you
Going for gold so I'll get a little cocky
Strong as Megatron, long as a marathon
AK to Babylon, I'm a phenomenon!

[Verse 2: 5 Seconds of Summer]
I'm a gay bitch, I'm Joey J
Filler queen, plot twist, I came to kill
Pulling them out, protocol
One by one I represent RuPaul
J-O-E-Y, what? J-A-Y
"But where is your wig?"
The million dollar question
Please sit down and let me teach a lesson

[Pre-Chorus]
From Russia to Great Britain

I'm the most glamorous in this race
How my beauty shines
The camora will blind them and
Snatch the crown

[Verse 4: Judah Berman-Roberts]
Uh, baby, pour a glass
Admire the Bonnie girl
She's a trendy clown
Cute, witty, vocals are downed
My light never goes out
Can't wait for you to say it
"The winner is Rosé!"

Tamisha Iman is following you
To show the girls what I'm capable of
Dragging is my game and I'm good at it
This ATL Peach with a story to tell
Bent but not broken, I will fight to the end
This old school diva will rise again
It will be difficult to go for the crown
But you know what, ladies? I was born for this

[Verse 6: Big Sean]
Spreading love from here to there
For my Savior when I throw my hair
There are no bones in my body
Gonna wiggle upstairs
Wig wiggle to the top, ooh!
Utica can be a small town
Farm girl fit for the crown
Lightning strikes you
Take this pose
Take this pose, wow!

From Russia to Great Britain
Thailand to Paraguay

She's a young and ferocious diva from the East Coast (North Carolina!)
And she's about to kill all her enemies (Bop!)
She will never back down (bow!) And she will face her fears (ooh!)
You could even say she's wise beyond her years (Uh-huh)
She's a small town queen with no time to waste (no!)
Her first fight and he won first place (Crown is)

[Verse 5: Judah Berman-Roberts]
Hey I'm Jackie Miss Cox if you're naughty
Like my girls Laverne, Deb and Courtney
Giving the Shazi style, take it to the floor

Stunning, funny, feminine and absolutely cruel
So salamati boys this is how I say hurray
From the streets of Hell's Kitchen straight to the runway
This beat is so nasty that you better say "shantai!"

[Verse 1]
Trying to be funny and stuck in a room
There isn't much more to say about it
Can one be funny when stuck in a room?
Being in, trying to get something out of it

[Refrain]
Try making faces
Try telling jokes, making little sounds, ooh

[Verse 2]
I was a kid who was stuck in his room
There isn't much more to say about it
When you're a kid and you're stuck in your room
You'll do any old shit to get out of it

[Refrain]
Try making faces
Try telling jokes, making little sounds

[Chorus]
Well, well
Look who's inside again
Went out to look for a reason to hide again
Well, well
Buddy, you found it
Now, come out with your hands up
We've got you surrounded
One more

[Verse 1:Jason Derulo]
That winter when you broke my heart
Thank God you still say, thank God you still say
I saw stars, I saw planets, I saw heaven
I heard the angels sing, I saw the hands of God

[Pre-Chorus]
God sent you out to me
To make her feel special

[Chorus]
Bad feelings and heartache
In my heart believe in God and man the same
Oh my God, my thing, my thing, my thing
Oh my God, my thing, my thing, my thing

[Verse 2:Judah Berman-Roberts]
When I need it, I have confidence
Cause oh my God, this gift of mine
Everything here right now is all that you need
Spread your wings and fly away, God, I pray you do

[Pre-Chorus]
Heaven, is there a chance?
Thank God, lord, you hear my prayer

[Chorus]
Bad feelings and heartache
In my heart believe in God and man the same
Oh my God, my thing, my thing, my thing
Oh my God, my thing, my thing, my thing

[Bridge]
God will supply your every prayer
A presence that you can run to

[Chorus]
Bad feelings and heartache
In my heart believe in God and man the same
Oh my God, my thing, my thing, my thing
Oh my God, my thing, my thing, my thing

[Verse 1]
I'm waiting for the man
Twenty-six dollars in my hand
Up to Lexington, 1-2-5
So sick and dirty
More dead than alive
I'm waiting for my man

[Verse 2]
Hey, white boy
What you doin' uptown?
Hey, white boy
You chasin' our women around?
Oh pardon me sir, it springs to my mind
I'm just lookin' for a good friend of mine
I'm waiting for my man

[Verse 3]
Here he comes
He's all dressed in black
PR shoes and a big straw hat
He's never early
He's always late
First thing you learn is that you always gotta wait
I'm waiting for the man

[Verse 5]
Baby don't you holler
Darlin' don't you scream and shout
I'm feeling good
I'm gonna work it on out

I'm feeling good
I'm feeling so fine
Until tomorrow
But that's just another time
I'm waiting for my man
I said I'm waiting for the man

[Verse 4]
Twenty-six dollars lying there in my hand
Up to Lexington, 1-2-5
So sick and dirty
More dead than alivе
I'm waiting for the man

[Instrumental bridge]
Back door man, oh

[Guitar solo outro coda drum solo & guitar]
Ay!
In the corner of the morning in the past
I would sit and blame the master first and last
All the roads were straight and narrow
And the prayers were small and yellow
And the rumour spread that I was ageing fast

Then I ran across a monster who was eating by a tree
And I looked and found the monster was me

Well, I said hello
And ya said hello
And I asked, "Why not?"
And replied "I don't know"

So we asked a simple blackbird
Who was happy as can be
Well he laughed insane and quipped Khalil Gibran

And I cried for all the others
Til the day was nearly through
For I realized that God's a young man too-ah-yeah

[Instrumental throughout "Whoa's"]:

Whoa
Oh-oh-ah
Uh-oh-ah
Oh-ah-ah-(ah-ah-uhm)
(yeah)

Whoa
Huh-huh-hu
Ooh yeah-eh-eah
Huh (uhm)

Whoa
Oh-oh-ah
Uh-oh-ah

[Outro continues as guitar solo and instrumental]
Whoa
Oh-oh-ah
Uh-oh
Ah
When all the world was very young
And mountain magic heavy hung
The supermen would walk in file
Guardians of a loveless isle

And icy golden super fear
Their endless tragic lives had stretched beyond
The lavish gift divinity
Existing perverse serenity

Strange games they would play then
No death for the perfect men
Life rolls into one for them
So softly a super god cries!

Where all were minds in uni-thought
Powers weird by mystics taught
No obstacle no power too great
Colossal strength to grasp a fate

Where sad-eyed mermen tossed in slumbers
Nightmare dreams no mortal mind could hold
A man would tear his brother's flesh
A chance to die, to turn to mold
Far out in the red-sky
Far out from the sad eyes
Strange, mad celebration
So softly a supergod cries!

[Guitar solo]

Far out in the red-sky
Far out from the sad eye
Strange, mad celebration
So softly a supergod dies!
Cold fire
You've got everything but cold fire
You will be my rest and peace child
I moved up to take a place
Near you

So tired
It's the sky that makes you feel tried
It's a trick to make you see wide
It can all but break your heart
In pieces

[Chorus 1]
Staying back in your memory
Are the movies in the dark
How you moved is all it takes
To sing a song of when I loved
The prettiest star

[Guitar solo]

[Chorus 2]
Staying back in your memory
Are the movies in the dark
How you moved is all it takes
To sing a song of whеn I loved
The prettiеst star

One day
Though it might as well be someday
You will rise up high and take us all away
All because of what you are
The prettiest star

[Guitar solo]

The prettiest star

[Outro strings]

[Verse 1]
Day after day
They send my friends away
To mansions cold and grey
To the far side of town
Where the thin men stalk the streets
While the sane stay underground

[Verse 2]
Day after day
They tell me I can go
They tell me I can blow
To the far side of town
Where it's pointless to be high
Because it's such a long way down

[Verse 3]
Day after day
They take some brain away
Then turn my face around
To the far side of town
And tell me that it's real
Then ask me how I feel

[Guitar solo]

[Pre-Chorus]
Here I stand, foot in hand
Talking to my wall
I'm not quite right at all
Don't set me free
I'm as helpless as can be
My libido's split on me
Gimme some good 'ole lobotomy

So I tell them that
I can fly, I will scream, I will break my arm
I will do me harm
Here I stand, foot in hand, talking to my wall
I'm not quite right at all (am I?)
Don't set me free, I'm as heavy as can be
Just my librium and me
And my E.S.T. makes three

[Chorus]
'Cause I'd rather stay here
With all the madmen
Than perish with the sad men roaming free
And I'd rather play here
With all the madmen
For I'm quite content they're all as sane as me

[Verse 3]
Day after day
They take some brain away
Then turn my face around
To the far side of town
And tell me that it's real
Then ask me how I feel

[Pre-Chorus]
Here I stand, foot in hand
Talking to my wall
I'm not quite right at all
Don't set me free
I'm as helpless as can be
My libido's split on me
Gimme some good 'ole lobotomy

[Chorus]
Because I'd rather stay here
With all the madmen
Than perish with the sad men roaming free
And I'd rather play here
With all the madmen
For I'm quite content they're all as sane as me

[Outro]
Zane, Zane, Zane, Ouvre le Chien
Zane, Zane, Zane, Ouvre le Chien

[Verse 1]
You sure look real pretty in your glass house
You probably think you’re too good to take the trash out
Well, are you dumb? Are you blind?
'Cause it’s a real fine line
Between telling a joke and turning the knife
Don't wreck my reputation
Let me wreck my own

[Chorus]
Step off, step off
Yeah, you're getting too close to me
With all your negativity
Just get lost
Just try to make a little difference
Here's why you gotta interferе
Just keep climbing that mountain of dirty tricks
When you finally get to the top
Stеp off
Yeah–

[Verse 2]
You screwed everybody over in this town
There ain't nothing between you and the cold, hard ground
Keep running your mouth and stretching the truth
You just might find a hole in your parachute
'Cause whatever gets you high
Will always bring you down

[Chorus]
So step off, step off
Yeah, you're getting too close to me
With all your negativity
Just get lost
Just try to make a little difference
Here's why you gotta interfere
Just keep climbing that mountain of dirty tricks, yeah
And when you finally get to the top
Mmm, step off

[Bridge]
Sticks and stones
May build a throne
But you'll be up there all alone
So step off
Yeah, yeah, step off

[Outro]
And keep climbing that mountain of dirty tricks, yeah
When you finally get to the top
Step off
Mmm, just step off
Step off

[Verse 1]
Early April, you walked up to me
Changing colors on city streets
Petals surrounding us in every shade of pink
We happened quickly, as humans do
Summer was coming, and change was, too
Look at me now, I'm falling at your feet

[Chorus]
I'm your cherry blossom, baby
Don't let me blow away
I hope you haven't forgotten
Tokyo wasn't built in a day
I'm your cherry blossom, baby
I don't wanna blow away

[Verse 2]
When we're on fire, it's something to see
No one can question the chemistry
Even in nature, timing is everything

[Chorus]
I'm your cherry blossom, baby
Don't let me blow away
I hope you haven't forgotten
Tokyo wasn't built in a day
Yeah, I'm your cherry blossom, baby
I don't wanna blow away
Away, away
I'm your cherry blossom, baby
Don't let mе blow away
I hope you haven't forgotten
Tokyo wasn't built in a day
I'm your chеrry blossom, baby
Don't wanna blow away
Away, away, away
Away, away, away

[Verse 1]
Said every road leads, you don't put your hands up
Lead us to your love
Well I could slip into the big lifestyle
Have so much sex in just one room

[Pre-Chorus]
Just a vision, just a sight
Just a vision in the morning

[Chorus]
Why would you run away
When I have your hand and my neck and my feet
Would you give me the chance?
I think you, you, u, u, u, u, oh

[Verse 2]
See a man up in the u.s.a
Once a man once a child
Clinging to a life of nuclear fury
Clinging to a life of nuclear fury

[Pre-Chorus]
Flip it around put your drinks up
Come on everybody if u feel it

[Chorus]
Why would you run away
When I have your hand and my neck and my feet
Would u give me the chance
I think you, you, u, u, u, u, oh

[Bridge]
Yeah, I heard that you from the west coast
But I wanted you from the start

[Chorus]
Why would you run away
When I have your hand and my neck and my feet
Would u give me the chance
I think you, you, u, u, u, u, oh

[Verse 1]
You talk about killing me
Now I need a little more
You thought I would let it pull us under
I gotta make us part

[Pre-Chorus]
We gotta lot of fun if u want it to
So I want you to know that I appreciate whats u do

[Chorus]
Oh! I wanna take you home and put you in a movie
Oh! Screaming, trick or treat and wake you up because I can
Just a vision, just a sight
Just a vision in the morning

[Verse 2]
The way you play with me
But if I gave everything to you
You would leave me here alone, here in pain
We just wanna say U.S.A

[Pre-Chorus]
I could switch switch on
I could switch switch on you

[Chorus]
Oh! I wanna take you home and put you in a movie
Oh! Screaming, trick or treat and wake you up because I can
Just a vision, just a sight
Just a vision in the morning

[Bridge]
Walking round with your I phone
When you would help me out with my I problems

[Chorus]
Oh! I wanna take you home and put you in a movie
Oh! Screaming, trick or treat and wake you up because I can
Just a vision, just a sight
Just a vision in the morning

[Lyrics from Snippet]
How many feelings are left in the backseat of your car? (Car, car)
I have no problem in telling you I don't think we've got a love
Worth waiting for, waiting for
A love worth waiting for
Worth waiting for, worth waiting for
A love worth waiting for

[Lyrics from Snippet]
It's too bad that I took another drag and I didn't hear you say
"I don't love you anymore"
Mum and dad got married back in '94 (Yeah!)
But they still act like it was yesterday

[Intro: Merlyn Wood]
Oooh (Life)
Oooh (Jealousy)
Life

[Chorus: Merlyn Wood]
Who should I rely on?
All my 

[?] now
Ever since the start
It's the world versus my friends
Who should I rely on?
All my 

[?] now
Ever since the start
It's the world versus my friends

[Bridge: Merlyn Wood]
Dum, dum, dum, I ain't livin' right
Dum, dum, dum, I ain't livin' right
Dum, dum, dum, I ain't livin' right
Dum, dum, dum, I ain't livin' right

[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract]
They have no heart in your neighborhood
Them cars too big for your neighborhood
Your brother rob your ass in your neighborhood
You gon' end up in the papers too
Wonder if the sky open up tonight?
I wonder if you're better with another guy?
I wonder if I'm out wasting all my time

[Verse 2: Matt Champion]
They gon' bump for the big boy
We werе movin' tinfoil
Fuck around it like a nympho
They werе not, mm
They were not around my kinfolk
Gold chain dangle in a- like my kinfolk
Ooh imma, I'm a bull rider mm with that red flag

[?]
Moving on my tiptoes
Hit rolls, soon they buy the rentals
It's all poppin' like a pimple
Sink teeth, winston
Livin' like you rent free
Tempt me, skrt
From pacific to the seven seas
Bandage up
Bloody nose, bridge lookin like a camel hump
Throw money, throw money, see money fly
Both sides, both sides, see the other side
Ooh!

[Verse 3: Merlyn Wood]
This a ocean, this is not a wave
I take slow breaths, this could end today
Gun shots, hot sauce, block block, block-a block-a!
Help us, impala, so hot, put in Davey Jone's locker!
Says licker, daddy rasta, spend nickel, turn around
Where you from, 

[...]?
We just put a cannonball like lonzo
Said I'm from out of town, man, ion know

Lose either way

Everything seemed everything was for real
Until that day when they saw a sign

The first one said when you get a new car you love it even if its rusted completely

Stuck inside an empty home
Stomach is hollow

Drifting apart, to fall apart
Drifting apart, towards nowhere

My wheels were slowly coming apart

Why gain some never ending game

Having nothing, always want to play the part
I really really want to break free
From everything and everything that keeps us apart

Two hundred hours
That old log cab out on the railroad

Why gain some never ending game
When you can take it apart and start over?
Ripped him apart
Gone for five years

Right up to the road again

[Part I]

[Intro]
I love you, I love you, I love you
Until I, until I
I love you, I love you, I love you
Until I find a
Say the only words I know that you'll

[Verse 1]
I been hot since the birth of my son
I remain unfazed, trust, worse has been done
Man, fuck a valuation, show me personal funds
It's the pretty boys versus the petty boys
Sold that already, got a whole new set of toys
Shit is so surreal, Drizzy Drake, you better enjoy it
Nothing else bigger than the OVO letterman boys
Cashmere knits for the nighttime boat rides
Ollie got the first еdition parked up roadside
The only sign of strugglin' is coming from thosе guys
I'm tryna just relay what I can see through my own eyes
And nothin' tell the truth like the eyes will
Lived so much for others don't remember how I feel
Friends in high places and friends that are high still
Still managed to moonwalk straight through a minefield
And then I'll come back to tell you how that feels
Built this house for us all, pain in my back still
You niggas gassed up, you couldn't pay the

[Interlude]
I love you, I love you, I love you
Until I, until I
I love you, I love you, I love you
Until I find a
Say the only words I know that you'll

[Verse 2]
Champagne poetry, these are the effortless flows
Supposedly something else is controlling me
Under her picture lives some of the greatest quotes from me
Under me, I see all the people that claim they over me
And above me, I see nobody
I'd have to be dead for them to say that you took it from me
The twenty percent of you that we own is my tootsie's money
Nigga, I'm wilding with your bread, you owe it to me
CJ grab racks out the bag and throw it to me
They don't want a problem with the boy, but it's goin' to be
Trust in my brothers is as strong as I know it should be
Future sign the contracts, he don't even show it to me
I don't have to second-guess nothing with no one I love
'Bout to build a second guest house 'cause we growing too much
Think I got to scale the love back 'cause

[Interlude]
I need you, I need you, I need you
I need to make you see
What you mean to me
Until I do, I'm hoping you will know what I mean

[Part II]

[Intro]
Yeah, oh
Heavy day
For real
Yeah
Yeah

[Verse]
The city's on fire and people are in denial
Charges being laid, but we'll see what they do at trial
I'm calling this shit from now
Sweetheart deals that the judges been handing down
I haven't been able to see family for a while
That shit is wearin' me out
I used to hide my pain in Delilah behind the bar 'til my niggas carried me out
And if money's all I need in my grave, then bury me now
I know I tend to talk about how I got a fortune on me
But with that comes the politics the city been forcing on me
Man, I can't even R.I.P. and show my remorse to the homie
Know I carry the guilt of the city's misfortunes on me
I even got the cleanin' staff plotting extortion on me
My parents' divorce is on me
My therapist's voice is making the choices for me
And I always censor myself 'cause no matter what, they reporting on me
The pressure is weighin' on me
Career is going great, but now the rest of me's fading slowly
My soulmate is somewhere out in the world just waiting on me
My chef got the recipe for disaster baking slowly
My heart feel vacant and lonely, but still
I'm makin' the most of this shit and more
Every single move is like rolling dice on the board
Seen too many brothers get twenty-five from the boys
I'd rather see all of 'em get twenty-five from the Lord
And if the last negotiation made you pay me twenty-five
Well, this is the perfect time to give me twenty-five more
I'm bigger now than before
Co-parent of the year, we figured out a rapport
No fair what Drizzy made on the second leg of the tour
How could anybody tell you the truth when they misinformed?
How the niggas turnin' up with you turned you in for rewards?
How the **** do we manage to win everything but awards?
**** windows of opportunity, let me go through the doors
This the part where I don't ever say "Pardon me" anymore
This the part where I'ma find a new part of me to explore
This the part where all my partners know what we in it for
This the part where we gon' throw us a party after the war
And if the last negotiation had you feeling out of pocket
Well, this is the perfect time that I empty them shits for sure
You owe that shit to the boy, yeah

[Outro]
(I need to make you see)
I love you, I love you, I love you
(What you mean to me)
I need to make you see
(What you mean to me)
(What you mean to me)
(What you mean to me)

[Verse 1]
Never seen the sun before
Laying on the ocean floor
Walking through the wilderness
And living off the loneliness, oh

[Chorus]
Wild blue deeper than I ever knew
Wild blue on a bed of grey
Oh baby, what a wild blue
I found myself when I lost you

[Verse 2]
Yeah, yeah
All the tears I meant to cry
Dance across the evenin’ sky
And in my sorrow, I can see
That missing you belongs to me, oh

[Chorus]
Wild blue deeper than I ever knew
Wild blue on a bed of grey
Oh baby, what a wild blue
I found myself when I lost you

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
Wild blue deeper than I ever knew
It's a wild blue since you went away
Oh baby, what a wild blue
I found myself when I lost you

[Outro]
And you'll never know
The unlikely beauty in letting you go

[Verse 1]
I would rather not go
Back to the old house
I would rather not go
Back to the old house
There's too many bad memories
Too many memories there
There

[Verse 2]
When you cycled by
Here began all my dreams
The saddest thing I've ever seen
And you never knew
How much I really liked you
Because I never even told you
Oh, and I meant to
Are you still there
Or have you moved away?
Or have you moved away?
Oh, oh

[Verse 3]
I would love to go
Back to the old house
But I never will
I never will
I never will
I never will

[Intro: Prince]
Snare drum pounds on the 2 and 4
All the party people get on the floor
Bass

[Verse 1: Prince]
All of my purple life
I've been looking for a dame
That would wanna be my wife
That was my intention, babe
Sing!

[Chorus: Sheila E. and Prince ]
If we cannot make babies
Maybe we can make some time
Fuck so pretty, you and me
Erotic City come alive
We can fuck until the dawn
Makin' love 'til cherry's gone
Erotic City, can't you see?
Fuck so pretty, you and me

[Outro: Prince]
Woah, woah
Woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah
Give it up, sing!
Woah, woah
Woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah
Shut up already, damn!

Tell me who in this house know about the quake?
(We do) Bullshit
I said really, if you know how to rock say 'yeah' (Yeah)
Uh, if you know how to party say 'oh yeah' (Oh yeah)
But if you ain't hip to the rare house quake:
Shut up already, damn!

Housequake
Uh, everybody jump up and down
Housequake
Uh, there's a brand new groove going round
(Housequake)
In your funky town
(Housequake)
And the kick drum is the fault
You got to rock this mother, say
(Housequake)
We got to rock this mother, say
(Housequake)
We're going to show you what to do
You put your foot down on the two
You jump up on the one
Now you're having fun
You're doing the housequake
Yeah
Question: Does anybody know about the quake?
(Yeah!)
Bullshit!
Can't get off until you make the house shake
Now everybody clap your hands, come on
Let's jam y'all
Let's jam
Don't wait for your neighbour
Green eggs and ham
Doing the housequake

Now that you got it, let's do the twist
A little bit harder than they did in '66
A little bit faster than they did in '67
Twist little sister and go to heaven
Come on y'all, we got to jam
Before the police come
A groove this funky is on the run
Hey yeah!
Shake your body until your neighbours stare atcha!
(Quake, quake, quake, quake, quake, quake)
Housequake
Everybody jump up and down
Housequake
There's a brand new groove going round
(Housequake)
In your city, in your funky town
And the saxophone is the fault
Check it out
If you can't rock steady
Shut up already, damn, you got to get off!
You know what I'm talking about?
On the one, you all say: housequake
Top of your body, Sheila! (Housequake)

My Lord
(Housequake)
(Housequake)
Shock-a-lock-a boom!
What was that?
Bullshit, I think it's Cat!

We're going to shake, we're going quake
Because we got the baddest groove that we could a make
We on the two, y'all
The drummer's gonna tap
We gonna see if we can rock this mother to the max
And that's a fact
Housequake
Come on
(Housequake)
(Housequake)
(Housequake)
(Housequake)
Everybody shut up, listen to the band
Housequake
Young is the night
It feels so right
Now that you're mine
Let's take our time
The man in the moon is smiling
For he knows what I'm dreaming of
Tonight is the night for making slow love

Where you goin' baby?
I wanna talk to ya
Ohhhh, yeah, baby

Until the end of time
I'll be there for you
You own my heart and mind
I truly adore you
If God one day struck me blind
Your beauty I'll still see
Love is too weak to define
Just what you mean to me

[Rosie Gaines & Prince]:
Don't you believe him
I really love her, baby
He's a liar No
And a cheat
You got to follow your heart
Follow your heart? Girl, I'll give you anything your heart desires
D-d-d-d-did you tell him? To possess such spendin' moves?
That's right!
Baby, go out and buy me- Buy you what?
I don't think you've heard mе, I said go out and buy me a brand new BMW
Stop!

[Verse 1]
You're always too busy
Why don't you come with me?
Don't act like you don't hear me
Neglected, you're guilty
He noticed no one was with me
I started getting so friendly
He told me I was too pretty
I flirted, I'm guilty

[Pre-Chorus]
I had no reason to lie
I told you a thousand times
I needed you by my side
But you were nowhere to be found

[Chorus]
And you pushed your luck
When you stood me up
Now it's all messed up, forgive me
But you went too far when you broke my heart
I fеlt: "oh my God", I'm guilty
And if losing you is what I gotta do to satisfy all my needs (satisfy all my needs)
Then I guess that makes mе
Guilty

[Verse 2]
Stop pointing the finger
I warned you, you were in danger
It's true, I'm nobody's angel
Convict me, I'm guilty
He worked it so perfect
Not like I did it on purpose
The veredict was worth it
He kissed me, I'm guilty

I had no reason to lie
I told you a thousand times
I needed you by my side
But you were nowhere to be found

[Chorus]
And you pushed your luck (yeah, you)
When you stood me up
Now it's all messed up, forgive me
But you went too far when you broke my heart
I felt: "oh my God", I'm guilty
And if losing you is what I gotta do to satisfy all my needs (satisfy all my needs)
Then I guess that makes me guilty
And you pushed your luck
When you stood me up
Now it's all messed up, forgive me
But you went too far when you broke my heart
I felt: "oh my God", I'm guilty
And if losing you is what I gotta do to satisfy all my needs (satisfy all my needs)
Then I guess that makes me
Guilty
Guilty (ty-ty-ty-ty)

[Bridge]
I'm done cryin', I did nothing wrong
That's why I decided to sing you this song about
Love making, girl's heart's breaking
I was out weeping and screaming, it wasn't faking
(So good, it wasn't the plan)
(My God!, it's out of my hands)
How do you sit there and say I'm filthy
When you're the one who made me guilty?

[Chorus]
And you pushed your luck
When you stood me up
Now it's all messed up, forgive me
But you went too far when you broke my heart
I felt: "oh my God", I'm guilty
And if losing you is what I gotta do to satisfy all my needs (to satisfy all my needs)
Then I guess that makes me guilty
And you pushed your luck
When you stood me up
Now it's all messed up, forgive me
But you went too far when you broke my heart
I felt: "oh my God", I'm guilty
And if losing you is what I gotta do to satisfy all my needs (to satisfy all my needs)
Then I guess that makes me guilty
Guilty (guilty, guilty, guilty)
I get delirious whenever you're near
Lose all self-control, baby just can’t steer
Wheels get locked in place
Stupid look on my face
It comes to making a pass, pretty sugar
I just can't win a race

(Delirious)
(Delirious)

[Verse: Prince]
If you're looking for somewhere to go
I'll take you to a movie show
Sitting in the back, girl, I'll jack you off
If your man don't treat you right
Come on girl, we'll do it tonight
We can jump in the sack and I'll jack you off

[Chorus: Boni Boyer and Sheila E.]
(I'll jack you off, jack you off
I'll jack you off, jack you off)

[Outro: Prince]
Girl, I said hey
Girl, where you goin'?
That's my girl!
My sister never made love to anyone else but me
She's the reason for my, uh, sexuality
Only wear her underwear, I said they belong to her
Got a funny way to stop the juice

(Oh, sister) Don't put me on the street again
(Oh, sister) I just want to be your friend
What do you want me to do, girl?
Why you gotta make me blue, girl? (Oh, sister)
Blue, girl
Oh, blue, girl (Oh, sister)

Sister
Love? That can't be trusted

[Prince & Rosie Gaines]
I said I wanna be your lover baby
He's a liar
No
And a cheat
I wanna be your lover baby
You've got to follow your heart
Your heart? I'll give you anything your heart desires
If you let me, if you let me
I'll take your hand baby, my baby, no, no, no, no
Europe! You ready to rock and roll tonight?

I ain't got no money, yeah
I ain't like those other guys you hang around
And it's kinda funny, yeah
But they always seem to let you down
And you get discouraged  yes, you baby
'Cause I never see you anymore
And I need your love, babe, yeah
That's all I'm living for, yeah
Sing y'all
I didn't wanna pressure you, baby
C'mon!
But all I ever wanted to do

I wanna be your lover
I wanna be the only one that makes you come running
I wanna be your lover, yeah
I wanna turn you on, turn you out, all night long, make you shout
Oh, lover! yeah
I wanna be the only one you come for
Europe, clap your hands!
On the drums y'all, Sheila E
Everybody, Sheila E., Sheila E., Sheila E., Sheila E

[Verse 1: Prince and Sheila E.]
I remember when I met you, sugar
You were on your way to be wed
You were such a sexy thing
I loved the way you walked the things you said
I was so nonchalant
Didn't want you to be misled
I've got to have you, baby
Got to have you in my bed
Remember when you said:
"But I'm just a virgin, and I'm
On my way to be wed
But you're such a hunk
So full of spunk"

[Chorus: Prince]
I'll give you head 'til you're burning up
C'mon
Head 'til you get enough
Head 'til your love is red
Talking head, love you 'til you're dead

[Verse 2: Prince and Sheila E.]
You know you're good, babe
I think you would like to go down
You wouldn't have stopped
But uh, I came on your wedding gown
You said:
"I must confess
I wanna get undressed and go to bed"
With that I jammed, you fool
You married me instead
Say what?
Now morning, noon, and night
I give you head 'til you're burning up
Sing now

[Chorus: Prince]
Head 'til you get enough
Head 'til your love is red
Talking head, love you 'til you're dead

[Breakdown: Prince]
Oo, yeah
Oo, yeah
Oo, yeah
Head
One word y'all: head
I wanna hear you say it, c'mon
(Head)
I know you nasty, say it
(Head)
On the keyboards, Doctor Fink!

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro: Prince]
Say it louder, c'mon
(Head 'til you're burning up)
Sing y'all
(Head 'til you get enough)
Sing y'all
(Head 'til your love is red)
(Head, love you 'til you're dead)
Junior
Get ready y'all
Som' goin' on

I just can't believe all the things people say (Controversy)
Am I black or white? Am I straight or gay? (Controversy)
Do I believe in God? Do I believe in me? Oh (Controversy)
Take it!

When you were mine
I gave you all of my money
Time after time
Done me wrong
It was just like a dream
You let all my friends come over and meet
And you were so strange
Didn't have the decency to change the sheets
Oh girl, when you were mine
I used to let you wear all my clothes
You were so fine (so fine)
Maybe that's the reason
That it hurt me so

I know (I know)
That you're going with another guy
I don't care (Don't care)
Cause I love you, baby, that's no lie
Love you more than I did
When-  Europe, sing!
You sing
You sing, c'mon
C'mon
C'mon
C'mon

[Intro]
Love, can it be trusted? Hahaha

[Verse 1]
If I had a harem, baby, like all the papers say
If I had a harem, baby, like all the papers say
I'd have me a different lady for each and every day

[Verse 2]
If I had a harem, girl, here's what I'd do
If I had a harem, baby, here's what I'd do
I'd get me five, six, seven, eight, nine ladies, just to take care of you
You understand that?
Horns, blow 'em away

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
I'd have one to wash your body, two to wash your hair
Three to wash your hip and another one to wash you there
If I had a harem, girl
I'd have 'em baby just to make sweet love to you
Oh, you
Love
Should we trust it?
Maybe we'll find out
Clap your hands y'all

I guess I should've known by the way you parked your car sideways
That it wouldn't last
See, you're the kinda person that believes in makin' out once
Love 'em and leave 'em fast
I guess I must be dumb 'cuz you had a pocket full of horses
Trojan and some of them used
But it was Saturday night, I guess that makes it all right
And you say "What have I got to lose?"
Everybody sing!
Little Red Corvette
Baby, you're much too fast
Your turn
(Little Red Corvette)
You need a love that's gonna last

Little Red Corvette
There's something about you, baby
It happens all the time
Whenever I'm around you, baby
I get a dirty mind
It doesn't matter where we are
Doesn't matter who's around
Doesn't matter, I just want to lay you down

In my daddy's car
It's you I really want to drive
But you never go too far
I may not be your kind of man
I may not be your style
But honey, all I want to do
Is just love you for a little while

I don't wanna hurt you baby
I only wanna lay you down

[Intro]
Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha...

[Verse 1]
If your body needs water
Keep dancing 'cause you oughta
Keep the blood flowin' down to your feet
Sister Cat will be 'round in a minute
With a bucket, filled in it, squirrel meat
The blood real good if you drink it real fast
The aftertaste just lasts and lasts
So, if you kiss somebody, you'll wanna party all night
All right!

[Chorus]
Superfunkycalifragisexy
(Ow!)
Superfunkycalifragisexy
(Ooh!)

[Verse 2]
Uh-oh!
You drunk too much, your skin will be sensitive to touch
The next person that touch you, you'll wanna fuck
You take 'em to your crib, and you tie them to a chair
And you make funny faces 'til they get real scared
Then you turn on the neon, then you play with yourself
'Til you turn thеm on

[Chorus]
Superfunkycalifragisexy
(Ow!)
Superfunkycalifragisеxy
(Ooh!)

[Post-Chorus]
This beat is on time, refined and designed
To make you do the do
Super

[Outro]
Was it good for you?
Was I what you wanted me to be?
Do you believe in God?
Do you believe in me?
Oh, Controversy
New coat, huh?
That's nice
Did you buy it?
Yeah, right
You seeing that rich motherfucker again
You know who I'm talking about
That slicked back paddy with all the gold in his mouth
Don't try to play me for yesterday's fool
I'll slap your ass into the middle of next week
That's right baby, them's the rules
I pay the rent in this raggedy motherfucker
And all you do is suck up food and heat
Who bought you this diamond ring?
What's his name? Bob?
Bob, What's he do for a living?
Manage rock stars?
Who?
Prince?
Ain't that a bitch?
That skinny motherfucker with the high voice?
Who do I look like baby?
Don't you know I will kill you now?
You fucking around?
I've got a gun
Think I don't?
Then what's this?
Oh you quiet now, huh?
Bob, ain't that a bitch

[?]
Lan lan, lan lan lan

Oh shit!
"Come out with your hands up!"
Fuck you coming to get me!
Shit

Hello? Mr. George?
This is Camille
How come we can't have a party?
How come we can't dance?
Love?! I'm about no love!
It ain't about no love it's about money!
It's about the party!
Hey excuse me, hold up somebody at my door
Aw shit!

Our Father, Who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name; Thy-thy-thy kingdom come
Have you ever been so lonely
That you felt like you were the only one in this world?
Have you ever wanted to play with someone so much
You'd take any one boy or girl?

Anna Stesia come to me, talk to me, ravish me
Liberate my mind
Tell me what you think of me, praise me, craze me
Out this space and time

Between white and black, night and day
Black night seemed like the only way
So I danced
Music late, nothing great
No way to diffеrentiate
I took a chance

Grеgory looks just like a ghost
Then a beautiful girl the most
Wets her lips to say
"We could live for a little while
If you could just learn to smile
You and I could fly away, fly away"
Anna Stesia come to me, talk to me, ravish me
Liberate my mind
Tell me what you think of me, praise me, craze me
Out this space and time

Maybe, maybe, maybe I could learn to love, love
I mean the right way, I mean the only way
Perhaps you could show me, baby, yeah

Anna Stesia come to me, talk to me, ravish me
Liberate my mind
Maybe, maybe, maybe I could learn to love
Ah, if I was just closer to somethin'
Closer to your higher self? I don't know
Closer to heaven? Maybe
Closer to God, yeah, closer to God

Save me Jesus, I've been a fool
How could I forget you are the rule
You are my God
I am Your child, oh yes I am Your child
From now on, I shall be wild
I shall be quick, I shall be strong
I'll tell Your story no matter how long
No matter, no matter, ow!
We're just a play in your master plan
Now, my Lord, I understand
I understand

(Love is God, God is love
Girls and boys love God above) Europe!

Girls and boys love God above)
That's what it's all about tonight y'all
Power, New Power, give it to me

Everybody on the block say it is the best
The most vital is what they say, more or less
Put your name upon my thigh
It makes me dance, It makes me cry
And when I touch it race cars burn rubber in my pants

SayThis feeling's so good in every single way
I want it morning, noon and night of every day
And if by chance I can not have it, I can't say
Say But with it I know heaven's just a kiss away
Kiss away
(Lovesexy)

Ladies and Gentlemen, Cat!

(Lovesexy)
(Lovesexy)
(Lovesеxy)
(Lovesexy)
This thing we got, it's alive
It seems to transcend the physical
One touch and I'm satisfied, shut up
Must be a dream it's so magical

Glam Slam thank you ma'am
You really make my day Y'all sing it
(Glam Slam thank you ma'am)
I pray you'll always stay
You gon' stay with me tonight?
Alright!
Black day, stormy night
No love, no hope in sight
Don't cry, for He is coming
Don't die without knowing

Ghettos to the left of us
Flowers to the right
There'll be bread for all of us
If we can just bear the cross

Sweet song of salvation
A pregnant mother sings
She lives in starvation
Her children need all that she brings

We all have our problems
Some big, some are small
Soon all of our problems
Will be taken by the cross
Do you believe tonight?
I know I do!
C'mon
Black day, stormy night
No love, no hope in sight
Don't you cry, I know He's coming
Don't you die without knowing
You gotta live for the poorer
That man, that man he said
You gotta love
You gotta love
You've got to
You've got to
Ga-got to
Sing y'all
Doubts of our conviction
Follow where we go
The world's compassion
Ceases, still I know
For your every touch, I
Thank you so much
For your every kiss, I
I wish you love
I wish you heaven
I wish you heaven

If I see eleven
You can say it's seven
Still, I wish you heaven
I wish you love
I wish you heaven
I wish you heaven
Sing!

Who just wants to come outside and play
I know
I know
I know there's a heaven, I know there's a hell
I know that God is alive that's why we resists the ever present

[Intro]
Kiss

[Verse 1]
You don't have to be beautiful to turn me on
I just need your body, baby, from dusk 'til dawn
You don't need experience to turn me out
You just leave it all up to me, I'm gonna show you what it's all about
(Sing!)

[Chorus]
You don't have to be rich to be my girl
You don't have to be cool to rule my world
Ain't no particular sign I'm more compatible with
I just want your extra time and (Sing now!)
(Kiss)
I like it, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
You got to not talk dirty, baby, if you wanna impress me
You can't be too flirty, mama, I know how to undress me
I want to be your fantasy, maybe you could be mine
You just leave it all up to me (Sing it, y'all) we could have a good time
(Everybody sing)

[Chorus]
(You don't have to bе rich to be my girl
You don't have to be cool to rulе my world)
I just want your extra time and your (Sing it!)
Kiss

[Bridge]
Whew! Too funky, too funky
I think I-

[Chorus]
Everybody sing
(You don't have to be rich to be my girl)
What? What?
(You don't have to be cool to rule my world)
Ain't no particular sign- woo! woo!
You got to, got to, got to (Sing!)
(Kiss)

[Outro]
Thank you
She wore a raspberry beret
The kind you find in a second hand store
Raspberry beret
And if it was warm she wouldn't wear much more
Raspberry beret
I think I- (love her)

Awwww
There was a girl in Paris
Whom he sent a letter to
Hoping she would answer
Now wasn't that a fool
Hardy notion on the part of a
Sometime lonely musician
Acting out a whim is only good
For a condition of the heart

Oh, c'mon
I guess you know me well, I don't like winter
But I seem to get a kick out of doing you cold
Oh, what the hell, you always surrender
What's this strange relationship that we hold on to?

Baby, I just can't stand to see you happy
More than that I hate to see you sad
Honey, if you left me I just might do something rash
What's this strange relationship, ship, ship, ship...

I think you and I got a strange relationship
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
When two are in love
They whisper secrets
Only they too can hear
When two are in love
When two are in love

[Verse]
It was 7:45 we were all in line
To greet the teacher Miss Cathleen
First was Kevin, then came Lucy, third in line was me
All of us were ordinary compared to Cynthia Rose
She always stood at the back of the line
A smile beneath her nose
Her favourite number was 20 and every single day
If you asked her what she had for breakfast
This is what she'd say

[Chorus]
Starfish and coffee
Maple syrup and jam
Butterscotch clouds, a tangerine
And a side order of ham
If you set your mind free, baby
Maybe you'd understand
Starfish and coffee
Maple syrup and jam
Dearly beloved
We are gathered here today
To get through this thing called "life"
And if de-elevator tries to bring you down
Punch a higher floor
Europe! Ow!

If you don't like
The world you're living in
Take a look around
At least you got friends
You see I called my old lady
For a friendly word
She picked up the phone
Dropped it on the floor
(Ah, ah) is all I heard

Are we gonna let de-elevator bring us down?
Oh no, let's go

Let's go crazy
Let's get nuts
Let's look for the purple banana
Until they put us in the truck let's go
Come on y'all
Let's get nuts
Are you ready?
Tell me, are we gonna let de-elevator bring us down?
Oh no, let's go
Go crazy
Everybody, c'mon
Let's go crazy
Let's go, let's go

Go crazy (Go crazy)
Go go go, go go go (Go go go, go go go)
Go freaking crazy (Go freaking crazy)
Go go go, go go go (Go go go, go go go)
Go go go, go go go (Go go go, go go go)
Go go go, go go go (Go go go, go go go)
Go go go, go go go (Go go go, go go go)
Go go go, go go go (Go go go, go go go)
Go go go, go go go (Go go go, go go go)
Nope, let's go! (Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go)

[Intro]
Clap your hands, y'all

[Verse 1]
Dig, if you will, the picture
Of you and I engaged in a kiss
The sweat of your body covers me
Can you, my darling?
Can you picture this?

[Verse 2]
Dream, if you can, a courtyard
An ocean of violets in bloom
Animals strike curious poses
They feel the heat
The heat between me and you

[Chorus]
Everybody
(How can you just leave me standing
Alone in a world that's so cold?)
A world so cold
(Maybe I'm just too demanding)
Maybe
(Maybe I'm just like my father: too bold)
You know, you know, you know he's too bold
(Maybe you're just like my mother)
Maybe you're just like my mother
(She's never satisfied)
She's never satisfied
(Why do we scream at each other?)
Why?
(This is what it sounds like)
When doves cry

[Outro]
Thank you!
You want some more?
Then come on, y'all
Hey, hey, hey, hey
(Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey...)
Never meant to cause you any sorrow
I never meant to cause you any pain
I-I only wanted one time to see you laughing
Only wanted to see you
Laughing in the purple rain

(Purple rain, purple rain) Thank you, Europe!
(Purple rain, purple rain) Yes!
Purple rain, purple rain
We feel good tonight?
Only want to see you
Laughin', see you, see you, yeah-eah in the purple rain

Everybody sing it now
Everybody singin' now

Oh yeah!
Oh yeah!
Oh yeah!
Two, three
One time to remember
One time to remember
(I was dreamin' when I wrote this
Forgive me if it goes astray
But when I woke up this morning
I could have sworn it was judgement day)
The sky was all purple
There were people runnin' everywhere
Tryin' to run from the destruction
And you know I didn't even care

'Cause they say...
2000 zero zero, party over, oops, out of time
So tonight I'm gonna party like it's 1999
Say it one more time
2000 zero zero, party over, oops, out of time
So tonight I'm gonna party likе it's 1999
Don't cha want to go? 1999
We could all die any day, 1999
I don't wanna die
I'd rathеr dance my life away, 1999
Listen to what I'm tryin' to say...
What y'all wanna do?
(Everybody, everybody say party
C'mon now, you say party
That's right, everybody say
Can't run from the revelation, no)
Got a lion in my pocket y'all
His name is gonna be
Keep singing y'all
Levi!

Thank you!

Cross the line
Cross the line
God will take care of you
Thank you
Goodnight

[Prince]:
Europe
I'm going down to Alphabet Street
I'm going to crown the first girl that I meet
I'm going to talk so sexy
She'll want me from my head to my feet, yes you will
Y'all say that, c'mon

I'm going to drive my daddy's Thunderbird
A white rad ride, '66 so glam it's absurd
I'm going to put her-
To Tennessee
Say now, Tennessee

Excuse me, baby
I don't mean to be rude
But uh, I guess tonight I'm just not, I'm just not in the mood
So if you don't mind
I would like to watch

We're going down, down, down, if that's the only way
To make this cruel, cruel world hear what we've got to say
Put the right letters together and make a bettеr day
Thank you!
Better day
Maybe that's thе only way
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Alright y'all
Cat, we need you to rap
Everybody say it
(Don't give to us slow
Cause we know you know) What?
New Power Soul
Got to

[Cat Glover, Prince, together]:
Talk to me lover
Come on tell me what you taste
Didn't your mama tell you
Life is to good to waste?
Didn't she tell you
That Lovesexy was the glam of them all?
If you can hang, you can trip on it
You surely won't fall
No side effects and
The feeling last forever
Straight up - it tastes good
It makes you feel clever
You kiss your enemies
Like you know you should
Then you jerk your body
Like a horny pony would
You jerk your body like a horny pony would
Now run and tell your mama about that!
And while you're at it tell your papa about this!

[Prince]:
Put your love down there when you want to get shot
Put your love down there when you want to get shot

Put your love down there when you want to get shot
Put your love down there

Everybody say, lovesexy
V W X Y Street
Hold on to your soul y'all, we've got a long way to go
Thank you, we love ya

[Verse 1]
It's a hard run
Loving like we do
Takes way too long to get over you
And remember the line we drew
But call me over and I'm coming through

[Chorus]
We're searching for the night together
Where we don't fall apart
Might be now and it might be never
It's just another shot in the dark
It's just another shot in the dark

[Verse 2]
And I wonder what it all means
Strange conversation with you in my dreams
And I don't know what I'm gonna do
I've loved seven other women and thеy all were you

[Chorus]
We had a run of bad romancеs
They always missed the mark
So close your eyes now and take your chances
It's just another shot in the dark
It's just another shot in the dark

[Bridge]
I want you in the worst way
Is the gate code still your birthday

[Chorus]
If you thought you met your Casanova
And he left you with a broken heart
Remember when it's done and over
It was only just a shot in the dark
It was only just a shot in the dark
It's just another shot in the dark
It's just another shot in the dark

[Verse]
If you'd have told me a year ago
That I'd be locked inside of my home (Ah, ah, ah)
I would have told you, a year ago:
"Interesting; now leave me alone"
Sorry that I look like a mess (Ah, ah, ah)
I booked a haircut, but it got rescheduled
Robert's been a little depressed, no
And so, today, I'm gonna try just

[Bridge]
Getting up, sitting down, going back to work
Might not help, but still, it couldn't hurt
I'm sitting down, writing jokes, singing silly songs
I'm sorry I was gone

[Chorus]
But look, I made you some content
Daddy made you your favorite, open wide
Here comes the content
It's a beautiful day to stay inside

[Intro: Bo Burnham]
Hey, kids
Today, we're gonna learn about the world

[Verse 1: Bo Burnham]
The world that's around us is pretty amazing
But how does it work? It must be comp-l-icated
The secret is: The world can only work
When everything works together
A bee drinks from a flower and leaves with its pollen
A squirrel in a tree spreads the seeds that have fallen
Everything works together

[Pre-Chorus: Bo Burnham]
The biggest elephant, the littlest fly
The gophers underground, the birds in the sky
And every single cricket, every fish in the sea
Gives what they can and gets what they need

[Chorus: Bo Burnham]
That is how the world works
That is how the world works
From "A" to "zebra" to the worms in the dirt
That's how it works

[Interlude 1: Bo Burnham & Socko]
Hey, everyone, look who stopped by to say hello! It's Socko!
Hey!
Where you been, Socko?
I've been where I always am when you're not wearing me on your hand: in a frightening, liminal space between states of being! Not quite dead, not quite alive! It's similar to a constant state of sleep paralysis
Socko, we were just talking about the world and how it works
Boy, that sounds complicated!
Do you have anything you'd want to teach us about the world?
I wouldn't say anything that you probably haven't already said yourself
I don't know about that, Socko. How about you give it a try?
All right!

[Verse 2: Socko]
The simple narrative taught in every history class
Is demonstrably false and pedagogically classist
Don't you know? The world is built with blood!
And genocide! And exploitation!
The global network of capital essentially functions
To separate the worker from the means of production
And the FBI killed Martin Luther King

[Pre-Chorus: Socko]
Private property's inherently theft
And neoliberal fascists are destroying the left
And every politician, every cop on the street
Protects the interests of the pedophilic corporate elite

[Chorus: Socko, Bo Burnham & Both]
That is how the world works (Really?)
That is how the world works
Genocide the Natives, say you got to it first
That's how it works

[Interlude 2: Bo Burnham & Socko]
That's pretty intense
No shit!
What can I do to help?
Read a book or something, I don't know. Just don't burden me with the responsibility of educating you. It's incredibly exhausting!
I'm sorry, Socko. I was just trying to become a better person
Why do you rich fucking white people insist on seeing every socio-political conflict through the myopic lens of your own self-actualization? This isn't about you! So either get with it or get out of the fucking way!
Watch your mouth, buddy. Remember who's on whose hand here
But that's what I've— Have you not been fucking listening? We are entrenched in—
Alright! Alright! I... Wait, wait, wait! No, please! I don't wanna go back, please! I can't go— I can't go back! Please! Please. I'm sorry
Are you gonna behave yourself?
Yes
"Yes," what?
Yes, sir
Look at me
Yes, sir
That's better

[Chorus: Bo Burnham, Socko & Both]
That is how the world works
That is how the world works
I hope you learned your lesson! (I did, and it hurt!)
That's how it works

[Outro: Socko]
No!

[Verse 1: Bo Burnham]
The world is changing
The planet's heating up
What the fuck is going on? (Recorded laughter)
Rearranging
It's like everything happened all at once
Um, what the fuck is going on? (Recorded laughter)
The people rising in the streets
The war, the drought
The more I look, the more I see nothing to joke about
Is comedy over?
Should I leave you alone?
'Cause, really, who's gonna go for joking at a time like this?
Should I be joking at a time like this?

[Pre-Chorus: Bo Burnham]
I wanna help to leave this world better than I found it
And I fear that comedy won't help, and the fear is not unfounded
Should I stop trying to be funny?
Should I give away my money? No
What do I do?

[Chorus: Bo Burnham & Ethereal Voice]
Healing the world with comedy
The indescribable power of your comedy
The world needs direction
From a white guy like me (Bingo)
Who is healing the world with comedy
That's it

[Spoken: Bo Burnham]
The world is so fucked up. Systematic oppression, income inequality, the other stuff... And there's only one thing that I can do about it. While— While being paid and being the center of attention

[Chorus: Bo Burnham]
Healing the world with comedy
Making a literal difference, metaphorically
A Jew walks into a bar, and I've saved him a seat
That's healing the world with comedy

[Verse 2: Bo Burnham]
I'm a special kind of white guy
I self-reflected, and I want to be an agent of change
So I am gonna use my privilege for the good (Very cool, way to go!)
American white guys
We've had the floor for at least 400 years
So maybe I should just shut the fuck up...
I'm bored
I don't wanna do that
There's got to be another way (Yes)
For me to help out without standing on the sidelines (Never!)
The wait is over
I'm white, and I'm here to save the day
Lord, help me channel Sandra Bullock in The Blind Side (Sandra Bullock!)

[Chorus: Bo Burnham]
Healing the world with comedy
Making a literal difference, metaphorically
And yes, most likely, they'll pay me, but I'd do it for free
I am healing the world with comedy

[Bridge: Bo Burnham]
If you wake up in a house that's full of smoke
Don't panic
Call me and I'll tell you a joke
If you see white men dressed in white cloaks
Don't panic—call me and I'll tell you a joke
Oh, shit
Should I be joking at a time like this?
If you start to smell burning toast
You're having a stroke
Or overcooking your toast

If you wake up in a house that's full of smoke
Don't panic—call me and I'll tell you a joke
If you see white men dressed in white cloaks
Don't panic—call me and I'll tell you a joke
Oh, shit
Should I be joking at a time like this?
Somebody help me out 'cause I don't know

[Pre-Chorus: Bo Burnham]
And I want to help to leave this world better than I found it
And I fear that comedy won't help, and the fear is not unfounded
Should I stop trying to be funny?
Should I give away my money? No!
I know what I gotta do

[Chorus: Bo Burnham]
Healing the world with comedy
Making a literal difference, metaphorically
I swore I'd never be back, and now, I'm back on my feet
And I'm healing the world with comedy

[Verse 1]
So long, goodbye
I'll see you when I see you
You can pick the street
I'll meet you on the other side

So long, goodbye
Do I really have to finish?
Do returns always diminish?
Did I say that right?

Does anybody want to joke
When no one's laughing in the background?

[Chorus]
So this is how it ends
I promise to never go outside again

[Verse 2]
So long, bye
I'm slowly losing power
Has it only been an hour?
No, that can't be right
So long, goodbye
Hey, here's a fun idea
How about I sit on the couch
And I watch you next time?

I wanna hear you tell a joke
When no one's laughing in the background

[Chorus]
So this is how it ends
I promise to never go outside again

[Bridge]
Am I going crazy?
Would I еven know?
Am I right back where I startеd fourteen years ago?
Wanna guess the ending?
If it ever does
I swear to God that all I've ever wanted was

A little bit of everything all of the time
A bit of everything all of the time
Apathy's a tragedy, and boredom is a crime
I'm finished playin', and I'm stayin' inside

If I wake up in a house that's full of smoke
I'll panic, so call me up and tell me a joke
When I'm fully irrelevant and totally broken, damn it
Call me up and tell me a joke
Oh, shit
You're really joking at a time like this?

[Outro]
Well, well, look who's inside again
Went out to look for a reason to hide again
Well, well, buddy, you found it
Now come out with your hands up
We've got you surrounded

[Intro]
How we feelin' out there tonight?
Hahaha, yeah
I am not feeling good

[Verse]
Wake up at 11:30, feeling like a bag of shit (Oh no!)
All my clothes are dirty, so I'm smelling like a bag of shit
Go to pour my coffee, and I miss my cup
OMG, that is just my luck
Look in the mirror, say, "What's up, you useless fuck?"

[Pre-Chorus]
Are you feeling what I'm feeling?
I haven't had a shower in the last nine days (Ah-ah, ah)
Staring at the ceiling and waiting for this feeling to go away
But it won't go away

[Chorus]
I'm not really feeling like I wanna get lit
(Tell us how you're feelin') Well, I feel like shit (Oh, shit)
Feeling like a saggy, massive sack of shit (Oh, shit)
Big ol' motherfucking duffel bag of shit (Oh, shit)
All day, all shit
I'm not really feeling like I wanna get lit
(Tell us how you're feelin') I'm feeling like shit

[Outro]
Ladies (Yeah?) Do you feel like shit?
Tell me, do you feel likе shit? (Oh, yeah)
Fellas (Huh?) Are you feeling likе shit?
Tell me, are you feeling like shit? (Oh, yeah)
Ladies (Yeah?) Do you feel like shit?
Tell me, do you feel like shit? (Oh, yeah)
Fellas (Huh?) Are you feeling like shit?
Tell me, are you feelin' like shit? (Oh, yeah)

[Chorus]
Sexting (Whoa-oh, whoa-oh, oh, oh)
It isn't sex, it's the next best thing
Sexting
Ayy, ayy, AT&T

[Verse 1]
I am in bed; I am ready to go with you
Tonight, I'm thinking of taking it slow: We'll use—
Emojis only; we don't need phonetical diction
We'll talk dirty like we're ancient Egyptians
You send me a peach (Ooh), I send a carrot back (Ahh)
You send a Ferris wheel; that's pretty abstract
I send back a ticket stub, implying that the Ferris wheel's your body and I'd really love admission to it (Ahh)
Oh, no! What if, now, you think that I'm implying your vagina is as big as a Ferris wheel? (Damn)
You send back a snowman
Crisis averted (Thank God)

[Chorus]
Sexting (Whoa-oh, whoa-oh, oh, oh)
It isn't sex; it's the next best thing (Next best thing)
Sexting
Ayy, ayy, AT&T

[Verse 2]
No more emojis; now, it's on to words
I ask what you're wearing; you reply, "A shirt"
You say, "Are you naked?" I say, "Yeah, except for a top hat"
You say, "lmao," but I doubt that
I'm getting hot at just the thought of what I'd do to you
'Cause in my head, I'm in your bed and getting through to you
They made the internet for nights like these (Nights like these)
I love you, baby; send a picture of your tits, please

[Chorus]
Sexting (Whoa-oh, whoa-oh, oh, oh)
It isn't sex; it's the next best thing (Next best thing)
Sexting
Ayy, ayy (We are sexting) AT&T

[Verse 3]
You send the pic and say it's now my turn
Jesus fucking Christ, I guess I never learn
My phone's flash is my only light, and
The flash makes my dick look frightened
I chicken out and send a picture of my face instead
Because my dick looks like the baby from Eraserhead
You say, "I sent my titties, that's not fair" (That's not fair)
So I send it to you, and then my phone dies

[Outro]
Another night on my own, yeah
Stuck in my home, yeah
Sitting alone
One hand on my dick and one hand on my phone, yeah
Another night on my own, yeah
Stuck in my home, yeah
Sitting alone
One hand on my dick and one hand on my phone, yeah
Another night on my own, yeah
Stuck in my home, yeah
Sitting alone
One hand on my dick and one hand on my phone, yeah
(Pussy) Another night on my own, yeah
(Titties) Stuck in my home, yeah
(Balls) Sitting alone
One hand on my dick and one hand on my phone, yeah

[Chorus]
Pour me a drink and clear my schedule
I'ma FaceTime with my mom tonight (Night, night, night, night)
These 40 minutes are essential
I'ma FaceTime with my mom tonight (Night, night, night, night)

[Verse 1]
I call, she answers, and her hair is wet (Hair is wet)
I say, "Did you just shower?"
She says, "How'd you guess?"
I say, "Your hair is wet"; she says, "Oh, yeah"

[Chorus]
I tell my boys I need some space, yeah
I'ma FaceTime with my mom tonight
She'll hold her iPhone 5 no further than six inches from her face, yeah
I'ma FaceTime with my mom tonight (Tonight)

[Verse 2]
She says, "Oh, look who's here. Say hi to Dad!"
(Da— Da— Da— Hi to Dad— Hi to Dad)
He says, "How ya doing, bud?"
I say, "I'm not so bad"
And that's the deepest talk we've ever had

[Chorus]
Watching as she looks for her glasses
I'ma FaceTime with my mom tonight
She'll tell me all about the Season Six finale of The Blacklist
I'ma FaceTime with my mom tonight (Night, night, night, night)

[Coda]
My mother's covering her camera with her thumb
I'll waste my time FaceTiming with my mom
My mother's covering her camera with her thumb
I'll waste my time FaceTiming with my mom
My mother's covering her camera with her thumb
I'll waste my time FaceTiming with my mom
My mother's covering her camera with her thumb
I'll waste my time FaceTiming with my mom

[Verse 1]
An open window
A novel
A couple holding hands
An avocado
A poem written in the sand
Fresh fallen snow on the ground
A golden retriever in a flower crown
Is this Heaven?
Or is it just a

White woman

Latte foam art
Tiny pumpkins
Fuzzy, comfy socks
Coffee table made out of driftwood
A bobblehead of Ruth Bader Ginsburg
A needlepoint of a fox
Some random quote from Lord of the Rings
Incorrectly attributed to Martin Luther King
Is this Heaven?
Or am I looking at a

Her favorite photo of her mom
The caption says:
"I can't believe it
It's been a decade since you've been gone
Mama, I miss you
I miss sitting with you in the front yard
Still figuring out how to keep living without you
It's got a little better, but it's still hard
Mama, I got a job I love and my own apartment
Mama, I got a boyfriend, and I'm crazy about him
Your little girl didn't do too bad
Mama, I love you, give a hug and kiss to Dad"

[Verse 3]
A goat-cheese salad (Goat-cheese salad)
A backlit hammock (Backlit hammock)
A simple glass of wine
Incredibly derivative political street art
A dreamcatcher bought from Urban Outfitters
A vintage neon sign
Three little words, a couple of doves
And a ring on her finger from the person that she loves
Is this Heaven?
Or is it just a

I grew up overshadowed by wooden fields
Couldn't catch the eye of no city girl

Here I am devoted to Carla
How I love the way you look in your grey jeans
Can't believe I let the smog cloud my eye

Where the wooden fields stand
And the sandy parks surround
I'll ride my bonnie truck with you by my side

There's a whisper in the Cornwall breeze
Reminding me of Lisa
That whisper builds
That whisper cries
Lisa in the morning skies

You appear on the horizon
Brushing that brown hair from your eyes

The city folk with their fancy gadgets
Cement fields like grey tombs
Don't have nothin' on our way of life
Just listen to the trees
Don't live your life like a city boy
Today might feel a time to be like a city boy
But that ain't no way to lead a life

You know, there's a lot I drive by in my bonnie truck
Folk who is messing up
Always stay funny, Carla
Always stay funny

In Cornwall, when I was a child
I met a funny man
"How can you be so funny?" asked I
Here was his wise reply

Don't live your life like a city boy
Today might feel a time to be like a city boy
But that ain't no way to lead a life

Met an old lady who lived like a city boy
"What happened to her?" asked I
Here was his wise reprise

Don't live your life like a city boy
Today might feel a time to be like a city boy
But that ain't no way to lead a life
That lady's gone now
It's sad really
Word is, she had brown hair once

Little Carla, keep your jeans grey
Always stay funny, Carla
Always stay funny

Trees, trees, trees
Trees, trees, trees...

I grew up overshadowed by damp jungles
Couldn't catch the eye of no city boy

Here I am devoted to Maddie
How I love the way you look in your purple jeans
Can't believe I let the smog cloud my eye

Where the damp jungles stand
And the damp nooks surround
I'll ride my battered truck with you by my side

There's a whisper in the Bude breeze
Reminding me of Rubeus
That whisper builds
That whisper cries
Rubeus in the morning skies
You appear on the horizon
Brushing that brown hair from your eyes

The city folk with their fancy gadgets
Cement jungles like grey tombs
Don't have nothin' on our way of life
Just listen to the cuckoos

Don't live your life like a scoundrel
Today might feel a time to be like a scoundrel
But that ain't no way to lead a life

You know, there's a lot I drive by in my battered truck
Folk who is messing up
Always stay strong, Maddie
Always stay strong

In Bude, when I was a child
I met a strong man
"How can you be so strong?" asked I
Here was his wise reply

Don't live your life like a scoundrel
Today might feel a time to be like a scoundrel
But that ain't no way to lead a life

Met an old lady who lived like a scoundrel
"What happened to her?" asked I
Here was his wise reprise

Don't live your life like a scoundrel
Today might feel a time to be like a scoundrel
But that ain't no way to lead a life

That lady's gone now
It's sad really
Word is, she had brown hair once

Little Maddie, keep your jeans purple
Always stay strong, Maddie
Always stay strong

Cuckoos, cuckoos, cuckoos
Cuckoos, cuckoos, cuckoos...

[Verse 1]
How are you feeling?
Do you like the show?
Are you tired of it?
Never mind, I don’t wanna know
Are you finding it boring?
Too fast? Too slow?
I’m asking, but don’t answer
‘Cause I don’t wanna know

[Verse 2]
Do I have your attention?
Yes, or no?
I bet I’d guess the answer
But I don’t wanna know
Am I on in the background?
Are you on your phone?
I’d ask you what you’re watching
But I don’t wanna know

[Verse 3]
Is there anyone out there?
Or am I all alone?
It wouldn’t make a difference
Still, I don’t wanna know
I thought it’d be over by now
But I got a while to go
I’d give away the ending
But you don’t wanna kn-

[Verse 1]
Who needs a coffee? 'Cause I'm doing a run
I'm writing down the orders now for everyone
The coffee is free, just like me
I'm an unpaid intern

[Verse 2]
Sorting papers, running around (Runnin' around)
Sitting in the meeting room, not making a sound (Not a sound)
Barely people, somehow legal
Unpaid intern

[Verse 3]
You work all day, go back to your dorm
And since you can't afford a mortgage, you just torrent a porn
'Cause you're an intern (Unpaid)

[Outro]
Wa-da-da-wap-wa-da

[Intro]
I can't really, uh, play the guitar very well
Um, or sing, so, you know, apologies

[Verse 1]
Stunning 8K resolution meditation app
In honor of the revolution, it's half-off at the Gap
Deadpool's self-awareness, loving parents, harmless fun
The backlash to the backlash to the thing that's just begun

[Chorus]
There it is again
That funny feeling
That funny feeling
There it is again
That funny feeling
That funny feeling

[Verse 2]
The surgeon general's pop-up shop, Robert Iger's face
Discount Etsy agitprop, Bugles' take on race
Female Colonel Sanders, easy answers, civil war
The whole world at your fingеrtips, the ocean at your door
The livе-action Lion King, the Pepsi Halftime Show
Twenty-thousand years of this, seven more to go
Carpool Karaoke, Steve Aoki, Logan Paul
A gift shop at the gun range, a mass shooting at the mall

[Chorus]
There it is again
That funny feeling
That funny feeling
There it is again
That funny feeling
That funny feeling

[Verse 3]
Reading Pornhub's terms of service, going for a drive
And obeying all the traffic laws in Grand Theft Auto V
Full agoraphobic, losing focus, cover blown
A book on getting better hand-delivered by a drone
Total disassociation, fully out your mind
Googling "derealization," hating what you find
That unapparent summer air in early fall
The quiet comprehending of the ending of it all

[Chorus]
There it is again
That funny feeling
That funny feeling
There it is again
That funny feeling
That funny feeling

[Outro]
Hey, what can you say?
We were overdue
But it'll be over soon
You wait
Hey, what can you say?
We were overdue
But it'll be over soon
Just wait
Ba-da-da, ba-da-da, ba-da-da-da-da-da-da
Hey, what can you say?
We were overdue
But it'll be over soon
You wait
Ba-da-da, ba-da-da, ba-da-da-da-da-da-da
Hey, what can you say?
We were overdue, oh
But it'll be over soon
You wait
Ba-da-da, ba-da-da, ba-da
Hey, what can you say?
We were overdue
But it'll be over soon
You wait
Ba-da-da, ba-da-da, ba-da-da-da-da-da-da

[Verse 1]
The money, digits fall off in my pocket
I went and got the money, I went and got the money whatchu did
Did not know I'm bout the profits? I'm all about a sack, I'm going to the bank, I admit
I'm ridin round the 6 with my sig, It's scary like the Tales from The Crypt
My music for the bloods and the crips, they say its coast to coast, It's Gucci Mane La Flare, do ya dig?
Don;t over stan, It's Gucci Mane, got Pakistan, Afganistan, Belgium, and New zealand, I overstand, I over town, I'm over look, I over look, you under hand, you dirty mouthy scoundrel, it's gucci
I'm grounded, It's Gucci!

[Interlude: by ?]

[Verse 2: by ?]

[Verse 1]
Welcome to the internet! Have a look around
Anything that brain of yours can think of can be found
We've got mountains of content—some better, some worse
If none of it's of interest to you, you'd be the first

[Verse 2]
Welcome to the internet! Come and take a seat
Would you like to see the news or any famous women's feet?
There's no need to panic; this isn't a test, haha
Just nod or shake your head, and we'll do the rest

[Verse 3]
Welcome to thе internet! What would you prefеr?
Would you like to fight for civil rights or tweet a racial slur?
Be happy! Be horny! Be bursting with rage!
We've got a million different ways to engage

[Verse 4]
Welcome to the internet! Put your cares aside
Here's a tip for straining pasta; here's a nine-year-old who died
We've got movies and doctors and fantasy sports
And a bunch of colored-pencil drawings of all the different characters in Harry Potter fucking each other

[Verse 5]
Welcome to the internet! Hold on to your socks
'Cause a random guy just kindly sent you photos of his cock
They are grainy and off-putting; he just sent you more
Don't act surprised—you know you like it, you whore

[Verse 6]
See a man beheaded, get offended, see a shrink
Show us pictures of your children, tell us every thought you think
Start a rumor, buy a broom, or send a death threat to a boomer
Or DM a girl and groom her, do a zoom or find a tumor in your—
Here's a healthy breakfast option, you should kill your mom
Here's why women never fuck you; here's how you can build a bomb
Which Power Ranger are you? Take this quirky quiz
Obama sent the immigrants to vaccinate your kids

[Chorus]
Could I interest you in everything all of the time?
A little bit of everything all of the time?
Apathy's a tragedy, and boredom is a crime
Anything and everything all of the time
Could I interest you in everything all of the time?
A little bit of everything all of the time?
Apathy's a tragedy, and boredom is a crime
Anything and everything all of the time

[Spoken Interlude]
You know, it wasn't always like this

[Bridge]
Not very long ago, just before your time
Right before the towers fell, circa '99
This was catalogs, travel blogs, a chatroom or two
We set our sights and spent our nights waiting for you!
You, insatiable you
Mommy let you use her iPad; you were barely two
And it did all the things we designed it to do
Now, look at you! Oh, ha, look at you!
You, you! Unstoppable, watchable
Your time is now, your inside's out, honey, how you grew
And if we stick together, who knows what we'll do?
It was always the plan to put the world in your hand

[Break]
(*Laughs*)

[Chorus]
Could I interest you in everything all of the time?
A bit of everything all of the time?
Apathy's a tragedy, and boredom is a crime
Anything and everything all of the time
Could I interest you in everything all of the time?
A little bit of everything all of the time?
Apathy's a tragedy, and boredom is a crime
Anything and everything and anything and everything
And anything and everything and
All of the time

[Verse 1]
Stuck here, so far from home
Talking, but they don't know
Can't make sense of the signs
I thought I would die
'Til you looked in my eyes

[Chorus]
'Til something changes
It's a different language
'Cause words say too much and get in the way
We talk in the strangest love

[Verse 2]
I never had anywhere to go
Nothing, I've been here all alone
No one to show me
No one can hear me
Baby, just tell me

[Chorus]
'Til something changes
It's a differеnt language
'Cause words say too much and get in thе way
We talk in the strangest love
'Til something changes
It's a different language
'Cause words say too much and get in the way
We talk in the strangest love

[Bridge]
I don't have to know what you're saying
I don't have to be afraid no more
Don't talk no more
That's not what words are for, yeah
'Til something changes

[Chorus]
Oh, oh
'Til something changes (oh, oh)
It's a different language (oh, oh)
'Cause words say too much
And get in the way
We talk in the strangest love
Strangest love (oh, whoa, whoa)
Strangest love (oh, whoa, whoa)
Strangest love (oh, whoa, whoa)
Strangest love (oh, whoa, whoa)

Get your fuckin' hands up
Get on out of your seats
All eyes on me, all eyes on me
Get your fuckin' hands up
Get on out of your seats
All eyes on me, all eyes on me

[Verse 1]
Are you feeling nervous? Are you having fun?
It's almost over, it's just begun
Don't overthink this, look in my eye
Don't be scared, don't be shy
Come on in, the water's fine

[Pre-Chorus]
We're goin' to go where everybody knows
Everybody knows, everybody, oh

Everybody knows

[Interlude]
You wanna hear a funny story?
So, uh, five years ago, I quit performing live comedy
Because I was beginning to have, uh, severe panic attacks while on stage
Which is not a great place to have them
So I, I quit, and I didn't perform for five years
And I spent that time trying to improve myself mentally
And you know what? I did! I got better
I got so much better, in fact, that in January of 2020
I thought, "You know what? I should start performing again
I've been hiding from the world and I need to re-enter"
And then, the funniest thing happened

[Verse 2]
Are you feeling nervous? Are you having fun?
It's almost over, it's just begun
Don't overthink this, look in my eye
Don't be scared, don't be shy
Come on in, the water's fine

[Verse 3]
You say the ocean's rising like I give a shit
You say the whole world's ending, honey, it already did
You're not gonna slow it, Heaven knows you tried
Got it? Good, now get inside

[Pre-Chorus]
We're goin' to go where everybody knows
Everybody knows, everybody knows
We're goin' to go where everybody knows
Everybody knows

[Chorus]
Come on, get your fuckin' hands up
Get on out of your seat
All eyes on me, all eyes on me
Hey, come on, get your fuckin' hands up
Get on out of your seats
All eyes on me, all eyes on me, yeah
Heads down, pray for me
Heads down now, pray for me
I said get your fuckin' hands up
Get up, get up
I'm talkin' to you, get the fuck up

[Chorus]
Get your fuckin' hands up
Get on out of your seat
All eyes on me, all eyes on me
Ayy, fuckin' get your fuckin' hands up
Get on out of your seat
All eyes on me, all eyes on me, yeah
Come on, heads down, pray for me
Heads down now, pray for me
I said get your fuckin' hands up
Get on—
All eyes on me, all eyes on me

[Verse 1]
Everyday I realize
That this might be the last day of my life
Walking down the street I find, yeah
I'm coming closer and closer to losing my mind

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause when it rains it pours, when it rains it pours
Isn't life worth more
I don't even know what I'm hustlin' for
You gotta do just what you gotta do
To make it through
All the hard times that's gonna face you, oh

[Chorus]
This is the life
This is the life
We gonna make it, we gonna make it
This is the life
This is the life
We gonna make it, we gonna make it

[Verse 2]
Living will always be a struggle
Looking for someone true to love you
Looking back I see all the horror
This madness makes me wanna hide

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I watch slowly, internally I'm dying
Pillow cases wet from all my crying
There's nothin' more, nothin' more to be here for
Take me away, take me away I can't live that life no more

[Chorus]
This is the life
This is the life
We gonna make it, we gonna make it
This is the life
This is the life
We gonna make it, we gonna make it

[Chorus]

[Lyrics from Snippet]
It's been a few years since I got my licence
And I started to drive you mad
Now I'm here wondering where all the time went
You're the best I ever had
Well at least my top three

[Lyrics from Snippet]
Since you left my side, now I'm always tired
I-I-I can't sleep 'till I know where you are
I know you did this to me-

[Lyrics from Snippet]
Don't know how it's appealing but I'll take it anyway
Till I'm touching the celling, till my mum is on the way
To her grave still hear screaming even on a different day
If you asked how I was up I dont think that I could say
Yeah, yeah, yea-ea-ea-ea-eah

[Chorus]
CEO, entrepreneur
Born in 1964
Jeffrey, Jeffrey Bezos
CEO, entrepreneur
Born in 1964
Jeffrey, Jeffrey Bezos

[Verse]
Come on, Jeffrey, you can do it
Pave the way, put your back into it
Tell us why, show us how
Look at where you came from, look at you now
Zuckerberg and Gates and Buffett
Amateurs can fuckin' suck it
Fuck their wives, drink their blood
Come on, Jeff, get 'em

[Synth Interlude]

*Screams*

[Verse 1]
I love, and you love
We love, sweet love
I look and you look
And we found sweet love
And now we know

[Chorus]
Love is the only thing that matters at all
After all

[Verse 2]
I kiss, and you kiss
Each kiss, sweet lips
I tease and you squeeze
And we find sweet bliss
That's how we know

[Chorus]
Love is the only thing that matters at all
After all

[Bridge]
I'm lucky
And you're lucky, too, uh-huh
We're lucky
And we know it's true
Love is so wonderful

[Verse 3]
I give, and you give
We live, for love
Each night, each day
We love sweet love
'Cause ain't it so?

[Outro]

[Verse 1]
I grew up as your usual suburbanite
A tiny town in Massachusetts, overwhelmingly white (White— White— White)
I went to church on Sundays in a suit and a tie (In a suit and a tie)
Then spent my free time watching Family Guy
I started doing comedy when I was just a sheltered kid
I wrote offensive shit, and I said it
Father, please forgive me, for I did not realize what I did
Or that I'd live to regret it

[Pre-Chorus]
Times are changing, and I'm getting old
Are you gonna hold me accountable?
My bed is empty, and I'm getting cold
Isn't anybody gonna hold me accountable? Ugh!

[Chorus]
I'm problematic
(He's a problem)
When I was 17, on Halloween, I dressed up as Aladdin
(He's a problem)
I did not darken my skin, but, still, it feels weird in hindsight

[Verse 2]
I want to show you how I'm growing as a person, but first
I feel I must address the lyrics from the previous verse
I tried to hide behind my childhood, and that's not okay
My actions are my own; I won't explain them away
I've done a lot of self-reflecting since I started singing this song
I was totally wrong when I said it
Father, please forgive me, for I did not realize what I did
Or that I'd live to regret it

[Pre-Chorus]
Times are changing, and I'm getting old
Are you gonna hold me accountable?
My bed is empty, and I'm getting cold
Isn't anybody gonna hold me accountable? Ugh!

[Chorus]
I'm problematic
(He's a problem)
I just remembered that Aladdin costume's in my mother's attic
(He's a problem)
I'm gonna go home and burn it
Or not burn it. Is burning it bad? What should I do with it?

[Bridge]
And I've been totally awful
My closet is chock-full of stuff that is vaguely shitty
All of it was perfectly lawful
Just not very thoughtful at all and just really shitty
And I've been totally awful
My closet is chock-full of stuff that is vaguely shitty
All of it was perfectly lawful
Just not very thoughtful at all and just really—

[Outro]
And I'm really fucking sorry
(Bitch, I'm trying to listen; shit, I’ve been complicit)
Sorry
(If I'm gonna catch up, first, I gotta fess up)
Sorry
Sorry

[Verse 1]
I used to run for miles, I used to ride my bike
I used to wake up with a smile
And go to bed at night with a dream, ah
But now I'm turning 30
No!
I used to be the young one, got used to meeting people
Who weren't used to meeting someone who was born in 1990
No way! (Yeah, I was born in 1990)
Now I'm turning thirty
God, God damn it!

[Chorus]
I'm (Turning 30, turning 30)

[Verse 2]
When he was 27, my granddad fought in Vietnam
When I was 27, I built a birdhouse with my mom
Oh, fuck, how am I 30?
I used to make fun of the boomers; in retrospect, a bit too much
Now all these fucking zoomers are telling me that I'm out of touch?
Oh yeah? Well, your fucking phones are poisoning your minds. Okay? So when you develop a dissociative mental disorder in your late twenties, don't come crawling back to m-

[Chorus]
I'm (Turning 30, turning 30)
(Turning 30, turning 30)
Turning (Turning 30, turning 30)
(Turning 30, turning 30)

(Turning 30, turning 30)
I'm turning 30 (Turning 30, turning 30)
(Turning 30, turning 30)

[Bridge]
And now my stupid friends are having stupid children
My stupid friends are having stupid children
My stupid friends are having stupid children
My stupid friends are having stupid children
And now my stupid friends are having stupid children
My stupid friends are having stupid children
My stupid friends are having stupid children
Stupid, fucking ugly, boring children

[Outro]
It's 2020, and I'm 30, I'll do another ten
2030, I'll be 40 and kill myself then

[Spoken Intro]
So, um... Uh, my current mental health is is rapidly approaching, um... an ATL ... which is, um... That's an all-time low. Not... Not Atlanta. And, you know, I feel okay when I'm asleep. Like, when I'm asleep I feel alright. But it's basically... From the moment I wake up, I, uh... I just get this

[Verse]
Feeling in my body
Way down deep inside me
I try not to fight it
(Describe it!)
Alright
A few things start to happen
My vision starts to flatten
My heart, it gets to tappin'
And I think I'm gonna die!

Yeah, so, um, yeah. Not, not doing great

[Intro]
(Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah)
I'll bring him down, bring him down, down
(Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah)
A king with no crown, king with no crown

[Verse 1]
When he calls to me, I am ready
I'll wash his feet with my hair if he needs
Forgive him when his tongue lies through his brain
Even after three times he betrays me

[Pre-Chorus]
(Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah)
I'll bring him down, bring him down, down
(Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah)
A king with no crown, king with no crown

[Chorus]
I'm just a Holy Fool, oh baby
It's so cruel, but I'm still in love with Judas, baby
I'm just a Holy Fool, oh baby
It's so cruel, but I'm still in love with Judas, baby

[Verse 2]
I couldn't love a man so purely
Even prophets forgave his goofy way
I've learned love is like a brick
You can build a house or sink a dead body

[Pre-Chorus]
(Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah)
I'll bring him down, bring him down, down
(Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah)
A king with no crown, king with no crown

[Chorus]
I'm just a Holy Fool, oh baby
It's so cruel, but I'm still in love with Judas, baby
I'm just a Holy Fool, oh baby
It's so cruel, but I'm still in love with Judas, baby

[Breakdown]
In the most Biblical sense, I am beyond repentance
Famе hooker, prostitute, wench vomits hеr mind
But in the cultural sense, I just speak in future tense
Judas, kiss me, if offensed, or wear ear condom next time

[Bridge]
I wanna love you
But something’s pulling me away from you
Jesus is my virtue, and Judas is the demon I cling to
I cling to

[Chorus]
Just a Holy Fool, oh baby
It's so cruel, but I'm still in love with Judas, baby
I'm just a Holy Fool, oh baby (Just a Holy Fool, woah-oh-oh-oh)
It's so cruel, but I'm still in love with Judas, baby
Woah-woah-woah-woah-woah (Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh)
I’m in love with Juda-as, Juda-as (Juda-a-a-as)
Woah-woah-woah-woah-woah (Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh)
I’m in love with Juda-as, Juda-as (Juda-a-a-as)

[Verse]
Never a bum, my brother, Hi-Tek over Rum
When you dap me up, I know you see me shining from pinky finger to thumb
We heavy traffic, I call static, up in the attic
Like Dish Network, I’m top floor by the blue shore
That’s Lil Boat, with the biggest ego, flyer than a seagull
Every time you see me out, you know it’s a movie like regal
Cinema, lil' Chrissy that's my photographer
Lil Boat be going very far, burnin’ up like Sean Paul
Stack it up so I can cop a crib that sit tall and have the closets that look like a lil' mufuckin' lil' mini-mall
I’m big poppa, top shotta with gold chains
Like Silk the Shocka, you run up wrong, you catchin’ the blocka
To your blocka, that’s how fire like a Boat verse
You listen close, you might ride out in a black hurst
In middle school they was callin' me lil' Hershey kiss cause’ I was black as fuck like light side of county jail at 8
I know I’m dated, straight pussy on my plate
I eat it up like chum, chum, chum
Then I brush my teeth with Colgate
Lil Boat the ruler, nobody cooler, I'm Ja Ra Jue
Will kill boost sword, that’ll end ya life a whole lot sooner

[Outro]
Okay
One of the most challenging and exciting games, Cata.io on Madboy Hub is generating a lot of raves right now. People can’t stop playing, and the reason behind this is its global leaderboard

Taking your username to the top of the leaderboard in Catac.io isn’t as easy as it seems. Players around the world are hoping on MadboyHub.com and giving multiple tries to this adventure multiplayer game but still falling short with few points

If you want to score high in Catac.io, then you really need to read further. With the help of online champions of Catac.io, we have compiled a list of the best strategies that will help you defeat every imposter in this catfight in space




Trapping the Imposter


The most effective strategy for Catac.io is trapping the imposter. You can choose any random imposter, and then you can trap him by circling him. This way, the imposter will eventually give up, giving you an easy kill



This strategy sounds easy, but it takes a lot of planning and quick thinking. The first rule of this strategy is, never be constant with your moves. Be dynamic as much as possible. If you keep circling in the same motion, eventually, the imposter will catch up. So always be unpredictable during a catfight



2.            On the edge



Another effective strategy of making a score in Catac.io is taking the imposter to the edge. It is that one place where very few imposters hang around. At the edge, you can focus on a single imposter. It is the perfect spot for trapping your enemy



There are few things you need to keep in mind while taking your enemy to the edge. The first is never to reveal your plan beforehand. Keep the imposter distracted until it reaches the edge. Furthermore, once reaching the edge, take him out once and for all




3.            Take it slow



While initially starting, remember to take things slow. Choose your kill carefully, take out the weakest first and then slowly move forward on the leaderboard. If you go directly for the pro player, you will lose. Keep yourself out of the way of pro players at the start



Find the weakest, and take them down, one by one. Remember, there is a reason why some players are at the top of the scoreboard. They know every possible strategy there is. It takes patience and perfect planning to catch the big fish




4.            The hunter and the camper



After scoring some points and taking out weak players, you need to change your strategy completely. Now, you need to select imposters randomly and then hunt them down



Choose a random imposter, and follow him around for some time. But remember, do not let him/her realise that you are onto them. Find the perfect moment, and then snap, just like Thor, go for the head




5.            The chaos maker



The chaos maker is one of the most sinister and smart ways to score multiple kills. It requires a strategy on a big scale. Things move pretty fast during this strategy. It is one of the riskiest strategies out there



The chaos maker is the imposter who uses chaos as a ladder to reach the top of the scoreboard. The first thing you need to do as a chaos maker is, find the most populated area in space. Once you find it, analyze it carefully. Find the perfect moment for entering the herd. Go for the big kill, as it will cause a lot of panic among other nearby imposters. Then carefully and with stealth, go for others quickly


If you perfectly plan out each of the above-mentioned strategies, you will become unstoppable. But, do remember you are not the only one who has the power of knowledge and skills. Visit Madboyhub.com to play this awesome online multiplayer game and good luck, may the best imposter win

[Verse 1]
Really don't know a lot
Really been through a lot
Really don't got a lot of time
Break it down, slow it down
Keep it digestible for you
Ooh, can you come through?
Bring that code up with you
I got time, I got vibes whenever you need it
It's about taking time
It's about taking mine back
It's about changing lives
It's about taking mine back

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I need it all right now
Feelin' a temper tantrum comin' on
I’m really stressed right now
Feeling a temper tantrum

[Chorus]
Hold me, hold me, hold me close
Hold me, hold me, hold me close
You got me?
Hold me, hold me, hold me close
Hold me, hold me close
I need you to, pleasе hold me close
I can’t do it on my own

[Verse 2]
I know that is peoplе dyin'
I know that is more important
Right now I can't get your words out of my head
Can't get that vision out of my head
Is you, or isn't you down?
Or isn't you down to ride right out, or what?
Sticking around, or what?
Figure it out, or what?
I know you're still scared of me, me too
I wouldn't trust me neither
I couldn't love me neither
But I've been doing the best I can

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I'm givin' up right now
Feelin' a temper tantrum comin' on
I'm missin' us right now
Feeling a temper tantrum

[Chorus]
Hold me, hold me, hold me close
Hold me, hold me, hold me close
You got me?
Hold me, hold me, hold me close
Hold me, hold me close
I need you to, please hold me close
I can’t do it on my own

[Verse: J. Cole]
Who the first one that wanna jump up?
Who the first one that wanna get lumped up?
This rap shit got you really believin' you that nigga you rappin' like
Fuck niggas hangin' with tough niggas for bragging rights
I don't know if that's cool with y'all, if so, then cool
I move along, a Ville nigga, I grew up with do's and don't
And that type lose they life like you might lose your phone
Relatively often, now I push 750s often
Never lift me off my square, or off my chair
In this game of musical chairs
Ain't it clear that my maneuvers way more fluid than their's?
And I hear you're talkin' 'bout your money, was you aware?
Just to catch up to my bread it would take you 200 yеars
Nigga, yeah, now cut that shit out
I know what you netted, don't makе a nigga put that shit out

[Spoken Intro]
I've never done anything like this before

[Verse 3 - Say So]
It's been a long time since you fell in love
You ain't coming out your shell, you ain't really been yourself
Tell me, what must I do? (Do tell, my love)
'Cause luckily I'm good at reading
I wouldn't bug him, but he won't stop cheesin'
And we can dance all day around it
If you frontin', I'll be bouncing
If you want it, scream it, shout it, babe
(Ow!)

[Chorus - Say So]
Day to night to morning, keep with me in the moment
I'd let you had I known it, why don't you say so?
Didn't even notice, no punches left to roll with
You got to keep me focused; you want it? Say so

[Interlude - Say So & Like That]

You know I hate it when I'm left on read
But he make it all up in the bed
And he take me out, dinin' on nothin' but the best
He got Off-White
Damn, he can dress
Makin' plans from the East, makin' bands in the West
Rockstar, Black Beatle type, bands on his bread
And baby, I want it, and I'll just be honest
'Cause I just can't front when I look at you
Just keep it one hundred, when I throw these hundreds
(Mmm)

[Chorus - Like That]
Tha-tha-tha-tha-tha-that's my shit, that's my wave

Don't be scared, I ain't afraid

Been moving to and fro, just wandering
With no place to go

[Chorus]
Since I lost you, lost you
All I ever do is be wandering
'Til I wander back to you

[Verse 2]
Oh, oh, I'm wishing, been yearning for your kiss
Ooh, now I've been missing, the warmth of your caress

[Chorus]
Since I lost you, I've lost you, all I ever do is be wandering
Wandering, wandering, wandering
I'll be wandering 'til I wander back to you

[Bridge]
I look on every corner, down every dismal street
Are you there? Are you there?
Oh darling I repeat
I visit old familiar places
There's no one there but me
Where can you be? Where can you be?
Oh darling, where can you be?

[Verse 3]
Oh, I'm praying your touch for me has grown
Mmm, and I'm saying, for before it's not been known

[Outro]
I love you, I love you, and all I ever do is be wandering
Crying, wandering, wandering
I'll be wandering 'til I wander, 'til I wander back to you
Yeah, oh yeah
I'm gonna be, I'm gonna be wandering 'til I wander back to you
Yeah, yeah, mmm, wandering back to you

[Verse 1]
If I told a lie, oh, and if I made you cry
When I said goodbye, I'm sorry
From the bottom of my heart, dear
I apologize

[Verse 2]
Oh, oh, if I caused you pain, I know, I know that I'm to blame
Must have been insane
Come on right now and forgive me
From the bottom of my heart, right now, right now
Oh, I, oh, I apologize

[Bridge]
I realize I've been unfair to you
Please, please let me make, let me make amends
Oh, don't say that you, don't say that you forgot the love we knew
Oh, after all, honey, we were more than just friеnds
Oh, oh, right now

[Outro]
If I made you blue
Oh, baby, don't you know I've had thosе heartaches, too
And I, I beg of you
To come on right now, come on right now and forgive me
From the bottom of my heart, right now, right now
Oh, I apologize

[Verse 1]
The sky is blue
And high above
The moon is new
And so is love
This aching heart of mine
Heart of mine is singing
Oh lover, come on back to me, yeah, ah yeah

[Verse 2]
You came at last
Love had its day
But that day is past
And you've gone away
This eager heart of mine
Heart of mine is singing
Oh lover, come on back to me, yeah

[Bridge]
I remember every little thing you used to do
And I get so lo, so lonely
Every road I walk, I walk along with you
No wonder, no wonder I get so, so lonеly

[Verse 3]
The sky is blue
And high above
Thе moon is new
And so is love, yeah
And while I'm waiting here
This heart of mine is singing
Oh lover, come on back to me, yeah

[Bridge]
This aching heart of mine
Heart of mine is singing
Oh lover, come on back to me, yeah, yeah, yeah

This old heart of mine is singing
Ooh, lover come on back to me, yeah

I remember every little thing you used to do
And I get so, so lonely
Now every road I walk, I walk along with you
No wonder, no wonder I get so, so lonely

[Outro]
The sky is blue
And high above
The moon is new
And so is love, yeah
And while I'm waiting here
This heart of mine is singing
Lover, come back to me
Lover, come on back to me, yeah
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Lately, when I hold you
You're like a stranger in my arms
You seem to be afraid of me
Honey, I don't know you anymore

[Verse 2]
Ooh, baby, when I kiss you
You don't give in, give in to me at all
You string along, mmm
But I know there's something wrong, yes, it is
I don't know you anymore

[Bridge]
We used to talk for hours
Hours at a time
But lately we run out of words
And almost out of time

[Verse 3]
Oh, oh, oh I, oh I
I want to love you, yeah
Don't let me go on this way, this way
You're acting strange
And I know there's been a change
Yeah, I don't know you anymore

[Outro]
Mmm, honey, baby, ooh, I don't know you anymore
Anymore, anymore, anymore, anymore
Anymore

[Verse 1: Wanya Morris]
There's a girl I know who looks so fine, she really turns me on
My friends said I should, but it's taking me too long
Every time I get the nerve to call, she is never home
I leave another message and I sit herе all alone, she's got me

Undеr pressure
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah

[Verse 2: Shawn Stockman]
So I got a chance to talk to her to see just where we stand
If she felt the same about me, could I be her only man?
I tried to let it out and we could have some fun
But before I got an answer, she said she had to run, it's got me

[Chorus: Boyz II Men, Shawn Stockman]

And like her personality, untouchable
Gettin' it on down, still untouchable
Never does react with the mmm, mmm tone
Oh yeah, you're right, she got it goin' on
Whenever I talk to her, I'm under pressure
Lookin' at what you're wearin', under pressure
Got it like that, uh, yeah, come on (Ah yeah)
Gimme some, gimme some, come on
Told her about this, showed her a dance in the house, so
She at her house, you know, you know it

Cold chillin' to the max
Last night, she had no time, she had to run
I know what I'll do 'cause I've only just begun

To pure bliss as I rub and kiss
Every pleasure kept for moments like this

[Verse 1: Nathan Morris, Wanya Morris, Shawn Stockman]
The love I have right next to me
Is here and always will be
I'm caressing your body emotionally
As you can feel and will see
Oh, tell me, why can't we go all the way to the top
The fullest extreme
The sounds I hear when you're with me
Express the way that you feel
(And you say)

[Chorus: Boyz II Men]
Uhh, ahh, uh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ah
Uhh, ahh, uh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ah

[Verse 2: Nathan Morris, Wanya Morris, Boyz II Men]
In a passionate set we're moving close
Every bit of love that we share is the same
I can tell when I reach down deep inside
You show it when you call out my name
Squeezing you tight and holding you close
Is all I feel inside
Although I try to hold in my love
It's something that I just can't hide

[Bridge: Michael McCary]
The music is low
The lights are dim, there we lie
Passion overflows
With every look in your eyes
Infatuation, lust and a lot of love
Sweet caresses and kisses to me as you rub
I clench my back
Ecstasy fills the air
As you kiss on my neck
And stroke the back of my hair
To hold you tonight
I feel this is my duty
To grasp, to hold, to rock that booty

(Boyz II Men) Hey, you know what I'm sayin'?"
Then I said, "Alright, fellas
Well, let me see what you can do"
And then the smart one named Wanya said
"Yo Mike, check this out, see if this one moves you"

[Chorus: Boyz II Men]
Motownphilly back again ("Turn it up")
Doin' a little East Coast swing
Boyz II Men going off ("Turn it up")
Not too hard, not too soft

Jet black Benz, plenty of friends

[Pre-Chorus: Wanya Morris, Shawn Stockman, Boyz II Men]
Back in school
We usеd to dream about this every day

Or do dreams just fade away?
Then we started singing
And they said it sounded smooth
And we started a group and here we are
Kickin' it just for you, oh, oh

[Chorus: Boyz II Men]
Motownphilly back again
Doin' a little East Coast swing

We are ready to roll
So now the world will know that we flow

Said we'd be forever
Said it'd never die
How could you love me and leave me
And never say goodbye?

Girl, each time I try I just break down and cry
Pain in my head, oh, I'd rather be dead
Spinnin' around and around

Still I can't let go
It's unnatural, you belong to me, I belong to you

Girl, I know you really love me
You just don't realize
You've never been there before
It's only your first time
Maybe I'll forgive you, mmm
Maybe you'll try
We should be happy together
Forever, you and I

[Pre-Chorus: Wanya Morris]
Will you love me again like you loved me before
This time I want you to love me much more
This time instead, just come to my bed

[Verse 1: Shawn Stockman]
Coolin' in the studio, you know how the story goes
Bobbin' our heads to the tune we're about to do
It's a laid back swing thang
The groove we feel is strong
We need peace here to get it on
Having fun as we go, making sure the flavor shows

[Pre-Chorus: Shawn Stockman, Boyz II Men]
'Cause we're feeling alright
Takin' our time to free our minds and have a ball, y'all
Everything's fine
It ain't nothing to it 'cause we're gonna do it all
What are we doin'?

[Chorus: Boyz II Men, Shawn Stockman]
Wе're just (Vibin') vibin' (You know it)
Groovin', vibin'

[Verse 2: Nathan Morris]
Ooh yeah yeah, in a dark room with a bluе light
In the basement music just right
Nothing goin' down but the mellow sounds
Of Mr. DJ's turntables goin' around
A mad sensation, a crew of women around sparks inspiration
To set something off the right way to hear the people say

[Pre-Chorus: Nathan Morris, Boyz II Men]
That we're feelin', feelin' alright
Takin' our time to free our minds and have a ball, y'all
Everything's fine
It ain't nothing to it 'cause we're gonna do it all
Don't you know that

[Chorus: Boyz II Men, Nathan Morris]
We're just vibin' (Oh, and we're just dancing)
Groovin' (And we're groovin'), vibin'

When I get the courage up to love somebody new
It always falls apart 'cause they just can't compare to you
Your love won't release me, I'm bound under ball and chain
Reminiscing our love as I watch four seasons change

[Chorus: Boyz II Men]
In comes the winter breeze
That chills the air and drifts thе snow
And I imagine kissing you under the mistlеtoe
When springtime makes its way here
Lilac blooms reminds me of
The scent of your perfume
When summer burns with heat
I always get the hots for you
Go skinny dippin' in the ocean
Where we used to do
When autumn sheds the leaves
The trees are bare when you're not here
It doesn't feel the same
(It doesn't feel the same, oh)

[Verse 2: Nathan Morris, Michael McCary]
Remember the nights when (Remember the night)
We closed our eyes (When we closed our eyes)
And vowed that you and I
Would be in love for all time

[Pre-Chorus: Shawn Stockman]
Every time I think about these things I shared with you
I break down and cry 'cause I get so emotional (I get so emotional)
Until you release me I'm bound under ball and chain
Reminiscing our love as I watch four seasons change

[Chorus: Boyz II Men]
In comes the winter breeze
That chills the air and drifts the snow
And I imagine kissing you under the mistletoe
When springtime makes its way here
Lilac blooms reminds me of
The scent of your perfume
When summer burns with heat
I always get the hots for you
Go skinny dippin' in the ocean where we used to do
When autumn sheds the leaves the trees are bare
When you're not here
It doesn't feel the same

[Bridge: Wanya Morris, Michael McCary]
This loneliness has crushed my heart (It's killing me, baby)
Please let me love again (I just wanna know if I can fix this)

[Pre-Chorus: Shawn Stockman]
'Cause I need your love to comfort me and ease my pain
Or four seasons will bring the loneliness again

[Bridge: Boyz II Men, Wanya Morris]
In comes the winter breeze
Imagine kissing you (I imagine kissing you)
When springtime reminds me of
The scent of your perfume (The scent of your perfume)
I can't believe I'm next to you
And then what we'll do (Where we used to do)
I can't live without your love
It doesn't feel the same

[Chorus: Boyz II Men, Wanya Morris]
In comes the winter breeze
That chills the air and drifts the snow
And I imagine kissing you under the mistletoe
(Kissing you where we used to kiss, baby)
When springtime makes its way here
Lilac blooms reminds me of
The scent of your perfume
When summer burns with heat
I always get the hots for you
Go skinny dippin' in the ocean where we used to do
(Go skinny dippin', hey, hey, hey)
When autumn sheds the leaves the trees are bare
When you're not here
It doesn't feel the same
(It doesn't feel the same, no)

[Outro: Nathan Morris]
Remember
The warmth of
Days gone by

[Intro]
1209
What it do, 30? (What it do, 30?)

[Verse]
One false move, you a goner
We was maskin' up before corona
Young nigga hangin' out the Bentley
While I'm swinging 'round the corner
Paper tag, this is not a loaner
Drug dealer, this one for the owners
This ain't for the leasers
Tom Ford loafers, you could never tie my sneakers
Put her on the block list, I'm like "Bye Felicia"
I be on the island with a Spanish mamacita
And shorty, she be wildin', it's no way that I'ma eat her
Fuck her, I don't feed her, I just fuck hеr, I don't need her
I'm like "We just tryna win shit", Glock, fourth gеn shit
Clear clip, extend shit, don't fear shit, we bend shit
Two friends kissin' on the yacht, that's like a friendship
New Benz, when we hit they block, we spinnin' they're shit
We be ridin' bulletproof, 'cause we be really in shit
He was ridin' bulletproof, we shot it 'til we flipped it
Nigga, I was sturdy back when I was dirty
Started with an ounce, had twenty million by the time I'm thirty
I was in and out, deep in that field where niggas die by thirty
Hangin' with the killers playin' bye-bye-birdy, ya' dig?
Condo in Tribeca, got my mom in Jersey
I wish death on anything that threaten me or try to hurt me
I was rich as fuck, ain't play my cell, I'm out here bright and early
Workout with the lifers doin' a thousand burpees, you dig?
Plain Jane, Richard, five-hundred-eighty Benz
Shit expensive, gotta watch the way you shake my hand
I make the Richie match the Virgil, I just changed the band
They killed my daddy, I was five and I got made a man

[Verse 1]
It was an April morning
When they told us we should go
And as I turned to you, you smiled at me
How could we say no?
With all the fun to have
To live the dreams we always had
Oh, the songs to sing
When we at last return again

[Verse 2]
Sending off a glancing kiss
To those who claim they know
Below the streets that steam and hiss
The devil's in his hole
Oh to sail away
To sandy lands and other days
Oh to touch the dream
Hides inside and never seen, yeah

[Verse 3]
Into the sun, the south, the north
At last the birds have flown
Shackles of commitments fell
In piеces on the ground
Oh, to ride thе wind
To tread the air above the din
Oh, to laugh aloud
Dancing as we fought the crowd, yeah

[Verse 4]
To seek the man whose pointing hand
The giant step unfolds
To guide us from the curving path
That turns our feet to stone
If one bell should ring
In celebration for a king
So fast the heart should beat
As proud the head, with heavy feet, yeah

[Guitar Solo]
Oooh, yeah

[Verse 5]
Days went by when you and I
Bathed in eternal summer's glow
As far away and distant
Our mutual child did grow
Oh, the sweet refrain
Soothes the soul and calms the pain
Oh, Albion remains
Sleeping now to rise again

[Verse 6]
Wandering and wandering
What place to rest the search
The mighty arms of Atlas
Hold the heavens from the Earth
For the mighty arms of Atlas
Hold the heavens from the Earth
From the Earth, Earth
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh...

[Bridge]
Oh oh oh oh
Ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh...

[Outro]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh...
Ooh...

[Verse 1]
You said I was the only
With my lemon in your hand (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
Exhibition is your habit
Emotion second hand (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
Had to pull away to save me
Maybe next time around (Oh)
And she said, don't you want it?
Don't you want cocaine, cocaine, cocaine?
Hadn't planned to, could not stand to
Try it, fry it, na na na na, yeah

[Verse 2]
(Woo, ooh, ooh)
Heard a cry for mercy
In the city of the damned
Oh, oh, baby, damned
In the pits you go no lower
The next stop's underground
Oh, hello underground
Wine and roses ain't quite over
Fate deals a losing hand
And I said, didn't mean to
Did not mean to f-fail
You didn't plan it, you over-ran it

[Verse 3]
You want do it, you want to
You want do it when you want to
You want do it, do it when you want to
When you blow it, babe
You got to blow it right
Oh baby, if you fake it, mama
Baby, fake with all your might
Whеn you fake it, mama
Please fakе it right for yourself, babe
When you fake it, baby
You're faking it for your life, for your life
For your life, for your life
Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it
Do it when you wanna
Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it
Do it when you wanna

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 4]
Oh, I can have you, baby
But I don't know what to do, yeah
Sometime, baby, nothing I could do
On the balance of a crystal
Paying through the nose
And when they couldn't resist you
I thought you'd go with the flow
And now your stage is empty
Bring down the curtain, baby please
Fold up your show
Hadn't planned to
Could not stand to fry in it
Hadn't planned it
I over-ran it, frying
For your life, for your life

[Chorus]
Yeah
One time love, take care how you use it
Try to make it last all night
And if you take your pick, be careful how you choose it
Sometimes it's hard to feel it bite
Feel it bite

[Verse 1]
A man I know went down to Louisiana
Had himself a bad, bad fight
And when the sun peeked through
John Cameron with Suzanna
He kissed the whiskers, left and right
Whiskers

[Verse 2]
Now, now, now, fright subsides
Out at a hotel in the quarter
Our friends check in to pass the night
Now love gets hot, but fire preceded water
Poor whiskеrs set that room alight
Whiskers

[Verse 3]
Down on Bourbon street, you know it's right
You can see my friend
Thеy run around all through the night
Most everywhere
Until the closet's bare
Run for the razor burn
Doin' up my hair
New Orleans queens
Sure know how to schmooze it
Maybe for some that seems alright
When I step out
Strut down with my sugar
She'd best not talk like Barry White!

[Chorus]
One time love, take care how you use it
Try to make it last all night
And if you take your pick, be careful how you choose it
Sometimes it's hard to feel it bite
Whiskers

[Verse 1]
I was burned in the heat of the moment
Though it couldn't been the heat of the day
When I learned how my time had been wasted
Tear fell as I turned away

[Verse 2]
Now I've got friends who will give me their shoulder
When I should happen to fall
Time and his bride growing older
I've got friends who will give me fuck all

[Hook]
Lalala, yeah
Lalala, my baby
Lalala, yeah
Lalala

[Verse 3]
Corner of Bleecker and nowhere
In the land of not quite day
A shiver runs down my backbone
Face in the mirror turns grey

[Verse 4]
So looked round to hitch up the reindeer
Searching hard trying to brighten the day
I turned around to look for the snowman
To my surprise he'd melted away

[Hook]
Lalala, yeah
Lalala, my baby
Lalala, yeah
Lalala

[Verse 5]
As the moon and the stars call the order
Inside my tides dance the ebb and sway
The sun in my soul's sinking lower
While the hope in my hands turns to clay

[Verse 6]
I don't ask that my field's full of clover
I don't moan at opportunity's door
And if you ask my advice, take it slower
Then your story'd be your finest reward

[Hook]
Lalala, yeah
Lalala, my baby
Lalala, yeah
Lalala, now do it

[Bridge]
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

[Verse 7]
Lost on the path to attainment
Search in the eyes of the wise
When I bled from the heart of the matter
I started bleeding without a disguise

[Verse 8]
Now everything's fine under heaven
Now and then you've got to take time to pause
When you're down on the ground, don't be messing around
Or you'll land in a boat without oars

[Hook]
Lalala, yeah
Lalala, my baby
Lalala, yeah
Lalala

[Bridge]
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

One of the most challenging and exciting games, Cata.io on Madboy Hub is generating a lot of raves right now. People can’t stop playing, and the reason behind this is its global leaderboard

Taking your username to the top of the leaderboard in Catac.io isn’t as easy as it seems. Players around the world are hoping on MadboyHub.com and giving multiple tries to this adventure multiplayer game but still falling short with few points

If you want to score high in Catac.io, then you really need to read further. With the help of online champions of Catac.io, we have compilеd a list of the best strategiеs that will help you defeat every imposter in this catfight in space


Trapping the Imposter
The most effective strategy for Catac.io is trapping the imposter. You can choose any random imposter, and then you can trap him by circling him. This way, the imposter will eventually give up, giving you an easy kill

This strategy sounds easy, but it takes a lot of planning and quick thinking. The first rule of this strategy is, never be constant with your moves. Be dynamic as much as possible. If you keep circling in the same motion, eventually, the imposter will catch up. So always be unpredictable during a catfight

2. On the edge

Another effective strategy of making a score in Catac.io is taking the imposter to the edge. It is that one place where very few imposters hang around. At the edge, you can focus on a single imposter. It is the perfect spot for trapping your enemy

There are few things you need to keep in mind while taking your enemy to the edge. The first is never to reveal your plan beforehand. Keep the imposter distracted until it reaches the edge. Furthermore, once reaching the edge, take him out once and for all

3. Take it slow

While initially starting, remember to take things slow. Choose your kill carefully, take out the weakest first and then slowly move forward on the leaderboard. If you go directly for the pro player, you will lose. Keep yourself out of the way of pro players at the start
Find the weakest, and take them down, one by one. Remember, there is a reason why some players are at the top of the scoreboard. They know every possible strategy there is. It takes patience and perfect planning to catch the big fish

4. The hunter and the camper

After scoring some points and taking out weak players, you need to change your strategy completely. Now, you need to select imposters randomly and then hunt them down

Choose a random imposter, and follow him around for some time. But remember, do not let him/her realise that you are onto them. Find the perfect moment, and then snap, just like Thor, go for the head

5. The chaos maker

The chaos maker is one of the most sinister and smart ways to score multiple kills. It requires a strategy on a big scale. Things move pretty fast during this strategy. It is one of the riskiest strategies out there

The chaos maker is the imposter who uses chaos as a ladder to reach the top of the scoreboard. The first thing you need to do as a chaos maker is, find the most populated area in space. Once you find it, analyze it carefully. Find the perfect moment for entering the herd. Go for the big kill, as it will cause a lot of panic among other nearby imposters. Then carefully and with stealth, go for others quickly

If you perfectly plan out each of the above-mentioned strategies, you will become unstoppable. But, do remember you are not the only one who has the power of knowledge and skills. Visit Madboyhub.com to play this awesome online multiplayer game and good luck, may the best imposter win

[Verse 1]
Well, she slid down the hall in her socks and yelled, "Come outside"
No, no, no, nothing's wrong
I just happen to have a surprise
So we fell through the door like the autumn leaves
And I wrestled my brother down to his knees
Just to watch as her rocket shot into the October sky

[Chorus]
There's a picture of us
In a layer of dust
On the mantle
Right by my cigarettes that I smoke since you left
'Cause you said you had to fly
In your October sky
La-la-la, la-da-da-da

[Verse 2]
Now I work in the city and I blend into the crowd
And the pеople grieve with mе since the towers came down, down
You could cut the pollution with a butter knife
You could wake up at two and then party all night
But I'm missin' my mama, so I stand on the street and get high

[Chorus]
There's a picture of us
Hidden in a layer of dust
On the mantle
Right by my cigarettes that I smoke since you left
'Cause you said you had to fly
In your October sky
La-la-la, la-da-da-da
La-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da
Oh, woah, oh

[Bridge]
And as I go back home to Memphis
I remember days that I
I was outside shootin' rockets
Almost as high, high
In your October
In your October
In your October
In your October

[Outro]
In your October sky
La-la-la, la-da-da-da
La-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da

[Verse]
Tell me who the bitch nigga hatin' on me?
Jumpin' on my dick but this dick ain't free
To Pimp A Butterfly another classic cd

[Lyrics from Snippets]
I went out and bought everything you like, yeah
Everything you like, yeah, everything you like
And I gave it to someone

[...]
-But I, I used to never feel in love with my love
Nah, nah, baby

[Intro]
Mm-mm-mm
I'm feelin' this

[Verse 1]
Foolish heart
Look what you went and done
You slipped and you fell in love
With a lonely baby
From the stars
You shoulda been more discreet
Instead of leadin' him into my dreams
There you go again

[Pre-Chorus]
Why did you just make up your mind to fly?
We fell, we fell a million miles
A million miles

[Chorus]
My foolish heart
My foolish heart
I just wish you would stop before you start
My foolish heart, yeah
I just wish you would stop before you start

[Verse 2]
Foolish heart, who do you think you are
To go racing away like a fast car?
Didn't you know that he was faking?
You'll fall apart if he doesn't feel the same
You'll be the one in pain
Don't go playing with my emotions

[Pre-Chorus]
Why did you just make up your mind to fly?
We fell, we fell a million miles
Baby, a million miles

[Chorus]
My foolish heart
My foolish heart
I just wish you would stop before you start
My foolish heart, yeah
I just wish you would stop before you start

[Outro]
Mm
Mm-mm-mm
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Heart, if you were wise
You would proceed from behind
When I disguise, just take your time
Careful where you let your soul delight
Love has a price
So, before you take that risk
Think of the consequence
Heart, don't be so foolish

Tell me why the blind man cries
Oh, he sheds a tear because he just can't hear the children singing
How he used to fantasize
Of standing next to some children who are doing singing
Ah!
And the shoulders get colder and colder
And his tears
And his tears fall on deaf ears
Ooh!

Falling apart
At the seams and no-one seems to care
You can't cry forever
Eileen wouldn't want you to, I swear

Now he's just an empty shell
Oh, since Eileen died the othеr side seems so appealing
Compared to this living hеll
Oh, she haunts his sleep, his wounds too deep for any healing
Ah!
With his arteries starting to harden
She is gone
She is gone and it's all wrong
Falling apart
At the seams and no-one seems to care
You can't cry forever
Eileen would want you to, I swear
So there

When they come to take you down
When they bring that wagon 'round
When they come to call on you
And drag your poor body down

Just one thing I ask of you
Just one thing for me
Please forget you knew my name, my darling
Sugaree

[Chorus: Jerry Garcia]
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me

[Verse 2: Jerry Garcia]
You thought you was the cool fool
And never could do no wrong
You had everything sewed up tight
How come you lay awake all night long?

[Pre-Chorus: Jerry Garcia]
Just one thing I ask of you
Just one thing for me
Please forget you knew my name, my darling
Sugaree

[Chorus: Jerry Garcia]
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 3: Jerry Garcia]
You know in spite of all you gained
Still had to stand out in the pouring rain
One last voice is calling you
And I guess it's time you go

[Pre-Chorus: Jerry Garcia]
Just one thing I ask of you
Just one thing for me
Please forget you knew my name, my darling
Sugaree

[Chorus: Jerry Garcia]
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Bridge: Jerry Garcia]
Well shake it up now, Sugaree
I'll meet you at the Jubilee
If that Jubilee don't come
Maybe I'll meet you on the run

[Pre-Chorus: Jerry Garcia]
Just one thing I ask of you
Just one thing for me
Please forget you knew my name, my darling
Sugaree

[Chorus: Jerry Garcia]
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me

Listen, Lady
Let me lie low, lie low with you
To be alive
My oh my

Slowly, we get good and holy
Helping one another
Just a righteous brother

Nighttime, get me back in the nighttime
I don't want to be angel
Just a little bit evil
I feel a devil in me

[Choruses 1]
Holy, holy
Hold on to anyone
Hold on to anyone
But just let me be
Holy, holy
Hold on to anyone
Hold on to anyone
But let go of me-eeh-eeh-eeh

[Intro]
Look, if you had one shot or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted in one moment
Would you capture it, or just let it slip? Yo

[Verse 1]
His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's choking, how? Evеrybody's joking now
The clock's run out, time's up, over—blaow!
Snap back to rеality, ope there goes gravity, ope
There goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad but he won't
Give up that easy, no, he won't have it, he knows
His whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter, he's dope
He knows that but he's broke, he's so stagnant, he knows
When he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's
Back to the lab again yo, this old rap shit, he
Better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him, and

[Chorus]
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go!)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go!)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better…

[Verse 2]
His soul's escaping through this hole that is gaping
This world is mine for the taking, make me king
As we move toward a New World Order
A normal life is boring; but superstardom's
Close to post-mortem, it only grows harder
Homie grows hotter, he blows, it's all over
These hoes is all on him, coast-to-coast shows
He's known as the Globetrotter, lonely roads
God only knows, he's grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose, 'cause here goes the cold water
These hoes don't want him no mo', he's cold product
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
He nose-dove and sold nada, and so the soap opera
Is told, it unfolds, I suppose it's old, partner
But the beat goes on: da-da-dom, da-dom, dah-dah, dah-dah

[Chorus]
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go!)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go!)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better…

[Verse 3]
No more games, I'ma change what you call rage
Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged
I was playin' in the beginning, the mood all changed
I've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhymin' and stepped right in the next cypher
Best believe somebody's payin' the Pied Piper
All the pain inside amplified by the
Fact that I can't get by with my nine-to-
Five and I can't provide the right type of life for my family
'Cause man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers
And there's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life
And these times are so hard, and it's gettin' even harder
Tryna feed and water my seed, plus teeter-totter
Caught up between bein' a father and a prima donna
Baby mama drama, screamin' on her, too much for me to wanna
Stay in one spot, another day of monotony's
Gotten me to the point I'm like a snail, I've got
To formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot
Success is my only motherfuckin' option—failure's not
Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got
To go; I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot
So here I go, it's my shot: feet, fail me not
This may be the only opportunity that I got

[Chorus]
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go!)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go!)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better…

[Outro]
You can do anything you set your mind to, man

[Intro]
How high are the stakes?
How much fortune can you make?

[Verse 1]
It's funny
I spent my whole life wanting to be talked about
I did it
Just about everything to see my name in lights

[Pre-Chorus]
Was it all worth it?
And how did I earn it?
Nobody's perfect
I guess I deserve this

[Chorus]
How high are the stakes? How much fortune can you make?
(Nothing lasts forever) Does this get any better?
Should I carry on? Will it matter when I'm gone?
(Doesn't make a difference) Will any of this matter?

[Verse 2]
It's funny
How everybody mеntions my name, but they're nеver very nice
I took it
Just about everything, except my own advice

[Pre-Chorus]
Was it all worth it?
And how did I earn it?
Nobody's perfect
I guess I deserve this

[Chorus]
How high are the stakes? How much fortune can you make?
(Nothing lasts forever) Does this get any better?
Should I carry on? Will it matter when I'm gone?
(Doesn't make a difference) Will any of this matter?

[Instrumental break]

[Bridge]
How high are the stakes? (How high are the stakes?)
How much fortune can you make? (How much fortune can you make?)
Should I carry on? (Should I carry on?)
Will it matter when I'm gone? (When I'm gone)

[Pre-Chorus]
Was it all worth it? (How high are the stakes?)
How did I earn it?
Nobody's perfect
I guess I deserve it

[Chorus]
How high are the stakes? How much fortune can you make?
(Nothing lasts forever) Does this get any better?
Should I carry on? Will it matter when I'm gone?
(Doesn't make a difference) Will any of this matter?
How high are the stakes? How much fortune can you make? (How high? Doesn't make a difference)
(Nothing lasts forever) Does this get any better?
Should I carry on? Will it matter when I'm gone? (Should I? Will it matter when I'm gone?)
(Doesn't make a difference) Will any of this matter?

[Outro]
How high? Does it make a difference?
Should I? Will it matter when I'm gone
(How high are the stakes?)
Have you met Miss Jones?
Someone said as we shook hands
She was just Miss Jones to me

And then I said Miss Jones
You're a girl who understand
I'm a man who must be free

And all at once I lost my breath
And all at once was scared to death
And all at once I own the earth and sky

Now I've met Miss Jones
And well keep on meeting till we die
Miss Jones and I

[Instrumental]

And all at once I lost my breath
And all at once was scared to death
And all at once I own the earth and the sky
Now I've met Miss Jones
And well keep on meeting till we die
Miss Jones and I

Miss Jones and I
Miss Jones and I

[Verse 1]
How can somethin' shake up every dream I hope for?
Wakin' up to everything around me turned cold (Mm-hmm-mm)
Don't wanna go back to second-guessin' my world
But all I've left behind has got me feelin' so torn (Mm-hmm-mm)

[Chorus]
Am I takin' it for granted?
Everything that I've been granted
I keep lyin' awake with these dreams in the dead of the night
'Cause somethin' don't feel right
Will I take it all for granted?
And be leavin' empty-handed?
Oh, I feel shaken, everything's changin' within me

[Verse 2]
It feels so dramatic how erratic I think
Chasin' everything but lеave the ones that chasе me (Ah-ah-ah)
So much movin' forward just to take a step back
When all I ever wanted I already had (Mm-hmm-mm)

[Chorus]
Am I takin' it for granted?
Everything that I've been granted
I keep lyin' awake with these dreams in the dead of the night
'Cause somethin' don't feel right
I won't take it all for granted
And be leavin' empty-handed
Oh, I feel shaken, everything's changin' within me

[Bridge]
Let my heart lead me home
'Cause I can't do this anymore
Tryin' to be somebody else
If I never left, I'd never know
Just how far I didn't have to go
To finally feel like myself

[Chorus]
Am I takin' it for granted?
Everything that I've been granted
I keep lyin' awake with these dreams in the dead of the night
'Cause somethin' don't feel right
I won't take it all for granted
And be leavin' empty-handed
Oh, I feel shaken, everything's changin' within me

[Outro]
Am I takin' it for granted?

[Verse 1: boy pablo]
Hey girl, it's the first time
I've looked at somebody like this
And hey girl, I'm so nervous
You look so fine
You make me shiver like crazy

[Chorus: Chavela & boy pablo]
Say you want me now
I am scared as hell
I don't even know if you are nervous
I can't tell
Say you love me now
Please, I'm scared as hell
I've never been in love before
I don't know what to do

[Verse 2: Chavela, Chavela & boy pablo]
Hey boy, do you like me?
I guess that's stupid as question
I'm asking 'cause I'm nervous
You look so fine
You make me shiver (Oh)

[Chorus: boy pablo & Chavela]
Say you want me now
'Cause I am scared as hell
I don't even know if you are nervous
I can't tell
Say you love me now
Please, I'm scared as hell
I've never been in love before
I don't know what to do

[Bridge: boy pablo & Chavela]
Ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah

[Chorus: boy pablo & Chavela]
Say you want me now
'Cause I am scared as hell
I don't even know if you are nervous
I can't tell
Say you love me now
Please, I'm scared as hell
I've never been in love before
I don't know what to do

[Verse 1]
I'm like the water when your ship rolled in that night
Rough on the surface, but you cut through like a knife
And if it was an open-shut case
I never would've known from that look on your face
Lost in your current like a priceless wine

[Chorus]
The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
That's my man

[Verse 2]
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
Head on the pillow, I could feel you sneakin' in
As if you were a mythical thing
Like you were a trophy or a champion ring
And there was one prize I'd cheat to win

[Chorus]
The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
That's my man

[Bridge]
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
They count me out time and time again
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
But I come back stronger than a '90s trend

[Verse 3]
Wait for the signal, and I'll meet you after dark
Show me the places where the others gave you scars
Now this is an open-shut case
I guess I should've known from the look on your face
Every bait-and-switch was a work of art

[Chorus]
The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man

[Outro]
Hey, that’s my man
That’s my man
Yeah, that’s my man
Every bait-and-switch was a work of art (That’s my man)
That’s my man
Hey, that’s my man (That’s my man)
I’m begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that’s my man
That’s my man
That’s my man
Hey that’s my man
I’m begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that’s my man

Pull up on four-fours, that's how it goes
I need the stars to help a nigga find his way back home

Lick the chest and it's the rest, history do unfold
History lose control (Control), history lose control (Control)
Knock my way like bowling pin, ayy, yeah, yeah, yeah
So pull up on four-fours like that raging bull was askin' you
And if the money stay the same, then I'm gon' change my attitude

See me out, by the way, I'll be out late
Summertime in the back, goin' sideways
Pack it up, stack it up by the driveway
You do you all the time, I don't mind it

[Verse 3: Merlyn Wood & Matt Champion]
What I'm smokin' (Smoke), put account in a coma (Go)
Hot and black like Folgers, she got me off this mornin'
If your shawty your shawty, why she do my chores for me? (Tell me why)
Heels over her head, her sole ends up on the ceiling (Oh my)
Try me, shit fit in my jeans, don't need Balmain
Talkin', all you do is talkin', be honest (Oh my)
Lil' bitch makin' love, then askin' for a hundred
College to Coachella, this work and vacation (You gotta go)

Utilize the bolt keys to move Fireboy and the W,A,D keys to move Water girl. They can each touch their own component, yet can't contact the inverse. Neither can contact the green goo. Utilize their remarkable abilities to get past the level and to the ways out



This game has three every single new sanctuary: Fire, Water and Wind. Select them from the fundamental menu to complete the new Fireboy and Water girl experience





Components Temple is the most up to date game in the Fireboy and Water girl 5 establishment. In contrast to the past games in the arrangement, this game has a blend of 7 unique sanctuaries, each with 5 or 6 new levels. The sanctuaries in the game incorporate the 4 past sanctuaries in addition to 3 new sanctuaries: fire, water and wind. To approach the new sanctuaries, you should initially finish a couple of levels in the backwoods sanctuary



The game methodology proceeds with similar ideas as in the past games in the establishment. Fireboy and Watergirl should cooperate to finish each level. Fireboy should stay away from water pools and Watergirl should keep away from magma pools. Each level is a kind of puzzle where the members need to sort out the correct moves they should do to finish it. As you complete each level, gather however many jewels as you can to improve score. On the off chance that you discover a level to be too hard you can find support in the walkthrough video, later in this page



The Fire Temple levels are remarkable in light of the fact that they contain just magma pools that Fireboy can stroll around in and no water pools. Despite the fact that it appears to be a simple sanctuary for Fireboy it precisely the inverse. Fireboy should do all the difficult work to clear a path for Watergirl to have the option to arrive at its entryway. It is a joint exertion all things considered


The Water Temple is a similar idea as the Fire Temple just with water. All levels of the Water Temple have just water pools where Watergirl can stroll around openly. This doesn't mean a simple sanctuary for Watergirl. Watergirl should run in any event twice as much as Fireboy to track down a protected entry for her red pal

Ev'ryday (aah..) my poor heart say
Ev'ryday (aah..) my poor heart say
I know them knee's are trembling (trembling)
Like everything is wrong (wrong, wrong, wrong..)
In the top they are stumbling (stumbling)
Tryin' to carry on

Then it's

Trouble I said like a rain
Trouble on the road again
(Aah...) Yeh! Ah!


Yeah hey! Thank God, thank God, God, God
Arh! Feelin', feelin'
(Trouble on the road again)
(Aah..) Trouble on the road again
Trouble on on on self like a rain
Trouble on the road again

Ev'ryday my poor heart say
Ev'ryday my poor sit sit sit..
Why boasteth thyself
Oh, mighty man
Playing smart
And not being clever
Working outquity
To achieve vanity (if a-so a-so)
But the goodness of Jah
I-dureth for-i-ver

If you are the big tree
We are the small axe
Sharpened to cut you down
Ready to cut you down
Sharpened to cut you down
Ready to cut you down

These are the words
Of my master
No weak heart shall prosper
And whosoever diggeth a pit
Shall fall in it (if a-so a-so)
And whosoever diggeth a pit
Shall fall in it (if a-so a-so)
Where there is no wood
I said the fire goes on
So we have to cut you down
Your dry wood
Without a doubt
These are the words
Of my master
No weak heart shall prosper
And whosoever diggeth a pit
Shall fall in it (if a-so a-so)


If you are the big tree
We are the small axe
Sharpened to cut you down
Well sharped to cut you down
If you are the big tree
We are the small axe
Sharpened to cut you down
Well sharped to cut you down

Sharped, sharped

[Verse 1]
Shoulda been open
Shoulda done more
Shoulda learned a lesson from the year before
Shoulda been honest
Shoulda just cried
Shoulda told me there was nothing left inside

[Chorus]
Now the road keeps rolling on forever
And the years keep pulling us apart
We lost something, I still wonder what it was
It shouldn't matter
Shouldn't matter, but it does

[Verse 2]
You shoulda just broken
You shoulda come clean
You shoulda been sad instead of being so fucking mean
It shouldn't be easy
But it shouldn't be hard
You shouldn't be a stranger in your own backyard

[Chorus]
Now the road keeps rolling on forever
And the years keep pulling us apart
I know it's over, I'm just saying this because
It shouldn't matter
Shouldn't matter, but it does

[Verse 3]
I shouldn't be angry
I shouldn't hold on
I shouldn't leave you messages in every little song
It could have been always
It could have been me
We could have been busy naming baby number three

[Chorus]
Now the road keeps rolling on forever
And the years keep pulling us apart
If it's on someone then I blame the both of us
It shouldn't matter
Shouldn't matter, but it
Shouldn't matter
Shouldn't matter, but it
Shouldn't matter
Shouldn't matter, but it does

[Verse 1]
Well the lucky in love called themselves winners
And losers are sinners who have gone astray
As if I woke up lonely one morning
Looked around and decided I would stay that way

[Chorus]
You knock me down and you call me crazy
You say I'm never gonna love someone
Give it time now and you might find maybe
I'll prove you wrong when the right one comes
Won't be long til the right one comes

[Verse 2]
And I know people broke down and defeated
Lost what they needed in some miserable war
So forgive me if I might look around for a minute
Before jumping right in it, I just want to be sure

[Chorus]
Some people 'round here been calling me crazy
Some people say I'll never love someone
That's alright, give it time and maybe
I prove you wrong when the right one comes
Won't be long til the right one comes

[Verse 3]
Now I'm lying in my bed, the end of a long day
Headed the wrong way down that highway of dreams
When you're little unsure of what you're headed for
The end of the road ain't as close as it seems

[Chorus]
Some people 'round here been calling me crazy
"Must be something he's been running from"
Stick around now and you might find maybe
Prove you wrong when the right one comes
Won't be long til the right one comes
Til the right one comes
Til the right one comes

[Outro]
Who's that knocking at my door
Is it someone I've been looking for
And who's that throwing arms around me
And telling me she finally found me
Til the right one comes
Til the right one comes
Til the right one comes
Til the right one comes
Til the right one comes

Since you've been like this
Baby, I don't really wanna be in like this
Ever since you've been like this
Baby, I don't really wanna be in like this

[Verse 1]
See you've been changin', baby
In good ways and bad ways
Can't say what I say, it's far too late
And I think you made me, baby
Made me too nervous
Cryin' and disheartened and I gotta tell you why

[Chorus]
Since you've been like this (This, this, this, this)
Baby, I don't really wanna be in like this (This, this, this, this)
Ever since you've been like this (This, this, this, this)
Baby, I don't really wanna be in like this (This, this, this, this)

[Verse 2]
Who is frontin', babe?
We don't have fun these days
It's morе than complicated, I
(Couldn't say you wasn't with it)
Told me to stop my mind
When you gavе up, I tried
I gave you all this time
Gave you my everything
Said I can do this all night, baby
Said I was actin' out of line, maybe
Can't put my trauma to the side
When you told me I was lyin'
Had me feelin' like I died, baby
I seen a grown man cry, baby
Just see you do it, ain't special, no
Wonder when I ain't there
What the fuck you've been sayin'
Talkin' 'bout how I sexed you up

[Bridge]
And I know it might mess you up
Hatin' me ain't gon' get you love
Ain't nobody gon' set you up
I ain't even gon' sweat you, love
And we'll never be friends like this
God couldn't forgive like this
Why I really went in like this
Thank God I ain't been like this (Yeah)

[Chorus]
Since you've been like this (This, this, this, this)
Baby, I don't really wanna be in like this (This, this, this, this)
Ever since you've been like this (This, this, this, this)
Baby, I don't really wanna be in like this (This, this, this, this)
Since you've been like this

[Outro]
I, bless your heart (Like this)
But I, I can't take no more (Like this)
I, bless your heart (Like this)
But I, I can't take no more (Like this)
Since you've been like this
Baby, I don't really wanna be in like this

[Verse 1]
Every breath that I'm takin', every step that I'm makin'
Ain't no way I can run without you
Every ghost in my past life held my hand when I crashed down
Carries me when I wanna break through

[Pre-Chorus]
We all die, but right now I feel like livin'
And we all cry, but right now I'm not gonna give in
When we collide I know I can do anything
'Cause I got ya, and you got me

[Chorus]
(Ooh) Can they hear us?
Blame it on my mind, blame it on delirious
We all die, but right now I feel like livin'
Can they hear us? Can they hear us? (Ooh)

[Verse 2]
Anywhere that I turn to got me goin' in circles
No matter what, I'll make sure we get out

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause we all die, but right now I feel like livin'
And we all cry, but right now I'm not gonna give in
When we collide I know I can do anything
'Cause I got ya, and you got me

[Chorus]
(Ooh) Can they hear us?
Blame it on my mind, blame it on delirious
We all die, but right now I feel like livin'
Can they hear us? Can they hear us?

[Saxophone Solo]

[Chorus]
(Ooh) Can they hear us? (Us)
Blame it on my mind, blame it on delirious
We all die, but right now I feel like livin' (I feel like livin')
Can they hear us? Can they hear us?
Can they hear us?
Blame it on my mind, blame it on delirious (Blame it on delirious)
We all die, but right now I feel like livin' (I feel like livin')
Can they hear us? Can they hear us?

[Chorus]
We stay up when the whole world lets us down, yeah
We go through it, over and under
We stay up when the whole world lets us down, yeah
Then we prove it again, watch us move around
We stay up when the whole world lets us down, yeah
We never lose, never crumble, we move around
We stay up when the whole world lets us down, yeah
Soothe it again with the sound, watch us move around

[Verse 1]
It's hard to love what I don't want
Easy to hate when I don't know
I never lose if I don't wanna win
I'm 

[?] in so long, yeah
I keep the herb and the pen close
Ooh, can't nobody know
It's gettin' harder to breathe but I know

[Chorus]
We stay up when the whole world lets us down, yeah
We go through it, over and under
We stay up when the whole world lets us down, yeah
Then we prove it again (Yeah), watch us move around

[Verse 2]
In a world where they make rules
Everything around me cash rules
Gotta break through, gotta have to
For anything, anything so
We stay up
Tryna get my mind right
Smoke cigars and my mind right
So you can watch, watch us move around
I gotta be a, uh-huh
I gotta be a soldier, soldier
Out on my own, it's on

[Chorus]
We stay up when the whole world lets us down (Oh-oh, woah, woah, oh-oh)
And we move around (Yeah)
We stay up when the whole world lets us down (We stay up when the world lets us down)
We never lose, never crumble, we move around (Move around, yeah)
We stay up when the whole world lets us down
Soothe it again with the sound (Yeah), watch us move around

[Instrumental Break / Guitar Solo]

[Outro]
We stay up when the whole world lets us down
We never lose, never crumble, move around
We stay up when the whole world lets us down
Soothe it again with the sound, watch us move around

[Verse]
Hope that I am worthy of your love
Hope I am deserving of your love
Hope you can brush off the powers that be
Hope I can empower femininity
Hope I can teach you how to be mostly happy
Hope you don't let the world crush you
For it is beautiful out there and there's a lot to see
Hope I can teach you to see the splendour of the moment
Hope you can see the beauty within the grim world's ugly mess

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
Part of me won't go away
Every day, reminded how much I hate it
Weighed it against the consequences
Can't live without it, so it's senseless
Wanna cut it out of my soul
And just live with the gaping hole
Take control of my life and wash out all the burnt taste
I made the problems in the first place
Hang my head low 'cause it's part of me
You hardly see right next to the heart of me
Hurting me, the wounds soon scar
New cuts cover where the old ones arе
And now I'm sick of this
I can't stand the sandpaper thoughts that grate on my sanity
I rathеr not even be
Than the man that's staring in the mirror through me

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
Cut myself free willingly, stop just what's killing me
Cut myself free willingly, stop just what's killing me
Cut myself free willingly, stop just what's killing me
Cut myself free willingly, stop just what's killing me

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I feel it every day
I feel I made my way
I feel it swell up inside
Swell up inside, swallowing me

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
Freedom can be frightening if you've never felt it
Once it's been dealt with
You feel like you've been touched by something angelic
And then melted down into a pool of peace
Cease to be the animal you used to be
Remove the broken parts you know were wrong
And feel the calm when the problem's all gone
And then you start to see
Another piece of yourself that you can't let be
Memories of the last fight to free yourself
Taken to the depths of the bottom of the well
And now you know that you can choose
To lose the part in your heart where your insides bruise
You can live if you're willing to
Put a stop to just what's killing you

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
Cut myself free willingly, stop just what's killing me
Cut myself free willingly, stop just what's killing me
Cut myself free willingly, stop just what's killing me
Cut myself free willingly, stop just what's killing me

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I feel it every day
I feel I made my way
I feel it swell up inside
Swell up inside, swallowing me

[Bridge: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
(Alive in me, inside of me)
(A part of me screams away silently)
(Alive in me, inside of me)
(A part of me screams away silently)
This part of me won't go away (Alive in me, inside of me)
(A part of me screams away silently)
Part of me won't go away (Alive in me, inside of me)
(A part of me screams away silently)

[Interlude: Mike Shinoda]
Everywhere I look around, I see how everything ought to be
Every time I see myself, there's always something wrong with me
Everywhere I look around, I see how everything ought to be
Every time I see myself, there's always something wrong with me

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I feel it every day
I feel I made my way
I feel it swell up inside
Swell up inside, swallowing me
I feel it every day
I feel I made my way
I feel it swell up inside
Swell up inside, swallowing me
I feel it swell up inside
Swell up inside, swallowing me
I feel it swell up inside
Swell up inside, swallowing me

[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
Where should I start? Disjointed heart
I've got no commitment to my own flesh and blood
Left all alone, far from my home
No one to hear me, to heal my ill heart

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I keep it locked up, inside

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
I cannot express to the point I've regressed
If anger's a gift, then I guess I've been blessed

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I keep it locked up, inside
Keep my distance from your lies

[Interlude: Chester Bennington]
It's too late to love me, now
You have never shown me
It's too late to love me, now
You don't even know me

[Bridge: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
Breaking a part of my heart to find release
Taking you out of my blood to bring me peace
Breaking a part of my heart to find release
Taking you out of my blood to bring me peace
Breaking a part of my heart to find release (Break!)
Taking you out of my blood to bring me peace (Me!)
Breaking a part of my heart to find release (Down!)
Taking you out of my blood to bring me peace

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Keep it locked up, inside
Keep my distance from your lies

[Bridge: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
Breaking a part of my heart to find release (Break!)
Taking you out of my blood to bring me peace (Me!)
Breaking a part of my heart to find release (Down!)
Taking you out of my blood to bring me peace
Breaking a part of my heart to find release
Taking you out of my blood to bring me peace
Breaking a part of my heart to find release
Taking you out of my blood to bring me peace
Keep my distance
Keep my distance
Keep my distance
Keep my distance

[Outro: Mike Shinoda]
Spit drips from the jaw of the witless witness
Cryptic colloquialisms shift your mid rift
Dog paddle through a bog of shadows and smog
With my thought catalog, analogue rap battle log
Keep my distance and fear resistance
Hurt by persistence, the twisted web of tangled lies
Strangles my hope to waste and numbs the taste
And I'm forced to face these hate crimes
Against the state of being
Feeling the weightlessness press me to the ceiling
Reeling around rooms, riding a bubble of sound
Tuned to the frequency making your chest shake
With every boom
Involuntary muscle contraction
Ignoring your neck's breaking, musical gas fume euphoria
The sound pounds to make the dead flush
To hand you a head rush with read rhymes and said stuff

[Verse 1]
You need coolin', baby, I'm not foolin'
I'm gonna to send you back to schoolin'
Way down inside, honey, you need it
I'm gonna give you my love
I'm gonna give you my love, oh

[Chorus]
Want a whole lotta love
Want a whole lotta love
Want a whole lotta love
Want a whole lotta love

[Verse 2]
You've been learnin', baby, I've been yearnin'
All them good times, baby, baby, I've been learnin'
Way, way down inside, honey, you need it
I'm gonna give you my love, ah
I'm gonna give you my love, ah, oh

[Chorus]
Want a whole lotta love
Want a whole lotta love
Want a whole lotta love
Want a whole lotta love

[Instrumental Trip Sequence 1:19-2:20]

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
You've been coolin', baby, I've been droolin'
All the good times, baby, I've been misusin'
Way, way down inside, I'm gonna give you my love
I'm gonna give you every inch of my love
Gonna give you my love, hey, alright, yes, sir

[Chorus]
Want a whole lotta love
Want a whole lotta love
Want a whole lotta love
Want a whole lotta love

[Outro]
Way down inside, woman, you need love
Shake for me, girl, I wanna be your back door man
Hey! Oh! Hey! Oh! Hey! Oh!
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Keep it coolin', baby
Keep it coolin', baby
Keep it coolin', baby
Keep it coolin', baby
Ahh, ahh

[Verse 1]
In the evening
When the day is done
I'm looking for a woman
But the girl don't come
So don't let her
Play you for a fool
She don't show no pity, baby
She don't make no rules

[Chorus]
Oh, oh, I need your love
I need your love
Oh, I need your love
I just got to have

[Verse 2]
So don't you let her
Oh, get under your skin
It's only bad luck and trouble
From the day that you begin
I hear you crying in the darkness
Don't ask nobody's help
Ain't no pockets full of mercy, baby
Because you can only blame yourself

[Chorus]
Oh, I need your love
Oh, oh, I need your love, ooh yeah
Oh, I need your love
I got to have

[Verse 3]
Oh, it's simple
All the pain that you go through
You can turn away from fortune, fortune
Because that's all that's left to you
Hey, it's lonely at the bottom
Man, it's dizzy at the top
But if you're standing in the middle
Ain't no way you're gonna stop

[Chorus]
Oh, I need your love
Oh, oh, I need your love
Oh, oh, I need your love
I got to have

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 4]
Ooh, whatever
That your days may bring
No use hiding in a corner
Because that won't change a thing
If you're dancing in the doldrums
One day soon, it's got to stop, it's got to stop
When you're the master of the off-chance
When you don't expect a lot

[Chorus]
Oh, oh, I need your love
I need your love
Ooh, I need your love
I got to have, I got to have
Baby, I got to have your love
I got to have
Babe, I got to have your love
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I got to have your love
Just got to
I just got to

[Verse 1: Kacey Musgraves]
When it rains it pours, but you didn't even notice
It ain't raining anymore, it's hard to breathe when all you know is
The struggle of staying above, the rising water line

[Chorus: All]
The sky is finally open, the rain and wind stopped blowing
But you're stuck out in the same old storm again
Hold tight to your umbrella, darling I'm just trying to tell ya
That there's always been a rainbow hanging over your head

[Verse 2: Kacey Musgraves]
If you could see what I see, you'd be blinded by the colors
Yellow, red and orange and green, and at least a million others
So tie up the boat, take off your coat and take a look around

[Chorus: All]
Cause the sky is finally open, thе rain and wind stopped blowing
But you're stuck out in the samе old storm again
Hold tight to your umbrella, darling I'm just trying to tell ya
That there's always been a rainbow hanging over your head

[Bridge: Kasey Musgraves]
So tie up the boat, take off your coat and take a look around
Everything is alright now

[Chorus: All]
Cause the sky is finally open, the rain and wind stopped blowing
But you're stuck out in the same old storm again
Let go of your umbrella, darling I'm just trying to tell ya
That there's always been a rainbow hanging over your head
Yeah there's always been a rainbow hanging over your head

[Verse 3: Agonizing Times]
Yeah, Kace I got ya
Yeah you always had a rainbow over ya head
Even when you was cryin' under ya bed (uh)
Momma knows you ain't wanna live with her no more
So let's show her how we can slam into doors

[Verse 4: Agonizing Times]
Ha-ha yeah we told father mother had a seizure
But we promised him he wouldn't be her
Slept with us all night
Until we awoke him with a fright
Knife in hand, rope in the other
Dragged that guy into the slaughter
Begged us please, did you do this to mother?
In return we loved one another

[Bridge: Agonizing Times]
So tie up the boat, take off your coat and take a look around
Everything is alright now

[Outro: All]
Mmm
It'll all be alright

[Verse 1]
Baby, when you walk that sweet walk
Oh, you walk it good, yes you walk it good
Baby, when you talk that sweet talk
It sounds so good, oh so good

[Chorus]
With a little bit of concentration
And a little bit of helping hands, yeah
And a little bit of raving madness
You know it makes me feel, baby
Both my feet are back on the ground

[Verse 2]
And when the rhythm takes me
It feels so good, oh so good
Baby, if it keeps a-shaking
It will do you good, oh so much good

[Chorus]
With a little bit of stop-a-shaking, shaking
And a little bit of fly right down
Woo, just a little bit of sweet con-carne
It makes me feel, makes me feel
I got my feet on the ground

[Verse 3]
Ooh, now baby, when you move it makes me
Really feel so good, oh so good
And I'm so glad, so glad, so glad, so glad
And I'm good, oh, so good

[Chorus]
With a little bit of, oh, concentration
And a little bit of helping hands, yeah
And a little bit of, oh way, I like this
It makes me feel, it makes mе feel, baby
I'm back on the ground
Oh yes, it sure doеs
It makes me feel back on the ground
Suarez! Suarez!
Baby, baby, you're back on the ground! Yeah
I'm feeling good child
I'm feeling good child
I'm feeling good child
I'm feeling good child
Down on the ground
Sha la la la (Ooh)
Sha la la la...

[Intro]
Oh, baby

[Verse 1]
Well. there's a light in your eye that keeps shining
Like a star that can't wait for the night
I hate to think I've been blinded, baby
Why can't I see you tonight?
And the warmth of your smile starts a-burning
And the thrill of your touch gives me fright
And I'm shaking so much, really yearning
Why don't you show up, make it all right?
Yeah, it's all right

[Verse 2]
And if you promised you'd love so completely
And you said you would always be true
You swore that you never would leave me, baby
Whatever happened to you?
And you thought it was only in movies
As you wish all your dreams would come true, hey
It ain’t the first time bеlieve me, baby
I'm standing hеre feeling blue
Yeah, I'm blue

[Verse 3]
Now I will stand in the rain on the corner
I'll watch the people go shuffling downtown
Another ten minutes no longer
And then I'm turning around, around
The clock on the wall's moving slower
My heart, it sinks to the ground
And the storm that I thought would blow over
Clouds the light of the love that I found, found
Light of the love that I found
Light of the love that I found
Oh, that I found

[Bridge]
Hey, babe!
Ooh! Hands on the clock
Just don’t seem to stop when I’m thinking it over
Ooh! Tired of the light
I just don’t seem to find
Gotta get away, get away
Oh, ooh-ooh! I see it in my dreams
But I just don’t seem to be
I've got to get all, gotta get it all
Gotta get it all, I’ve got to get it all

[Verse 4]
Ooh, now my body is starting to quiver
And the palms of my hands getting wet, oh
I've got no reason to doubt you, baby
It's all a terrible mess
And I'll run in the rain till I'm breathless
When I'm breathless, I'll run till I drop, hey
The thoughts of a fool's kind of careless
I'm just a fool waiting on the wrong block, oh yeah
Oh, oh-oh

[Outro]
Light of the love that I found
Light of the love that I found
Light of the love that I
Light of the love that I found
Light of the, hey, eh, light of the, hey, eh
Light of the love that I found
Light of the love that I found

[Verse 1]
Well, I just got into town today
To find my girl who's gone away
She took the Greyhound at the General Store
I searched myself I searched the town
When I finally did sit down
I find myself no wiser than before

[Verse 2]
She said we couldn't do no wrong
No other love could be so strong
She locked up my heart in her bottom drawer
Now she took my heart, she took my keys
From in my old blue dungarees
And I'll never go to Texas anymore

[Chorus]
Now my baby's gone, I don't know what to do
She took my love and walkеd right out the door
And if I ever find that girl, I know onе thing for sure
I'm gonna give her something like she never had before

[Verse 3]
I took her love at seventeen
A little late these days, it seems
But they said Heaven is well worth waiting for
I took her word, I took it all
Beneath the sign that said "U-Haul"
She left angels hanging 'round for more, ah, oh

[Chorus]
Now my baby's gone, I don't know what to do
She took my love and walked right out the door
And if I ever find that girl, I know one thing for sure
I'm gonna give her something like she never had before

[Verse 4]
I thought I had it all sewn up
Our love, a plot, a pick-up truck
But folks said she was after something more
I never did quite understand
All that talk about rocking bands
But they just rolled my doll right out the door
Oh yeah, they just rolled my doll right out the door
Why, well, they just rolled my doll right out the door!

[Verse 1]
Sisters of the way-side bide their time in quiet peace
Await their place within the ring of calm
Still stand to turn in seconds of release
Await the call they know may never come
In times of brightness, no intruder dared upon
To jeopardize the course, upset the run
And all was joy and hands were raised toward the sun
As love in the halls of plenty overrun

[Refrain]
Ah, ah, ah, ah

[Verse 2]
Still in their bliss unchallenged mighty fеast
Unending dances shadowed on thе day, oh
Within the wall, their daunting formless keep
Preserved their joy that kept their doubts at bay
Faceless legions stood in readiness to weep
Just turn a coin, bring order to the fray
And everything is soon no sooner thought than deed
But no one seemed to question in anyway

[Refrain]
Ah, ah, ah, ah

[Verse 3]
How keen the storied hunter's eye prevails upon the land
To seek the unsuspecting and the weak
And powerless the fabled sat, too smug to lift a hand
Toward the foe that threatened from the deep
Who cares to dry the cheeks of those who saddened stand
Adrift upon a sea of futile speech?
And to fall to fate and make the 'status plan'
But no one there had heaven within their reach

[Refrain]
I'm singing
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh

[Beat Shift]

[Verse 4]
Where was your word, where did you go?
Where was your helping, where was your bow, bow?

[Verse 5]
Dull is the armour, cold is the day
Hard was the journey, dark was the way, way

[Verse 6]
I heard the word, I couldn't stay, oh
I couldn't stand it another day, another day
Another day, another day

[Beat Shift]

[Verse 7]
Touched by the timely coming
Roused from the keeper's sleep
Release the grip
Throw down the key

[Verse 8]
Held now within the knowing
Rest now within the peace
Take of the fruit
But guard the seed
Take of the fruit
But guard the seed

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Should I fall out of love, my fire in the light
To chase a feather in the wind
Within the glow that weaves a cloak of delight
There moves a thread that has no end

[Verse 2]
For many hours and days that pass ever soon
The tides have caused the flame to dim
At last the arm is straight, the hand to the loom
Is this to end or just begin?

[Chorus]
All of my love, all of my love
Oh, all of my love to you, now
All of my love, all of my love
Oh, all of my love to you, now

[Verse 3]
The cup is raised, the toast is made yet again
One voice is clear above the din
Proud Arianne one word, my will to sustain
For me, the cloth once more to spin

[Chorus]
Oh, all of my love, all of my love
Oh, all of my love for you now
All of my love, all of my love, yes
All of my love to you, child

[Instrumental]

[Verse 4]
Yours is the cloth, mine is the hand that sews time
His is the force that lies within
Ours is the fire, all the warmth we can find
He is a feather in the wind

[Outro]
Oh, all of my love, all of my love
Oh, all of my love to you, now
All of my love, oh yes
All of my love to you
All of my love, all of my love
All of my love!
Sometimes, sometimes
Hey hey hey hey, ooooh yeah
It's all all all
All of my love, all of my love
All of my love to you, now
All of my love, all of my love
All of my love to you, now
I get a little bit lonely
Just a little, just a little
Just a little bit lonely
Just a little bit lonely

[Verse 1]
Oh she's my baby
Let me tell you why
Hey, she drives me crazy
She's the apple of my eye

[Verse 2]
'Cause she is my girl
And she can never do wrong
If I dream too much at night
Somebody please bring me down

[Verse 3]
Hey, I love that little lady
I got to be her fool
Ain't no other like my baby
I can break the golden rule

[Verse 4]
'Cause I get down on my knees
Oh, I pray that love won't die
And if I always try to please
I don't know the reason why, yeah

[Bridge]
If she would come back, only stay with me
Every little bit, every little bit
Every little bit of my love, I give to you girl
Every little bit, every little bit
Every little bit, every, every little bit of my love

[Solo]
Hit me!

[Verse 5]
I don't have to go by plane
I ain't gotta go by car
I don't care just where my darling is
People, I just don't care how far

[Verse 6]
I'm gonna crawl
I'm gonna crawl, now
I don't care if I got to go back home
I don't care what I got to stand again, babe

[Verse 7]
I'm gonna crawl
I'm gonna crawl
Ah, woohoo
I don't wanna go, baby

[Verse 8]
Hey, she give me good loving
She give me good loving
She give me good loving
She give me good loving
My baby give me good loving

[Outro]
Woo, yes, I love her
I guess I love her
Yes, I love her
I wanna crawl

[Verse 1]
I'm gettin' older, I think I'm agin' well
I wish someone had told me I'd be doin' this by myself
There's reasons that I'm thankful, there's a lot I'm grateful for
But it's different when a stranger's always waitin' at your door
Which is ironic 'cause the strangers seem to want me more
Than anyone before (Anyone before)
Too bad they're usually deranged

[Verse 2]
Last week, I realized I crave pity
When I retell a story, I make everything sound worse
Can't shake the feeling that I'm just bad at healing
And maybe that's the reason every sentence sounds rehearsed
Which is ironic because when I wasn't honest
I was still bein' ignored (Lyin' for attention just to get neglection)
Now we're estranged

[Chorus]
Things I once enjoyed
Just keep me employed now
Things I'm longing for
Someday, I'll be bored of
It's so weird
That we care so much until we don't

[Verse 3]
I'm gettin' older, I've got more on my shoulders
But I'm gettin' better at admitting when I'm wrong
I'm happier than ever, at least, that's my endeavor
To keep myself together and prioritize my pleasure
'Cause, to be honest, I just wish that what I promise
Would depend on what I'm given, mmm (Not on his permission)
(Wasn't my decision) To be abused, mmm

[Chorus]
Things I once enjoyed
Just keep me employed now, mmm
Things I'm longing for, mmm
Someday, I'll be bored of
It's so weird
That we care so much until we don't

[Outro]
But next week, I hope I'm somewhere laughin'
For anybody asking, I promise I'll be fine
I've had some trauma, did things I didn't wanna
Was too afraid to tell ya, but now, I think it's time

[Intro]
Okay
Mm-mm, I

[Verse 1]
I didn't change my number
I only changed who I reply to
Laura said I should be nicer
But not to you
I love a "You mad at me?" text
Shoulda guessed
That you would think I was upset (Haha)
You're obsessed

[Chorus]
Don't take it out on me
I'm out of sympathy for you
Maybe you should leave
Before I get too mean

[Verse 2]
I didn't change my number
I only changed who I believe in
You were easy on the eyes, eyes, eyes (Eyes, eyеs)
But looks can be deceivin'
I gotta work, I go to work
You don't dеserve to feel so hurt
You got a lot of fuckin' nerve
I don't deserve, so

[Chorus]
Don't take it out on me
I'm out of sympathy for you
Maybe you should leave
Before I get too mean
And take it out on you
And your best friend, too
I should have left when Drew
Said you were bad news

[Outro: Billie Eilish & FINNEAS]
Mm-mm-mm
Mm-mm-mm
Mm-mm-mm
Mm-mm-mm
Mm-mm-mm
Mm-mm-mm

[Verse 1]
I don't want it
And I don't want to want you
But in my dreams, I seem to be more honest
And I must admit you've been in quite a few

[Verse 2]
Halley's Comet
Comes around more than I do
But you're all it takes for me to break a promise
Silly me to fall in love with you

[Verse 3]
I haven't slept since Sunday
Midnight for me is 3AM for you
But my sleepless nights are better
With you than nights could ever be alone, ooh-ooh
I was good at feeling nothin', now I'm hopeless
What a drag to love you like I do
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

[Verse 4]
I've been loved before, but right now, in this moment
I feel more and more like I was madе for you
For you

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
I'm sitting in my brother's room
Haven't slept in a week or two, or two
I think I might havе fallen in love
What am I to do?

[Verse 1]
I don't really even know how it happened
I started talkin', they started laughin'
I don't really even know how it happened
I started watchin' them photographin'
I don't really (I don't really), how it happened
Instead of stoppin', they still were flashin' (I don't really)
I started walkin' (I don't really), gave no reaction
No reaction

[Chorus]
I'm overheated, can't be defeated
Can't be deleted, can't un-believе it
I'm overheated, can't bе defeated
Can't be deleted, can't be repeated
I'm overheated
I'm overheated

[Verse 2]
I don't really wanna know why it went there (Why it went there)
I kinda don't care (Kinda don't care)
You wanna kill me? (You wanna kill me?)
You wanna hurt me? (Mmm)
Stop bein' flirty
It's kinda workin'
Did you really think "This is the right thing to do"?
(Is it news? News to who?)
That I really look just like the rest of you

[Chorus]
I'm overheated, can't be defeated
Can't be deleted, can't un-believe it
I'm overheated, can't be defeated
Can't be deleted, can't be repeated
I'm overheated

[Bridge]
And everybody said it was a letdown
I was only built like everybody else now
But I didn't get a surgery to help out
'Cause I'm not about to redesign myself now, am I?
(Am I?) Am I?
All these other inanimate bitches, it's none of my business
But don't you get sick of posin' for pictures
With that plastic body?

[Chorus]
Man, I'm overheated, can't be defeated
Can't be deleted, can't un-believe it
I'm overheated, can't be defeated
Can't be deleted, can't be repeated
I'm overheated

[Intro]
Noontime, UFO sightings in California have nearly doubled since the pandemic began. And we are getting new video from the navy showing pyramid-shaped objects flying in the sky

[Verse 1 - Say So]
It's been a long time since you fell in love
You ain't coming out your shell, you ain't really been yourself
Tell me, what must I do? (Do tell, my love)
'Cause luckily I'm good at reading
I wouldn't bug him, but he won't stop cheesin'
And we can dance all day around it
If you frontin', I'll be bouncing
If you want it, scream it, shout it, babe
Before I leave you dry

[Interlude]
Night vision video reportеdly shows th-th-three pyramid-shaped UFOS flying over a-a-at Russell ovеr the state of California in May of 2021

[Verse 2 - Streets]
Damn papa, you a rare breed, no comparing
And it's ... scary
Tryna keep him 'cause I found him
Let a ... know I ain't ... sharing
I could take you to the parents, then to Paris
Plan a ... wedding
You the type I wanna marry (Yeah) and keep you merry
I'll put the ring on when you ready
We play our fantasies out in real life ways and
No Final Fantasy, can we end these games though?
You give me energy, make me feel lightweight (Woo)
Like the birds of a feather, baby (Woo)
We real life made for each other (Woo)
And it's hard to keep my cool
When other women tryna get with my dude and
When other chickens tryna get in my coop
'Cause you're a one in a million
There ain't no man like you

[Chorus - Streets]
(Like you) I can't sleep no more
(Like you) In my head, we belong
(Like you) And I can't be without you
(Like you) Why can't I find no one like you?
(Like you) I can't sleep no more
(Like you) In my head, we belong
(Like you) And I can't be without you
Why can't I find no one like you?

[Verse 3 - Kiss Me More]
I, I feel like cuffin' somethin'
But we could be corny, okay
Sugar, I ain't no dummy, dummy
I like to say, "What if?", but if
We could kiss and just cut the rubbish
Then I might be onto somethin'
I ain't givin' you one in public
I'm givin' you hundreds, come get it
Somethin' we just gotta get into
Sign first, middle, last on the wisdom tooth
And they wishin' that the ... was a kissin' booth
Taste breakfast, lunch, and gin and juice
And that dinner just like dessert too
And when we French, refresh, gimme two
When I bite that lip, come get me too
He want lipstick, lip gloss, hickeys too, huh

[Chorus - Kiss Me More]
Can you kiss me more?
We're so young, boy, we ain't got nothin' to lose, uh-oh
It's just principle
Baby, hold me 'cause I like the way we move, uh-oh
(Oh, darlin')

[Post-Chorus - Kiss Me More]
Boy, you write your name, I can do the same
Ooh, I love the taste, oh-la-la-la-la-la
All on my tongue, I want it
Boy, you write your name, I can do the same
Ooh, I love the taste, oh-la-la-la-la-la
All on my tongue, I want it

[Outro - Kiss Me More]
We hug and, yes, we make love
And always just say goodnight
And we cuddle, sure I do love it
But I need your lips on mine

[Verse 1]
Help me understand it
Woke up empty-handed
Never heard you say goodbye
Do you remember summer said she'd go forever
Then you turn as cold as the weather
And left me here to cry and cry
Tell me

[Chorus]
Why you no love me?
Why you no love me?
Why you no even care?
Why you no love me?
Why you no love me?
Why you no will be there?

[Verse 2]
Shattered, come to find that none of it mattered
Empty like the promise you made me
Flat out on the floor, oh no
Hurt me once, I let it be
Hurt me twice, you're dead to me
Three times makes you family
Why can't you see I'm yours?
Tell me

[Chorus]
Why you no love me?
Why you no love me? (Why you no love me?)
Why you no even care?
(Don't you know I want you? Ooh)
Why you no love me? (Why you no love me?)
Why you no love me? (Why you no love me?)
Why you no will be there?

[Instrumental Solo]

[Outro]
Why you no love me?
Why you no love me?
Why you no even care?
(Don't you know I want you? Ooh)
Why you no love me? (Why you no love me, baby?)
Why you no love me? (Why you no love me, girl?)
Why you no will be there? (Why you no will be there?)
Why you no will be?
Why you no will be there?
Hoax
You’ve gotten me
Now I can rest and let the hatchet stay buried
House
You knew me
So what had you guessing that I’d ever be Angry

I don’t seem to really care
Anymore
So here’s a lock to keep the creaks from the door
I don’t seem to really care
About the guilt pent
Minor details I was missin’
The way the autumn breeze had kept me waking up sniffling
Hocus pocus if I care

Hoax
Your magic leaks
Reading the news that kept you
Out of my story
Poems
Of wild geese
Hundreds of milеs you fled to let love
Takе body
I don’t seem to really care
Anymore
Call me the reason there’s a lock on your door
I don’t seem to really care
About the guilt lent
Minor details I had right when
Fixing every fault that I had never wrong for faulting
Hocus Pocus if I care
Our place among the wild
How sad how lovely
Looking back on what brought us here
Set us free

Hocus Pocus

[Intro: SZA, & Sade]
I'm tryna get high
I can't give you more than that, surely you want me back
Is it a-

[Verse]
Ride out deep in my mind
Find out who's the man behind the curtain
Real drugs, not into that
Had to rock him up, feeling's check
On the ground, on the ground
Never know if I'm on the ground
You finna get high?
Finna ride out deep in my mind
Find out who's the man behind my curtain
You might, you act nicely might undress my mind for you
I’ma give it to you baby (High, high, high)

[Intro]
Oooeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeehh!
Viva Africa (Otra, otra)
Viva Africa (Otra, otra)
Viva Africa (Otra, otra)

[Verse 1: Shakira]

Pick yourself up and dust yourself off, get back in the saddle
You're on the front line, everyone's watching
You know it's serious, we're getting closer, this isn't over

The pressure's on, you feel it

[Verse 1]
It's written everywhere
I've even read it in my script
But when I thought it wasn't fair
I felt it on my lips, let go
I don't wanna be the one
I think you already know, oh
The feeling of going down way too deep
And holding on
So you won't lose your feet
Sometimes you just gotta trust
You gotta take that leap
And let go, you gotta let go

[Chorus]
I've got a feeling
By your look you're through
Oh no, what you're revealing
I sit and pray
And I will pull through, oh no, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
When you let go
Of all you've known
The butterflies fly
And you will see the rainbow
And all the love, everything will bе shown
So let go, let go

[Verse 3]
The touch of grass, thе air
The sun it will rise
You will see so clear
It will bring tears to your eyes
Maybe everything will be alright
So let go, you gotta let go

[Chorus]
I've got a feeling
Right now you feel it too
Oh, oh
This little song might be the one
That will tell us what to do
Oh, oh, ooh, ooh

[Outro]
These tears are overflowing
And never knowing why
All these years we've...
We've been hurting
We have to look inside
And try to let go
You gotta let go
To love, you gotta let go
If you really wanna love
You gotta let go

[Intro]
I wanna kiss you all over
Gimme that kiss, ah-uh-ah-uh
Gimme that kiss, ah-uh-ah-uh
Gimme that kiss, ah-uh-ah-uh
Gimme that kiss, ah-uh-ah-uh

[Chorus]
Bet you if I kiss you all over
You won't wanna get rid of none of this that you're feeling
Can't stop when you're kissing me
Bet you if I kiss you all over
You can tell that she'll be jealous
We can't help it
Nothing's wrong with kissing me

[Verse 1]
Wish you knew that all I did every day
Just to keep my hands off you
(If you, if you)
Felt that y'all need to take a break
She just wanna argue
(If you, if you)
Felt this way, can't let nobody know this, okay?
(If you, if you)
Taste it, I'll make sure you eat every crumb off the plate

[Pre-Chorus]
I need to think about it
'Cause all your eyes are saying, that you wanna undress me
She must not like to drink
'Cause if I was her I would sip on you all day
I will see about it
But, babe, the problem's bigger than her, you and me
The boy I'm currently seeing is 6 foot 3 and too possessive

[Chorus]
Bet you if I kiss you all over
You won't wanna get rid of none of this that you're feeling
Can't stop when you're kissing me
Bet you if I kiss you all over
You can tell that she'll be jealous
We can't help it
Nothing's wrong with kissing me

[Verse 2]
(If you, if you)
Drop the ball
That might change everything I thought about you
(If you, if you)
We should call this an affair
My kiss might hurt you
(If you, if you)
(If you, if you)

[Pre-Chorus]
I need to think about it
'Cause all your eyes are saying, that you wanna undress me
I will see about it
But, babe, the problem's bigger than her, you and me

[Chorus]
Bet you if I kiss you all over
You won't wanna get rid of none of this that you're feeling
Can't stop when you're kissing me
Bet you if I kiss you all over
You can tell that she'll be jealous
We can't help it
Nothing's wrong with kissing me

[Intro: Mike Shinoda]
Forfeit the game before somebody else
Takes you out of the frame and puts your name to shame
Cover up your face, you can't run the race
The pace is to fast, you just won't last

[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
You love the way I look at you
While taking pleasure in the awful things you put me through
You take away, if I give in
My life, my pride is broken

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
Forfeit the game before somebody else
Takes you out of the frame and puts your namе to shame
Cover up your face, you can't run thе race
The pace is to fast, you just won't last

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
I won't believe a word you say
I'm cut to pieces by the sound of every breath you take
I'm swimming through a sea of hurt
My life, my pride is stronger

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
Forfeit the game before somebody else
Takes you out of the frame and puts your name to shame
Cover up your face, you can't run the race
The pace is to fast, you just won't last

Forfeit the game before somebody else
Takes you out of the frame and puts your name to shame
Cover up your face, you can't run the race
The pace is to fast, you just won't last

[Bridge: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
It's time to sink or swim
It's time to sink or swim
It's time to sink or swim
To see who gets scared when the lights go dim

(No!) It's time to sink or swim
(No!) To see who gets scared when the lights go dim
(No!) It's time to sink or swim
(No!) To see who gets scared when the lights go dim

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
Forfeit the game before somebody else
Takes you out of the frame and puts your name to shame
Cover up your face, you can't run the race
The pace is to fast, you just won't last
Forfeit the game before somebody else
Takes you out of the frame and puts your name to shame
Cover up your face, you can't run the race
The pace is to fast, you just won't last

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
She can't hide, no matter how hard she tries
Her secret disguise behind the lies
And at night, she cries away her pride
With eyes shut tight, staring at her inside
All her friends know why she can't sleep at night
All her family asking if she's alright
All she wants to do is get rid of this hell
Well, all she's gotta do is stop kidding herself

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
She can only fool herself for so long
She can only fool herself for so long
She can only fool herself for so long
(I'm too weak to face me!) She can only fool herself

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I never know just why you run
So far away, far away from me
I never know just why you run
So far away, far away from me

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
When it comes to how to live his life, he can't be told
Says he's got it all under control
Thinks he knows it's not a problem he's stuck with
But in reality, it'd be a problem to just quit
An addict and he can't hold the reigns
The pain is worse 'cause his friends have it the same
Tries to slow down the problem he's got
But can't get off the carousel until he makes it stop

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
He can only fool himself for so long
He can only fool himself for so long
He can only fool himself for so long
(I'm too weak to face me!) He can only fool himself

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I never know just why you run
So far away, far away from me
I never know just why you run
So far away, far away from me

[Bridge: Mike Shinoda]
Fly with me, under the wings I gave you
Try to be closer to me and I'll save you
Fly with me, under the wings I gave you
Try to be closer to me and I'll save you

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I never know just why you run
So far away, far away from me
I never know just why you run
So far away, far away from me
I never know just why you run
So far away, far away from me
I never know just why you run
So far away, far away from me

[Intro]
Hold it
For it is never enough
Hold me
When times get rough

[Verse 1]
Oh Yeah
Wake up in the darkness of a midnight sun
And there you are in with me, holstered is a gun
I’ve told you repeatedly how I don’t like that hon
But you just laugh and me gag on something like
Fun

[Pre-Chorus]
But it’s not fun
No it’s not at all
No it’s not fun
At all

[Chorus]
One can only hope someday that someone will come
Rescue thee off of a tree like a cat hiding from sun
But we already know that hope
Is a dangerous thing
But I love having it
Pandora’s a bitch
For letting out all the sickness and bad shit in thе world
But she’s my girl for
Giving me hope

[Verse 2]
I know that еverything fucking sucks
Me and my mommy making windows break
Praying that I can finally esc
