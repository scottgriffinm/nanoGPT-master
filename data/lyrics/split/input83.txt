 numb
You never know until you let go
Let's go numb

[Verse 2]
Keep on doing the same old thing
And you expecting change
Well, is that really insanity
Or just a loser's game?
I only trust in the things I feel
Some may say that's strange
You better recognize what is real

[Outro]
'Cause forever is a long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long
Long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long
Long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long
Long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long
Long, long, long, long
I can feel you now
Numb, numb, numb
I can feel you now
I can feel you now
I can feel you now
But you can't feel it 'til you're
Numb
Shake it off, let it go, I don't care anymore

[Verse 1]
They say life is a battlefield
I say bring it on
If you wanna know how I feel
Live it 'til it's gone
I'm just saying that what don't kill, only makes you strong
If you don't recognize what is real
Then forever is a long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long time

[Pre-Chorus]
Some things never change, here we go again
Feel like I'm losing my mind
Shake it off, let it go, I don't care anymore

[Chorus]
Just go numb
Numb, numb, numb
Just go numb
Numb, numb, numb

[Bridge]
Keep on doing the same old thing
And you expecting change
Well, is that really insanity
Or just a loser's game?

[Chorus]
Just go numb
You never know until you let go
Let's go numb

[Verse 2]
Keep on doing the same old thing
And you expecting change
Well, is that really insanity
Or just a loser's game?
I only trust in the things I feel
Some may say that's strange
You better recognize what is real

[Outro]
'Cause forever is a long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long
Long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long
Long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long
Long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long
Long, long, long, long
I can feel you now
Numb, numb, numb
I can feel you now
I can feel you now
I can feel you now
But you can't feel it 'til you're
Numb
Shake it off, let it go, I don't care anymore

[Verse 1]
Baby, I know pain is as natural as the rain
I just thought it didn't rain in California
Baby, I know love isn't what I thought it was
'Cause I've never known a love like this before ya
Baby, I know dreams tend to crumble at extremes
I just thought our dream would last a little bit longer
There's a time when every man draws a line down in the sand
We're surviving, we're still living, are we stronger?
Ooh, ooh

[Chorus]
You've been cheating on, cheating on me
I've been cheating on, cheating on you
You've been cheating on me
But I've been cheating through this life
And all its suffering
Oh Christ
Am I good for nothing?

[Verse 2]
Baby, I know hate is always waiting at the gate
I just thought we locked the gate when we left in the morning
And I was told that war is how we landed on these shores
I just thought the drums of war beat louder warnings
Ooh, ooh

[Chorus]
You've been cheating on, cheating on me
I've been cheating on, cheating on you
You've been cheating on me
But I've been cheating through this life
And all its suffering
Oh Christ
Am I good for nothing?

[Verse 3]
Baby, I know death probably hasn't happened yet
'Cause I don't remember living life before this
And darling, our disease is the same one as the trees
Unaware that they've been living in a forest
Ooh, ooh

[Chorus]
You've been cheating on, cheating on me
I've been cheating on, cheating on you
You've been cheating on me
But I've been cheating through this life
And all its suffering
Oh Christ
Am I good for nothing?
This life
And all its suffering
Oh Christ
Am I good for nothing?
I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
Not what you'd think
And if I'm bein' honest
It might've been a nightmare
To anyone who might care
Thought I could fly
So I stepped off the Golden, mm
Nobody cried
Nobody even noticed
I saw them standing right there
Kinda thought they might care

I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
But when I wake up, I see
You with me

And you say, "As long as I'm here, no one can hurt you
Don't wanna lie here, but you can learn to
If I could change the way that you see yourself
You wouldn't wonder why you hear
'They don't deserve you'"
I tried to scream
But my head was underwater
They called me weak
Like I'm not just somebody's daughter
Coulda been a nightmare
But it felt like they were right there
And it feels like yesterday was a year ago
But I don't wanna let anybody know
'Cause everybody wants something from me now
And I don't wanna let 'em down

I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
But when I wake up, I see
You with me

And you say, "As long as I'm here, no one can hurt you
Don't wanna lie here, but you can learn to
If I could change the way that you see yourself
You wouldn't wonder why you hear
'They don't deserve you'"

If I knew it all then, would I do it again?
Would I do it again?
If they knew what they said would go straight to my head
What would they say instead?
If I knew it all then, would I do it again?
Would I do it again?
If they knew what they said would go straight to my head
What would they say instead?

[Intro]
I wonder

[Verse 1] 

[Nick Hakim]
I wonder
What it would be to you
If I came around
I want to
Go home one day
To see my beloved ones that I haven’t seen in a decade

[Verse 2]
I
I’ve got somewhere to go
It’s down south but  (?)
Type of land that I don’t know
It’s a land that my mother and father call home
Id die to go down there, if only I had the funds

[Interlude]
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Can you feel it?
Yeah

[Intro]
No-no, no-no, no-no-no

[Verse 1]
I let you down, I led you on
I never thought I'd be here without you
Don't let me drown inside your arms
Bad thoughts inside my mind
When the darkness comes, you're my light, baby
My light, baby, my light when it's dark, yeah
I'm too high, baby, too high, baby
'Cause I know right now, that I lost it (Hey)

[Chorus]
It's way too late to save our souls, baby (Oh, oh, yeah)
It's way too late, we're on our own (Baby, on my own)
I made mistakes, I did you wrong, baby (Oh, oh, yeah)
It's way too late to save my—

[Verse 2]
I can't trust (I can't trust) where I live (Where I live) anymore (Anymore, anymore, anymore)
Sources say (Sources say) that we're done (That we're done), how would they know? (They know, 'cause they know, 'cause they know)
We're in Hell, it's disguised as a paradise with flashing lights
I just wanna believe there's so much more (Hey, hey, hey)

[Chorus]
It's way too late to save our souls, baby (Oh, oh, yeah)
It's way too late, we're on our own (Baby, on my own)
I made mistakes, I did you wrong, baby (Oh, oh, yeah)
It's way too late to save my—

[Bridge]
And, ooh, I tell myself I should get over you
I said, ooh, I know I'd rather be all over you trying, trying, but I, I just want your body
Riding slow on top of me, girl, on top of me
I want you, babe, ooh-ooh

[Chorus]
It's way too late (Late) to save our souls, baby (Souls, baby, oh, oh, yeah)
It's way too late, we're on our own (Baby, on my own)
I made mistakes (Mistakes), I did you wrong, baby (Oh, baby, oh, oh, yeah)
It's way too late to save my, my—

[Verse 1]
I found a guy, told me I was a star
He held the door, held my hand in the dark
And he's perfect on paper, but he's lying to my face
Does he think that I'm the kinda girl who needs to be saved?

[Verse 2]
And there's one more boy, he's from my past
We fell in love, but it didn't last
'Cause the second I figure it out, he pushes me away
And I won't fight for love if you won't meet me halfway
And I say that I'm through, but this song's still for you

[Chorus]
All I want is love that lasts
Is all I want too much to ask?
Is it something wrong with me?
All I want is a good guy
Are my expectations far too high?
Try my best, but what can I say?
All I have is myself at the end of the day
But shouldn't that be enough for me?

[Bridge]
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
And I miss the days when I was young and naive
I thought the perfect guy would come and find me
Now happy ever after, it don't come so easily

[Chorus]
All I want is love that lasts
Is all I want too much to ask?
Is it something wrong with me? Oh, ooh
All I want is a good guy
Are my expectations far too high?
Try my best but what can I say?
All I have is myself at the end of the day
And all I want is for that to be okay

[Verse 1]
Jojo was a man who thought he was a loner
But he knew it couldn't last
Jojo left his home in Tucson, Arizona
For some California grass

[Chorus]
Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, Jojo

All these years, I've been wandering around
Wondering how come nobody told me
All that I was looking for was somebody who looked like you!

[Verse 3]
I've got a feeling that keeps me on my toes
Oh yeah, oh yeah (Oh yeah!)
I've got a feeling, I think that everybody knows
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah

Don't let me down, (please) don't let me down
Don't let me down, don't let me down

[Verse 1]
You've got this golden way of making my body sway
Of making my mind fly away, of making it fly
It's the world I love to be in
Come on, let's go high above the ceiling
Oh, we could be feeling, oh, what we could be feeling

[Chorus]
I'm one of those witches, babe
I'm one of those witches, babe
Just don't try to save me, 'cause
I don't wanna be saved
I'm one of those witches, babe
I'm one of those witches, babe
Just don't try to save me, 'cause
I don't wanna be saved

[Verse 2]
Me, I've got my own little magic
And I'm not trying to wreak havoc
It's just that sometimes I see something and I just need to have it
Let's share a few dirty habits (Dirty habits)
Let's share a few dirty habits (Ooh)
Last night when you pulled through
I put a spell on the moon
It was three times the size in your moon-lit eyes
And I sang you an old tune
Mom sang me when I was half the size
And I looked at you and your moon-lit eyes
And your moon-lit eyes
And your moon-lit eyes
And your moon-lit eyes
And your moon-lit eyes
And your moon-lit eyes

[Chorus]
I'm one of those witches, babe
I'm one of those witches, babe
Just don't try to save me, 'cause
I don't wanna be saved
I'm one of those witches, babe
I'm one of those witches, babe
Just don't try to save me, 'cause
I don't wanna be saved

[Verse 1]
I can name a couple ways, baby, this shit might go
You just might forget that this was what you're gettin' high for
And it might do the things to him, I mean the guy who
He's the one who's sweet enough, who'll shoot to make that high note

[Pre-Chorus]
And it's such a typical thing, runnin' over a billion men, oh, ooh
Runnin' through a difficult place, you don't need no blood on your hands, no

[Chorus]
She's just like candy, she's so sweet
But you know that it ain't real cherry, know that it ain't real cherry
She's just like candy (candy), she's so sweet
But you know that it ain't real, know that it ain't real
She's just like candy, she's so sweet
But you know that it ain't real cherry, know that it ain't real cherry
She's just like candy (candy), she's so sweet
But you know that it ain't real, know that it ain't real

[Verse 2]
I can be your sugar when you're fiendin' for that sweet spot
Put me in your mouth, baby, and eat it 'til your teeth rot
I can be your cherry, apple, pecan, or your key lime
Baby I got everything and so much more than she's got

[Pre-Chorus]
And it's such a typical thing, runnin' over a billion men
Runnin' through a difficult place, you don't need no blood on your hands, no

[Chorus]
She's just like candy, she's so sweet
But you know that it ain't real cherry, know that it ain't real cherry
She's just like candy (candy), she's so sweet
But you know that it ain't real, know that it ain't real
She's just like candy, she's so sweet
But you know that it ain't real cherry, know that it ain't real cherry
She's just like candy (candy), she's so sweet
But you know that it ain't real, know that it ain't real

[Bridge]
Sugar coated, lies unfolded, you still lick the wrapper
It's addictive, you know this, but you still lick the wrapper
Sugar coated, lies unfolded, you still lick the wrapper
It's addictive, you know this, but you still lick the wrapper

[Chorus]
She's just like candy, she's so sweet
But you know that it ain't real cherry, know that it ain't real cherry
She's just like candy (candy), she's so sweet
But you know that it ain't real, know that it ain't real
She's just like candy, she's so sweet
But you know that it ain't real cherry, know that it ain't real cherry
She's just like candy, she's so sweet
But you know that it ain't real, know that it ain't real

[Verse 1]
Well, my daddy left home when I was three
And he didn't leave much to ma and me
Just this old guitar and an empty bottle of booze
Now, I don't blame him cause he run and hid
But the meanest thing that he ever did
Was before he left, he went and named me "Sue."

[Verse 2]
Well, he must've thought that is quite a joke
And it got a lot of laughs from a' lots of folks
It seems I had to fight my whole life through
Some gal would giggle and I'd get red
And some guy'd laugh and I'd bust his head
I tell ya, life ain't easy for a boy named "Sue."

[Verse 3]
Well, I grew up quick and I grew up mean
My fist got hard and my wits got keen
I'd roam from town to town to hide my shame
But I made a vow to the moon and stars
That I'd search the honky-tonks and bars
And kill that man who gave me that awful name

[Verse 4]
Well, it was Gatlinburg in mid-July
And I just hit town and my throat was dry
I thought I'd stop and have myself a brew
At an old saloon on a street of mud
There at a table, dealing stud
Sat the dirty, mangy dog that named me "Sue."

[Verse 5]
Well, I knew that snake was my own sweet dad
From a worn-out picture that my mother'd had
And I knew that scar on his cheek and his evil eye
He was big and bent and gray and old
And I looked at him and my blood ran cold
And I said: "My name is 'Sue!' How do you do!
Now you're going to die!!"

[Verse 6]
Well, I hit him hard right between the eyes
And he went down, but to my surprise
He come up with a knife and cut off a piece of my ear
But I busted a chair right across his teeth
And we crashed through the wall and into the street
Kicking and a' gouging in the mud and the blood and the beer

[Verse 7]
I tell you, I've fought tougher men
But I really can't remember when
He kicked like a mule and he bit like a crocodile
I heard him laugh and then I heard him cuss
He went for his gun and I pulled mine first
He stood there lookin' at me and I saw him smile

[Verse 8]
And he said: "Son, this world is rough
And if a man's gonna make it, he's gotta be tough
And I knew I wouldn't be there to help ya along
So I give ya that name and I said goodbye
I knew you'd have to get tough or die
And it's the name that helped to make you strong

[Verse 9]
He said: "Now you just fought one hell of a fight
And I know you hate me, and you got the right
To kill me now, and I wouldn't blame you if you do
But ya ought to thank me, before I die
For the gravel in ya guts and the spit in ya eye
Because I'm the son-of-a-bitch that named you Sue

[Verse 10]
I got all choked up and I threw down my gun
And I called him my pa, and he called me his son
And I came away with a different point of view
And I think about him, now and then
Every time I try and every time I win
And if I ever have a son, I think I'm gonna name him
Bill or George! Anything but Sue! I still hate that name!

[Verse 1]
Fear of what's in the mirror, yeah
So much to be afraid of
Scared of what we're made of
And what we might be

[Verse 2]
Young life flies out the window, yeah
It's not the time that changed us
It's the dreams that we weren't chasing
Come back to haunt us, eventually

[Bridge]
That's why every morning, after dawn and
Tell your darling something is calling
Drive me crazy, I just can't explain it

[Hook]
Go out of your mind (Out of your mind, out of your mind, out of your mind)
Go out of your mind (Out of your mind, out of your mind)

[Chorus]
No, we can't rewind, life ain't no time machine
But once you free your mind, there's beauty in everything
No, we can't rewind, life ain't no time machine
But once you free your mind, there's beauty in everything

[Bridge]
That's why every morning, after dawn and
Tell your darling something is calling
Drive me crazy, I just can't explain it

[Hook]
Go out of your mind (Out of your mind, out of your mind, out of your mind)
Go out of your mind (Out of your mind)
Out of your mind
Go out of your mind (Out of your mind, out of your mind, out of your mind)
Go out of your mind (Out of your mind)
Out of your mind

[Chorus]
No, we can't rewind, life ain't no time machine
But once you free your mind, there's beauty in everything
No, we can't rewind, life ain't no time machine
But once you free your mind, there's beauty in everything

[Chorus]
Wavy, grab a cup, sip something
Set the mood right
Drunken bet you I could fuck you crazy
With this Rosé, underneath the moonlight

[Verse 1]
Moisturize me
Swim into the ocean, oh
Hypnotize me
Guess somebody made me want some more
I'm so numb but it feels right
If it's poison that you like
Yeah, you want Henny, I got plenty
I got many more, yeah

[?] without denny
Twinkle, twinkle little star
In that fenty glow, yeah

Drunken bet you I could fuck you crazy
With this Rosé, underneath the moonlight

[Verse 2]
Blue Hawaiian, so he Aiyan
Long island, now he smiling
White Russian, now I'm crushing
One Mai Tai, now he my guy
Margarita, make it sweeter
One Mimosa, he coming over
Two Smirnoffs, with his shirt off
Martinis keep it neat, I need the dirt off

[?] He wanna spank me
Mojito, he a freak though

[?], now he smashing
This sugar all over that glass rim
Come shimmy on over, you crashing
No fruit in my drink, I got passion
You do it so good that you practice
Got 

[?] I'm the new captain

[Chorus]
Wavy, grab a cup, sip something
Set the mood right
Drunken bet you I could fuck you crazy
With this Rosé, underneath the moonlight

[Steve Lacy:]
In the forest, I'm not alone
I’m lonely

[Asiatic:]
With this fire I'm burning all
Not only!

[Steve Lacy:]
Kill the light, go thrust on the fall
To go there

[Asiatica:]
Back to basics
Same thing to spill
Still over

[Steve Lacy & Asiatic:]
This is for now
My head go 'round
Somethings out of pocket, not my hand
And I’m going crazy
So you should get out
For the dumb mistakes
Nothings closer to make it to town
And I'm going crazy

[Steve Lacy:]
In the forest, I love the moon
No daylight

[Asiatica:]
Silver bullets consciously too
I'll stand high

[Steve Lacy & Asiatic:]
This is for now
My head go 'round
Somethings out of pocket, not my hand
And I'm going crazy
So you should get out
For the dumb mistakes
Nothings closer to make it to town
And I'm going crazy
Dream sweet dreams for me
Dream sweet dreams for you

Now it's time to say good night
Good night sleep tight
Now the sun turns out his light
Good night sleep tight

Dream sweet dreams for me
Dream sweet dreams for you

Close your eyes and I'll close mine
Good night sleep tight
Now the moon begins to shine
Good night sleep tight

Dream sweet dreams for me
Dream sweet dreams for you

So cry baby cry
Cry cry cry baby
Make your mother sigh
She's old enough to know better

But I must go alone
Till the lord comes and calls, calls me away, oh yes
Well the morning's so bright
And the lamp is alight
And the night, night is as black as the sea, oh yes

There will be peace in the valley for me, some day
There will be peace in the valley for me, oh Lord I pray
There'll be no sadness, no sorrow
No trouble, trouble I see
There will be peace in the valley for me, for me

Well the bear will be gentle
And the wolves will be tame
And the lion shall lay down by the lamb, oh yes
And the beasts from the wild
Shall be lit by a child
And I'll be changed, changed from this creature that I am, oh yes

There will be peace in the valley for me, some day
There will be peace in the valley for me, oh Lord I pray
There'll be no sadness, no sorrow
No trouble, trouble I see

I'm going down this road feeling bad
Bad luck's all I've ever had
Going down this road feeling bad, Lord, Lord
And I ain't gonna be treated this a-way

Got me way down in jail on my knees
This old jailer he sure is hard to please
Feed me on corn, bread and peas, Lord, Lord
And I ain't gonna be treated this a-way

Sweet mama, won't buy me no shoes
Lord, she's left me with these lonesome jailhouse blues
My sweet mama won't buy me no shoes, Lord, Lord
And I ain't gonna be treated this a-way

And these two-dollar shoes hurt my feet
The jailer won't give me enough to eat
These two-dollar shoes they hurt my feet, Lord, Lord
And I ain't gonna be treated this a-way

I'm going where the climate suits my clothes
Lord, I'm going where these chilly winds never blow
I'm going where the climate suits my clothes, Lord, Lord
And I ain't gonna be treated this a-way
Yes, I'm going down the road feeling bad, Lord, Lord
Lord, I'm going down the road feeling bad
Bad luck is all I've ever had
And I ain't gonna be treated this a-way
I was standing by the window
On one cold and cloudy day
When I saw the hearse come rolling
For to carry my mother away

Will the circle be unbroken
Bye and bye Lord, bye and bye
There's a better home awaiting
In the sky Lord, in the sky

I said to the undertaker
Undertaker please drive slow
For this lady you are carrying
Lord I hate to see her go

Will the circle be unbroken
Bye and bye Lord, bye and bye
There's a better home awaiting
In the sky Lord, in the sky

Oh, I followed close behind her
Tried to hold up and be brave
But I could not hide my sorrow
When they laid her in the grave
Will the circle be unbroken
Bye and bye Lord, bye and bye
There's a better home awaiting
In the sky Lord, in the sky

I went back home, the home was lonesome
Since my mother, she was gone
All my brothers and sisters crying
What a home so sad and alone

Will the circle be unbroken
Bye and bye Lord, bye and bye
There's a better home awaiting
In the sky Lord, in the sky

We sang songs of childhood
Hymns of faith that made us strong
Ones that mother maybelle taught us
Hear the angels sing along

Will the circle be unbroken
Bye and bye Lord, bye and bye
There's a better home awaiting
In the sky Lord, in the sky
In a vine covered shack in the mountains
Bravely fighting the battle of time
There's a dear one who's wept through life's sorrows
It's that silver haired daddy of mine

If I could recall all the heartaches
Dear ole daddy I've caused you to bear
If I could erase those lines from your face
And bring back the gold to your hair

If God would but grant me the power
Just to turn back the pages of time
I would give all I own just to put a tone
To that silver haired daddy of mine

If I could recall all the heartaches
Dear ole daddy I've caused you to bear
If I could erase those lines from your face
And bring back the gold to your hair

If God would but grant me the power
Just to turn back the pages of time
I would give all I own just to put a tone
To that silver haired daddy of mine
Some glad morning when this life is over
I'll fly away
To a home on God's celestial shore
I'll fly away

I'll fly away, o Glory
I'll fly away (in the morning)
When I die, Hallelujah, bye and bye
I'll fly away

When the shadows of this life are gone
I'll fly away
Like a bird from prison bars has flown
I'll fly away

I'll fly away, o Glory
I'll fly away (in the morning)
When I die, Hallelujah, bye and bye
I'll fly away

Just a few more weary days and then
I'll fly away
To a land where joy shall never end
I'll fly away
I'll fly away, o Glory
I'll fly away (in the morning)
When I die, Hallelujah, bye and bye
I'll fly away

[Chorus]
Thots be chattering
My thoughts be traveling
Mind unraveling, time I'm traveling
These bands of the day,these stance of the day, these hands are the day (okay)

Mr. bandz still awake, these bands in the safe (okay)
These bands are the day, these stance of the day, these hands are the day (okay)

[Verse 1]
I'mma put these bands in the safe, okay
'Cause we don't leave chance up to fate, okay huh
Blowing weed strains in your face (uh)
Dry herb damn near earthquake (okay, huh)
Raisin bread niggas they be flaking
The hood ain't been the same since Reagan (since Reagan)
You get pulled over by the bacon
When you look like you gotta a whole lot of bacon
Not too much bread I ain't that into baking
We ain't helping we just videotaping
I'm a goat young boy get your paper
Was a vet when you was in a incubator (huh)
Still whip around in decatur
Loyalty's a real nigga indicator
How you imitate a innovator
Bet I make some shake defibrillator, bands

[Chorus]
Thots be chattering

Can I be great, for once can you not be late
If I hear one more complaint, God damn, can you at least not ovulate (aye)
Swear this all you say, do you wanna hold his breath, all I got is blue face
If you two faced you get two L's Cool J
Bitch niggas pussay, but I bought the dusse , guess we even touchee
We are not similar, I don't throw subliminals
Mi-mister-commissioner, taking no prisoners, really
Too many cylinders, kill you vehicular
Stunt in my spare time, call it flextracurricular, bandz

[Verse]
You've cut out your dancin'
And you never see a show
Friends drop by to pick you up
But you hardly ever go
It seems your head is in the clouds above
You've got the ways of a woman in love
I walk by your house at night in the hopes that I might see
The guy who's got you in a spin
I wish that guy was me
I don't know why it's you I'm thinkin' of
You've got the ways of a woman in love

[Chorus]
Many is the night I've laid awake and cried
Now you'll never know how much you hurt my foolish pride
I recall your kisses
The times I held you tight
Now, when I come to see you, you're sittin' in the light
Missin' all the things that we dreamed of
You've got the ways of a woman in love
Many is the night I've laid awake and cried
Now you'll never know how much you hurt my foolish pride
I recall your kisses
The times I held you tight
Now, when I come to see you, you're sittin' in the light
Missin' all the things that we dreamed of
You've got the ways of a woman in love
You've got the ways of a woman in love

[Verse 1]
You go where the wind blows
Destroying everyone in your path
I'm done feeding your ego
Forgetting everything that we had

[Pre-Chorus]
Funny how history ends in an instant
How something so close can end up so distant

[Chorus]
Dancing on the line of the great divide
Wash my hands, turn my back
I don't need the memories we had
I'm leaving you behind
Across the great divide

[Verse 2]
Good luck when you wake up
And realize all that you've lost
Shining lies are what you're made of
I hope it's worth the price that it cost

[Pre-Chorus]
Funny how history ends in an instant
How something so close can end up so distant

[Chorus]
Dancing on the line of the great divide
Wash my hands, turn my back
I don't need the memories we had
I'm leaving you behind
Across the great divide

[Bridge]
I let you go, so let me go
Let us go
I let you, I let you
I let you go, oh

[Chorus]
Dancing on the line of the great divide
Wash my hands, turn my back
I don't need the memories we had
I'm leaving you behind
Across the great divide

[Outro]
Mmm, the great divide
Hey, yeah

[Verse 1]
You go where the wind blows
Destroying everyone in your path
I'm done feeding your ego
Forgetting everything that we had

[Pre-Chorus]
Funny how history ends in an instant
How something so close can end up so distant

[Chorus]
Dancing on the line of the great divide
Wash my hands, turn my back
I don't need the memories we had
I'm leaving you behind
Across the great divide

I'm leaving you behind
Across the great divide

[Bridge]
I let you go, so let me go
Let us go
I let you, I let you
I let you go, oh

[Chorus]
Dancing on the line of the great divide

Hey, yeah

[Chorus: Kanye West]
I know God breathed on this
I know God breathed on this
I know God breathed on this
I know God breathed on this

[Verse 1: Kanye West & Vory]
I know He got His hands on this
I know we got a chance on this
No, I never planned on this

This might get banned off rip
Gon' say somethin' for y'all quick
Let me know something, who y'all with?
Don't know nothing, I know this

[Chorus: Kanye West]
I know God breathed on this

[Break: Vory]
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Breathed on this, breathed, breathed, oh, oh

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
More than I can say for you
Before the sons and the daughters
Before the sun and the water
More than I can say for you
But the truth still for you
Once I saw what the Lord do
God, the Son, all the glory
God, the Father, like Maury
Don't care what you say, nothin' on me
I don't care 'bout the lawyer fees
I don't care 'bout your loyalties
God will solve it all for me
Trust man, he a failure
Trust, and God'll heal ya'
Dustin, he a Hoffman
Don't fall what they offerin', uh
Fall far too often, yeah, call God but don't call enough
Fall down but don't fall in love, I know God is all in us

[Chorus: Kanye West]
I know God breathed on this
I know God breathed on this
I know God breathed on this
I know God breathed on this
I know God breathed on this
I know God breathed on this
I know God breathed on this
I know God breathed on this

[Verse 3: Vory]
Devil on my shoulders, I can't let 'em breathe
Brush 'em off my sleeve, I'm filled with memories
Pray they remember me, oh, oh-oh
And I know there's an angel watchin' over me
(All times), I inhaled and breathed
They hearts are filled with greed
Okay, now they want the old me
Not too big on peoples talkin'
Okay, now they gotta show me
Okay, okay, Devil's talkin' to me, angel's talkin' to me
But Angels start to tell me, "It's okay to not feel okay"
I know that you'd be proud if you was here today
But it's okay 'cause I'm okay

[Chorus: Vory]
I know God breathed on me
I know God breathed on me
I know God breathed on me
I know God breathed on me

[Verse 1]
Lipstick and Polaroids
Late night hanging with you, boy
Record player playing white noise
That's the way, that's the way I
Like it when the stars are out
Drop top cruising out of town
You and me, it's going down
That's the way, that's the way

[Pre-Chorus]
Hold me down, I'll play your game
Kiss until I, I
I'm addicted to your everything, everything

[Chorus]
My body's tripping on you
Feeling higher than the moon
Got me trying something new
Falling into you, foolish
My body's tripping on you
Feeling higher than the moon
Got me trying something new
Falling into you, foolish

[Verse 2]
Black nails and denim jeans
Every night feeling like a dream
Always know just what I need
That's the way, that's the way I
Like it when you play a little rough
Breathe you in, can't get enough
Keep it in, no need to rush
That's the way, that's the way

[Pre-Chorus]
Hold me down, I'll play your game
Kiss until I, I
I'm addicted to your everything, everything

[Chorus]
My body's tripping on you
Feeling higher than the moon
Got me trying something new
Falling into you, foolish
My body's tripping on you
Feeling higher than the moon
Got me trying something new
Falling into you, foolish

[Bridge]
Blurring all the lines, lost in paradise
Oh, oh
Wavy state of mind, fading out of time
Oh, oh

[Chorus]
My body's tripping on you
Feeling higher than the moon
Got me trying something new
Falling into you, foolish
My body's tripping on you
Feeling higher than the moon
Got me trying something new
Falling into you, foolish

[Outro]
Falling into you, foolish
Falling into you, foolish

[Verse 1]
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
We jumped, never asking why
We kissed, I fell under your spell
A love no one could deny

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't you ever say I just walked away
I will always want you
I can't live a lie, running for my life

[Chorus]
I came in like a wrecking ball
I never hit so hard in love
All I wanted was to break your walls
All you ever did was wreck me
Yeah, you, you wreck me

[Verse 2]
I put you high up in the sky
And now, you're not coming down
It slowly turned, you let me burn
And now, we're ashes on the ground

[Pre-Chorus]

I will always want you
I can't live a lie, running for my life
I will always want you

Left me crashing in a blazing fall
All you ever did was wreck me
Yeah, you, you wreck me

[Bridge]
I never meant to start a war
I just wanted you to let me in
And instead of using force
I guess I should've let you win
I never meant to start a war
I just wanted you to let me in
I guess I should've let you win

[Interlude]
Don't you ever say I just walked away
I will always want you

[Chorus]
I came in like a wrecking ball

Little Foot, Big Foot, get out the way
I'ma show y'all how to move this yay

Little Foot, Big Foot, get out the way
I'ma show y'all how to move this yay

I'ma show y'all that a move ain't, woo

[Verse 1]
Little Foot, Big Foot, get out the way
Bustin' out bales, I've been bustin' all day
Bustin' out bales, we were sellin' that hay
We been movin' that snow, I was ridin' that sleigh
Double cup C's, had to put them in the safe
Got the semi on deck, .45, AK
Servin' up fiend, I remember that J
Brought his daughter to the house, I was cryin' all day
L's rolled up and I'm packin' that heat
12 roll up and I'm slappin' them feet
He was only sixteen, he was lookin' at three
Now he lookin' at nine, pray to God he don't speak
Water drip rich, so we gave 'em that leak
Bales got my baby mama nails on fleek
I was seven years old, daddy thrown in the clink
Said, "Life ain't fair, everybody gon' cheat"

[Chorus]
Little Foot, Big Foot, get out the way
I'ma show y'all how to move this yay
I'ma show y'all how to move like this
I'ma show y'all that a move ain't, woo
Little Foot, Big Foot, get out the way
I'ma show y'all how to move this yay
I'ma show y'all how to move like this
I'ma show y'all that a move ain't, woo

[Verse 2]
Chicken coupe, chicken soup, I got the wave
Move so smooth like butter, like shea
Crime don't pay, I ain't heard what they say
Quarter brick, half a brick, whole brick, ayy (Ayy)
Cotton ball white like hen house floors
Could've been broke, this the life I chose
They was in school, I was stirrin' that pot
Daddy couldn't come home, I was takin' that spot
Life move fast, like a movie, so quick
Dark-skinned beauty got a booty so thick
She a down-home chick, she'll hit that lick
Had to drop my old girl 'cause she think that she slick
I ain't seen him in a minute, so I think he might flip
Had to hit him with the stick, man you niggas ain't, woo
If I couldn't move bricks, I don't know what I'd do
I ain't worried 'bout mine, you can worry 'bout you

[Chorus]
Little Foot, Big Foot, get out the way

She just laughed and touched my face (What you mean?)
You don't understand what this is (Oh wait, wait, wait, wait)

Let's just stay here and enjoy the great design
Had the iceberg tucked in my waist (Bling)
Fuck an omelet, you can eat off my face (No)

You don't love her, then you lyin'
Come and go and you get tulips
Put a finger to my two lips (It's okay)

You can set the snow on fire
The reason that you suffer is desire (Huh)
The reason that I'm moving with this ooh-wee

Woke up in my room, she was long gone
Toni singing me another sad song (Ooh)
Eternity

[Chorus]
Why go to the party? Why go to the party?
Why go to the party at all?
Two shots and a body, two shots and a body
Two shots and a body involved

[Verse 1]
Where are those subtle men?
With the decency to might be wrong
Where are those winter girls?
Who corrected, say women
I'm sorry, forgiven
Why would we ever change?
Planets never see a day that isn't towards the Sun
Bliss is a cheap emotion, everyone here seems to afford
So I don't know why I'm here without you, you

[Chorus]
Why go to the party? Why go to the party?
Why go to the party at all?
When you're not invited, you take what you're given
Some wait every day for the call

[Verse 2]
Grief is a standing ocean, I never swam unless you did
So I don't know why I'm here without you
I miss you

[Chorus]
Why go to the party? Why go to the party?
Why go to the party at all? (You)
I call to a spirit, you may never hear it
How else could I keep you alive? Alive

[Outro]
'Cause it's hard for me to love myself without you here
'Cause the days are slow, but the years are fast
I wonder when I'll feel your smile

[Intro]
Ooh
Ooh, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Uh
Let me tell you something true

[Verse 1]
I remember, uh, back when I was six years old, uh
Daddy said, "The world's so cold"
"There is something that you should know"
Uh
"You're so gorgeous," thank you, daddy
"Nothing's really worth your time"
"But someday soon you just might find"
"The truth about the world's design," oh

[Chorus]
To be beautiful is to be hunted
I can't change the truth, I can't get you used to this
No, no, no, no, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
To be beautiful is to be hunted
I can't change the truth, I can't get you used to this
And I know that, yeah

[Verse 2]
Now remember, uh
You do what the hell you want, uh
But someone's gonna smell your funk
You're exactly what they want (Truth)
To be happy really means that someone else ain't
And balance ain't a one-food plate
Everything is give and take, oh, oh

[Chorus]
To be beautiful is to be hunted
I can't change the truth, I can't get you used to this
Oh, oh, yeah, oh yeah
To be beautiful is to be hunted
I can't change the truth, I can't get you used to this
And I know

[Post-Chorus]
Go'n, do it like this, okay (Woo)
Shoulder shake, woah (Oh no)
Do it in and out (Nah-nah-nah-nah)
Ayy, ayy, uh (Ooh)

[Chorus]
To be beautiful is to be hunted
I can't change the truth, I can't get you used to this
Can't get you used to this
No, no, no, no
To be beautiful is to be hunted (I can't, I know)
I can't change the truth (I said), I can't get you used to this
Ooh, give it to me now, bring the strings back, uh

[Outro]
To be beautiful is to be hunted
We are beautiful, yeah
That's so beautiful
That's so beautiful

[Chorus]
Sweet thing
You moved to Southern California, sweet thing
You do just what your parents told you, sweet thing
You're watching Parks and Rec alone, sweet thing
You sweet thing
Sweet thing
You'll end up being someone better, sweet thing
But I can only be myself, sweet thing
You'll still believe in fairytales, sweet thing
You sweet thing

[Verse]
You take me to the fair
But I don't really care
You wouldn't change a hair
Sometimes I wonder why you love me
But you love me
I always make you cry
No matter how I try
Sometimes I wonder why
Why would you ever want to love me?
Must you love me? Oh

[Chorus]
Sweet thing
You made me chicken, rice, and beans, sweet thing
You're just as sweet as you can be, sweet thing (Oh, yeah)
If you wanna be happy, don't look at my phone, sweet thing
My sweet thing (Sweet thing)
Sweet thing
Your friend is always acting stank, sweet thing
You wanna hold me, but you can't, sweet thing
You always eating off my food, sweet thing
My sweet thing

[Bridge]
Ain't got no pictures on my feed
Gucci jacket smell like weed, ooh
Rubbing my head while we're both sleeping
Feel like I'm cheating on myself
But it feels so good
I wanna tell you something
Something I've never said before
I just wanna say

[Outro]
Thank you (Oh, yeah)
'Cause I love you, mmh, mmh

Thank you

Oh, I said thank you
And I love you, yes, I do
And I love you, yes, I do
I said thank you (Woo)
Thank you for children
Thank you for your love
I said thank you
I admire, I admire
I just wanna say it, I had mine sad (Thank you)
I cannot find, I cannot find, losin' my mind
Losin' my mind

Surrounded by cameras and night-owls
Slid him 23 milli and it's mine now

A highly decorated war veteran
Educated and eloquent
For a better brighter future, Ninja for President

Uh yo that dropped out what the fuck?
How do I, hang on…
Oh there we go
Shits fuckin' banging, okay, yo
Yeah, uh, first up I’d just like to say
Fuck you, Thomas
Look at me now
Up in fucking Zef Studios, South Africa
Where are you?
Still living at your mum’s house
Anyway, tell her I say hi

[Verse]
Yo my life is a porno
Got all these sexy girls loving my raw flow
Like this one chick with the fat bum and the tight little corn rolls
Woke me up and said: “Smiley I’ve got a sore throat”
“And sore bum from last night”, yeah, I’ve got a fat dick
When she first saw it she was like, “It’s fuckin' gigantic!”
In the candlelight, I made the vibe all nice and romantic
She was way impressed, she said: “I’ve never sucked a dick that big!”
I don’t really like skinny bitches, I prefer thicker chicks
My dick's obviously not small, but Ninjas got a bigger dick
His dick is a miracle, I can’t take my eyes off it
I promise I’m not gay, but I kind’ve admire it
I respect Ninja a lot 'cause he is a really good rhymer
When we hit the town, we drown in a fuckin' sea of vagina
I recently moved to LA and uh, I must say LA is nice
Plus all the girls there really like fucking famous guys
I like girls company, but I’m also happy to stay at home
All day alone, high as fuck, wanking to Game Of Thrones
I really miss Khaleesi, Game of Thrones was my favorite show
If I dated her, we wouldn’t fuck straight away, we’d just take it slow
Girls think I’m mysterious 'cause I fuck with a mask on
I’m not a 2 minute noodle, yeah baby, I last long
'Cause if a girl doesn’t come, then, I feel like a failure
Smiley, a young OG from Australia

[Verse 1]
Uh yo
Looking back on the bad days
I was on a muddafuckin 'rampage
Back when I was caught up in the rat race
I knew somehow, someway, someday one day
I’d be living that Lambo Life
Now everybody goes “That’s so nice”
But nobody knows what I sacrificed
To get this shit
I don't fit in
Yes I admit it
But I’m committed
Told them I gon' get it and I muddafuck hit it
It took a minute
But look, Ma, I did it
Rich is how I’m living
Cos I kill it when I spit it

I’m not really sure what insanity is to tell you the truth, so sometimes I feel I’m going in a path, it’s going against the river, going against the wave, going against what other people are doing. But I don’t necessarily call that insanity, I really don’t call that insanity. Sometimes when I look at the mass of people or turn on the TV, I just shake my head and say, this is insanity, this is insanity, normality is insanity, I can't escape it, it's everywhere. Wherever I look it's there, so I’m not quite clear on what the word means anymore

Of course, I’m afraid of dying, everybody is. Everything on the planet is afraid of dying, whether it’s a dog, whether it’s a mosquito, whether it's a turtle, whether it’s a cat, everything’s programmed to survive. Everything doesn't want to… nothing wants to die, everything’s struggling to live. I guess humans, but I wouldn't necessarily say this for certain, are maybe most aware of the fact that they’re going to die, and I guess that makes the whole journey a lot more difficult, more complex, and more challenging than perhaps what goes through an animal's mind, but I wouldn't say that for certain

Well you know, I’m certain, certain people who came into contact with me during my life will remember me, there is no doubt about it, and as time goes on less and less people might remember me, unless what I’ve what achieved in my art has some sort of eternal meaning to it. It’s always impossible to judge whether this will happen or not happen, it’s… it’s… whether it’s just chance I guess, maybe skill, maybe chance, whatever it is that you have, uh... a following that goes beyond your own life. But ultimately I guess, they say everything will disappear, and I guess the planet might disappear when the sun goes out

If they can steal from you, they can kill you

[Verse]
It’s not my fault I was born into this fucked up world
Not sure how to fix this
Baby, maybe I can ease your pain just a little bit
Yo I got the cure for sickness
Got the ill hardware guaranteed to take away your pain
One hit, bwah, you addicted
Pure uncut straight from the muddafukin' source, kid
This shit will fuck you up
Had to disappear for a while, shit got a lil' hot
Guess who’s back on the block
Mr. Big Stuff laid back in the cut
One hand on the burner one hand on the Glock
Everyday it’s war on the streets
One lil' slip bring a whole lotta heat
Stay woke, your boy getting raw on the beat
Don’t sleep, zef soldiers on da creep
Let’s ride, I got your fix baby, yo, you wanna get high?
Get you anything you need on da zefside
Just trying to live my muddafukin' best life
Loved by many, hated by few
Cos I’m scandalous
Too real, fake people can’t handle us
Operate from Africa to Los Angeles
Slanging hot product what shut up nwata
One little, two little, three little zeflingz
Flexing customers texting
123tjie glowing in the dark, soos n fietjie
I can see you but you can’t see me
Fun time on the frontline bra passop virrie 1time
Wat kind scurrel tot die sunshine
Fuck I’m in too deep, stay woke, don’t sleep
Zef soldiers on the creep

Every time I touch the mic they say, “You fuckin killed that!”
I fuck ‘em up lights out, put the fuckin mic down right now
Too cold to hold baby iced out
I had no help when I was flat broke
Hit the fuckin lotto and I’m never looking back yo
Mad dough, rap shows generate the cash flow
“Damm bro! You went from a Jetta to a Lambo!”
Is it real, is it fake? Is it ill, is it lame, is it comedy?
It's easy to fake it to make it takes an anomaly
It's easy to not give a fuck when you’re living in luxury
My people are starving it’s fucked to be living in poverty
We raising our youth yo we open their brains with this poetry
We training the troops to shoot open the gates to the overseas
We changing the future, we fucked if we don’t save the planet

No photos, no fame
Nobody knows my name

[Ninja]
No future, no plan
I'm just an everyday man

[Yo-Landi Visser]
Finally, we are no one

[Ninja]
I'm walking down the street, smoking a cigarette
Nobody look at me 'cause nobody cares
No one stares, no one gives a damn
I'm just another face, no one knows who I am
"Un café s'il vous plaît", I order my coffee
Watching people go by, nobody bothers me
Nobody knows I am a millionaire
So nobody stares, 'cause nobody cares
This is what it feels like
To be no one

[Chorus: Ninja]
This is what it feels like to be no one
So this is what it feels like to be no one
This is what it feels like to be no one
So this what it feels like to be no one

[Yo-Landi Visser]
Finally, we are no one
No photos, no fame, nobody knows my name
Life is beautiful, I'm just a stranger sipping on champagne

[Ninja]
No future, no plan, I'm just an everyday man
I'm just another face in the crowd watching my favourite band

[Yo-Landi Visser]
I'm lying on the beach with my toes in the sand
Working on my tan, no one knows who I am
A firm hand applies the lotion
Little house on the beach next to the ocean
"Een roomys asseblief", I order my ice cream
Watching people on the beach, nobody bothers me
Nobody knows I am a millionaire
So nobody stares 'cause nobody cares
This is what it feels like to be no one

[Chorus: Ninja]
This is what it feels like to be no one
So this is what it feels like to be no one
This is what it feels like to be no one
So this what it feels like to be no one

[Ninja]
This is what it feels like to be no one

[Yo-Landi Visser]
No photos, no fame, nobody knows my name

[Chorus: Ninja]
So this is what it feels like to be no one
This is what it feels like to be no one
No future no plan I'm just an everyday man
So this what it feels like to be no one

Be happy
If you don't wanna see me

Did a full 180, Crazy
Thinking 'bout the way I was
Did the heartbreak change me? Maybe
But look at where I ended up
I'm all good already
So moved on, it's scary
I'm not where you left me at all, so

If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me

Don't show up, don't come out
Don't start caring about me now
Walk away, you know how
Don't start caring about me now

Aren't you the guy who tried to
Hurt me with the word "goodbye"?
Though it took some time to survive you
I'm better on the other side
I'm all good already
So moved on, it's scary
I'm not where you left me at all, so
If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me
(Don't, don't, don't)

Don't show up, don't come out

If you wanna believe that anything could stop me

Don't start caring about me now ('Bout me now)
Walk away (Walk away), you know how (You know how)

[Intro]
It's the ugliest nightmare born from the prettiest dreams
Millions of people tryin' to get on the scene
And everyone sellin' their souls, everyone sellin' their...
Everyone sayin' they woke
But they sleepwalkin', dead, eyes closed

[Chorus]
L.A. monster
I pray the Lord my soul to keep
Lord, save these people, they asleep
They lettin' Satan run they streets
Lord, save us from
L.A. monster
I pray the Lord my soul to keep
Lord, save these people, they asleep
They lettin' Satan run they streets
Lord, save us from
L.A. monster

[Refrain]
It's the ugliest nightmare born from the prettiest dreams
Millions of people tryin' to get on the scene
And everyone sellin' their souls, everyone sellin' their...
Everyone sayin' they woke
But they sleepwalkin', dead, eyes closed
L.A. monster
It's the ugliest nightmare born from the prettiest dreams
Millions of people tryin' to get on the scene
And everyone sellin' their souls, everyone sellin' their...
Everyone sayin' they woke
But they sleepwalkin', dead, eyes closed
L.A. monster

[Outro]
It gives false hope then eats them whole
Seen billionaires who are still broke
Jesus, save all my people
From this monster, 'fore it takes their souls
It gives false hope then eats them whole
Seen billionaires who are still broke
Jesus, save all my people
From this monster, 'fore it takes their souls

[Verse 1]
People like us, we play with a heavy balloon
We keep it up to keep the devil at bay, but it always falls way too soon
People like us, we play with a heavy balloon
We keep it up to keep the devil at bay, but it always falls way too soon
People like us, we play with a heavy balloon
We keep it up to keep the devil at bay, but it always falls way too soon

[Chorus]
I spread like strawberries (I spread like strawberries)
I climb like peas and beans (I climb like peas and beans)
I've been sucking it in so long
That I'm busting at the seams
I spread like strawberries (I spread like strawberries)
I climb like peas and beans (I climb like peas and beans)
I've been sucking it in so long
That I'm busting at the seams

[Verse 2]
In the middle of the day, it's like the sun
But the Saharan one, it's staring me down
Forcing all forms of life inside of me to retreat underground
It grows relentless like the teeth of a rat
It's just got to keep on gnawing at me
And it constricts like a boa on a hose, nothing flows
So the pressure grows instead of the seed

[Verse 3]
People like us get so heavy and so lost sometimes
So lost and so heavy that the bottom is the only place we can find
You get dragged down, down to the same spot enough times in a row
The bottom begins to feel like the only safe place that you know
But you know what?

[Chorus]
I spread like strawberries (I spread like strawberries)
I climb like peas and beans (I climb like peas and beans)
I've been sucking it in so long
That I'm busting at the seams
I spread like strawberries (I spread like strawberries)
I climb like peas and beans (I climb like peas and beans)
I've been sucking it in so long
That I'm busting at the seams

[Outro]
(I spread like strawberries), I spread like strawberries
I climb like (I climb like peas and beans)
I spread like strawberries
I climb like peas and beans
I spread like strawberries
I climb like peas and beans (That I'm busting at the seams)
I spread like strawberries
I climb like peas and beans

[Bridge]
Open dreams and open feelings, oh
They deny our path through
Feelings and miseries, oh
No one gets the lookup
Oh, I tried and I tied, no
Oh no, it did not work
Well I tried

[Verse 1]
I used to walk down the streets
On my way to school
Grinding my teeth to a rhythm invisible
I used my feet to crush dead leaves like they had fallen from trees
Just for me, just to be crash cymbals

[Pre-Chorus]
In class, I'd pass the time
Drawing a slash for every time
The second hand went by a group of five
Done twelve times was a minute

[Chorus]
But Shameika said I had potential
Shameika said I had potential
Shameika said I had potential
Shameika said I had potential

[Verse 2]
I used to march down the windy, windy sidewalks
Slapping my leg with a riding crop
Thinking it made me come off so tough
I didn't smile, because a smile always seemed rehearsed
I wasn't afraid of the bullies, and that just made the bullies worse

[Pre-Chorus]
In class, I'd pass the time
Drawing a slash for every time
The second hand went by a group of five
Done twelve times was a minute

[Chorus]
But Shameika said I had potential
Shameika said I had potential
Shameika said I had potential
Shameika said I had potential

[Bridge]
Hurricane Gloria in excelsis deo
That's my bird in my tree
My dog and my man and my music is my holy trinity
Hurricane Gloria in excelsis deo
That's my bird in my tree
My dog and my man and my music is my holy trinity

[Verse 3]
Tony told me he'd describe me as pissed off, funny, and warm
Sebastian said I'm a good man in a storm
Back then I didn't know what potential meant
And Shameika wasn't gentle and she wasn't my friend but
She got through to me and I'll never see her again
She got through to me and I'll never see her again
I'm pissed off, funny, and warm
I'm a good man in a storm
And when the fall is torrential, I'll recall

[Chorus]
Shameika said I had potential
Shameika said I had potential
Shameika said I had potential
Shameika said I had potential

[Verse 3]
Tony told me he'd describe me as pissed off, funny, and warm
Sebastian said I'm a good man in a storm
Back then I didn't know what potential meant
But Shameika wasn't gentle and she wasn't my friend
But she got through to me and I'll never see her again
She got through to me and I'll never see her again
I'm pissed off, funny, and warm
I'm a good man in a storm
And when the fall is torrential, I'll recall

[Chorus]
Shameika said I had potential
Shameika said I had potential
Shameika said I had potential
Shameika said I had potential
Shameika said I had potential
Shameika said I had potential
Shameika said I had potential
I too used to want him to be proud of me
And then I just wanted him to make amends
I wonder what lies he's telling you about me
To make sure that we'll never be friends
And it's a shame because you and I didn't get a witness
We're the only ones who know
We were cursed the moment that he kissed us
From then on, it was his big show

I grew concerned when I saw him start to covet you
When I learned what he did, I felt close to you
In my own way, I fell in love with you
But he's made me a ghost to you
I watch him let go of your hand, I wanna stand between you
But it's not what I'm supposed to do
I watch him walk over, talk over you, be mean to you
And it makes me feel close to you
It makes me feel close to you
It makes me feel close to you
It's not what it's supposed to do
It makes me feel close to you
I too wanted to make him proud of me
And then I just wanted him to make amends
I wonder what lies he's telling you about me
To make sure that we'll never be friends
And it's a shame because you and I didn't get a witness
We're the only ones who know
We were cursed the moment that he kissed us
From then on, it was his big show
From then on, it was his big show
From then on, it was his big show

And you're wearing time like a flowery crown
Sitting that, sitting that big cat down
And I'm alone on the summit now
Trying not to let my light go out

I too used to want him to be proud of me
And then I just wanted him to make amends
I wonder what lies he's telling you about me
To make sure that we'll never be friends
And it's a shame because you and I did not get a witness
We’re the only ones who know
We were cursed the moment that he kissed us
From then on, it was his big show

I grew concerned when I saw him start to covet you
When I learned what he did, I felt close to you
In my own way, I fell in love with you
But he's made me a ghost to you
I watch him let go of your hand, I wanna stand between you
But it's not what I'm supposed to do
I watch him walk over you, talk over you, be mean to you
And it makes me feel close to you
And you're wearing time like a flowery crown
Sitting there, sitting that big cat down
And I'm alone on the summit now
Trying not to let my light go out
Trying not to let my light go out
And you're wearing time like a flowery crown
Sitting there, sitting that big cat down
And I'm alone on the summit now
Trying not to let my light go out

Oh, I too used to want him to be proud of me
And then I just wanted him to make amends
I wonder what lies he's told you about me
To make sure that we'll never be friends
To make sure that we'll never be friends
To make sure that we'll never be friends
To make sure that we'll never be friends

[Verse 1]
I've been thinking about when I was trying to be your friend
I thought it was then, but it wasn't, it wasn't genuine
I was just so furious, but I couldn't show you
'Cause I know you and I know what you can do
And I don't want a war with you, I won't afford it
You get sore, even when you win

[Verse 2]
And you maim when you're on offense
But you kill when you're on defense
And you've got them all convinced
That you're the means and the end
All the VIPs and PYTs and wannabes
Afraid of not being your friend

[Verse 3]
And I've always been too smart for that
But you know what? My heart was not
I took it like a kid, you see
The cool kids voted to get rid of me
I'm ashamed of what it did to me
What I let get done
It stole my fun, it stole my fun

[Chorus 1]
Fetch the bolt cutters, I've been in here too long
Fetch the bolt cutters, I've been in here too long
Fetch the bolt cutters, I've been in here too long
Fetch the bolt cutters

[Post-Chorus]
He sings so nice, I guess he tries (I've been thinking about when I was trying to be your friend)
(I thought it was then, but it wasn't, it wasn't genuine)

[Chorus 2]
Fetch the bolt cutters, I've been in here too long
Fetch the bolt cutters (I've been in here too long)
Whatever happens, whatever happens (Whatever happens)
Fetch the bolt cutters, I've been in here too long
Fetch the bolt cutters

[Verse 4]
While I'd not yet found my bearings
Those it girls hit the ground
Comparing the way I was to the way she was
Sayin' I'm not stylish enough and I cry too much
And I listened because I hadn't found my own voice yet
So all I could hear was the noise that
People make when they don't know shit
But I didn't know that yet

[Verse 5]
I grew up in the shoes they told me I could fill
When they came around, I would stand real still
A girl can roll her eyes at me and kill
I got the idea I wasn't real
I thought being blacklisted would be grist for the mill
Until I realized I'm still here (I'm still here)
I grew up in the shoes they told me I could fill
Shoes that were not made for running up that hill
And I need to run up that hill, I need to run up that hill
I will, I will, I will, I will, I will

[Chorus 2]
Fetch the bolt cutters, I've been in here too long
Fetch the bolt cutters, whatever happens, whatever happens
Fetch the bolt cutters, I've been in here too long
Fetch the bolt cutters, whatever happens, whatever happens
Fetch the bolt cutters (I've been in here too long)
Whatever happens, whatever happens

[Outro]
Fetch the bolt cutters, fetch the bolt cutters
Fetch the bolt cutters, fetch the bolt cutters (I will, I will)
Fetch the bolt cutters, fetch the bolt cutters
Fetch the bolt cutters, fetch the bolt cutters
Fetch the bolt cutters, fetch the bolt cutters
Whatever happens, whatever happens
Whatever happens, whatever happens
Fetch the bolt cutters (Whatever happens, whatever happens), fetch the bolt cutters
On I go, not toward or away
Up until now it was day, next day
Up until now in a rush to prove
But now I only move to move

On I go, not toward or away

Up until now in a-
Ah, fuck, shit
Oh

In the long run
If I get there in
In the long run (It could be alright)
It could be alright (If I get there in time)
In the long run
If I get there in (If I get there in time)
It could be alright (If I get there in time)
Be alright (If I get there in time)
In the long run

On I go, not toward or away
Up until now it was day, next day
Up until now in a rush to prove
But now I only move to move

[Verse 1]
The drumset is gone
And the rug it was on
Is still here screaming at me
Why did you take it all away?
Why did you take it all away?
And the dialing of the phone
Is no longer fun
Since you've been done with me
And you don't want to talk with me at all
Why'd you take it all away?
I did nothing wrong
I don't believe it, I don't believe it
I don't believe your reasoning
Now I understand you're a human
And you've got to lie, you're a man
And you've got to get what you want
How you want it but so do I
And I wanted to try

[Chorus]
Why did you not want to try?
Why did you take it all away?
Why did you not want to try?
Why did you take it all away?
Why did you not want to try?
Why did you take it all away?
Why did you not want to try?
Why did you take it all away?

[Post-Chorus]
Why did you take it all away? (You took it all away)
Why did you take it all away? (You took it all away, took it)
Why did you take it all away? (You took it all away)
Why did you take it all away? (You took it all away)

[Verse 2]
The drumset is gone
And the rug it was on
Is still here screaming at me (You took it all away, took it)
Why did you take it all away?
Why did you take it all away? (You took it all away, took it)
And the dialing of the phone (You took it all away, took it)
Is no longer fun (You took it all away, took it)
Since you've been done with me
And you don't want to talk with me at all
Why'd you take it all away?
I did nothing wrong
I don't believe it, I don't believe it
I don't believe your reasoning
Now I understand you're a human
And you've got to lie, you're a man
And you've got to get what you want
How you want it, but so do I
And I wanted to try

[Chorus]
Why did you not want to try?
Why did you take it all away?
Why did you not want to try?
Why did you take it all away?
Why did you not want to try?
Why did you take it all away?
Why did you not want to try?
Why did you take it all away?
And

[Verse 1]
I gave you pictures and cards on non-holidays
And it wasn't because I was bored
I followed you from room to room with no attention
And it wasn't because I was bored

[Chorus]
It was because I was loving you so much
It's the only reason I gave my time to you
And that's it, that's the kick in you giving up
'Cause you know you won't like it when there's nothing to do

[Verse 2]
Check out that rack of his, look at that row of guitar necks
Lined up like eager fillies, outstretched like legs of Rockettes
They don't know what they are in for and they don't care, but I do
I thought you would wail on me like you wail on them, but it was just a coochie-coo-coups

[Chorus]
And meanwhile I'm loving you so much
It's the only reason I gave my time to you
And that's it, that's the kick in you giving up
'Cause you know you won't like it when there's nothing to do

[Chorus]
Meanwhile I'm loving you so much
That's the only reason that I gave my time to you
And that's it, that's the kick in you giving up
'Cause you know you don't like it when there's nothing to do

[Bridge]
And I've been used so many times
I've learned to use myself in kind
I try to drum, I try to write
I can't do either well but
Oh well, that's fine, I guess
'Cause I know how to spend my time

[Outro]
(I know how to spend my time)
(I know how to spend my time)
(I know how to spend my time, oh)
(Try to drum, I try to write, oh)
(Meanwhile I'm loving you so much)
(Meanwhile I'm loving you so much)
(Meanwhile I'm loving you so much)

[Intro]
I would beg to disagree
But begging disagrees with me
I would beg to disagree
But begging disagrees with me

[Verse 1]
I told you I didn't wanna go to this dinner
You know I don't go for those ones that you bother about
So when they say something that makes me start to simmer
That fancy wine won't put this fire out, oh

[Chorus]
Kick me under the table all you want
I won't shut up, I won't shut up
Kick me under the table all you want
I won't shut up, I won't shut up

[Verse 2]
I'd like to buy you a pair of pillow-soled hiking boots
To help you with your climb
Or rather, to help the bodies that you step over along your route
So they won't hurt like mine

[Chorus]
Kick me under the table all you want
I won't shut up, I won't shut up
Kick me under the table all you want
I won't shut up, I won't shut up

[Post-Chorus]
And if I don't wanna go, leave me alone
Don't push me, cookie, don't push me, don't you push me
If you get me to go and I open my mouth
To the fucking mutton that they're talking about
You can pout, but don't you, don't you
Don't you, don't you, don't you shush me

[Chorus]
Kick me under the table all you want
I won't shut up, I won't shut up
Kick me under the table all you want
I won't shut up, I won't shut up
Kick me under the table all you want (I would beg to disagree)
I won't shut up, I won't shut up (But begging disagrees with me)
Kick me under the table all you want (I would beg to disagree)
I won't shut up, I won't shut up (But begging disagrees with me)

[Post-Chorus]
And if I don't wanna go, leave me alone
Don't push me, cookie, don't push me, don't you push me
If you get me to go and I open my mouth
To the fucking mutton that they're talking about
You can pout, but don't you, don't you
Don't you, don't you, don't you shush me

[Bridge]
I would beg to disagree
But begging disagrees with me
I would beg to disagree
But begging disagrees with me
I would beg to disagree
But begging disagrees with me

[Chorus]
Kick me under the table all you want
I won't shut up, I won't shut up
Kick me under the table all you want (I would beg to disagree)
I won't shut up, I won't shut up (I would beg to disagree)
Kick me under the table all you want (I would beg to disagree)
I won't shut up, I won't shut up (But begging disagrees with me)
Kick me under the table all you want (I would beg to disagree)
I won't shut up, I won't shut up (But begging disagrees with me)

[Verse 1]
Look at how feathered his cocks are
See how seamless his frocks are
Look at his paper-beating over that rockstar
Look at how long she walks and how far
Was she lost? Or
Maybe she was not for
Traveling in the stock car anymore
Maybe she spent her formative years
Dealing with his contentious fears
And endless jeers at her endless tears
Or maybe she just got tired of watching him

[Verse 2]
Sniff white off a starlet's breast
Treating his wife like less than a guest
Getting his girl to clean up his mess
Never showing weakness unless it's a ward's season
It's the season of the ward
And she's trying to cut the cord
She's tired of planting her knees on the cold, hard floor of facts
Trying to act like the other girl acts

[Pre-Chorus]
And your strike may have been exact
But you know that you never really go to the mat
You tie everything all pretty in the second act
When you know that it didn't go exactly like that

[Chorus]
You arrive and drive by like a sauced up bat
Like you know you should know, but you don't know where it's at
Like you know you should know, but you don't know where it's at
Like you know you should know, but you don't know where it's at
You arrive and drive by like a sauced up bat
Like you know you should know, but you don't know where it's at
You arrive and drive by like a sauced up bat

[Post-Chorus]
Like you know you should know, but you don't know where it's at
Like you know you should know, but you don't know what you did
Like you know, you should know what happened when I came to bed
Like you know you should know, but you don't know
Like you know you should know, but you don't know
Like you know you should know, but you don't know what you did

[Bridge]
Well, good morning
Good morning
You raped me in the same bed your daughter was born in
Good morning
Good morning
Good morning
Good morning
Good morning
(Like you know you should know, but you don't know
Like you know you should know, but you don't know
Like you know you should know, but you don't know)

[Outro]
You were so high
You were so high
You were so high

[Verse 1]
I'm the one you're gonna take
From the following poisons
And I can't poison you, 'cause if I did
I'd get sued

Can you tell me who I am?
I've been wondering, so can you?
I have to get the airs on me
So why'd you even glare?

[Chorus]
Hands up, hands up
Hands down, hands down
Sands flying around
The airship requires towns

So, I'm coming
Down the path
Hands up, hands down
Everyone's getting the sound

[Verse 2]
Would be glad to tell you this
I'm in for seeing miss
Persia infamous
Teaming against the tip

I'm so annoyed now
'Cause you are all around
And editing skills, they say
Down, downtown

[Chorus]
Hands up, hands up
Hands down, hands down
Sands flying around
The airship requires towns

So I'm coming
Down the path
Hands up, hands down
Everyone's getting the sound

[Outro]
And as I feel the feelings you collected
I'm caught up with my name
It says to me: "Oh, day, oh, day"
As we try again and fade away

[Verse 1]
I just pretend that I'm in the dark and
I don't regret 'cause my heart can't take a loss
I'd rather be so oblivious
I'd rather be with you

[Pre-Chorus]
When it's said, when it's done, yeah
I don't ever wanna know
I can tell what you done, yeah
When I look at you

[Chorus]
In your eyes
I see there's something burning inside you
Oh, inside you
In your eyes
I know it hurts to smile, but you try to
Oh, you try to
You always try to hide the pain
You always know just what to say
I always look the other way
I'm blind, I'm blind
In your eyes
You lie, but I don't let it define you
Oh, define you

[Verse 2]
I tried to find love
In someone else too many times
But I hope you know I mean it (Mean it)
When I tell you you're the one that was on my mind, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
When it's said, when it's done, yeah
I would never let you know (Let you know)
I'm ashamed of what I've done, yeah
When I look at you

[Chorus]
In your eyes (Your eyes)
I see there's something burning inside you (Inside you)
Oh, inside you (Oh, inside you)
In your eyes
I know it hurts to smile, but you try to (But you try to)
Oh, you try to (You try to)
You always try to hide the pain (Oh, oh)
You always know just what to say (Oh, dear)
I always look the other way
I'm blind, I'm blind
In your eyes
You lie, but I don't let it define you (Hey)
Oh, define you

[Chorus]
In your eyes
I see there's something burning inside you
Oh, inside you
You always try to hide the pain
You always know just what to say
I always look the other way
I'm blind, I'm blind
In your eyes
You lie, but I don't let it define you
Oh, define you

[Intro]
Let's have some fun, this beat is sick
I wanna take a ride on your disco stick
Let's have some fun, this beat is sick
I wanna take a ride on your disco stick
Hey!

[Verse 1]
I wanna kiss you
But if I do, then I might miss you, babe
It's complicated and stupid
Got my ass squeezed by sexy Cupid
Guess he wants to play, wants to play a lovegame, a lovegame

[Pre-Chorus]
Hold me and love me
Just wanna touch you for a minute
Maybe three seconds is enough for my heart to quit it
Let's have some fun, this beat is sick
I wanna take a ride on your disco stick
Don't think too much, just bust that kick
I wanna take a ride on your disco stick

[Chorus]
Let's play a lovegame, play a lovegame

Are you in the game?
Dans, the lovegame

Are you in the game?
Dans, the lovegame

[Verse 2]
I'm on a mission
And it involves some heavy touching, yeah
You've indicated your interest
I'm educated in sex, yes
And now I want it bad, want it bad
A lovegame, a lovegame

[Pre-Chorus]
Hold me and love me
Just wanna touch you for a minute
Maybe three seconds is enough for my heart to quit it
Let's have some fun, this beat is sick
I wanna take a ride on your disco stick
Don't think too much, just bust that kick
I wanna take a ride on your disco stick

[Bridge]
I can see you staring there from across the block
With a smile on your mouth and your hand on your (huh)
The story of us, it always starts the same
With a boy and a girl and a, (huh) and a game
And a game (huh)
And a game (huh)
And a game (huh)
A lovegame!

[Chorus]
Let's play a lovegame, play a lovegame

[Outro]
Let's have some fun, this beat is sick
I wanna take a ride on your disco stick
Don't think too much, just bust that kick

[Intro]
Do it one more time. I sung the wrong lyrics

[Chorus]
She's out of my life
She's out of my life
I don't know whether to laugh or cry
I don't know whether to live or die
And it cuts like a knife
She's out of my life

[Verse]
It's out of my hands
It's out of my hands
To think for two years she was here
And I took her for granted, I was so cavalier
And the way that it stands
It's out of my hands

[Bridge]
So, I've learned that love's not possession
And I've learned that love won't wait
Now, I've learned, love needs expression
But, I've learned too late

[Chorus]
And she's out of my life
She's out of my life
Damned indecision and cursed pride
Kept my love for her locked deep inside
And it cuts like a knife
She's out of my life

[Chorus]
I said you wanna be startin' somethin'
You got to be startin' somethin'
I said you wanna be startin' somethin'
You got to be startin' somethin'
It's too high to get over (yeah, yeah)
You're too low to get under (yeah, yeah)
You're stuck in the middle (yeah, yeah)
And the pain is thunder (yeah, yeah)
High to get over (yeah, yeah)
You're too low to get under (yeah, yeah)
You're stuck in the middle (yeah, yeah)
And the pain is thunder (yeah, yeah)

[Verse 1]
I took my mama to the doctor with a fever
Seen a ta-da
I've known damn space
She done on a second
Someone's always tryin'
To start my baby cryin'
Talkin', squealin', lyin'
Saying you just want to be startin' somethin'

[Chorus]
I said you wanna be startin' somethin'
You got to be startin' somethin'
I said you wanna be startin' somethin'
You got to be startin' somethin'
It's too high to get over (yeah, yeah)
You're too low to get under (yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2]
So, Massa, she was stupid
With the seed that she was bathin'
When mama took the street
They said that she was sittin'
Someone's always tryin'
To start my baby cryin'
Hustlin', squealin', spyin'
Sayin' you just want to be startin' somethin'

[Chorus]
I said you wanna be startin' somethin'
You got to be startin' somethin'
I said you wanna be startin' somethin'
You got to be startin' somethin'

Still they hate you (Still they hate you)
You're a vegetable (You're a vegetable)
You're just a buffet (You're just a buffet)
You're a vegetable (You're a vegetable)
They eat off of you (They eat off of you)
You're a vegetable, aaow!

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Verse 3]
Billie Jean is always talkin'
But they think somebody's talkin'
Took her to the street
Now somebody always talkin'
She is always tryin'
To start my baby cryin'
Hustlin', squealin', lyin'
My baby's slowly dyin'

[Chorus]
I said you wanna be startin' somethin'
You got to be startin' somethin'

You're just a buffet (You're just a buffet)

You're a vegetable, aaow!

[Instrumental Interlude with Guitar]
Aaow!
Hee-haw! (Ooh!)

[Verse 4]
If you can't feed your baby (yeah, yeah)
Then don't have a baby (yeah, yeah)
And don't think maybe (yeah, yeah)
If you can't feed your baby (yeah, yeah)
You'll be always tryin'
To stop that child from cryin'
Hustlin', stealin', lyin'
Now baby's slowly dyin'

[Chorus]
I said you wanna be startin' somethin'
You got to be startin' somethin'
I said you wanna be startin' somethin'
You just got to be starting somethin'

You're too low to get under (yeah, yeah)
You're stuck in the middle (yeah, yeah)
And the pain is thunder (yeah, yeah)

But you're driving me mad

[Chorus]
So beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it
No one wants to be defeated
Showin' how funky and strong is your fight
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right
Just beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it

[Chorus]
You don't love him, you don't love him
You don't love him if you're thinking of me
You don't love him, you're just fucking
You're just fucking, it means nothing to me
You don't love him, you don't love him
You don't love him if you're thinking of me
You don't love him, you're just fucking
You're just fucking, it means nothing to me, yeah

[Verse]
It's been too long, you changed up over time
Why you, why you gonna even try to hide?
It's natural to find someone to treat you right
But it ain't right if you fuck him out of spite
You don't have to cry, girl, let me wipe your eyes
Your eyes, your eyes, your eyes
I promise you will always be mine
Oh-oh, just repeat after me

[Chorus]
You don't love him, you don't love him
You don't love him if you're thinking of me (It's all right)
You don't love him, you're just fucking
You're just fucking, you're thinking of me
You don't love him, you don't love him
You don't love him if you're thinking of me
You don't love him, you're just fucking
You're just fucking, it means nothing to me

[Verse]
Take off my disguise
I'm living someone else's life
Suppressing who I was inside
So I throw two thousand ones in the sky
Together we're alone (Together we're alone)
In Vegas, I feel so at home (In Vegas, I feel so at home)
I'm falling only for the night
So I throw two thousand ones in the sky (The sky)
Oh, oh, oh, how much to light up my star again
And rewire all my thoughts?
Oh, baby, won't you remind me what I am
And break, break my little cold heart?

[Bridge]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, oh
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh

[Chorus]
Call me up and I'll send for you
Take me down to your altitude
I don't know if I can be alone again (Alone again)
I don't know if I can sleep alone again (Alone again)
Check my pulse for a second time (A second time)
I took too much, I don't wanna die
I don't know if I can be alone again (Alone again)
I don't know if I can sleep alone again

[Bridge]
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh

[Outro]
Count it up, it's all for you, count it up
Count it up, it's all for you, count it up
'Cause I don't know if I can be alone again
I don't know if I can be alone again

[Intro]
I can't move, I'm so paralyzed
I'm so paralyzed
I can't explain why I'm terrified
I'm so terrified

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, I don't wanna touch the sky no more
I just wanna feel the ground when I'm coming down
It's been way too long
And I don't even wanna get high no more
I just want it out of my life
Out of my life, out

[Chorus]
I wanna cut you outta my dreams
'Til I'm bleeding out
'Til I'm bleeding
I wanna cut you outta my mind
'Til I'm bleeding out
'Til I'm bleeding
I wanna cut you outta my dreams
Woah, I'm bleeding out
Girl, I'm bleeding
I wanna cut you outta my mind
'Cause I'm bleeding out
Oh, I'm bleeding
Girl, I'm bleeding

[Outro]
I keep telling myself I don't need it
I keep telling myself I don't need it anymore
I keep telling myself I don't need it anymore
Need it anymore

[Intro]
No, yeah
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
Yeah, uh

[Verse 1]
You try with me so many times, yeah
You're cryin' out behind the smiles
And I can see right through the lies
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
And what we had is dead inside, yeah
You're actin' like it's still alive, ayy
And you still wanna make it right, yeah
I know

[Chorus]
But I've been the hardest to love
You're tryna let me go, yeah
And I can see it, I can see it
I've been the hardest to love
It's hard to let me go, yeah
And I can feel it, I can feel it (Oh, yeah)

[Verse 2]
I don't feel it anymore (Yeah)
The house I bought is not a home (No)
Together we are so alone
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Oh)
Don't regret the day we met (We met)
Don't forget that time we spent (We spent)
Forget that we're in different beds
I know

[Chorus]
'Cause I've been the hardest to love
You're tryna let me go, yeah
And I can see it, I can see it
I've been the hardest to love
It's hard to let me go, yeah
And I can feel it, I can feel it

[Bridge]
I can't, can't believe you want me
After all the heartbreaks, after all I've done, oh-oh-oh (Oh, oh, oh)
No, I can't, can't believe you trust me (Trust me)
After all the rough days, you still call me up (Me up, oh-oh-oh)

[Chorus]
'Cause I've been the hardest to love
You're tryna let me go, (Tryna let me go) yeah
And I can see it, I can see it (I can see it)
I've been the hardest to love (Love, baby)
You're tryna let me go, yeah
And I can feel it, I can feel it

[Instrumental Outro]

[Verse 1]
I used to pray when I was sixteen
If I didn't make it, then I'd probably make my wrist bleed
Not to mislead, turn my nightmares into big dreams
Whole squad mobbin' even though we only six deep
I was singing notes while my niggas played with six keys
Walking in the snow before I ever made my wrist freeze
I was blowing smoke, had me dizzy like Gillespie
Niggas had no homes, we were living in the dead streets
You couldn't find me like I'm Hoffa
Cover girls jumping out the page like they pop ups
Spending all my money on these niggas that I brought up
Taking care of families for my brothers when they locked up
And I had nothing to believe in
Double cup leanin'
Couldn't even breathe and
For that money I was fiending
Cali was the mission but now a nigga leaving

[Chorus]
Leaving, leaving into the night
Now a nigga leaving, leaving
Leaving into the night, oh

[Verse 2]
She like my futuristic sounds in the new spaceship
Futuristic sex, give her Philip K dick
She never need a man, she what a man need
So I keep on falling for her daily
We was at Coachella going brazy
Stack a couple M's like I was Shady
Now I'm in Tribeca like I'm Jay-Z
Rockin' Sorayama like he pay me
I just signed a new deal with Mercedes
Got me movin' dirty like I'm Swayze
All my diamonds dancing like they Swayze
All my diamonds hitting like they Swae Lee
Jet so big got a business and a coach
Always livin' on the road, rockin' Louis à la mode, nigga
And for that money, I been fiending
Cali was the mission, but now a nigga leaving

[Chorus]
Leaving, leaving into the night
Now a nigga leaving, leaving
Leaving into the night, oh

[Bridge]
Twenty mill' mansion, never lived in it
Zero edge pool, never dipped in it
Superstar neighbor in my business
Paparazzi tryna catch me slippin' and
Going on tour is my vacation
Every month another accusation
Only thing I'm phobic of is failing
I was never blessed with any patience

[Chorus]
So a nigga leaving, leaving, leaving into the night
Now a nigga leaving, leaving
Leaving into the night, oh

[Verse 1]
You pillow talk to me about the men who try to get in between us
They buy you bags and jewelry, yeah
They think your kindness is so weak
No, you don't give it up so easy, baby
But you just wanted my attention
You just wanted my affection
You got me tattooed on your mind
You just want me all the time
We'll figure out our shit and find a way (Oh, yeah)
When you say that you need space, I give you space (You space)
Girl, when you're ready, you know where I stay
When it comes to all these hoes, I'll never chase
But this world is such a, such an evil place
Man, these hoes will always find a way
'Cause when I'm on the liquor, I go crazy
And for that pussy, you know I'm a slave, yeah

[Chorus]
Well, this place is never what it seems
Take me out LA
Take me out of LA
This place will be the end of me
Take me out LA
Take me out of LA, yeah

[Verse 2]
Yeah
I'm in the Spyder Porsche cruisin' down the street
Black on black venom covered seats
Keanu Reeves, way a nigga speed
Diamond cross hangin' off of me
I'm fighting for my soul, Constantine
And it's slowly burning, it was never cheap
If you seen what I seen, you wouldn't sleep
I can't sleep
'Cause I got everything I wanted
Got the money, got the cars, got the ceiling with the stars
Got everything I wanted
But I'd be nothing without you
Gave you everything you wanted
Gave you power, gave you life, gave you space so you can shine
Gave you everything you wanted
But none of that matters to you, oh-oh

[Chorus]
This place (This place) is never what it seems
Take me out LA
Take me out of LA
(Oh, out LA, oh) This place will be the end of me
Take me out LA
Take me out of LA, yeah

[Bridge]
Woah, no, oh, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, ooh-woah
Oh-ah, no, no, no, no, woah-woah
Oh, no, oh
Hey
She pulled up to the studio
Nobody's watching
She closed the door and then she locked it
For me, for me
We had sex in the studio
Nobody walked in
I cut my verse and then she popped it
For me, for me
LA girls all look the same
I can't recognize
The same work done on they face
I don't criticize
She a cold-hearted bitch with no shame
But her throat too fire
She got Chrome Hearts hangin' from her neck
And them shits going wild
When she ride, she hold tight
She gon' ride 'til sweat fall down her spine
She's all mine for the night
She's all mine until he calls her line

[Outro]
She pulled up to the studio
Nobody's watching
She closed the door and then she locked it
For me, for me
We had sex in the studio
Nobody walked in
I cut my verse and then she popped it
For me, for me
Oh-oh, oh-oh

[Verse 1]
It was cold, we were laying by the lake
And oh, that's when I made my first mistake
I was sold, yeah, I thought that it was fate
Oh no, that's when I first felt my heart break

[Pre-Chorus]
Lust, it made us hungry like the wolves
We choose to act like fools
We were young, thought we were wildly in love

[Chorus]
But I wasted all my youth on you
Wasted all my youth on you
Oh, wasted youth
Oh, wasted youth

[Verse 2]
You, you stole the better parts of me
Cruel, you took my good and left no peace
Soon, there'll be no beauty left to see
Truth, wish I could erase memories

[Pre-Chorus]
Lust, it made us hungry like the wolves
We chose to act like fools
We were young, thought we were wildly in love

[Chorus]
But I wasted all my youth on you
Wasted all my youth on you
Oh, wasted youth
Oh, wasted youth

[Bridge]
If I had the chance to take it back
I'd waste it again, waste it again

[Chorus]
Wasted all my youth on you (wasted my youth, wasted my youth)
Wasted all my youth on you (you-u-uth)
Oh, wasted youth
Oh, wasted youth

[Outro]
If I had the chance to take it back
I'd waste it again, waste it again

[Verse 1: Drake]
You ask how many girls I been with in my life
I tell ya, "I stopped keeping count when I was 25"
I ask you the same thing, you tell me, "Seven guys"
But we both know that's a lie
'Cause if we countin' head and if we countin' drunken nights
Then that number that you gave just might be off by eight or nine
But it's still nowhere close to mine
Marcus prolly had to bring me straps like thirty times
He took over like four years ago when Courtnee had resigned
I been talkin' sex with Courtnee since like 2005
We been friends since junior high
Tough to enjoy the company and never cross the line
She's like, "Is it more than a hundred, with everyone combined?"
And I say, "Yeah, that's bein' kind"
At one point or another they all felt like they were mine
I had a lot of backs that I would never talk behind
I'm not really into threesomes, I like one thing at a time
I like when it's you and I
Plus I always feel like if somebody outperforms you
That could jeopardize your pride and I'm not into choosin' sides
Unless you 'bout to sleep and you askin' me what's my side
It's the right at home, but this a hotel so you can decide
Lessons that I learned before hittin' my prime
Confessions that I blame on the zodiac sign
Things you need to hear 'fore we say our goodbyes
Free myself of it all, watch a Scorpio rise
Yeah

[Verse 2: Jessie Reyez]
You say you wanna know but you don't though
Why you wanna know who I cropped out of photos?
And lately, papi, you been acting tonto
What you think before you, I was only movin' dolo
But I'm honest 'til I die, so I won't lie
And I prolly got some numbers that you won't like
And you're prolly gonna hate it
But I much rather be hated for the truth than for the wrong guy if he ain't done
You can't be this good without some badness
What? You think I fuck this good without some practice?
And if it's LOV and you're my MVP
Then why we talkin' about practice?
Like you want me to lie
Why would I jeopardize my worth, just to value your pride?
Confessions that I blame on the zodiac sign
'Cause then I switch up and I blame it on my Gemini
Might be jealousy, 'cause you just want me tradin' lives
Jealousy, 'cause I can get the girls and get the guys
And if I'm honest, this whole convo's just a waste of time
'Cause legacy should be my focus, not here playin' wife

[Verse 1]
Now it's getting quiet here, now it's getting blue
And this, baby, ain't no fair, taking up my youth
You've been telling me some lies, I be thinking it's the truth
But I see it in your eyes, the things that you do

[Refrain]
I don't wanna waste no time all alone
Want somewhere to go, something to call my own
And I ain't satisfied, where to go?
Lost out on the road, washed up on the shore

[Pre-Chorus]
And I've been through mountains and seas
Tryna get you to come back to me
And I've been far, and I've been so deep
Now I find it harder and harder to breathe

[Chorus]
And I need some new love
New love, new love

[Verse 2]
Even though I've run away, I still come back
No, there's nothing more to say, it's all been said
I've been trying to explain the things we had
To all of my friends who say that I've gone mad

[Refrain]
I don't wanna waste no time all alone
Want somewhere to go, something to call my own
And I ain't satisfied, where to go?
Lost out on the road, washed up on the shore

[Pre-Chorus]
And I've been through mountains and seas
Tryna get you to come back to me
And I've been far, and I've been so deep
Now I find it harder and harder to breathe

[Chorus]
And I need some new love
New love, new love
And I need some new love
New love, new love

[Bridge]
Easy come, easy go
Why are we living on, living on?
If we're not getting on, getting on?
Can we just let it go?
Cause we're waiting for a miracle
Why wait for a miracle? Yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
And I've been through mountains and seas
Tryna get you to come back to me
And I've been far, and I've been so deep
Now I find it harder and harder to breathe

[Chorus]
And I need some new love
New love, new love
And I need some new love
New love, new love

[Verse 1]
Now it's getting quiet here, now it's getting blue
And this, baby, ain't no fair, taking up my youth
You've been telling me some lies, I be thinking it's the truth
But I see it in your eyes, the things that you do

Easy come, easy go

New love, new love
And I need some new love
New love, new love

[Lyrics from Snippet]

[Verse 1]
Not long ago when I saw you there
With your brown-eyed grin and your messy hair
And every girl at the party was looking at you (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
I wonder what I'd say if I knew back then
That the brown-eyed boy'd be my best friend
And the one I'd give my heart to (Ooh, ooh, ooh)

[Pre-Chorus]
Now everything reminds me of you
Your pictures framed all over my room
And if I hate someone, you'll hate 'em too

[Chorus]
As long as I'm your darling angel
I don't need anything in the world
'Cause I feel like the luckiest every second that I'm your girl
I wanna do everything with you
Take the highs, I'll take the lows
I'll keep you close, give you the most
Oh, baby, I like you so much, it's kinda gross
Yeah, I like you so much, it's kinda gross

[Verse 2]
And driving in your car, I feel all grown up
Is it me or does it feel more than high school love?
Not gonna lie, your last name sounds so nice
I love when you complain about things like traffic
Love when you're tired, baby, I like all of it
Honestly, I can't believe you're mine

[Pre-Chorus]
I bring you up in every conversation
We're young, I know we gotta be patient
But I know I want my life to have you in it

[Chorus]
Ooh, and as long as I'm your darling angel
I don't need anything in the world
'Cause I feel like the luckiest every second that I'm your girl
I wanna do everything with you
Take the highs, I'll take the lows
I'll keep you close, give you the most
Oh, baby, I like you so much, it's kinda gross
Yeah, I like you so much, it's kinda gross

[Verse]
I can't step back on my block without no W
Lil' bitch think I'm finna chase, yeah, I'll find another you
I'm outchea thuggin', rollin' stogies from this gas station
I'm duckin' paparazzi flash, lil' bitch, I'm trap famous
So many people know my pockets, it's like my stash famous
I remember bein' so broke, shit, I ain't wanna have no babies
We was project playin' 'til Clip came with that black Mercedes
If you was pussy then, you pussy now, nigga, you can't erase it
I never saw us becoming famous in my imagination
Sat in too many rooms with losers who was procrastinatin'
Screamin', "Gang, gang, gang," it seemed so fascinatin'
The gang is at the wall, 0 and three, they catchin' cases
On the block, that's where I back the Wraiths
Shinin' on these white folk that was actin' racist
When your influence too big then they assassinate ya
When you keep this shit too real they wanna fabricate ya
Baby mama on my phone, she outchea bitchin' at me
Don't talk to me right now, my dawg, I'm trigger happy
It's like my girlfriend always mad whenever a nigga happy
It's like my girlfriend always mad whenever my niggas happy
Out in Amsterdam, I'm at the coffee shop
I ain't conversatin' if you talk a lot
Niggas only half-winnin', shit, we one and two
So I can't step back on my block without no W

[Chorus]
Picture perfect, you don't need no filter
Gorgeous, make 'em drop dead, you a killer
Shower you with all my attention
Yeah, these are my only intentions
Stay in the kitchen cookin' up, got your own bread
Heart full of equity, you're an asset
Make sure that you don't need no mentions
Yeah, these are my only intentions

[Verse 1]
Shout-out to your mom and dad for makin' you
Standin' ovation, they did a great job raisin' you
When I create, you're my muse
That kind of smile that makes the news
Can't nobody throw shade on your name in these streets
Triple threat, you a boss, you a bae, you a beast
You make it easy to choose
You got a mean touch, I can't refuse (No, I can't refuse it)

[Chorus]
Picture perfect, you don't need no filter
Gorgeous, make 'em drop dead, you a killer
Shower you with all my attention
Yeah, these are my only intentions
Stay in the kitchen cookin' up, got your own bread
Heart full of equity, you're an asset
Make sure that you don't need no mentions
Yeah, these are my only intentions

[Verse 2]
Already passed, you don't need no approval
Good everywhere, don't worry 'bout no refusal
Second to none, you got the upper hand now
Don't need a sponsor, nope, you're the brand now
You're my rock, my Colorado
Get that ring, just like Toronto
Love you now, a little more tomorrow
This how I feel, act like you know that you are

[Chorus]
Picture perfect, you don't need no filter
Gorgeous, make 'em drop dead, you a killer
Shower you with all my attention
Yeah, these are my only intentions
Stay in the kitchen cookin' up, got your own bread
Heart full of equity, you're an asset
Make sure that you don't need no mentions
Yeah, these are my only intentions

[Outro]
Only intentions
That's all I plan to do

[Speech: Paul McCartney]
Sometimes I'd borrow a tape recorder and ?
And we sought of go around to my house and try record little things
I remember doing "Hallelujah, I Love Her So", cause I had the Eddie Cochran record *cough*
But those are very much home demos, very bad quality
Plus I think a couple of those two exist

[Intro]
Hey, yeah
La-da-da, da-da
La-da-da, da-da, la-da

[Verse 1]
La-da-da-da-da, here I go again
With another love song that I wasted
Just another love run out of patience
She don't want it, she don't need it
Every other word coming from my pen
She throw back in my face, saying, "Where you been?"
I sound so poetic, but it feels like I let it slip away, slip away

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna show my love is strong
Make her feel it when I'm home
No fakin', no mistakin'
She can feel me when I'm gone

[Chorus]
That actions speak louder than, speak louder than, speak louder than love songs
The melodies, they carry on
Actions speak louder than, speak louder than, speak louder than love songs
I've been doing it all wrong

[Verse 2]
La-da-da-da-da, here we go again
Just a couple of friends with some benefits
She gave me all of her love, then I waste it
I wrote a new song, then erased it
Oh, every other thing that I've said before
Said she don't wanna hear about it anymore
I feel so creative, but it feels like there's nothing left to say to make you stay

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna show my love is strong
Make her feel it when I'm home
No fakin', no mistakin'
She can feel it when I'm gone

[Chorus]
That actions speak louder than, speak louder than, speak louder than love songs
The melodies, they carry on
Actions speak louder than, speak louder than, speak louder than love songs
I've been doing it all wrong

[Bridge]
La-da-da-da-da, la-da-da-da away
La-da-da-da-da, la-da-da, all day
She don't wanna hear, don't wanna hear a word I say, word I say
La-da-da-da-da, la-da-da-da away
La-da-da-da-da, la-da-da, all day
She don't wanna hear, don't wanna hear a word I say, word I say

[Chorus]
Actions speak louder than love songs, speak louder than love songs
The melodies, they carry on
Actions speak louder than love, woah, speak louder than love songs
I've been doing it all wrong

[Intro]
Previously on Ready To Die

[Chorus: Drake]
Never had a lot, this is all I need
People never care 'til it's R.I.P. 
Niggas turned they back on me for no good reason
Loyalty is priceless and it's all I need
Can't burn a bridge just to light my way
Lotta '42 on the flights I'm takin'
Pourin' out my soul and it might sound crazy
Lotta fallin' outs help me build foundation
Never had a lot, this is all I need
People never care 'til it's R.I.P. 
Niggas turned they back on me for no good reason

[Verse 1: Drake]
Never had a lot, this is all I need
Lost individuals is all I see
Grab the top spot like "pardon my reach"
Woke up one day and it was all on me
If it comes down, it's gon' fall on me
Lotta '42 on the flights I'm takin'
Long way down from the heights I'm chasin'
Just touched down, I was lights out in Vegas
Girls checkin' in 'cause my lifestyle dangerous
Hard to tell people that I'm all out of favors
Call me for songs or they call me for paper
Turnin' off my phone for the night now, baby
Pourin' out my soul and it might sound crazy
Some of my niggas don't love me
We should sit down before shit turns ugly
We should sit down since you said things about me

[Chorus: Drake]
Never had a lot, this is all I need
People never care 'til it's R.I.P. 
Niggas turned they back on me for no good reason
Loyalty is priceless and it's all I need
Can't burn a bridge just to light my way
Lotta '42 on the flights I'm takin'
Pourin' out my soul and it might sound crazy
Lotta fallin' outs help me build foundation
Never had a lot, this is all I need
People never care 'til it's R.I.P. 
Niggas turned they back on me for no good reason

[Verse 2: JAY-Z]
Niggas wanted to kill me and y'all still with 'em
Nigga, y'all chill with 'em, and y'all wonder why we not friends?
Best thing I can do is not build with you
When I could destroy you, that takes some fuckin' discipline
I could send a team to come drill you
I got a billion or two and I know where the fuck you live
Niggas gotta chill with talking gangsta
You should just thank us, humble yourselves a little bit
This ain't the same Shawn that you knew once
I don't shine shoes, uh, this ain't what you want, no
All that back and forth on the internet
Nigga, we don't tennis that, y'all gotta do something, yeah
Only thing we 'spect now is violence
Anything besides this, we playing violins, uh
I'm public enemy
Niggas wanted to kill me and y'all want me to be friendly
Niggas want sympathy after they wanted to end me
Be those closest to it be the very ones that envy
Shout out to the family
I don't want no friends no more, not many understand me
Everybody want something
You know the price of everything but the value of nothing
But everybody want something
You know the price of everything but the value of nothing

[Chorus: Drake]
Never had a lot, this is all I need
People never care 'til it's R.I.P. 
Niggas turned they back on me for no good reason
Loyalty is priceless and it's all I need
Can't burn a bridge just to light my way
Lotta '42 on the flights I'm takin'
Pourin' out my soul and it might sound crazy
Lotta fallin' outs help me build foundation
Never had a lot, this is all I need
People never care 'til it's R.I.P. 
Niggas turned they back on me for no good reason

[Intro]
Yeah, nothin' bigger than the Umbrella
Yeah, yeah (Perfect)
Forever, you just gotta feel me, nigga
Lil Tory (Cannon)

[Verse]
Told my bitch, "I love her", she ain't say it back
My heart, I can't play with that
Fuck it, that's that, and we made it that
Runnin' through the trap to find my re-up, tryna make it back
BM trippin', I'm just tryna cop my son his favorite snacks
Love from the Crip, Bloods, and GDs
Scammin' out the bank, I made like fifty thou' on TD
In this trap, my homeboys my heart, but shit, I gotta move greedy
Got a budget for the lawyer case I lose with this PD (Perfect)
'Cause we tryna get more than rich, fuck the fame and all the glitz
My bitch ain't had tits, so I bought her tits
I'm a lil' older, so I mold her 'til I taught the bitch
Boy, I woulda swore that she was loyal 'til I caught the bitch
I won't trust a soul, it's just me and my pole, playin' position
On that road, watchin' jackboys close
Gun closer than the sirens, see if them boys try me
Bitch, I'm openin' the fire, catchin' bodies like corona in the virus, nigga
Weed bought the Rolex, crack bought the bussdown
Trappin' did a home run, scammin' did a touchdown
Thinkin' 'bout my son now, know I gotta stay alive
'Cause I done let him down like four times and I can't make it five
Cops from a naked eye, watchin' in a foreign
But we movin' neat, the DA can't grant them no warrants (Perfect)
The Birdman with me like Wayne in New Orleans
Rainin' and pourin', ragin' and warin'
Prolly lost my bitch to an athlete
Fuck it, I'ma pull up with another bitch, mad fleek
I remember Crystal done told me I was mad weak
From that day, I never let another bitch embarrass me (Perfect)
I had to wear the same drawers
Goin' out for weeks, a nigga stank, but this shit paid off
Flexin' like I own the rental, nigga, I had to play it off
Hoes I put this dick off in they hole just like I'm playin' golf
Anytime I ran up out of work I sold 'em drywall
I was broke and threw it on the scale 'cause I can't eyeball
Homie, I just came from bein' homeless, that's a sidebar
That's why with this rap shit I be focused, can't take time off
Boy, I'm not a killer, but don't push me, that's on my mama
'Cause my killers out there swimmin' in the deep end
'Fore he knew that nigga drowned 'cause he was deep in
Scoreboard, bitch, you playin' on the defense
My lil' niggas catchin' bodies every weekend
My lil' shooter made the movie with the sequence
Play with us and we gon' turn that nigga pretense
In the foreign, picked him up from out the precinct
'Cause he gon' still put in that pressure 'til the beef ends, ayy
I wanna cheat but I'll prolly kill her if she cheat on me
Homicidal thoughts don't mix with Gs on me
Plus I be with Gs, homie, stick hot like ninety-eight degrees on me
Trigger finger itchy like some fleas on me
Sleepin' on my nigga sofa, sleepin' on the floor
I couldn't even tell a bitch, "Come over"
Now it's all Dior all on my body like my melatonin
Niggas took the stand, I can't believe them boys were tellin' on me
Street shit is hella phony, yeah
Look in my eyes, you see I'm dodgin' all the demons
Came a long way from swipin' fraud cards at all the Neiman's (Perfect)
I was plottin' and schemin', poppin' bad beans and shit
I thought it, then dreamed it, turned it to reality
This a fatality, killin' any nigga sayin' he got the same style as me
I'm the only rapper sayin' shit with no apology
Pull up, you could holler, B
Your favorite rapper's shit just ain't as hot as me
Tory (Perfect)

[Outro]
Ayy, spittin' fire in the booth
Forgiato tires on the coupe
OGs lookin' at me like they inspired to be me, when I aspired to be you
It's crazy but it's true
Damn, yeah
90310 run this shit, you know what's goin' on, nigga
Big U, big Umbrella
Lyrics From Snippet

She don't think I see her (No)
'Cause I...

We know that we can fall in love tonight
...'cause I feel it
It's the moonlight

[...]
...in love with you

Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, uh

[Verse: Lupe Fiasco & Frank Ocean Sample]
Elegant dust falls like water off tall cliffs
What starts as icebergs and small drips
Gangs up in what you can call crips
(Human beings in a mob) Uh, yeah
(What's a mob to a king?
What's a king to a god?) What's that
(What's a god to a non-believer
Who don't believe in anything?) Uh-huh, uh-uh, let me get that
Blue seas, slipping like skis over the top like T's
Camouflage-colored, chamomile on the battlefield
I relax and chill, yeah
Dapper Dan daffodils
Two G's worth of recording gear to make reports for your ears
I'm a little teapot, short and stout
But I'm a little ski shop, sports and routes
(Human beings in a mob
What's a mob to a king?
What's a king to a god?
What's a god to a non-believer
Who don't believe in anything?)
Let me get that, 

[?] is double black diamond
Took that shop to a resort, now I'm shining
Don't get a bullet lodged
I'm just here to lift 'em up, I didn't duck
Figure the flow icy so get a puck
Go, go 

[?]

[?]homie is sick as fuck
Look at it closely, but do it anti-socially
It's a winter wonderland but it's toasty
Two slots I work with both days
Two shots, dapper pants
Niagara used to fall on my pair
Step outside, hear the voice of Creasy Bear
All up in the air like, "Yeah"
Shit's the bomb, come talk to the derrière
Take every care, go blind stare in that glare
The air, Kool-Aid and Perrier
Three cheers 'til they get him to cheer
I be blessed, sports and routes
I play with paths like Professor X
Me on IG, that means you can snort the house
Tokyo freeze, look all this powder about, ha

[Refrain]
Strongboi; strongboi
Strongboi; strongboi
Strongboi; strongboi
Strongboi; strongboi

[Verse 1]
Take it up with god
I'm just the messenger undressing her
Allowing her to love herself
Take herself off the shelf
Got a healthy appetite for what feels right
What a sight
Her tits out wet from a dip
Slipping into silk
As she starts to laugh like thunder
Dance, dance like water reflecting the sun
Run, run, run towards a new year
Hear, hear
I'm feeling fiery and full of what I need
To get me to sunrise

[Chorus]
Oh she left me seeing stars
Like I was hit on the head real fucking hard
I see you
Just remember that I feel you too
Love is simple, love is complicated
Am I ever really satiated?
I warned you
There's always better views
I'm tickled pink
But sometimes I feel blue
How can you possibly be see through
This tongue
It doesn't feel wrong
Deep warmth rising through my body
I'm high again and I feel a longing

[Bridge]
The 

[?] is changing
My pussy is ready
Je-Jesus

[Refrain]
Strongboi; strongboi
Strongboi; strongboi
Strongboi; strongboi
Strongboi; strongboi

[Verse 3]
Sharpen your claws, my girl
Learn to love your flaws, my girl
Don't listen to the laws that make you feel small, my girl
We're a waterfall
And we fall and we fall
But I'd rather fall than never try at all
Let me play
I'm a kid in many ways
I've got cheeky love for days
Just give me a taste
Trembling at the thought of your sweet face
I'll be loving with you once again
We send, we bend
Kissing my friends
The party never ends, let's do it again

[Chorus]
Oh she left me seeing stars
Like I was hit on the head real fucking hard
I see you
Just remember that I feel you too
Love is simple, love is complicated
Am I ever really satiated?
I warned you
There's always better views
I'm tickled pink
But sometimes I feel blue
How can you possibly be see through
This tongue
It doesn't feel wrong
Deep warmth rising through my body
I'm high again and I feel a longing

[Intro]
Ayo Jerm I need you to do me a favor real quick
Turn the beat up in my headphones a lil bit
This shit needs to knock a lil bit for me feel me
Ayo Cardo you keep hitting me with heat like this man
Ima have no choice but to kill it you feel me

[Verse 1]
Hey Hey I want a, bunch of bad broads, a couple fast cars
So high up in the air that I can grab mars
Got a bunch of miles in me like a gas card
King of the jungle bitch I'm Madagascar
Don't aggravate him cause I don't have the patience
Send you home early like a bad vacation
Fuck with hoes that been struck with infatuation
But I be on the road and have em waitin'
Escape from reality, life is just a fallacy
So we ride the clouds round skippin' through the galaxy
On the Millennium Falcon you see me travelin'
That's the type of shit to have you fallin' off the balance beam
Way to confusin' got they hearts movin'
Homie life is a game and you loosin'
Better start improvin', boy get your stats up
Cause my shit is gonna hit you like a mac truck bad luck

[Hook]
With my Polo button up and a starter cap
Keep my clothes real clean at the laundromat
H-Hit the hit the liquor store to get my medicine
I'm in a league of extraordinary gentlemen
With my Polo button up and a starter cap
Keep my clothes real clean at the laundromat
At the laundromat, a-at the at the laundromat
I keep my clothes real clean at the laundromat

[Verse 2]
I'm puffin' lala, they got me sittin' chillin' like gaga
You grillin' at the kid but I'm laughin', haha
Now that people know me, it's so hard to stay low-key
When every single motherfucker treat me like they homie
And every single lady tell me I'm they one and only
But I'm just coverin' my ground like a zone D
Before bed I use to pray to be fresh
Now everyday I just play it's recess
It's so nice, it feels awesome
I'm just tryna ball old school Kenny Loften
Caution, address me as your sergeant

[?]I got your girl undressed at the apartment
Jameson and Hennessy, shakey with my memory
Wakin' up next to a ho that don't remember me
Hey it's so nice to meet you, but now I gotta leave you

[Hook]
With my Polo button up and a starter cap
Keep my clothes real clean at the laundromat
H-Hit the hit the liquor store to get my medicine
I'm in a league of extraordinary gentlemen
With my Polo button up and a starter cap
Keep my clothes real clean at the laundromat
At the laundromat, a-at the at the laundromat
I keep my clothes real clean at the laundromat

She eyes me like a Pisces when I am weak
I've been locked inside your heart-shaped box for weeks
I've been drawn into your magnet tar pit trap
I wish I could eat your cancer when you turn black

Meat-eating orchids forgive no one just yet
Cut myself on angel hair and baby's breath
Broken hymen of 'Your Highness', I'm left black
Throw down your umbilical noose so I can climb right back

[Chorus]
Hey! Wait! I got a new complaint
Forever in debt to your priceless advice

[Intro: Kanye West]
And that's where you're wrong
And now for our feature presentation
Yo, what's up? This is Kanye West and you're checking out
Mick Boogie, Terry Urban  -
Life was on the beat
Welcome to the Graduate brought to you by the League Crew
This is an official League Crew presentation
Terry Urban, The League Crew

[Intro]
Flashing lights (lights, lights)
Flashing lights (lights, lights)
Flashing lights (lights, lights)
Flashing lights (lights, lights)

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
She don't believe in shootin' stars
But she believe in shoes and cars
Wood floors in the new apartment
Couture from the store's departments
You more like "love to start shit"
I'm more of the trips to Florida
Ordered the hors d'oeuvres, views of the water
Straight from a page of your favorite author
And the weather so breezy
Man, why can't life always be this easy?
She in the mirror dancin' so sleazy
I get a call like, "Where are you, Yeezy?"
And try to hit you with the ol-wu-wopte
'Til I got flashed by the paparazzi
Damn, these niggas got me
I hate these niggas more than the Nazis

[Hook: Dwele]
As I recall, I know you love to show off
But I never thought that you would take it this far
What do I know?
Flashing lights (lights, lights)
What do I know? Know
Flashing lights (lights, lights)

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
Fity
Up and down, she likes on top, facts
Praying that the condom pop, that fair
But fuck me so hood, to me
And Hollywood's been real real good to
Now who give a fuck if a bitch just ain't shit
In the whip, she gives CPR to my dick
You losing her baby, feeding em up quick
Bitch, roleplay, I'm getting really into this shit
In the telly on all fours, ride that like a horse
I'm screaming 'whoo-ha' to my boy Rick Ross
Call me 50, call me daddy, you can call me the boss
I dig Double XXL, you can call me the sauce
I can laugh at my performance and get that perfume
You supposed to be quick bitch, I kept on my shoes
Oh, you thought we had a love thing? No, you no fools
Don't listen to the dicept, its never ever true

[Outro: Kanye West]
At the end of the day I care, and I'd rather be hated for what I am than loved for what I am not. You know, I don't have media training and all that stuff. And and you know, even with all the backlash that I had, I feel like I should approach it, man. You live by the sword you die by the sword. You express yourself, I'm here to express myself and you know people gon understand me like yo its not a matter of understanding me like yo it being about me, it's not about me I'm just being passionate

[Produced by Kanye West]

[Chorus: Labi Siffre]
Its been so long
But now your here
Here to stay
And I wonder if you know
What it means, what it means
And I wonder if you know
What it means to find your dreams
And I wonder

[Verse 1: Kanye West & Labi Siffre]
I've been waiting on this my whole life
(And I wonder)
These dreams be waking me up at night (night, night)
(And I wonder)
You say I think I'm never wrong (wrong, wrong)
(And I wonder)
You know what? Maybe you're right (right, right)
A'ight?

[Chorus: Labi Siffre]
And I wonder if you know
What it means, what it means (Commissioner)
And I wonder if you know
What it means to find your dreams (Terry Urban)
And I wonder

[Verse 2: Kanye West & Labi Siffre]
And I'm back on my grind
A psychic read my lifeline
Told me in my lifetime
My name would help light up the Chicago skyline
And that's why I'm
(And I wonder)
Seven o'clock, that's primetime
Heaven'll watch, God calling from the hotlines
Why he keep giving me hot lines?
I'm a star, how could I not shine?
(And I wonder)
How many ladies in the house?
(If you know)
How many ladies in the house without a spouse?
(What it means)
Something in your blouse got me feeling so aroused
(What it means)
What you about?
(And I wonder)
On that independent shit
(If you know)
Trade it all for a husband and some kids
(What it means)
You ever wonder what it all really mean?
(To find your dreams come true)
You wonder if you'll ever find your dreams?

[Verse 3: Nas]
I woke up early on my born day, I'm 20
The essence of adolescence leaves my body. Now I'm 'feshing
My physical frame is celebrated cause I made it
One quarter through life so I'm like golly thank creatives. My rhymes
365 days, annual plus some, load up the mic and bust one
Cuss while bust from
My skull cause there's pain in brain, vein, money, maintain, don't go against the grain, simple and plain
When I was young, at this I used to do my thing, heart
Robbing foreigners take they wallets, take they jewels, and rip they hand cards
Took to the projects, flashing my quick cash, and got my first piece of hash smoking blunts with ash
Now it's all about cash and abundance N****s I used to run with is rich, doing years in the hundreds
I switch my role model, instead of saying "fuck tomorrow, that one dollar bottle could've struck the lotto" Once I
Stood on the block, loose cracks produce stacks, I cooked up because small kids used to get my loot back
Time is Illmatic, keep static like wove fabric, pack a four 'matic to pack your whole cabbage
I'm sure to fall
Fall in love
I'm sure to fall in love with you
You are so sweet
And so near
I'm sure to fall in love with you
So hold me tight
Let tonight be the night
Darling, don't ever let me go
Loving you
Is the natural thing to do
I want you for the rest of my life
So hold me tight
Let tonight be the night
Darling, don't ever let me go
Loving you
Is the natural thing to do
I want you for the rest of my life

[Part 1: Big Brother(Kanye West)]

[Intro]
Stadium status

[Hook]
My big brother was B.I.G.'s brother
Used to be Dame and Biggs' brother
Who was Hip Hop brother, who was No I.D. friend
No I.D. my mentor, now let the story begin

[Verse 1]
It's the Hard Knock Life Tour, sellout
Picture us in the mall, coppin' Iceberg and yell out "Jigga"
Yeah, that's what we'll yell out, yell out
You know the name do I gotta spell out or tell 'bout
J-A-Y, and 'Ye so shy
Now he won't even step to his idol to say hi
Standing there like a mime and let the chance pass by
Back of my mind, "He could change your life
With all these beats I did, at least let him hear it
At least you can brag to ya friends back at the gig"
But he got me out my momma crib
Then he help me get my momma a crib

[Hook]
Big brother was B.I.G.'s brother
Used to be Dame and Biggs' brother
Who was Hip Hop brother, who was No I.D. friend
No I.D. my mentor, now let the story begin, begin
Let the story begin
If you feel the way I feel why don't you wave your hands?

[Verse 2]
Fresh off the plane, I'm off to Baseline
Nothing handed out, I'm 'bout to take mine
'round the same time of that Blueprint 1
And these beats in my pocket was that blueprint for him
I'd play my little songs in that old back room
He'd bob his head and say "Damn! Oh, that's you?"
But by The Black Album, I was blacking out
Partyin' S.O.B.'s and we had packed a crowd
Big brother got his show up at Madison Square
And I'm like "Yeah, yeah, we gon' be there" but
Not only did I not get a chance to spit it
Carline told me I could buy two tickets
I guess big brother was thinkin' a little different
And kept little brother at bay, at a distance
But everything that I felt was more bogus
Only made me more focused, only wrote more potent
Only thing I wanna know is why I get looked over
I guess I'll understand when I get more older
Big brother saw me at the bottom of the totem
Now I'm on the top and everybody on the scrotum

[Hook]
My big brother was B.I.G.'s brother
Used to be Dame and Biggs' brother
Who was Hip Hop brother, who was No I.D. friend
No I.D. my mentor, now let the story begin, begin
Let the story begin
If you feel the way I feel why don't you wave your hands?

[Verse 3]
Have you ever walked in the shadow of a giant?
Not only a client, the Presidito, hola, Hovito
The game gettin' foul so here's a free throw
I was always on the other side of the peephole
Then I dropped "Jesus Walks" now I'm on the steeple
And we know, "New Jack City"—got to keep my brother
But to be number one I'ma beat my brother
On that "Diamonds" remix I swore I spazzed
I guess Beanie's style was more of a slam dunk
And my shit was more like a finger roll
But I had them singles though
And them hoes at the show gonna mingle, yo, heh, y'all know
I told Jay I did a song with Coldplay
Next thing I know he got a song with Coldplay
Back in my mind I'm like, "Damn, no way"
Translate, español: "No way, José"
Then I went and told Jay Brown
Shoulda known that was gonna come back around
Shoulda talked to you like a man, shoulda told you first
But I told somebody else and that's what made shit worse

[Bridge]
My big brother was B.I.G.'s brother
So here's a few words from ya kid brother
If you admire somebody you should go on 'head tell 'em
People never get the flowers while they can still smell 'em
A idol in my eyes, god of the game
Heart of the City, Roc-a-Fella chain
Never be the same, never be another
Number one, Young Hov, also my big brother
Big brother (x15)

[Part 2: Encore (Kanye West & Jay-Z)]

[Verse 4]
Now, can I get a encore? Do you want more?
Cookin' raw with the Brooklyn boy
So for one last time I need y'all to roar
Now what the hell are you waitin' for?
After me, there shall be no more
So for one last time, nigga, make some noise!

[Chorus]
When it comes to being true, at least true to me
One thing I've found, one thing I found
Oh no, you'll never let me down
Get up, I get down, get up, I get down
Get up, I get down, get up, I get down
Get up, I get down, get up, I get down

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Yo, first I snatched the streets, then I snatched the charts
First I had they ear, now I have they heart
Rappers came and went, I've been here from the start
I seen them put it together, watched them take it apart
Seen the Rovers roll up with ribbons
I seen them re-po'd, re-sold, then re-driven
So when I reload, he holds number one position
When you hot, I'm hot
And when your feet cold, mines is sizzling
It's plain to see, niggas can't fuck with me
'cause I'ma be that nigga for life
This is not an image, this is God-given
This is hard-livin', mixed with Cristal sippin'
It's the most consistent, Hov
Give you the most hits you can fit inside a whole disc and
Nigga I'm home on these charts, y'all niggas visitin'
It's Hov tradition, Jeff Gordon of rap
I'm back to claim pole position, holla at ya boy

[Chorus]
When it comes to being true, at least true to me
One thing I've found, one thing I found
Oh no, you'll never let me down
Get up, I get down, get up, I get down
Get up, I get down, get up, I get down
Get up, I get down, get up

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
I get down for my grandfather who took my mama
Made her sit in that seat where white folks ain't want us to eat
At the tender age of 6, she was arrested for the sit-ins
And with that in my blood, I was born to be different
Now niggas can't make it to ballots to choose leadership
But we can make it to Jacob's and to the dealership
That's why I hear new music and I just don't be feelin' it
Racism's still alive, they just be concealin' it
But I know they don't want me in the damn club
They even made me show ID to get inside of Sam's Club
I done did dirt and went to church to get my hands scrubbed
Swear I've been baptized 'least three or four times
But in the land where niggas praise Yukons and getting paid
It's gonna take a lot more than coupons to get us saved
Like it take a lot more than doo rags to get you waves
Nothing sad as that day my girl's father passed away
So I promised to Mr. Rainey I'm gonna marry your daughter
And you know I gotta thank you for the way that she was brought up
And I know that you were smiling when you see the car I bought her
You sent tears from heaven when you seen my car get balled up
But I can't complain what the accident did to my left eye
'Cause look what an accident did to Left Eye
First Aaliyah now Romeo must die
I know I got angels watching me from the other side

[Chorus]
When it comes to being true, at least true to me
One thing I've found, one thing I found
Oh no, you'll never let me down
Get up, I get down, get up, I get down
Get up, I get down, get up, I get down
Get up, I get down, get up, I get down

[Verse 4: Jay-Z and (Kanye West)]
Who else you know been hot this long?
(Oh yeah, we ain't finished)
Started from nothing but he got this strong
(The Roc is in the building)
Built the Roc from a pebble, peddled rock before I met you
Pedaled bikes, got my nephews pedal bikes because they special (Wooooo)
Let you tell it, man, I'm falling
Well, somebody must have caught him
'Cause every fourth quarter, I like to Mike Jordan them
Number one albums, what I got? Like four of them
More of them on the way, the eighth wonder on the way
Clear the way, I'm here to stay
Y'all can save the chitter chat, this and that
This is Jay, dissing Jay will get you maced
When I start spitting them lyrics niggas get very religious
Six Hail Marys, 'Please Father forgive us'
Young the archbishop, the Pope John Paul of y'all niggas
They way y'all all follow Jigga
Hov's a living legend and I'll tell you why
Everybody wanna be Hov and Hov's still alive

[Outro]
(Clapping and Cheering)
Hitting the stage right now to perform his new song called, big brother! Please show some love to, Kanye West!

[Verse 1]
Some other guy now, has taken my love away from me, oh now
Some other guy now, has taken away my sweet desire, oh now
Some other guy now, I just don't want to hold my hand, oh now
I'm the lonely one, as lonely as I can feel all right

[Verse 2]
Some other guy now, is sipping up the honey like a yellow dog, oh now
Some other guy now, has taken my love just like I'm gone, oh now
Some other guy now, has taken my love away from me, oh now
I'm the lonely one, as lonely as I can feel all right
Oh oh hoho
Oh yeah! Ow! Ow!

[Verse 3]
Some other guy, is making me very very mad, oh now
Some other guy now, is making my past seem oh so bad, oh now
Some other guy now, she was the first girl I ever had, oh now
I'm the lonely one, as lonely as I can feel all right
Oh oh hoho
I'm a-talking to you, right now
Ow!

[Outro]
Hey! Yeah!

[Intro: Jacob Collier]
Get it

[Verse 1: Jacob Collier]
There's a funky feeling in my bones, in my bones
In my bones, I got that funky feeling
I don't want to feel it on my own, on my own
What-a-do

[Verse 2: Jacob Collier]
There's a constant tapping in my toes, in my toes
In my toes, I get this tapping feeling
I got to tell you something I don't know, I don't know
What-a-do

[Pre-Chorus: Jacob Collier]
If there's a thing you wanna get right
Then now's the time to get that funky feeling right
If there's a thing you wanna get right
Then get the boogie in your bones all through the night
Play it, boy!

[Chorus: Jacob Collier & Kimbra]
(Be my rush, be my crush, be my fantasy)
Hoo!
(Get my blush, feel my touch, baby, you can see)

[Verse 3: Kimbra with Jacob Collier, Jacob Collier]
There's a pressing question on your lips, on your hips
On your lips, you got some kind of question
Like you got something to say? Ha-ha-ha
It's a question I could answer with some
With some kiss, what-a-do
Ba-ba, ba-ba, ba-ba
Woo! (Absolutely)

[Verse 4: Kimbra with Jacob Collier]
There's a kind of magic in your smile, in your smile
In your smile, I found some kind of magic (Ow!)
Kinda thing I want to stay a while, stay a while
What-a-do
Ba-ba, ba-ba, ba-ba, ba

[Pre-Chorus: Jacob Collier with Kimbra, Kimbra]
If there's a thing (If there's a thing)
You wanna get right (You wanna get right) (Ow!)
Then now's the time to get that funky feeling right ('Cause you can feel alright)
If there's a thing (If there's a thing)
You wanna get right (You wanna get right)
Then get the boogie in your bones all through the night (Boogie, boogie)
Play it, boy!
Now I got this feeling in my

[Chorus: Jacob Collier & Kimbra]
Be my rush, be my crush, be my fantasy
Get my blush, feel my touch, baby, you can see
Now's the time to get that funky feeling on me
So use it up, wear it out, oh
Now I got this feeling in my

Get my blush (My blush), feel my touch, baby, you can see
Now's the time to get that funky feeling on me
So use it up, wear it out, oh

[Verse 5: Jacob Collier]
I been obsessin' 'bout the present
Ever since I adolescent
Down the edge of Queen and Crescent
And you got me incandescent
'Cause now you got me guessin'
If it's me you love or Djesse
Do you wanna make me crazy or what?
Uh-uh-uh
And you don't know nothing of my struggle
You think I'm in a bubble
And I ain't got nothing to say
I ain't got nothing to say
No way, not today
So come again another day

[Verse 6: Tarriona “Tank” Ball]
I'm speaking Spanish, English, Mandarin
Lil' french for the boujee hoes in mansions
Reach in, gotta fish for the compliments
Missing is a whole lot of baggage
Messing with me is tragic
You a whole fan bandwagon
Black girl, black girl magic
Hey, hey, hey, what's happenin'?

[Verse 7: Jacob Collier & Kimbra]
I'd never expect you to realise you're free
The powers that be are just the powers you see around you
Only as powerful as the truth you've told
Every span of concentration in the idea cultivation
Every adding decoration to the shores of deprivation

[Verse 8: Jacob Collier & Kimbra]
I'd never expect you to realise you're free
The powers that be are just the powers you see around you
Only as powerful as the truth you've told
(No more imitation, be my inspiration
Find a meditation, tintinnabulation)

[Chorus: Jacob Collier & Kimbra]
Be my rush, be my crush, be my fantasy
Get my blush, feel my touch, baby, you can see
Now's the time to get that funky feeling on me
So use it up, wear it out, oh
Now I got this feeling in my
Hoo!

[Chorus: Jacob Collier with Kimbra, Kimbra]
Be my rush, be my crush, be my fantasy
Get my blush (My blush), feel my touch, baby, you can see
Now's the time to get that funky feeling on me
So use it up, wear it out
Use it up, wear it out
Use it up, wear it out, oh
Now I got this feeling in
Now I got this feeling
Now I got this funky feeling in my
Bones

Young blood, ah young blood, young blood
I can't get you out of my mind

Things went bad, I met her dad
He said, "You'd better leave my daughter alone"
Ow!

[Verse 4]
Well I tried to speak but I just stuttered (Yip yip boom)
I saw the rising of the sun (Yip yip boom)
And all along my heart was falling
While you're the one, you're the one
While you're the one, ah you're the one
Young blood, oh young blood, yeah young blood
I can’t get you out of my mind
Yeah young blood, oh young blood, yeah young blood
I can’t get you out of my mind

Well, if your hands start a-clapping
And your fingers start a-popping
And your feet start a-moving around

And if you start to swing and sway

A real cool way out sound

And if you get to can't help it
And you can't sit down
You feel like you gotta move a round

[John] It's from the form up a third at Hemel Hempstead

[Rodney] Oh!

[John] It says, "Dear George, John, Ringo, Paul, here's hoping that you'll please us all
A beauty song and swinging voice, we leave it up to you, the choice
We think you're fab and really cool, so brighten up our lads at school"
Dig this, for here's Paul, whistling "Clarabella"

[Verse]
Yeah
I'm going to sit right down and cry over you
I'm going to sit right down and cry over you
And if you ever say goodbye
And if you ever even try
I'm going to sit right down and cry over you

I'm going to love you more and more every day
I'm going to love you more and more every day
And if you ever say goodbye
And if you ever even try
I'm going to sit right down and cry over you

[Pre-Chorus]
Going to tell your mama
Tell your papa, too
So they'll know exactly
Just what I'm going to do

[Chorus]
If you ever say goodbye
If you ever even try
I'm going to sit right down and cry over you
Oh, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Brian Matthew] But despite the fact that the next request comes from Anton, 32 Perry Road, Sherwood, in Nottingham, it's headed "Up the Pool" and starts, "Dear Wack!" So, John, you take it from there

[John] "Dear Wack! Please, ask those gorgeous lads (hee hee) called the Beatles (buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh) to sing You Really Got a Hold on Me for Di, Gus, Vizz, and me, also for the Beatles themselves, especially Paul, ha, and everybody that was in the Roy Orbison Tour. I'm a regular listener of Pop Go The Beatles, good lad-if you're a lad, and please, tell the boys that all the girls in our office think it is a fab show. Thank you."

[Brian] All right, oh, stop the band. Whoa, that's splendid and now, what are you gonna sing for us?

I dream of your first kiss, and then
I feel upon my lips again
A taste of honey (A taste of honey)
Tasting much sweeter than wine

[Bridge]
I will return, yes I will return
I'll come back for the honey and you

Yours was the kiss that awoke my heart
There lingers still, though we're far apart
A taste of honey (A taste of honey)
Tasting much sweeter than wine

[Intro: Paul McCartney]
1, 2, 3, 4!

[Verse 1: Paul McCartney, Paul McCartney & John Lennon]
Well, she was just 17, if you know what I mean
And the way she looked was way beyond compare
So how could I dance with another (Ooh)
When I saw her standing there?

[Verse 2: Paul McCartney, Paul McCartney & John Lennon]
Well, she looked at me, and I, I could see
That before too long, I'd fall in love with her
She wouldn't dance with another (Woo)
When I saw her standing there

[Bridge: Paul McCartney & John Lennon]
Well, my heart went "boom" when I crossed that room
And I held her hand in mine

[Verse 3: Paul McCartney, Paul McCartney & John Lennon]
Well, we danced through the night, and we held each other tight
And before too long, I fell in love with her
Now, I'll never dance with another (Woo)
Since I saw her standing there

[Guitar Solo: George Harrison]

[Bridge: Paul McCartney & John Lennon]
Well, my heart went "boom"
When I crossed that room
And I held her hand in mine

[Verse 3: Paul McCartney, Paul McCartney & John Lennon]
Oh, we danced through the night, and we held each other tight
And before too long, I fell in love with her
Now I'll never dance with another (Woo)
Since I saw her standing there

[Outro: Paul McCartney & John Lennon]
Oh, since I saw her standing there
Yeah, well, since I saw her standing there
I never knew that a day like today lay before us
I’ve got the sun in my heart and my heart’s in the sun
Skies are as bright as your eyes
The horizon is open
Love is the ceiling
Feelings are reeling
Free as the air

Forever on and forever
Forever on side by side
Who ever knew that we two could be free as we’d fancy?
Fancy is free
But are we who are bound to each other by love?
To each other by love
Who ever knew that we two could be free as we’d fancy?
Fancy is free
But are we who are bound to each other by love?
To each other by love
To each other by love
To each other by love

[Verse 1]
Turn off your mind, relax and float downstream
It is not dying, it is not dying

[Verse 2]
Lay down all thoughts, surrender to the void
It is shining, it is shining

[Verse 3]
That you may see the meaning of within
It is being, it is being

[Instrument Break]

[Verse 4]
That love is all and love is everyone
It is knowing, it is knowing

[Verse 5]
That ignorance and hate may mourn the dead
It is believing, it is believing

[Verse 6]
But listen to the colour of your dreams
It is not living, it is not living

[Outro]
Or play the game "Existence" to the end
Of the beginning, of the beginning
Of the beginning, of the beginning
Of the beginning, of the beginning

[Verse 1]
If you're listening to this song
You may think the chords are going wrong
But they're not
I just wrote it like that

[Verse 2]
When you listen late at night
You may feel the words are not quite right
But they are
I just wrote them myself

[Chorus 1]
And it doesn't really matter what chords I play
What words I say or time of day it is
As it's only a Northern song

[Instrumental Verse]

[Chorus 2]
It doesn't really matter what clothes I wear
Or how I fare or if my hair is brown
When it's only a Northern song

[Verse 3]
If you think the harmony
Is a little off and out of key
Then you're right
'Cause I sing it myself

[Instrumental Chorus]

[Outro]

[Verse 1]
Baby's good to me, you know
She's happy as can be, you know
She said so
I'm in love with her and I feel fine

[Verse 2]
Baby says she's mine, you know
She tells me all the time, you know
She said so
I'm in love with her and I feel fine

[Chorus]
I'm so glad that she's my little girl
She's so glad, she's telling all the world

[Verse 3]
That her baby buys her things, you know
He buys her diamond rings, you know
She said so
She's in love with me and I feel fine (Yeah)
Mmm

[Verse 4]
Baby says she's mine, you know
She tells me all the time, you know
She said so
I'm in love with her and I feel fine (Yeah)

She's so glad, she's telling all the world

[Outro]
That her baby buys her things, you know
He buys her diamond rings, you know
She said so
She's in love with me and I feel fine
She's in love with me and I feel fine
Mmm

[Verse 1]
I think I'm going to be sad, I think it's today, yeah
The girl that's driving me mad is going away

[Chorus]
She's got a ticket to ride
She's got a ticket to ride
She's got a ticket to ride but she don't care

[Verse 2]
She said that living with me is bringing her down, yeah
She would never be free when I was around

[Chorus]
She's got a ticket to ride
She's got a ticket to ride
She's got a ticket to ride but she don't care

[Bridge]
I don't know why she's riding so high
She ought to think twice, she ought to do right by me
Before she gets to saying goodbye
She ought to think twice, she ought to do right by me

[Verse 3]
I think I'm going to be sad, I think it's today, yeah
The girl that's driving me mad is going away, yeah

[Chorus]
Oh, she's got a ticket to ride
She's got a ticket to ride
She's got a ticket to ride but she don't care

Yesterday
All my troubles seemed so far away
Now it looks as though they're here to stay
Oh, I believe in yesterday

[Verse 2]
Suddenly
I'm not half the man I used to be
There's a shadow hanging over me
Oh, yesterday came suddenly

[Chorus]
Why she had to go
I don't know, she wouldn't say
I said something wrong
Now I long for yesterday

[Verse 3]
Yesterday
Love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh, I believe in yesterday

[Chorus]
Why she had to go
I don't know, she wouldn't say
I said something wrong
Now I long for yesterday

[Verse 4]
Yesterday
Love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh, I believe in yesterday

[Outro]
Mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm, hmm-hmm

[Intro]
(Help!) I need somebody
(Help!) Not just anybody
(Help!) You know I need someone
(Help!)

[Verse 1]
When I was younger so much younger than today
I never needed anybody's help in any way
But now these days are gone, I'm not so self assured
Now I find I've changed my mind and opened up the doors

[Chorus]
Help me if you can, I'm feeling down
And I do appreciate you being 'round
Help me get my feet back on the ground
Won't you please, please help me?

[Verse 2]
And now my life has changed in oh so many ways
My independence seems to vanish in the haze
But every now and then I feel so insecure
I know that I just need you like I've never done before

[Chorus]
Help me if you can, I'm feeling down
And I do appreciate you being 'round
Help me get my feet back on the ground
Won't you please, please help me?

[Verse 1]
When I was younger, so much younger than today
I never needed anybody's help in any way
But now these days are gone, I'm not so self assured
Now I find I've changed my mind and opened up the doors

[Chorus]
Help me if you can, I'm feeling down
And I do appreciate you being 'round
Help me get my feet back on the ground
Won't you please, please help me?
Help me? Help me? Ooh

[Verse 1]
Well they took some honey from a tree
Dressed it up and they called it me

[Chorus]
Everybody's trying to be my baby
Everybody's trying to be my baby
Everybody's trying to be my baby, now

[Verse 2]
Woke up last night, half past four
Fifty women knocking on my door

[Chorus]
Everybody's trying to be my baby
Everybody's trying to be my baby
Everybody's trying to be my baby, now

[Verse 3]
Went out last night, I didn't stay late
Before I got home I had nineteen dates

[Chorus]
Everybody's trying to be my baby
Everybody's trying to be my baby
Everybody's trying to be my baby, now

[Verse 4/3]
Went out last night, I didn't stay late

Well they took some honey from a tree
Dressed it up and they called it me

[Chorus]
Everybody's trying to be my baby
Everybody's trying to be my baby
Everybody's trying to be my baby, now

[Verse 1]
I once had a girl
Or should I say, she once had me?
She showed me her room
"Isn't it good, Norwegian wood?"

[Bridge 1]
She asked me to stay and she told me to sit anywhere
So I looked around and I noticed there wasn't a chair

[Verse 2]
I sat on the rug
Drinking her wine, biding me time
We talked until two
And then she said, "It's time for bed"

[Bridge 2]
She told me she worked in the morning and started to laugh
I told her I didn't and crawled off to sleep in the bath

[Verse 3]
And when I awoke
I was alone, this bird had flown
So I lit a fire
Isn't it good, Norwegian wood?

[Verse 1]
I'm looking through you, where did you go?
I thought I knew you, what did I know?
You don't look different, but you have changed
I'm looking through you, you're not the same

[Verse 2]
Your lips are moving, I cannot hear
Your voice is soothing, but the words aren't clear
You don't sound different, I've learned the game
I'm looking through you, you're not the same

[Bridge]
Why, tell me why, did you not treat me right?
Love has a nasty habit of disappearing overnight

[Verse 3]
You're thinking of me, the same old way
You were above me, but not today
The only difference is you're down there
I'm looking through you, and you're nowhere

[Bridge]
Why, tell me why, did you not treat me right?
Love has a nasty habit of disappearing overnight

[Verse 4]
I'm looking through you, where did you go?
I thought I knew you, what did I know?
You don't look different, but you have changed
I'm looking through you, you're not the same

[Outro]
Yeah, oh, baby, you've changed
Ah, I'm looking through you
Yeah, I'm looking through you
You changed, you changed, you changed, you changed

[Verse 1]
I was alone, I took a ride
I didn't know what I would find there
Another road where maybe I
Could see another kind of mind there
Ooh, then I suddenly see you (Ah-ahh)
Ooh, did I tell you I need you
Every single day of my life?

[Verse 2]
You didn't run, you didn't lie
You knew I wanted just to hold you (Ah-ahh, ah-ahh)
And had you gone, you knew in time
We'd meet again, for I had told you (Ah-ahh, ah-ahh)
Ooh, you were meant to be near me (Ah-ahh)
Ooh, and I want you to hear me
Say we'll be together every day

[Refrain]
Got to get you into my life
Somehow, some way

[Verse 3]
What can I do, what can I be?
When I'm with you I want to stay there (Ah-ahh, ah-ahh)
If I'm true, I'll never leave
And if I do, I know the way there (Ah-ahh, ah-ahh)
Ooh, then I suddenly see you (Mhmm-mm)
Ooh, did I tell you I need you (Mhmm)
Every single day of my life

[Refrain]
Got to get you into my life
Somehow, some way

You tell me that you've got everything you want

And your bird can sing
But you don't get me

You say you've seen seven wonders

[Laughing] (When your prized possessions)
Start to weigh you down
Look in my direction
I'll be 'round, I'll be 'round

You tell me that you've heard every sound there is
And your bird can swing
But you can't hear me
You can't hear m—

[Chorus 2]
When your bike is broken
Will it bring you down?
You may be awoken

I'll be 'round, I'll be 'round

Should five percent appear too small
Be thankful I don't take it all

If you take a walk, walk, I'll tax your feet

[Bridge]
Taxman

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm the taxman
Yeah, I'm the taxman

[Verse 4]
Don't ask me what I want it for
(Anybody got a bit of money, anybody got a bit of money, anybody got a bit of money?)
If you don't want to pay some more
(Anybody got a bit of money, anybody got a bit of money, anybody got a bit of money?)

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm the taxman
Yeah, I'm the taxman

"I'm Only Sleeping," take one

[Verse 1: John Lennon & (Paul McCartney)]
When I wake up early in the morning
Lift my head, I'm still yawning
When I'm in the middle of a dream
Stay in bed, float up stream (Float up stream)

[Chorus: John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
Please, don't wake me, no, don't shake me
Leave me where I am, I'm only sleeping

[Verse 2: John Lennon & (Paul McCartney)]
Everybody seems to think I'm lazy
I don't mind, I think they're crazy
Running everywhere at such a speed
Till they find there's no need (There's no need)

[Chorus: John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
Please, don't spoil my day, I'm miles away
And after all, I'm only sleeping

[Bridge: John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
Keeping an eye on the world going by my window
Taking my time

[Verse 3]
Lying there and staring at the ceiling
Waiting for a sleepy feeling

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus: John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
Please, don't spoil my day, I'm miles away
And after all, I'm only sleeping

[Bridge: John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
Keeping an eye on the world going by my window
Taking my time

[Verse 4: John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
When I wake up early in the morning
Lift my head, I'm still yawning
When I'm in the middle of a dream
Stay in bed, float up stream

[Chorus: John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
Please, don't wake me, no, don't shake me
Leave me where I am, I'm only sleeping

[Chorus]
Just let me hear some of that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a backbeat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock and roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

[Verse 1]
I have no kick against modern jazz
Unless they try to play it too darn fast
And change the beauty of the melody
Until they sound just like a symphony

[Chorus]
That's why I go for that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a backbeat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock and roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

[Verse 2]
I took my loved one over across the tracks
So she can hear my man a-wail a sax
I must admit they have a rockin' band
Man they were blowing like a hurricane

[Chorus]
That's why I go for that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a backbeat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock and roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

[Verse 3]
Way down South they gave a jubilee
The jokey folks they had a jamboree
They're drinking home brew from a wooden cup
The folks dancing got all shook up

[Chorus]
And started playing that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a backbeat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock and roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

[Verse 4]
Don't care to hear 'em play a tango
Ain't in the mood to take a mambo
It's way too early for the congo
So keep a rockin' that piano

[Chorus]
So I can hear some of that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a backbeat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock and roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

[Verse 1]
My love don't give me presents
I know that she's no peasant
Only ever has to give me
Love forever and forever
My love don't give me presents
Turn me on when I get lonely
People tell me that she's only
Fooling, I know she isn't

[Verse 2]
She don't give the boys the eye
She hates to see me cry
She is happy just to hear me say
That I will never leave her
She don't give boys the eye
She will never make me jealous
Gives me all her time as well as
Loving, don't ask me why

[Bridge]
She's a woman who understands
She's a woman who loves her man

[Verse 1]
My love don't give me presents
I know that she's no peasant
Only ever has to give me
Love forever and forever
My love don't give me presents
Turn me on when I get lonely
People tell me that she's only
Fooling, I know she isn't

[Guitar solo]

[Bridge]
She's a woman who understands
She's a woman who loves her man

[Verse 1]
My love don't give me presents
I know that she's no peasant
Only ever has to give me
Love forever and forever
My love don't give me presents
Turn me on when I get lonely
People tell me that she's only
Fooling, I know she isn't

[Outro]
She's a woman
She's a woman
She's a woman
She's a woman
She's a woman

[Verse 1 Attempt]
No one I think is in my tree
I mean it must be high or low
That is you can't, you know, tune in

Cannot do it, I cannot do it

[Verse 1]
No one I think is in my tree
I mean it must be high or low
That is you can't, you know, tune in, but it's all alright
That is I think it's not too bad

[Verse 2]
Always, no, sometimes think it's me
But you know I know when it's a dream
I mean I think a "no", a "yes"
But it's all wrong
That is I think I disagree

[Chorus]
Let me take you back, 'cause I'm going to
Strawberry Fields
Nothing is real, and nothing to get hung about
Strawberry Fields forever
Strawberry Fields forever
Strawberry Fields forever

[Spoken Intro: John Lennon]
"Dub the mic on the piano quite low this
Just keeping it like maracas, you know
You know those old pianos"

"Ok, we're on"

"Sugarplum fairy, sugarplum fairy"

I read the news today, oh boy
About a lucky man who made the grade
And though the news was rather sad
Well, I just had to laugh
I saw the photograph

He blew his mind out in a car
He didn't notice that the lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
They'd seen his face before
Nobody was really sure if he was from the House of Lords
I saw a film today, oh boy
The English Army had just won the war
A crowd of people turned away
But I just had to look
Having read the book
I'd love to turn you on

"Five, six, seven, eight, nine
Ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen
Fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen, nineteen
Twenty"

Woke up, fell out of bed
Dragged a comb across my head
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup
And looking up I noticed I was late
Found my coat and grabbed my hat
Made the bus in seconds flat
Made my way upstairs and had a smoke
And everybody spoke and I went into a dream

"Oh shit"

I read the news today, oh boy
Four thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire
And though the holes were rather small
They had to count them all
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall
I'd love to turn you
"See the worst thing about doing this
Doing something like this
Is I think that at first people sort of are a bit suspicious
'You know, come on, what are you up to?'

[Verse 1]
I am he as you are he as you are me and we are all together
See how they run like pigs from a gun, see how they fly
I'm crying

[Verse 2]
Sitting on a cornflake, waiting for the van to come
Corporation tee-shirt, stupid bloody Tuesday
Man, you've been a naughty boy, you let your face grow long

[Chorus]
I am the egg man, they are the egg men
I am the walrus, goo goo g'joob

[Verse 3]
Mister City policeman sitting, pretty little policemen in a row
See how they fly like Lucy in the sky, see how they run
I'm crying, I'm crying
I'm crying, I'm crying

[Verse 4]
Yellow-matter custard dripping from a dead dog's eye
Crabalocker fishwife, pornographic priestess
Boy, you've been a naughty girl, you let your knickers down

[Chorus]
I am the egg man, they are the egg men
I am the walrus, goo goo g'joob

[Bridge]
Sitting in an English garden waiting for the sun
If the sun don't come, you get a tan
From standing in the English rain

[Chorus]
I am the egg man
They are the egg men (A poor man, made tame to fortune's) blowsoo goo joob (Good pity)
G'goo goo g'joob

[Verse 5]
Expert, textpert, choking smokers, don't you think the joker laughs at you?
(Ho ho ho, hee hee hee, ha ha ha)
See how they smile like pigs in a sty, see how they snide
I'm crying

[Verse 6]
Semolina pilchard climbing up the Eiffel Tower
Elementary penguin singing Hare Krishna
Man, you should have seen them kicking Edgar Allan Poe

[Chorus]
I am the egg man, they are the egg men
I am the walrus, goo goo g'joob g'goo goo g'joob
Goo goo g'joob g'goo goo g'joob, g'goo
Joob! Joob! Joob!
Do you want us to do it again, George?
Okay
With ciggy in mouth

[Intro]
Let's all get up and

[Verse 1]
Let's all get up and dance to a song
That was a hit before your mother was born
Though she was born a long, long time ago
Your mother should know
Your mother should know
Sing it again
Let's all get up and dance to a song
That was a hit before your mother was born
Though she was born a long, long time ago
Your mother should know
Your mother should know

[Bridge]

[Verse 2]
Lift up your hearts and sing me a song
That was a hit before your mother was born
Though she was born a long, long time ago
Your mother should know
Your mother should know
Your mother should know

[Bridge]

[Verse 3]

[Intro: Instrumental]

[Verse 1: Paul McCartney]
Lady Madonna, children at your feet
Wonder how you manage to make ends meet
Who finds the money when you pay the rent?
Did you think that money was heaven sent?

[Bridge 1: Paul McCartney]
Friday night arrives without a suitcase
Sunday morning creeping like a nun
Monday's child has learned to tie his bootlace
See how they run

[Verse 2: Paul McCartney]
Lady Madonna, baby at your breast
Wonders how you manage to feed the rest

[Bridge 2: Paul McCartney]

[Tenor Saxophone Solo: Ronnie Scott]
See how they run

[Verse 3: Paul McCartney]
Lady Madonna lying on the bed
Listen to the music playing in your head
See how they run

[Verse 4: Paul McCartney]
Lady Madonna, children at your feet
Wonder how you manage to make ends meet

[Outro: Instrumental]

[Verse 1: John Lennon]
Words are flowing out like endless rain into a paper cup
They slither while they pass, they slip away across the universe
Pools of sorrow, waves of joy are drifting through my opened mind
Possessing and caressing me

[Chorus: John Lennon]
Jai Guru Deva, Om
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world

[Verse 2: John Lennon]
Images of broken light which dance before me like a million eyes
They call me on and on across the universe
Thoughts meander like a restless wind inside a letter box
They tumble blindly as they make their way across the universe

[Chorus: John Lennon]
Jai Guru Deva, Om
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world

[Verse 3: John Lennon]
Sounds of laughter, shades of life are ringing through my open ears
Inciting and inviting me
Limitless undying love which shines around me like a million suns
It calls me on and on across the universe

[Chorus: John Lennon]
Jai Guru Deva, Om
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world

[Outro: John Lennon]
Jai Guru Deva
Jai Guru Deva
Jai Guru Deva
Lyrics from snippet

Yuh, yuh

[?] I can see that shit in your eyes
If only you saw it on that bitch one time
Got 'em straight out of stray, bitch you know the fives
And she tell me she love me, I'm one of a kind
The best didn't come out even in my prime
Shawty be on or shawty be slime
And a lot of them have aspiring sides
I remember when they would push me to the side
Oh I made it off the sidelines
I wanna ball like uncle Wayne
They think it's sweet, they want a piece of my advice

Check ignition (One) and may God's love (Lift off) be with you

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 2]
This is Ground Control to Major Tom
You've really made the grade
And the papers want to know whose shirt you wear
Now it's time to leave the capsule if you dare
This is Major Tom to Ground Control
I'm stepping through the door
And I'm floating in a most peculiar way
And the stars look very different today

[Chorus]
For here am I sitting in my tin can
Far above the world
Planet Earth is blue
And there's nothing I can do

[Verse 3]
Though I'm past 100,000 miles
I'm feeling very still
And I think my spaceship knows which way to go
Tell my wife I love her very much
She knows
Ground Control to Major Tom
Your circuit's dead, there's something wrong
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you

[Chorus]
Here am I floating 'round my tin can
Far above the moon
Planet Earth is blue
And there's nothing I can do

One of those nights where everything goes
Everybody goes through something

And you don't give a fuck what they all say, right?
Awesome, the Christian in Christian Dior
Damn, they don't make 'em like this anymore
I ask, cause I'm not sure
Do anybody make real shit anymore?
Bow in the presence of greatness
Cause right now thou hast forsaken us
You should be honored by my lateness
That I would even show up to this fake shit
So go ahead, go nuts, go apeshit
'Specially in my Pastel, on my Bape shit
Act like you can't tell who made this
New Gospel homie, take 6, and take this, haters

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I don't know if you got a man or not
If you made plans or not
If God put me in ya plans or not
I'm tripping, this drink got me saying a lot
But I know that God put you in front of me
So how the hell could you front on me?
There's a thousand yous, there's only one of me
I'm tripping, I'm caught up in the moment, right?
Cause it's Louis Vuitton Don night
So we gon' do everything that Kan like
Heard they'd do anything for a Klondike
Well, I'd do anything for a blonde dyke
And she'll do anything for the limelight
And we'll do anything when the time's right
Uh, baby you're makin' it
(Harder, better, faster, stronger)

Two words, no guns, break arms

[Intro: Zack de la Rocha]
Come with it now!
Come with it now!

[Verse 1]
The microphone explodes, shattering the mold
Either drop the hits like de la O or get the fuck off the commode
With the sure shot, sure to make the bodies drop
Drop and don't copy, yo, don't call this a co-op
Terror rains drenchin', quenchin' the thirst
Of the power dons, that five-sided Fistagon
The rotten sore on the face of Mother Earth gets bigger
The trigger’s cold, empty your purse

[Chorus]
Rally 'round the family with a pocket full of shells
They rally 'round the family with a pocket full of shells
They rally 'round the family with a pocket full of shells
They rally 'round the family with a pocket full of shells

[Verse 2]
Weapons, not food, not homes, not shoes
Not need, just feed the war, cannibal animal
I walk the corner to the rubble, that used to be a library
Line up to the mind cemetery, now
What we don't know keeps the contracts alive and movin'
They don't gotta burn the books, they just remove 'em
While arms warehouses fill as quick as the cells
Rally round the family, pockets full of shells

[Chorus]
Rally 'round the family with a pocket full of shells
They rally 'round the family with a pocket full of shells
They rally 'round the family with a pocket full of shells
They rally 'round the family with a pocket full of shells

Y'all been eatin' long enough now, stop bein' greedy
Just keep it real, partner, give to the needy
Ribs is touchin', so don't make me wait
Fuck around and I'm gon' bite you and snatch the plate

[Verse 1]
I could flip that flow, I could stick that ho
I could get that dough, you know I'm with that, yo
Ain't a thing about the shit I came through I haven't seen
But when it gets dark, it's like a nigga's havin' dreams
Or nightmares, the light dares to desert me
Got me like everybody wants to hurt me
Paranoid, so I strike out at whatever
The closest thing to me is gonna get it, but never
Will I kill, I think death is wrong
So I'ma keep holdin' on 'til what's left is gone
You could put that on my nigga Boom
These other rap cats will give a nigga room
But if it calls for me to force my way in the door
Headhuntin' motherfuckas, stay on the floor
4-4, that's what I get sick with (Grrrrrrr)
Four more, now all this is liquid (Grrrrrr)

[Hook]
Y'all been eatin' long enough now, stop bein' greedy
Just keep it real, partner, give to the needy
Ribs is touchin', so don't make me wait
Fuck around and I'm gon' bite you and snatch the plate

[Verse 2]
I thank the Lord everyday that I'm blessed with a gift
I'm the best, so unless you wanna rest with the stiff
Don't touch that, uh-uh, leave it alone
When you walk pass the doghouse, leave it a bone
Dogs bite, dogs fight, dogs knife
Scratch, shake, and hold all night
So when you hear the arf arf, start runnin'
'Cause when you hear the arf arf, I'm comin'
But I don't like drama, so I stay to myself
Keep focus with this rap shit and pray for the wealth
I want the money, just give me the honeys with big asses
The most expensive champagne you got in big glasses
I'm broke so I'ma bash his head wide open
Beggin' me to stop, but at least he died hopin'
Didn't get his wish, and now he's a dish for the pack
Two glowin' red eyes, everything else is black

[Hook x2]
Y'all been eatin' long enough now, stop bein' greedy
Just keep it real, partner, give to the needy
Ribs is touchin', so don't make me wait
Fuck around and I'm gon' bite you and snatch the plate

[Verse 3]
When the sun is up, the gun is up on the shelf
And all the runners up are thankin' me for their help
Hopin' that they not around when it gets dark outside
When the sun's goin' down, you hear the bark outside
Locks off the cage, gauge with the buck shots
Faggot, you've been lucky all day, that's when your luck stops
One drops, then another and another
Gun pops, goin' through you and your mother
When does it all end? I found a friend in a dog
'Cause fuckin' with these cats will send a friend to the morgue
Many questions, no answers, just stress
Try to hold my head and remember that I'm blessed
With the curse and it gets worse as time goes by
Can't see straight 'cause I'm so high
Why ask why when you know?
Nigga, when it's your time to go, you go

[Hook]
Y'all been eatin' long enough now, stop bein' greedy
Just keep it real, partner, give to the needy
Ribs is touchin', so don't make me wait
Fuck around and I'm gon' bite you and snatch the plate

[Intro]
Well alright
Now dig this!

Lyrics from Snippet:

[Chorus]
No one's ever made me feel so happy, remorseful, or so insecure
Oh God, you're everything I hate and everything I adore
You said you like this one songwriter
Now I'm tryna write this song like her
And no one's gonna love you like I do, know that much I know
I'll be your morning cup of coffee, the light guiding you home
Oh, you're my medicine, my vice
You keep me up at night
So tell me, baby
Am I crazy in love or just crazy?

[Post-Chorus]
Ba-da-dee-da, dee-da, dee-da

Queens and kings
The brown girl sings
Boys in the back by the tarpaulin
Who's hirin? What they firing?
The city’s full a sharks swimming with the dolphin
It's time for the magic like I'm Merlin
I've been choppin it and kicking it like a Shaolin
Darlin, the fun is always callin
And my callin is always to stop you fallin
If you do pick you up and keep it moving
It's only glass on the ceiling
It's not cement, don’t get stuck in feelings
The greatest glory's not never fallin
It's how we get back up and keep on moving

[Chorus]
Back home, back home (force to be reckoned with)
Back home, back home (yeah, we got the sauce)
Back on track (I’m on a new level)
You better go check (I still be that rebel)

Back home, back home (yeah, we got the sauce)
Back on track (I’m on a new level)
You better go check (I still be that rebel)

Hold on more, woah, woah
Don't tell me 'bout them woke facts (Woke fact)
Them just sound like broke facts (Broke facts)
I don't know who the fuck told you that (Told you that)

Why we need 'em? They just sold you crack (Sold you crack)

So how do I begin, to tell you now
That I can be the one to bring your angel out?
In this life of sin

Sometimes I feel like running away
From my own fears, own tears and reality
All together, through my eyes there's a different side
You want me to show you why you're here
It's clear

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I don't have the answers you wish to learn, learn
You'll always wonder the secrets that I hold, ho-old
My heart cries a bleeding symphony
All my life 'cause you have set me free
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
You put me out of my, my misery

[Verse 2: Kevin McCall]
I'm so numb, I can't feel my face
And for reason, I am not afraid
So if I leave, it's not in vain
I slowly feel my problems fading away
And now I'm drifting to another world
And don't you dare try to follow me, follow me
You wonder if we'll be together, girl
On the other side, but I

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Kevin McCall]
I don't have the answers (I) you wish to learn, learn (I, I)
You'll always wonder the secrets that I hold, ho-old (I, I)
My heart cries a bleeding symphony
All my life 'cause you have set me free
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
You put me out of my, my misery

[Bridge: Chris Brown & Kevin McCall]
No more crying
Slowly dying
Gave up trying
There's no turning back
Lightning strikes me
Quietly, rocking me to eternal sleep
Beautiful voices singing me a lullaby
Luring me to the other side

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Kevin McCall]
I don't have the answers (I, I) you wish to learn, learn (I)
You'll always wonder (I, I)  the secrets that I hold, ho-old (I)
My heart cries a bleeding symphony (I, I)
All my life 'cause you have set me free (I, I)
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
You put me out of my, my misery

[Outro: Kevin McCall]
I don't have the answers
I don't have the answers
I don't have the answers
I don't have the answers
I don't have the answers
I don't have the answers
Save me, why don't you believe?
I told you I don't have the answers
(Earl on the beat)

Armageddon
How many rings do you got on, like seven
You still around tryna get it with Devin
Fuckin this bitch she a matchmade in heaven
Met a little brother that nigga was madaline
Said he gon make it, told him keep peddelin

Broke out a bitch in the back and he damaging
Pass it to gang Peter fitch like makeup
Ass super fat but the titties are a-cup
Been had a tectonic gold like Marc Jacob
Shot for his chest and his life in a hiccup
Rich and I'm weak I cannot do a situp
Body can't just told him go get his fed up
And top

Need a bitch outside the door it's sand
Fuck on the jet till the time that we land
Cool we made it, you still a fan
All of the followers don't even know Gram
Say what I want cause I'm rich and I can

You lied, why'd you lie?

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Andre Merritt]
I don't know

I'm letting go of your heart
You're a stranger to me

Go with the wind, blow away, 'way from me
You are a nonchalant memory, oh yeah
You made me cry, I never wanna see your face again
And now my tears are all dry

I, I don't know who you are
The rain has left me so scarred (So scarred)

And the temperature just heats up when I'm with you
Don't be scared, when I start to go down and I lick you
Rubbing and kissing and licking on your body when I go down and oh, I'm gon' miss you
And I need your body right now 'cause I know it's an issue
And I'm hyperventilating right now, I can't breathe if I ain't with you
I need your body like right now, I need your body like right now
Lay your head, on my bed, baby, tell me if you want the lights down
Your property, treat me like I'm your property

I'll travel far to many places
Searching high and low for you, I'm stronger when I'm close to you
I'm seeing old, familiar faces
Girl, it's all about you, only you in my life
And girl, I see you like playing with my heart
Baby, please don't do this to me 'cause I'm in love
Can I get a little bit? One more kiss?
Yeah, 'cause I don't wanna miss it

[Chorus]
Baby, let me change your life, promise it will be alright

Maybe you can show me how to love, maybe
I'm going through withdrawals
You don't even have to do too much
You can turn me on with just a touch, baby

[Pre-Chorus: The Weeknd]
I look around and
Sin City's cold and empty (Oh)
No one's around to judge me (Oh)
I can't see clearly when you're gone

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night
Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust
Hey

[Verse 2: Ruth Radelet & The Weeknd]
I've been tryna call (Yeah)
I've been on my own for long enough
Maybe you can show me how to love, maybe
I'm running out of time
'Cause I can see the sun light up the sky
So I hit the road in overdrive, baby, oh

[Pre-Chorus: Ruth Radelet & The Weeknd]
The city's cold and empty (Oh)
No one's around to judge me (Oh)
I can't see clearly when you're gone

[Chorus: Ruth Radelet & The Weeknd]
I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch

I can't see clearly when you're gone
The city's cold and empty
No one's around to judge me
I can't see clearly when you're gone

[Intro]
Yeah

[Verse 1]
I saw you dancing in a crowded room, uh
You look so happy when I'm not with you
But then you saw me, caught you by surprise
A single teardrop falling from your eye

[Refrain]
I don't know why I run away (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
I make you cry when I run away (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)

[Verse 2]
You could've asked me why I broke your heart
You could've told me that you fell apart
But you walked past me like I wasn't there
And just pretended like you didn't care

[Refrain]
I don't know why I run away
I make you cry when I run away

[Chorus]
Take me back 'cause I wanna stay
Save your tears for another
Save your tears for another day

[Verse 3]
I made you think that I would always stay, yeah
I said some things that I should never say
Yeah, I broke your heart like someone did to mine
And now you won't love me for a second time

[Refrain]
I don't know why I run away (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh), oh, girl
Said I make you cry when I run away

[Chorus]
Girl, take me back 'cause I wanna stay
Save your tears for another
I realize that I'm much too late
And you deserve someone better
Save your tears for another day (Oh yeah)

[Outro]
Save your tears for another day, ooh, girl
I said save your tears for another day
Tears for another day
Girl, I said save your tears for another day
Save your tears for another day
Save your tears for another

[Intro: The Weeknd]
Heartless
I lost my heart and my mind
I try to always do right
I thought I lost you this time
You just came back in my life
You never gave up on me (Why don't you?)
I'll never know what you see (Why won't you?)
I don't do well when alone (Ooh, yeah)
You hear it clear in my

[Verse 1: The Weeknd]
Never need a bitch, I'm what a bitch need (Bitch need)
Tryna find the one that can fix me
I've been dodgin' death in the six-speed
Amphetamine got my stummy feelin' sickly
Yeah, I want it all now
I've been runnin' through the pussy, need a dog pound
Hundred models gettin' faded in the compound
Tryna love me, but they never get a pulse down (Why?)

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
'Cause I'm heartless
And I'm back to my ways 'cause I'm heartless
All this money and this pain got me heartless
Low life for life 'cause I'm heartless
Said I'm heartless
Tryna be a better man, but I'm heartless
Never be a wedding plan for the heartless
Low life for life 'cause I'm heartless

[Verse 2: Lil Uzi Vert]
She got me confused, I swear she got me mixed up (Woah)
I don't need you, girl, so I don't care if I slip up
Yes, I swear I'm heartless, more life, hold my wrist up
She rob me for my love, I feel like this a stickup (Freeze)
Yeah, it's Lil Uzi from the 16
Grade-A bank account, you know I'm with the A-team
Went up in my level, don't know why they hate me
I knew I was gonna be this way since eighteen
I heard she got that water, I'm tryna be waist-deep
I make her beg for it, make that girl wan' say please
Yes, I'm heartless, I get chilly in this Chrome fleece
I put emeralds in my Rollie, they don't even make these (Woah)

[Intro]
(Baby, almost died)
(Baby, almost died)
(Baby, almost died)
(Baby, almost died)

[Verse 1]
My darkest hours
Girl, I felt so alone inside of this crowded room
Different girls on the floor, distractin' my thoughts of you (Baby, almost died)
I turned into the man I used to be
To be (Baby, almost died)
Put myself to sleep
Just so I can get closer to you inside my dreams
Didn't wanna wake up 'less you were beside me (Baby, almost died)
I just wanted to call you and say, and say (Baby, almost died)

[Chorus]
Oh, baby
Where are you now when I need you most? (Baby, almost died)
I'd give it all just to hold you close
Sorry that I broke your heart, your heart

[Verse 2]
Never comin' down, uh
I was running away from facin' reality, uh
Wastin' all of my time out living my fantasies
Spendin' money to compensate, compensate
'Cause I want you, baby, uh
I be livin' in heaven when I'm inside of you
It was simply a blessing wakin' beside you
I'll never let you down again, again

[Chorus]
Oh, baby
Where are you now when I need you most?
I'd give it all just to hold you close
Sorry that I broke your heart, your heart
I said, baby
I'll treat you better than I did before
I'll hold you down and not let you go
This time, I won't break your heart, your heart, yeah

[Chorus]
Without my baby
Where are you now when I need you most?
I gave it all just to hold you close
Sorry that I broke your heart, your heart (Baby, almost died)
And I said, baby
I'll treat you better than I did before
I'll hold you down and not let you go (Baby, almost died)
This time, I won't break your heart, your heart, no (Baby, almost died)

[Verse 1]
When I saw the signs, I should've let you go
But I kept you beside me
And if I held you back, at least I held you close
Should have known you were lonely

[Pre-Chorus]
I know things will never be the same
Time we've lost will never be replaced
I'm the reason you forgot to love

[Chorus]
So don't be scared to live again
Be scared to live again
No, don't be scared to live again
Be scared to live again

[Verse 2]
You always miss the chance to fall for someone else
'Cause your heart only knows me
They try to win your love, but there was nothing left
They just made you feel lonely (Hey)

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, I am not the man I used to be
Did some things I couldn't let you see
Refuse to be the one who taints your heart

[Chorus]
So don't be scared to live again
Be scared to live again
No, don't be scared to live again, baby
Be scared to live again (Say)

[Post-Chorus]
I hope you know that, I hope you know that
I've been praying that you find yourself
I hope you know that, I hope you know that
We fell apart, right from the start

[Bridge]
I should have made you my only
When it's said and done
Woah-oh-woah

[Chorus]
So don't be scared to live again, baby
Be scared to live again
No, don't be scared to live again, baby
Be scared to live again (Hey)

[Post-Chorus]
I hope you know that, I hope you know that
I've been praying that you find yourself
I hope you know that, I hope you know that
We fell apart, right from the start

[Piano intro and Lupe humming]

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
Scenery, man replacing machinery
Letting my phone sing to me
Sinking art, what it seems to me
Like a teenager taking the senior seats
We give so much to these devices
Lifeless after lifeless, find a likeness, hope it likes us
Even plants fight or we would choke a ficus
A barely swallowed pecan chokes a vegan
To death right before the weekend, now
Will test fate testify on behalf of the victim?
On what he witnessed at cafe gratitude
And incriminate the kitchen?
Maybe implicate with snitchin'
But chef
Point is, nothing ever lacks a side effect
You could buy a vest and die from stress
Sometimes life may feel like one brick with 5 connects
But only you know if you really tried your best
Yes, yes, yes

[Interlude: Robert Glasper]
Casey Benjamin, saxophone and vocal, Casey Benjamin
Burniss Travis on the bass (*applause*)
Mark Colenburg on the drums (*applause*)
I'm Robert Glasper, arigato gozaimasu (*applause*)
Arigato, arigato, arigato

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
Uh, yeah, I'm just an author
Trying to optimize my ideals like Warby Parker
Kinda like Harvey's Harlot
When the game gets going, you gotta Atari harder
How you gonna deal with these eyes without the skills to survive?
How I lyrically take liberties
Paint literature of the walls of the embassy, yeah
I hope you find sense in the asymmetries, uh
Hands up, Tokyo freeze

Mm, yeah
Mm, yeah
Mm, yeah
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Spend my days countin' down
Time will pass, that I know
Whatcha done broke me down
Not alone, I’m vulnerable
Let you in, take good care
See the signs, crack the code
The time will pass, that I know
Love will grow like a wildflower

[Chorus]
Like a wildflower
Like a wildflower
Like a wildflower

[Verse 2]
Pull me in, then get close
Feel your heartbeat on mine
Where have you been? I've waited long
But now you're here, right on time
When it’s safe, they will pour
Who'll like to see you cry?
Take your hand, hold on mine
Love will burn like a wildflower (Love will burn)

[Chorus]
Like a wildflower (Love will burn)
Like a wildflower (It's about to burn)
Like a wildflower (It's about to burn)

[Intro]
Too fucked up to rap

[Verse 1]
Rollie on my wrist, a diamond ring right on my finger
They said, "Stick to rappin', boy, you ain't much of a singer"
But me, I don't give a fuck, 'cause simply I'm too cool
Got a whole life I can live, plus I just bought a pair of shoes
Funny, it's just magic, when my thoughts are so sporadic
And my mom thinks I'm an addict, or it's messy up in my attic
Got people in my ear, who's this speakin'? I don't hear
I'm too focused to be the dopest, got my mansion with chandeliers

[Refrain]
They thinkin' they all know you, and it's easy to break you down
There's so much they can show you, here's the notes, just take 'em down
Everybody's watchin', so be sure to make 'em proud
You can say you pissed off, you just can't say it too loud

[Chorus]
Bankin' on me, waitin' for me to fall
My homies first, no doubt about it at all
The world's got evils, they wanna watch you fail
But I'ma live to tell the tale
Oh well

[Verse 2]
Sometimes it's okay to stop and just say, "Fuck it all"
Fuck their expectations, I just need me a vacation
All these dumb public relations, swear I'm runnin' out of patience
There's no more shit I'll be takin', I'm just smilin' while you hatin'
Every cadence, every word, they analyze it and criticize it
"Someone else thought of that first," well, I'm just tryna redefine it
They're all so narrow-minded, tell 'em, "Open up that mind"
'Cause what I make is timeless, and right now that's so hard to find

[Refrain]
They thinkin' they all know you, and it's easy to break you down
There's so much they can show you, here's the notes, just take 'em down
And everybody's watchin', so be sure to make 'em proud
You can say you pissed off, you just can't say it too loud

[Chorus]
Bankin' on me, waitin' for me to fall
My homies first, no doubt about it at all
The world's got evils, they wanna watch you fail
But I'ma live to tell the tale
Oh well

[Verse 1]
Look at you, kids, with your vintage music
Comin' through satellites while cruisin'
You're part of the past, but now you're the future
Signals crossing can get confusin'

[Pre-Chorus 1]
It's enough just to make you feel crazy, crazy, crazy
Sometimes it's enough just to make you feel crazy

[Chorus 1]
You get ready, you get all dressed up
To go nowhere in particular
Back to work or the coffee shop
Doesn't matter because it's enough
To be young and in love, ah, ah
To be young and in love, ah, ah

[Verse 2]
Look at you, kids, you know you're the coolest
The world is yours and you can't refuse it
Seen so much, you could get the blues, but
That don't mean that you should abuse it

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Though it's enough just to make you go crazy, crazy, crazy

[Chorus 1]
But you get ready, you get all dressed up
To go nowhere in particular
Back to work or the coffee shop
It don't matter because it's enough
To be young and in lo-o-o-ove, ah, ah
To be young and in lo-o-o-ove, ah, ah

[Bridge]
Hmm-mm (Ah, ah)
Hmm-mm (Ah, ah, ah, ah)
Hmm
Don't worry, baby
Hmm-mm (Ah, ah)
Hmm-mm (Ah, ah, ah, ah)
Hmm
Don't worry, baby

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And it's enough just to make me go crazy, crazy, crazy
It's enough just to make me go crazy, crazy, crazy

[Chorus 2]
I get ready, I get all dressed up
To go nowhere in particular
It doesn't matter if I'm not enough
For the future or the things to come
'Cause I'm young and in lo-o-o-ove, ah, ah
I'm young and in love, ah-ah-ah, ah, ah, ah

[Outro]
Hmm-mm (Ah, ah)
Hmm-mm (Ah, ah, ah, ah)
Hmm
Don't worry, baby
Hmm-mm (Ah, ah)
Hmm-mm (Ah, ah, ah, ah)
Hmm
Don't worry, baby
As we smoke in a Beamer, the angel eye lights in the lenses
The .44 caliber killer, rappers are defenseless
I'm hearing voices in my mind, they keep repeating
'87 style, get the money like I'm 

[?]
Bizarre rap, call me Comandante Sarjak
Origami a cigar into a small black

You see me in the street, I'm rocking short set, roll in quartet
I play the doorstep, Rambo inside the Gore-tex
Moon covered by the half a cloud, make a bastard wild
Chasing numbers more than 

[?]

[?] a bit loose allow the mind to circulate
I'll merk a Jake cause we were brought up by the Purple Tape
Burn a blank cause I'm queezy feeling gated
Delegate of rough raps heavily celebrated
You see the mane on my face it spell struggle
Jail juggle, catch a case watch the bail double
Eleven drugs mixed, Tallahassee bun tricks
Now we stunt kicks, lemon on the lungfish
Artisan bread, half-moon parts in our head
Fila the shoe, deadly like a fart in the bed

[?] galore, sour in a plastic bag
Classic swag, lay a coward in a casket bad
Lyrics from snippet

[Intro]
Oh my God, what is this? An L beat?

[Chorus]
Ridin' around the valley playin' cheeky with my brothers
You be acting funny like your mantra I don't trust it
I fuck with lil' shawty but I wouldn't say I love her
I'm way too in love with all these racks up in the duffle
Shawty I'm a dog, I don't got no time for cover
Starting to feel in love, so I might just have to cut her
Ridin' around my whole city listening to the cutter
I will never learn, I just keep on gettin' caught up

[Verse 1]
I will never change, never switch up on my brothers
They've been there from the start, ever since the boy had nothin'
That's why I tell them, "Come and get these racks up out the duffle"
That's why shawty in love so you know I can not trust her
Loyalty and love is lost, nowadays our eyes are crossed
Yeah, they doubt us 'til they brace us, was never down in the mud
Yeah, I told them to be patient but they never listen once
Yeah, they was chasin' fun but I was just chasin' funds

[Chorus]
Ridin' around the valley playin' cheeky with my brothers
You be acting funny like your mantra I don't trust it
I fuck with lil' shawty but I wouldn't say I love her
I'm way too in love with all these racks up in the duffle
Shawty I'm a dog, I don't got no time for cover
Starting to feel in love, so I might just have to cut her
Ridin' around my whole city listening to the cutter
I will never learn, I just keep on gettin' caught up

[Bridge]
Love
People are gettin' caught in love
People are gettin' caught in love
People are gettin' caught in love
Lo-o-ove

[Verse 2]
I didn't even gotta say, she already know what's up
She say, "You look so damn young, how'd you get up in this club?"
Oh well, oh well, oh well, is you with me or what?
Yeah, bitch I'm young, rich and handsome, I got money on my own
And she aware, she don't care about my hair
Or my teeth, she just see all the dollar signs in her head
Trap bands all the time, but we never had a dime
Used to fuck with her arrest, now baby girl let me come inside, wassup, wassup

[Chorus]
Ridin' around the valley playin' cheeky with my brothers
You be acting funny like your mantra I don't trust it
I fuck with lil' shawty but I wouldn't say I love her
I'm way too in love with all these racks up in the duffle
Shawty I'm a dog, I don't got no time for cover
Starting to feel in love, so I might just have to cut her
Ridin' around my whole city listening to the cutter
I will never learn, I just keep on gettin' caught up

[Verse 1]
I know it's hot
I know we've got
Something that money can't buy
Fighting in fits
Biting your lip
Loving 'til late in the night

[Pre-Chorus]
Tell me I'm too crazy
You can't tame me, can't tame me
Tell me I have changed
But I'm the same me, old same me
Inside
Hey!

[Chorus]
If you don't like the way I talk, then why am I on your mind?
If you don't like the way I rock, then why are we wasting time?
We fight and we argue, you'll still love me blind
If we don't mess this whole thing up
Guaranteed, I can blow your mind
Mwah!

[Post-Chorus]
And tonight I'm alive, ain't no dollar sign
Guaranteed, I can blow your mind, mwah
And tonight I'm alive, ain't no dollar sign
Guaranteed, I can blow your mind, mwah
(Mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah)

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I'm so bad
Best that you've had
I guess you're diggin' the show
Open the door
You want some more
When you wanna leave, let me know

[Pre-Chorus]
Tell me I'm too crazy
You can't tame me, can't tame me
Tell me I have changed
But I'm the same me, old same me
Inside
Hey!

[Chorus]
If you don't like the way I talk, then why am I on your mind?
If you don't like the way I rock, then why are we wasting time?
We fight and we argue, you'll still love me blind
If we don't mess this whole thing up

And tonight I'm alive, ain't no dollar sign

If you wanna be Bright Minded, there’s just one place to go
When you’re stuck at home, and the time is ticking slow
Monday through Friday, live with Miley on my Instagram show
(On my Instagram Show)
Stay lit everybody

[PRE-Chorus]
He woke up, looked over
And he smiled for a while and said-

[Chorus]
That that was how we knew we were meant to be
Dancin' round in circles under willow trees
My head was saying "no"
My heart was saying "go"
Yeah, We were dancin' in the green
Dancin in the green

And so he said to me "thats the way to go"
Without no encounter, oh we'd never know
Our hearts were made of gold
And we began to glow
Oh we were dancin in the green, dancin in the green

Oh oh oh oh, Oh oh oh oh

Our hearts were made of gold
And we began to glow
We were dancin in the green
Dancin in the green

[Verse 1]
When you're all alone and you're thinking about everything
Know that wherever I am, that I'm doing the same

[Chorus]
Across the ocean of a thousand miles
It doesn't mean we can't talk a while and smile (At each other)
'Cause we're only human
It's okay to be human

[Verse 2]
We're stronger when we say we don't know the way
The courage that it takes to keep on searching is a beautiful thing
No use in pointing the blame, yeah, we're in this together

[Chorus]
Across the ocean, looking up at the stars
There's something out there that lets us know
It's okay (To be human)
It's okay to be human (We're only human)
We're only human (We're only human)
We'll get through this together

[Outro]
Don't give up, don't give up, don't give up, don't give up, my love
Won't give up, won't give up, won't give up, won't give up on you
Don't give up, don't give up, don't give up, don't give up, my love
'Cause we're together, at least we're together
Lyrics from snippet

[Chorus]
(Yeah, okay)
One, two, I can't throw this party
Tree, four, Shawty's off this molly
Five, six, now we trippin' for real

I just hope that no one saw me
One, two, I can't throw this party
Tree, four, Shawty's off this molly
Five, six, now we trippin' for real
And now we trippin', we trippin', trippin'
One, two, I-

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Picture this
Summer morning, breakfast

Private island, tryna turn your life up
We don't need a night club if you're tryna get wifed up
Yeah, baby, do you wanna take it there?
Do you wanna take it there, take it there?
Do you wanna make it there, make it there, make it there?
Do you wanna just stay in there and then wait in there?
Can you wait in there?
Just lay it down, just lay it down, just lay it down
Lay it down right there, lay it down, lay it down right there
Lay it down, lay it down right there, lay it down, lay it down right there
Right there, right there, right there, right there, right there

[Verse: Young Thug]
Ayy, lay her down right here, but don't move

Someone's in that bed like, oh yeah, that's a bet like

High to give a damn, yeah, I'm too
Fly to give a damn, yeah, I'm high
I don't give a damn, I'm from a
Place like Amsterdam, I just got some head in Rotterdam
I just got a lawsuit from my old manager
Look at my old clan tryna sue the man
Might go get a Benz, might go get the Ford
Might go get the Lamb' off the showroom floor
Bitch, I been ready, mark, set, let's go
I just do my thing and these ni‏ggas know

Motherfuck what's goin' on, I'm just movin' 'round like I'm on some Ritalin
No time to fuss, no fight, I'm at the best place in my life
I'm just wilding out with ya babe, she just wanna wild out tight
Chillin' in the spot all day, bubblegum a new Kanye
I just found a whole new wave, Tony Montana all day, ayy

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Picture this

Lay it down, lay it down right there, lay it down, lay it down right there
Right there, right there, right there, right there, right there

[Verse 1: Lizzy McAlpine]
It is 7 pm and I'm sitting all alone
No one's on my phone tonight
My boyfriend's in class
And my friends are back at home
And the internet is slow
So I can't watch my show tonight
Tonight

[Pre-Chorus: Lizzy McAlpine]
I'm losing my mind
I'm reading the news for the hell of it
I'm wondering if she's on your mind
Losing track of time
I'm learning to cook for the hell of it
And I'm wondering if she's by your side
Tonight (tonight)

[Chorus: Both]
I don't usually do this
But baby tell me that you love me and prove it
I'm just so far away it's easy to lose it
So tell me you're mine, oh
I'm so stuck and I need you to pull me back out (out, out)
Say you love me and maybe I'll stop having doubts (doubts, doubts)

[Verse 2: Lilacs.]
It's 11 pm and I'm hanging up my phone
'Cause I've reached your dial tone again
Something tells me I'll go crazy
If you keep playing these games with me
So maybe I'll call you again, oh
And it don't make sense (it don't make no sense)

[Pre-Chorus: Both]
I'm losing my mind
I've smoked too much tryna deal with it
And I'm wondering if he's on your mind
Losing track of time
I'm takin' drugs on the couch just to deal with it
And I'm wondering if he's by your side tonight (tonight)

[Chorus: Both]
I don't usually do this
But baby tell me that you love me and prove it
I'm just so far away it's easy to lose it
So tell me you're mine, oh
I'm so stuck and I need you to pull me back out
Say you love me and maybe I'll stop having doubts

[Intro]
Oooh (Bum bum)
Oooh (Bum bum)
Oooooh

[Verse 1]
Once there was a girl
Who captivated the world
She drew them in with her voice like money
That girl she had it all
Could make the fairest fall
She drew me in with her lips as gold as honey

[Pre-Chorus]
If she knew
I longed to touch her silken skin each night
And if she knew
I did this all for her
If she knew
I need her by my side to breathe alright
And if she knew

[Chorus]
Daisy, Daisy, please don't go
Daisy, Daisy, keep me
Oh, let me heal you
Let me break you
And we'll do it again
I just crave you
Let me save you
From the man who is your hand
I don't wanna be alone
So tell me where did I go wrong
Help me see the green light in front of me

[Outro]
Mmmm
Ba dum bum
Hmmmmm

[Verse 1]
I could count the stars
Wait until the dawn
I could cry tears of honey
Sweet as the hummingbird's song
I could drift away
Walking paths I'd never thought to follow
I could meet someone new
Feed them love and make them swallow

[Chorus]
You are mayhem and quiet
You are roses and riots

[Verse 2]
I don't know where to start without you
Even though I'm beginning to doubt you
You say everything that I need to hear
Ghost-like words that drift around the atmosphere
You linger even when you're supposed to be dead
You always did say things that you wanted unsaid
Loving an artist is hard when it's only in bed
'Cause I was always more beautiful inside your head

[Chorus]
I still remember
Last December when you told me
You was into me
My head above this water
Can't get into
Deep with you or I might drown
Oh, I remember
Oh, I remember
No, no-o-o-o

[Verse]
It's okay, I'll be on my way, I'll be on my way, I'll be on my way (Now)
But in my bed there's an empty space, where you can lay, come through my place (Now)
Keep you warm when you're in my brace, I'll keep you safe, just keep your place (Lie)
But for now, I'll be on my way, I'll be on my way, I'll be on my way (Now)

[Pre-Chorus]
On my own to fight, through this life, I might test my fists tonight
On my own to fight, through this lie, with you soarin' through my mind

[Chorus]
I still remember
Last December when you told me
You was into me
My head above this water
Can't get into
Deep with you or I might drown
Oh, I remember
Oh, I remember
No, no-o-o-o

[Breakdown]
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah

[Pre-Chorus]
On my own to fight, through this life, I might test my faith tonight
On my own to fight, through this lie, with you soarin' through my mind
On my own to fight, through this life, I might test my fists tonight
On my own to fight, through this lie, with you soarin' through my mind

[Chorus]
I still remember
Last December when you told me
You was into me (Into, you were into)
My head above this water
Can't get into (I can't get into)
Deep with you or I might drown
Oh, I remember
Oh, I remember
No, no-o-o-o

[Intro]
Oh, oh

[Verse 1]
While I'm laying on your chest
I can feel the emptiness
Like the sound of broken dreams
All those tattoos on your skin
This commitment joining
Tell me are we meant to be

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, we used to burn bright
But now I'm turning the lights off
(Lights go down today)
You said you'd be mine
But I've been waiting a lifetime
(And I can't stand the pain)

[Chorus]
Don't you beg me for forgiveness, oh no
Don't mistake my love for weakness
If you think I'd run around and 'round chasing you
Leave me hanging here like a fool, no
You can have it all, all
'Cause it's all or nothing, all or nothing

[Post-Chorus]
(Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh)
All or nothing
(Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh)
All or nothing

[Verse 2]
Loving you was like a pill
I stayed 'cause I liked the thrill
But now we're just wasting time (time, time)
I've been waiting weeks all night
You know that we're more than friends
We've been livin' in denial

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, we used to burn bright
But now I'm turning the lights off
(Lights go down today)
You said you'd be mine
But I've been waiting a lifetime
(And I can't stand the pain)

[Chorus]
Don't you beg me for forgiveness, oh no
Don't mistake my love for weakness
If you think I'd run around and 'round chasing you
Leave me hanging here like a fool, no
You can have it all, all
'Cause it's all or nothing, all or nothing

[Post- Chorus]
(Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh)
All or nothing
(Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh)
All or nothing

[Bridge]
Don't you beg me for forgiveness
Don't mistake my love for weakness

[Chorus]
Don't you beg me for forgiveness, oh no
Don't mistake my love for weakness
If you think I'd run around and 'round chasing you
Leave me hanging here like a fool, no
You can have it all, all
'Cause it's all or nothing, all or nothing

[Post- Chorus]
(Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh)
All or nothing
(Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh)
All or nothing

[Verse 1: KeY Wane]
Yeah, doin' doughnuts in the Porsche at the dealer
Listenin’ to Dilla
The Lord always made a way, yeah, that's my nigga
You used to drive the Honda Civic, nigga, I remember
I was being optimistic, I ain't have a pot to piss in
I was livin’ on my ex-girl couch, terrible
All my money kept goin' out
I ain't have enough to move, I felt like a vegetable
LIV, 2012, own your sectional
Damn, couple years later, I'm livin' exceptional
Spend thirty thousand, my Rollie came extra gold
Bitch ass niggas just mad I'm gettin' on

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Oh, oh, oh
Welcome to the terrordome
My, how my hair has grown
All I wanted was a Rollie and a 2Pac herringbone
Midwest kids, damn near all we used to hear was Bone
Two-family flat, mommy and aunt used to share a home
Boy, I rip your heart out and eat it while it's still beatin’ (Eat)
For no real reason, just blame it on killing season
Circle of life, top of the food chain, my new chain a circle of ice
My name deservin’ of lights
"The smartest thing you could do is stop music and finish school"
(Woah) Gotta be the dumbest shit I ever heard in my life
If yesterday is a tomb (Tomb), then tomorrow is the womb (Womb)
Waitin' on the Son of God ’cause he comin' back soon, hol' up
(Woah) Flashbacks of me dancin' in my living room was my first audition
Puff, Big, and Ma$e wavin’ gold bottles in the lenses like

[Interlude: Diddy & Big Sean]
Never let me go, that's the worst feeling (Woah)
I still love you like my first million
You got me hypnotized like the scene with Big and I, reverse wheelin' (Damn)

[Verse 3: Big Sean & Diddy]
Ciroc boys, blue circle business, that's full circle (Yeah)
Full circle like losin' friends from baggin' up yay to rappin' for Ye
Who dropped his first album, I was in the tenth grade
To ten years later, me droppin' a #1 the exact same day (Yeah, yeah)
Swear everything comes full circle, dawg, you just gotta wait
Full circle like, listenin' to Big to growin' up, they callin' you Big
(Can you feel me?)
Full circle like givin' your first Rolex to your first kid (Yeah)
Full circle like exactly what the fuck karma is
Full circle like every single thing I ever did

[Interlude: Diddy]
Yeah, niggas don't even make shit like this no more, ahaha
Shit lost, it's-it's a lost motherfuckin' art
I want the people out there in the world to hear me, though
I don't do it alone

[Verse 4: Big Sean]
Drop all that jealousy, that shit is gon' hurt you (Hurt you)
Quit givin' energy to ones that don't deserve you (They don't deserve)
You know everything come full circle
I just show love, watch it come full circle
And I could never let the bad vibes inside my circle, nah (Right now)
And loyalty deserves you (Yeah)
And tell the fuckin' truth even when it hurts to (Yeah-yeah)
But the most money come before the first two (Straight)
Don't worry, it'll come full circle (Yeah, look)

[Outro: Diddy]
Took all the pain that I knew and made songs
When God said, "Let there be light," he made Sean

[Verse 1]
I couldn't stand in a room with you
And not think about that night
I had to cross the street if we were walking on the same side
It just hurt too much
Too many reminders that I messed things up
But now, we're okay again

[Verse 2]
I had to block you on instagram
So I wouldn't feel impatient
I had to stop myself at least once a day
From thinking how her haircut makes us look the same and
It hurt a bunch
Too many reminders that I messed things up
But now, we're okay again

[Chorus]
I've been taking my time not trying to get high with all the wrong people
We've been growing apart but I guess that's what happens to some people
And I know we're not friends but I'll always be here if you need people
I'm just glad that we're okay again

[Verse 3]
We had a party at our place
And you showed up with your best friends
It wasn't weird it wasn't awkward
It was just like seeing an old friend

[Bridge]
After four whole months
I don't remember ever seeing you so happy
I guess we knew it wasn't meant to be us
It's been four whole months
I don't remember ever being this happy
I guess we knew it wasn't meant to be us

[Chorus
I've been taking my time trying not to get high with all the wrong people
We've been growing apart but I guess that's what happens to some people
And I know we're not friends but I'll always be here if you need people
I'm just glad that we're okay again

[Verse 1]
Why am I pulled to you
And why does it never feel like
I'm finished talking
When we're finished talking?
Why am I pulled to you
And why does it never feel right
To not pick up when you're calling?

[Pre-Chorus]
You know me so well
Even if you don't know my favorite type of cereal
You know me so well
Even though we're both different people now

[Chorus]
It's stupid, it's so stupid to miss you like this
I feel stupid, so stupid to miss you like this
'Cause I told you to go and you went
Oh, what did I expect?
So it's stupid, it's stupid, I know that it's stupid
To love you
But I can't help it

[Post-Chorus]
Mmm, I can't help it
I can't help it

[Verse 2]
How did we get here?
It makes no sense, but it feels like
A sign from God
That I keep ignoring
How did we get to this place we're in?
It makes no sense, but it feels right
And maybe that's God
I probably shouldn't ignore him

[Pre-Chorus]
You know me so well
Even if you don't know my favorite type of cereal
You know me so well
Even if you don't know I don't believe in God anyhow

[Chorus]
But it's stupid, it's so stupid to miss you like this
I feel stupid, so stupid to miss you like this
'Cause I told you to go and you went
Oh, what did I expect?
So it's stupid, it's stupid, I know that it's stupid
To love you
But I can't help it

[Verse 1]
I'm speechless
No words I make have meaning
Right now they're
Lost within me deep within me you complete me please don't leave me now

[Verse 2]
You're beauty
Inside and out
Enchants me
You understand the way I work
I understand the way that you work too
We fit like glue

[Pre-Chorus]
There's not a thing
I wouldn't do for you
You make me sing
You inspire the words of my youth
We are far apart but they still hold true

[Chorus]
It's so easy
To lose myself in you
I could hide
Inside your eyes
Deep and misty ocean blue
I was fine until I spent a while
Let myself drift
I couldn't see that I was
Slowly losing independence
Oh now
I feel much more free
I can finally see how
Time is everything
Oh love alone is not enough to heal the pain

[Verse 3]
I find you
So interesting
Your brain works
In ways I've never seen before
It's so annoying yet so intriguing too
I need you

[Pre-Chorus]
There's not a thing
I wouldn't do for you
You make me sing
You inspire the words of my youth
We are far apart but they still hold true

[Chorus]
It's so easy
To lose myself in you
I could hide
Inside your eyes
Deep and misty ocean blue
I was fine until I spent a while
Let myself drift
I couldn't see that I was
Slowly losing independence
Oh now
I feel much more free
I can finally see how
Time is everything
Oh love alone is not enough to heal the pain

[Intro]
Where the girls are the fairest the boys are the rarest
Ohhh

[Verse 1]
Love
Blue
Oceans move for you
Fire
Rain
Hits me all the same

[Chorus]
Oh indigo
Indigo
You and I made indigo
Deep deep indigo
Indigo

[Outro]
Sand in my crotch, there's sand in my crotch
Sand in my crotch
Sand in my crotch
Sand in my crotch, there's sand in my crotch
Sand in my crotch
Sand in my crotch
Sand in my crotch, there's sand in my crotch
Sand in my crotch
Sand in my crotch
Sand in my crotch, there's sand in my crotch
Sand in my crotch
Sand in my crotch
Yeah!

[Verse]
I'm running out of time
And you'll always be on my mind

[Chorus]
And I can't make you stay
In this broken place
And I hope you find peace
Close your eyes as I put us to sleep

[Post-Chorus]
Finally
To sleep
Finally

[Chorus]
And I can't make you stay
In this broken place
And I hope you find peace
Close your eyes as I put us to sleep

[Post-Chorus]
Finally
Go to sleep
Finally
Oh-oh, oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh

[Vocal Interlude]

[Chorus]
I can't make you stay
In this broken place
Won't you find peace?
Close your eyes and I put us to sleep

[Outro]
Woah, oh, oh
To sleep, woah
Na-na-na-duh-na
Oh, no, no
Na-na-na-na
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh

[Verse 1]
Convinced myself to run around with someone else to forget about you
But I can't hold you responsible for the things I do
I said your name by mistake, played it off like I'm just confused
But I was frontin', lyin' to myself when I know the truth

[Chorus]
Was I missed you
Yes, it's true
I should've known not to let you go, let you go
'Cause I missed you
Baby boo
We could've grown if I held you close, held you close

[Verse 2]
I hurt myself a hundred times just to feel something in my soul
I kept knocking even though I knew what's behind that door
But then I heard you call my name and it sounded like the sweetest song
You never moved on, you were waiting for me all along

[Chorus]
Well, I missed you
Yes, it's true
I should've known not to let you go, let you go
Well, I missed you
Baby boo
We could've grown if I held you close, held you close

[Outro]
Oh, I missed you
Yes, it's true
I should've known not to let you go, let you go
Girl, I missed you
Baby boo
We could've grown if I held you close, held you close
Well, I missed you

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Uh
Fresh up out the dealer to the new Rolls
To my generation, I'm the new HOV
Fuck a famous bitch and get some kudos
Pilow talkin' with 'em, we don't do those

[Pre-Chorus: Meek Mill]
Oh man this shit is rare
Fuckin' bad bitches in the ear
You ain't talking 'bout money, don't interfere
And I know shawty a twenty but I'ma share
Niggas scared, only hang out with killers out of fear
It's a hunnid y'all, hit everyone of y'all
A lot of tears, a lot of pain
All the shit I endured, that got me here

[Chorus: Ant Clemons]
Why I made it through?
From the basement, made it to the majors
Made it through the game with the same players
Everybody 'round me rich and we made it
All my niggas 'round me rich and we made it through
Made it out the trenches, yeah we made it through
We done made it out the trenches

[Verse 2: Ant Clemons]
People realize it's a brand new 

[?] of biscuits (Biscuits, biscuits)
To wakin' to bitches that just was all in my mentions, yeah
Pull up, skrrt, hop in the Benz
I've been at work, then got revenge

[?] up out my business
And the 

[?] on my ex, it's gettin' 

[?]

[Pre-Chorus: Meek Mill]
Oh man this shit is rare
Fuckin' bad bitches in the ear
You ain't talking 'bout money, don't interfere
And I know shawty a twenty but I'ma share
Niggas scared, only hang out with killers out of fear
It's a hunnid y'all, hit everyone of y'all
A lot of tears, a lot of pain
All the shit I endured, that got me here

[Chorus: Ant Clemons]
Why I made it through?
From the basement, made it to the majors
Made it through the game with the same players
Everybody 'round me rich and we made it
All my niggas 'round me rich and we made it through
Made it out the trenches, yeah we made it through
We done made it out the trenches
So ya
Thought ya
Might like to go to the show
To feel the warm thrill of confusion
That space cadet glow

I got some bad news for you, sunshine
Pink isn't well
He stayed back at the hotel
And they sent us along as a surrogate band
Where gonna find out were you fans really stand

Are their any coons in the theater tonight?
Get them up against the wall!
There's one in the spotlight, he don't look right to me
Get him up against the wall!
And that one looks Jewish!
And that one's a coon!
Who let all this Riffraff into the room?
There's one smoking a joint!
And another with spots!
If I had it my way, I'll have ya all in one shot!
Don't tell her you love her
Don’t let her know you insecure
Else yo heart she place it 4
Now yo heart broke she a heart breaker
Ooh, ma
Ooh, pa
Who's so sorry now?
Ooh, pa
Ooh, ma

Am I really on show?
Wild eyed in the spotlight?
Fuck me, what a nightmare, who's there?
Have they all gone?

It's okay now you're in luck
The worms have fled the rising sun
Their evil power is on the way
Forget the past and start again

There must be some mistake
I didn't mean to let them take away my soul
Am I too old?
Is it too late?
Ooh, ma
Ooh pa
Who's so sorry now?
Ooh, pa
Ooh, ma
Who's so sorry now?
Ooh, ah!
I know a boy
He likes to laugh
His brain is mess
But I like it like that

I know a boy
He tastes like the moon
Hangs up the stars
That dance 'round my room

We paint by numbers
But color outside the lines
We don't do what we should
We beat to our own time

[Chorus]
Baby
Love can be so damn magical
Hey we
Are already lovesick
And flower pickin'
Daisies and roses
We're doing fine
Baby
Our roses
Are intertwined
I know a boy
And he is mine
Mmm

[Verse 1]
I feel like running
So far away from here
I'm stuck in pudding
Can't move an inch my dear

Maybe in time
I could learn to love another
Maybe he'll be just like you

Maybe in time
I could grow to be some other
Person who can love like you
Ooh, ooh

[Verse 2]
I'm just existing
Not taking up too much space
It's probably this thing
Making my heart jump out of its place
I know in time
I will learn to love another
I hope he's just like you

I know in time
I will grow to be some other
Person who can love like you

[Chorus]
I'm not happy
But I'm getting through the days
I feel lonely
But I don't let the darkness engulf me in flames

I am new
Because of you
I feel free
Because you helped me see

[Verse 3]
Sometimes I wonder
Sometimes I don't
Lightning and thunder
Threaten to sink my faltering boat

I hope you know
That I've never loved another
Quite the way that i loved you
I hope you know
That I'll never find another
Person who can love like you

[Chorus]
I'm not happy
But I'm getting through the days
I feel lonely
But I don't let the darkness engulf me in flames

I am new
Because of you
I feel free
Because you helped me see

Oh, ooh

[Verse 1]
It's so hard to watch you be happy
It's so hard to know that I'm not
'Cause when the world stopped moving
Like it did last week
I just wanted you to hold me

[Verse 2]
It's so hard to not be in your life
'Cause you know I love your brother
And your mom like they were mine
And when the world stopped moving
Like it did last week
I just wanted you to hold me

[Chorus]
And all your friends are mine
They know that we're nothing alike, mmm
So if they believe that we're meant to be
I'd like to think they're right
But when the world stopped moving
You weren't by my side
And that didn't feel right

[Verse 3]
It's so hard to remember last winter
But like the porcupine and cactus
They don't care 'cause they've both got prickers
And when the world stopped moving
I felt just like them 'cause see

[Outro]
Love is more than words
And I also hurt you
We've both done the worst, but
When the world stopped last week
I just wanted you to hold me
Somebody out there
Tastes like a cool spring day
Somebody out there
Will tell me its okay
They will be as warm as summer rain
Lift me up and take me from the pain
Somebody out there will love me that way

I wish that you were mine, oh
I wish that you would drive slow
I'd kiss you if I knew your name
I miss a love I don't know
Three wishes for my very own Romeo
I'd kiss you only if I knew your name

If I see blue skies above, I think of you
When I see people in love, I think of you
The thought of you is so divine
You'll bring me flowers when I tell you you can be mine
That's how it'll start
Somebody out there
Likes to sleep in until 2
Somebody out there
Knows me better than I do
They will be as sweet as buttercream
Vivid like a Sunday daydream
Somebody out there
Will love me for me

This love will be something to remember
This love will be something for forever
I'll love you even if we're not together
Baby kiss me just for good measure

When I see blue skies above, I think of you
When I see people in love, I think of you
The thought of you is so divine
You'd bring me flowers when I tell you you can be mine
And that's how it'll start

If I see blue skies above, I think of you
When I see people in love, I think of you
The thought of you is so divine
You'd bring me flowers when I tell you you can be mine
And that's how it'll start

[Chorus: Future]
Pardon me, I been actin' lil' poor
Pardon me, I been still actin' poor
Pardon me, I been actin' lil' poor
Pardon me, I been still actin' poor (EarDrummers)
Pardon me, I been still actin' poor

Pardon me, sippin' lean at the store (Mike WiLL, Mike WiLL)
Pardon me, I been still actin' poor
Pardon me, sippin' stain at the store
Carbine sittin' on the seat and the floor
Carbine sittin' on the seat and the floor
Barkin', I put that knife on your throat
Torture, I'ma set fire to that ho
Walk in designer, head down to the toe
Name the strip club, I throw it

[Post-Chorus: Future]
Hittin' that throat, she a G.O.A.T.
Smashin' that throat, she a G.O.A.T.
Feelin' like an igloo now
Goons ready to hit you now

[Verse 1: Lil Yachty]

Let them fuck niggas know who really get foul
Four hundred thousand right now (Right now)
Four hundred thousand on me right now (Yeah)
Pull up on the scene, tryna hit it right now
I wrap the Bentley in snow (Yeah)
Pull up at the house, she waitin' outside, the lil' bitch is ready to go
Got a Sig Sauer, it's brown like boot
It's still my brother, that nigga the truth, nigga the truth
Twenty-five thousand for eight of my teeth
Three thousand dollars for each every tooth
In too close, pull back the top, shoot out the roof (Brrt), go poof
I'ma start puttin' these bitches on MARTA
I'ma stop puttin' broke hoes on charters
Brother too muddy, he been through too much
If you standin' and talkin', might black out the water
I was twenty years old with six different whips
Perfect good health, but bought ten different scripts (Woo)
Dawg, it's cheaper to boot her out
When niggas be flexin', nah, this ain't the same
Promise it's more for my shit plain
Niggas ain't P's, be lookin' like change
Don't you forget who showed you more
Showed you the life and you thought it was strange
Had the driver pick your ass up from LaGrange
In a black Range, I forgot bad hoes could be lame

[Chorus: Future & Lil Yachty]
Pardon me, I been actin' lil' poor (Hoo)
Pardon me, I been still actin' poor (Hoo)
Pardon me, I been actin' lil' poor (Hoo)
Pardon me, I been still actin' poor (Woo)

Pardon me, sippin' lean at the store

[Verse 2: Future]
Pardon me, I'm 'bout to shit on this beat
Pardon me, I just went crazy on a freak
Pardon me, I cook that bon appétit
Pardon me, I bought Chanel for ten G's
Just for the pills and my syrup and my weed
Pull out that Lam', I got somewhere to be
I'm on that, she like
Hit from the back and go deep and go
I'm on that, she on that
We on that, they on that
Crocodile spillin' all over the burp
Bought her a Birk', could've went bought a vert
Sippin' on syrup got my cup turnin' purp'
Pardon me, I got my side bitch on fleek
Swiped out the AP and bought the Philippe
Baguettes on her ankle, she walk so elite
Flex double C's and she with them big B's
Double my cup, man, I'm gone on that E
VVS cut, she done turned to a freak
Drivin' the Rolls and I came out on a key
Play with that drum like I'm Tommy Lee
Count up that money, I might just OD
I took the R out of free, charge a fee
Me and Lil Yachty done caught us a thottie

[Chorus: Future]
Pardon me, I been still actin' poor
Pardon me, sippin' stain at the store
Carbine sittin' on the seat and the floor
Carbine sittin' on the seat and the floor

Torture, I'ma set fire to that ho
Walk in designer, head down to the toe
Name the strip club, I throw it

Hittin' that throat, she a G.O.A.T.
Smashin' that throat, she a G.O.A.T.
Feelin' like an igloo now
Goons ready to hit you now

[Verse 1: Protoje]
And I said get on your feet and live
Nothing but strength and blessings I bring
And this one for all my queens and kings
We are royalty, yup, they know dem ting
I feel like the world really needs some change
This can't be right, whole ting feel so strange
Right now, all that we need is love
Some empathy, yes, the season's up

[Chorus: Alicia Keys]
They said I'll never make it
The dreams I'm chasing
I'm all alone
I am destined for greatness
Time to embrace it
Breaking the mold

[Verse 2: Alicia Keys]
Now they gonna see us
When you start out, they gon' give you love
But you find out what you're really worth
Then you go hard and you deal it rough
They gonna try and take it all away
Can't nobody take it all away
Nah-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah
Hurt, and you love
And you hurt and you’ve had enough

[Chorus: Alicia Keys]
They said I'll never make it

[Outro: Chronixx]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
No, no, no, no, no, no
Yeah, oh-oh-oh, ooh-ooh

[Verse 1]
'Twas a dark day in Dallas, November '63
A day that will live on in infamy
President Kennedy was a-ridin' high
Good day to be livin' and a good day to die
Being led to the slaughter like a sacrificial lamb
He said, "Wait a minute, boys, you know who I am?"
"Of course we do, we know who you are"
Then they blew off his head while he was still in the car
Shot down like a dog in broad daylight
Was a matter of timing and the timing was right
You got unpaid debts, we've come to collect
We're gonna kill you with hatred, without any respect
We'll mock you and shock you and we'll grin in your face
We've already got someone here to take your place
The day they blew out the brains of the king
Thousands were watching, no one saw a thing
It happened so quickly, so quick, by surprise
Right there in front of everyone's eyes
Greatest magic trick ever under the sun
Perfectly executed, skillfully done
Wolfman, oh Wolfman, oh Wolfman, howl
Rub-a-dub-dub, it's a murder most foul

[Verse 2]
Hush, little children, you'll understand
The Beatles are comin', they're gonna hold your hand
Slide down the banister, go get your coat
Ferry 'cross the Mersey and go for the throat
There's three bums comin' all dressed in rags
Pick up the pieces and lower the flags
I'm goin' to Woodstock, it's the Aquarian Age
Then I'll go over to Altamont and sit near the stage
Put your head out the window, let the good times roll
There's a party going on behind the Grassy Knoll
Stack up the bricks, pour the cement
Don't say Dallas don't love you, Mr. President
Put your foot in the tank and then step on the gas
Try to make it to the triple underpass
Blackface singer, whiteface clown
Better not show your faces after the sun goes down
Up in the red light district, like a cop on the beat
Living in a nightmare on Elm Street
When you're down on Deep Ellum, put your money in your shoe
Don't ask what your country can do for you
Cash on the barrelhead, money to burn
Dealey Plaza, make a left-hand turn
I'm going down to the crossroads, gonna flag a ride
The place where faith, hope, and charity died
Shoot him while he runs, boy, shoot him while you can
See if you can shoot the invisible man
Goodbye, Charlie, goodbye, Uncle Sam
Frankly, Miss Scarlett, I don't give a damn
What is the truth, and where did it go?
Ask Oswald and Ruby, they oughta know
"Shut your mouth," said a wise old owl
Business is business, and it's a murder most foul

[Verse 3]
Tommy, can you hear me? I'm the Acid Queen
I'm riding in a long, black Lincoln limousine
Ridin' in the back seat next to my wife
Headed straight on in to the afterlife
I'm leaning to the left, I got my head in her lap
Oh Lord, I've been led into some kind of a trap
Where we ask no quarter, and no quarter do we give
We're right down the street, from the street where you live
They mutilated his body and they took out his brain
What more could they do? They piled on the pain
But his soul was not there where it was supposed to be at
For the last fifty years they've been searchin' for that
Freedom, oh freedom, freedom over me
I hate to tell you, mister, but only dead men are free
Send me some lovin', then tell me no lie
Throw the gun in the gutter and walk on by
Wake up, little Susie, let's go for a drive
Cross the Trinity River, let's keep hope alive
Turn the radio on, don't touch the dials
Parkland Hospital, only six more miles
You got me dizzy, Miss Lizzy, you filled me with lead
That magic bullet of yours has gone to my head
I'm just a patsy like Patsy Cline
Never shot anyone from in front or behind
I've blood in my eye, got blood in my ear
I'm never gonna make it to the new frontier
Zapruder's film, I've seen that before
Seen it thirty-three times, maybe more
It's vile and deceitful, it's cruel and it's mean
Ugliest thing that you ever have seen
They killed him once and they killed him twice
Killed him like a human sacrifice
The day that they killed him, someone said to me, "Son
The age of the Antichrist has just only begun"
Air Force One comin' in through the gate
Johnson sworn in at 2:38
Let me know when you decide to throw in the towel
It is what it is, and it's murder most foul

[Verse 4]
What's new, pussycat? What'd I say?
I said the soul of a nation been torn away
And it's beginning to go into a slow decay
And that it's thirty-six hours past Judgment Day
Wolfman Jack, he's speaking in tongues
He's going on and on at the top of his lungs
Play me a song, Mr. Wolfman Jack
Play it for me in my long Cadillac
Play me that "Only the Good Die Young"

Take it to the limit and let it go by
Play it for Carl Wilson, too
Looking far, far away down Gower Avenue
Play "Tragedy", play "Twilight Time"
Take me back to Tulsa to the scene of the crime
Play another one and "Another One Bites the Dust"
Play "The Old Rugged Cross" and "In God We Trust"
Ride the pink horse down that long, lonesome road
Stand there and wait for his head to explode
Play "Mystery Train" for Mr. Mystery
The man who fell down dead like a rootless tree
Play it for the reverend, play it for the pastor
Play it for the dog that got no master
Play Oscar Peterson, play Stan Getz
Play "Blue Sky," play Dickey Betts
Play Art Pepper, Thelonious Monk

All that junk and "All That Jazz"
Play something for the Birdman of Alcatraz

Play Number nine, play Number six
Play it for Lindsey and Stevie Nicks

Play "Stella by Starlight" for Lady Macbeth
Don't worry, Mr. President, help's on the way
Your brothers are comin', there'll be hell to pay
Brothers? What brothers? What's this about hell?
Tell them, "We're waiting, keep coming," we'll get them as well
Love Field is where his plane touched down
But it never did get back up off the ground
Was a hard act to follow, second to none
They killed him on the altar of the rising sun
Play "Misty" for me and "That Old Devil Moon"
Play "Anything Goes" and "Memphis in June"
Play "Lonely at the Top" and "Lonely Are the Brave"
Play it for Houdini spinning around in his grave
Play Jelly Roll Morton, play "Lucille"
Play "Deep in a Dream", and play "Driving Wheel"
Play "Moonlight Sonata" in F-sharp
And "A Key to the Highway" for the king on the harp

Play "Darkness" and death will come when it comes
Play "Love Me or Leave Me" by the great Bud Powell
Play "The Blood-Stained Banner", play "Murder Most Foul"

Bottle, tonic, gin mixed in
Snoop house shoes, getting down in the kitchen
Ayy, I'ma socialize at a distance
I'm living my best life, minding my business (My business)
And my antisocials for the win, win
Locked down, I'ma stay stayin' in, in (In, in)

Ohh yeah, yeah
Ooh ahh, ahh

[Verse 1: The Weeknd]
Why you rushing me, baby? It's only us, alone
I don't want to die tonight, baby, so, let me sip this slow
I'll give you what you called for, just let me get in my zone
I'll be making love to her through you
So, let me keep my eyes closed

[Pre-Chorus: The Weeknd]
And I won't see a damn thing, I can't feel a damn thing
But I'ma touch you right, oh-ooh
I won't see a damn thing, I can't feel a damn thing
But I'ma touch you right, oh-ooh, yeah

I'ma touch you right (Let me get inside my zone)
I'ma touch you right, (Oh, yeah, just let me)
Ohh ahh, ahh
Ooh yeah

[Verse 2: Drake]
Whoa, all these broken hearts on that pole
Man, if pole dancing's an art
You know how many fuckin' artists I know?
Got some new bills in the mail
Got some big favors I owe
Got some good things ahead of me
When these bad bitches let go, well, girl, let's go
Walk your broken heart through that door
Sit your sexy ass on that couch
Wipe that lipstick off of your mouth, I take it slow
She in love with my crew
She said make enough so I can try some
I thought taking drugs just ain't you
Be you (Be you), yeah girl, just be you
And I do this shit for my hometown
It being going down, it ain't new
That's that north north, that up top
That OVO and that XO
Your girlfriend at our next show
But it's all good, don't stress though
First night fuck, never really planned it
Take a deep breath, no one need to panic
Lips so French, ass so Spanish
She don't really like attention
I don't know if she gon' manage out here
But she got me all up in my zone
Said she like the view I got in this place
Shit, I did all of that on my own, aw yeah

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
I'ma touch you right, ohh yeah
(Just let me sip this slow)
Ooh, I'ma touch you right
(Let me get inside my zone)
Ooh, I'ma touch you right

Ohh ahh, ahh
Ooh yeah

I'ma touch you right, ooh baby

Ooh-hoo, I'ma touch you right, ooh yeah

Ohh ahh, ahh
Ooh yeah

Aries

[Verse 1: 2-D]
I'm looking out at a volcano
Trying to read the world today
And see where you're at
I never do that
I'm a model that is uncomplicated
You can play a happy tune on me
But don't turn me off
'Cause then I am silent

[Verse 2: 2-D]
I'm standing on a beach in the distance
And even though you're far away
Can you see my red light?
It's waiting to turn green
'Cause I feel so isolated without you
I can't play a happy tune on my own
So stay by my side
High or low tide

[Chorus: 2-D & Peter Hook]
High tide, high tide, high tide, high tide
High tide, high tide, high tide, high tide, high
And it feels like I'm falling in, again
High tide, high tide, high tide, high tide
High tide, high tide, high tide, high tide, high
Feels like I'm falling in, again

[Verse 3: 2-D]
I'm a model that is uncomplicated
You can play a happy tune on me
But don't turn me off
'Cause then I am silent

[Chorus: 2-D & Peter Hook]
High tide, high tide, high tide, high tide
High tide, high tide, high tide, high tide, high
And it feels like I'm falling in, again
High tide, high tide, high tide, high tide
High tide, high tide, high tide, high tide, high
Feels like I'm falling in, again

[Verse]
Honestly, I don't know where I’ll be
In a couple years, hope I fulfil my fantasy
There'll be no tears, someday it'll work out
Work out for me
I know it's gettin' closer
Close to see

[Chorus]
If I start to be myself
Every single day of my life
Something tells me that I'm gonna be alright
If I ever lose myself
All my friends will be by my side
Nothing's ever gonna change the way I feel

[Post-Chorus]
If you got a minute, if you got a minute
Promise that I won't change
If you ever want it, if you ever want it
Call out my name

[Refrain]
When I was younger
I would call on my brother
Now he calls on me for a little bit of sunshine
Some peace of mind
My only advice
Never think twice
Follow you heart
If you get lost, go back to the start
Woo-woo-woo, ooh, ooh

[Chorus]
If I start to be myself
Every single day of my life
Something tells me that I'm gonna be alright
If I ever lose myself
All my friends will be by my side
Nothing's ever gonna change the way I feel

[Post-Chorus]
If you got a minute, if you got a minute
Promise that I won't change
If you ever want it, if you ever want it
Call out my name

[Refrain]
When I was younger
I would call on my brother
Now he calls on me for a little bit of sunshine
Some peace of mind
My only advice
Never think twice
Follow you heart
If you get lost, go back to the start
Woo-woo-woo, ooh, ooh

[Chorus]
If I start to be myself
Every single day of my life
Something tells me that I'm gonna be alright
If I ever lose myself
All my friends will be by my side
Nothing's ever gonna change the way I feel

[Post-Chorus]
If you got a minute, if you got a minute
Promise that I won't change
If you ever want it, if you ever want it
Call out my name

[Verse 1]
I been tryin' hard to find the words to say (Find the words to say)
If we tried again, we'd make the same mistakes (Ooh yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah)

[Pre-Chorus]
Asphyxiated (Asphyxiated)
I'll never make it (I'll never make it)
Without my baby, oh-ooh-oh
So I fill the void, I know you do the same
Oh, ooh-ooh-ooh, oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
Nothing compares to the emptiness we both share (Yeah)
And nobody cares like you do (Oh yeah)
You asked for my heart, but I didn't know where to start (Oh no)
But they won't think of you like I do (Ooh, ooh)

[Verse 2]
I try my best to not get high again (Oh, baby, I can't get high again)
But I've been stuck inside this place for days on end (La-da-da-da-da-da-da-da)

[Pre-Chorus]
Intoxicated (Intoxicated)
I'll never make it (I'll never make it)
Without my baby, oh-ooh-oh
So I fill the void just like I did back then
Oh, ooh-ooh, oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
Nothing compares (No), to the emptiness we both share (No, no, no)
Nobody cares like you do (Like you do, ooh yeah)
You asked for my heart (Heart), but I didn't know where to start (No, no, no, ooh)
But they won't think of you like I do (Ooh, ooh)

[Bridge]
I seen darker days (Woah), tryna keep my faith (Oh)
I sin too much to pray for you (For you)
Even when it's great (Woah), I still walk away (Oh)
I couldn't even change for you (For you, you)
If you're the air I need (Hey), I'm dying just to breathe
I hope that you're not dying too (Oh, oh, you)
Tryna keep my faith (Oh)
I sin too much to pray for you (For you, nah, nah)

[Chorus]
Nothing compares (Nothing compares, baby)
To the emptiness we both share (Nothing compares, baby)
Nobody cares (Nobody), like you do (Nobody, nobody), oh yeah (Oh)
You asked for my heart (You asked for my heart)
But I didn't know where to start (Didn't know where to start)
But they won't think of you like I do (Oh, oh)

[Verse 1]
We fight every day and night
You want me to make the time
You always get mad and say what you coulda had
And that you want me to make it right, uh
I couldn't do that to save my life
You always tell me you ain't surprised
You said it's the last time, I guess that you were right
'Cause I'ma do one with you tonight

[Chorus]
And now I'm so sick of these love songs, so sad and slow
And I'm so sick of wishin' I had you on my own
And oh, baby, I've been fucked up ever since you've been gone
I can't bring myself to even pick up my phone
I need you the most, I need you the most
I need you the most, I need you the most, I need you the most

[Verse 2]
I ain't gon' lie, oh, baby I've been fucked up
I said I was sorry for all of the times I fucked up
Fuck love, got me thinkin' while I pour my cup up
Tonight is in memory of you, I'm gettin' fucked up
Oh, just one more chance to make it right
Promise I got you, so tell me what's up?
I don't think that I can keep goin' this way
I can't take it

[Chorus]
Now I'm so sick of these love songs, so sad and slow
And I'm so sick of wishin' I had you on my own
And oh, baby, I've been fucked up ever since you've been gone
I can't bring myself to even pick up my phone
I need you the most, I need you the most
I need you the most, I need you the most, I need you the most

[Intro: Drake]
Ayy, yeah
Pipe this shit up and I turn this shit up
When I was down, I was down
Now them diamonds for fun like damn
Ayy, yeah

[Verse 1: Drake]
Trendsetter, Ben Frank' getter (Yeah)
Whip whatever, whip whatever
I buy diamonds when I’m under pressure (Yeah)
When I apply it, shit don't ever let up, yeah
Look, I'm in the cut, The Boy in the cut
Jump in the whip where the ceilings go up, we up
All of this grindin’ for what?
It's funny when you niggas thought it was luck
I cannot give you a pass if you play with my money and family and friends
And I compete with myself while you niggas competin' with trends
Your foreign is used, I looked up the VIN
I know the truth, no use in pretendin' with him

[Chorus: Drake]
Still in the cut, The Boy in the cut
Hop in the whip where the ceilings go up, we up

[Verse 2: Roddy Ricch]
And I'm way up at the top of the loft
Gotta stay up, ain't no knockin' me off
Pull up smooth, A.I. with the cross (Haha)
Countin' up wins on wins on wins, for all of my dawgs I lost
I might call Pharrell, get the new Chanel
Thugger got the YSL, huh
I remember when the Feds did the sweep, I pray my dawgs didn’t tell, huh
Cruisin’ down Biscayne
I was in Miami, she gave me top with the top off
Cartier wrist gang, got her a Audemar
She got the head, knock your socks off
You ain't gettin’ money, you ain't fuckin' with me
You ain't in your bitch top five
I might pull up in the Six with Drizzy
I was just in Houston, fuckin’ with the mob ties
We don't never ever play two sides
Hang out the Phantom, it's suicide
They ridin' my wave like a rogue tide
My necklace is wet like the poolside

[Chorus: Drake, Drake & Roddy Ricch]
Still in the cut, The Boy in the cut, yeah
Hop in the whip where the ceilings go up, we up

[Intro]
Yeah
Yeah, ayy

[Verse 1]
It was meant to happen, the most trusted going triple platinum
Link with Mac, link with Fee, if I'm down in Baton
Link with Tez, link with Zhii, when I'm down in Jackson
Just got back, overseas I was the main attraction
This ain't them, this is me, so you know what's crackin'

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I mean there's not even a doubt, you know what I'm about
Before I made it out, I said, "I've got to make it out"

[Chorus]
And I did, I did, I really did
Switch up the sentiment, rappin' on instrumentals
That's how I paid the rent
LA, at a big event
Been ten years, niggas hated him, now they cavin' in
Now, wait a minute

[Verse 2]
I mean maybe I'm confused, 'cause I thought that we was enemies, yeah
The big you is like a mini me
Like BIG U, man, I'm a legend in my city streets, yeah
Niggas peep, I wrote this shit while I was whippin' streets
Like fuck the law, I dropped Adonis off and pick a beat, yeah
Ballin' by the beach, like Miami Heat, yeah
Presidential suites, we don't get impeached
I talked to God standin' up straight, I don't get on my knees
That isn't me, that's not the person I was raised to be
Just wait and see

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Shit is jumpin' in my bank account
You know what I'm about
Before I made it out, I said, "I've got to make it out"

[Chorus]
And I did, I did, I really did
Switch up the sentiment, rappin' on instrumentals
That's how I paid the rent
LA, at a big event
Been ten years, niggas hated him, now they cavin' in
Now, wait a minute

[Intro: Nipsey Hussle]
Hit-Boy
G. Ry got me
Look

[Verse 1: Nipsey Hussle]
Fuck rap, I'm a street legend, block love me with a deep reverence
I was birthed in a C-section
Hella cops and police presence
We got opps so we keep weapons, we on y'all block while y'all eat breakfast
A lot of shots, we broke street records
Watch how you talk, I got reflexes, watchin' your cheap necklace
Then we slide out the East exit
But every time we get to fuckin' niggas up, TMZ catch it
Y'all still learnin' street lessons?
From the mastermind, first you master grind, then your team catch it
This time it’s for the money, I don't need credit
And I'm the don 'cause the streets said it, look

[Chorus: Nipsey Hussle, Big Sean & Both]
Fuck rap, I'm a street legend
And I'm the don 'cause the streets said it
Block love me with a deep reverence (Yeah, woah)
And I'm the don 'cause the streets said it (Yeah)

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
And I got pressure on me
Seven days a week, it's game seven on me
Life'll test you out, you live through that, that's testimony
Givin' them hell, but how in the hell I got all these blessings on me?
Most of the girls I know addicted to social media
All the time they put in, they could've wrote encyclopedias
Mama said it only takes one time to fuck up your whole Wikipedia
And as your son, I can see the type of light that you see me in
After what happened to Nipsey, I reached out to Kendrick
It wasn't even no real issues there to begin with
Lack of communication and wrong information
From people fueled by their ego, it's like mixin' flames with diesel
Energy crazy, I realized that it's a two-way street
What's comin' is goin', if it don't give you more, it drains you
Should be a billionaire based on the time off I'm not takin'
Probably why this shit with me get crazy and we lost a baby
And everybody around me think I'm the one
But we all just one of ones, and I'm walkin' out the crib
They ask me where I'm goin', I told them, "I'm going on another ten-year run"
Niggas is bangin' over blocks that they don't own, thinkin' that's home
Boy, you think that's where you from? You don't really know where you from
You don't how deep your roots is or what your ancestors had done
So, God bless all of the sons and daughters
Who knew they history so they knew where to take it farther
And all the ones that stuck with me like good barbers
Lookin' at my life story, God's a good author
Never was the loudest in the room, we move like ninjas
And if it cost your peace of mind, it might be too expensive
So I can't give you everything that you want from me for free though
Get you one shot in life, you might not be able to reload
So advanced, I need all my advances
Bro hit me up for cash like we didn't have the same chances
My dad hit me up like, "Why I don't live in a mansion?"
I'm tryna focus, but baby girl keep holdin' my mind for ransom
And that ain't how it supposed to be, this man Hov got to a B
And his name Shawn too, I almost felt like it was me
Damn, I realized all my setbacks were inside of me
In high school, I learned chemistry, biology
But not how to cope with anxiety
Or how I could feel like I'm by myself on an island
With depression on all sides of me (Damn)
With a Glock seventeen right on the side of me (Hol' up)
Look, I ain't think I had the thought of suicide in me
Until life showed me all these different sides of me
Too many times I thought the reaper was outside for me (Ooh)
And how the fuck it's people that never met me that hate me?
I wonder if they understand that I meditate daily
And feel like my life purpose is to give inspiration
Despite the hit songs that there's just no escapin'
That I take care of my family and beat the odds that were deadly
You hate that, that just reflects your lack of succession, bless 'em
If it ain't Nipsey blue, it's Detroit blue
This that Detroit 2, I'm bringin' it back to my hood like d-boys do
Gone (Gone)

[Outro: Nipsey Hussle & Comic J Will]
So, the collaboration though, with Nipsey and who?
Aw man, I'd probably say Payroll, eh, or Tee Grizzley
Me and Big Sean talked about doin' somethin' recently, too
So, you know, all of them, I'ma, I'ma tap in with all of Detroit
Fuck rap, I'm a street legend
Block love me with a deep reverence
*Lyrics from Snippets*

[Verse: Jay Electronica]
Got a couple nicknames
...know your bones aching

[?]

[Verse: Action Bronson]
Like a bluesman

[Verse: Drake]
...the offer you give me was preposterous
Papi, this bird won't fly, you sold me an ostrich
I'm just another nigga tryna keep his money up
I'll wipe that smirk off your face, you think it's funny, huh?

[Chorus: Drake]
I ain't playin' my nigga, go ahead and giggle
But bullets don't tickle
If you think you playin' with Elmo, hell no

[Verse 1]
If it was colors and shapes, the imaginary
Instead of all of this weight that we have to carry
Would you be able to breathe?
And if you could just find where that comfort resides
No distraction or movement that fucks with your mind
Would you let them see?
While beneath the ocean I met with the captain
Who sank to the floor on his ship
All of his passengers escaped to safety
But he was not done with his trip
He looked up and smiled, asked me ''how do you do?''
I told him I'm losing my grip
He told me ''son, if you want to hold onto yourself
Then let yourself slip''

[Hook]
Fall
Ooh
Fall
Oh
Fall
Oh, it feels good to fall

[Verse 2]
These puzzles are so hard to make into pictures
Of something that they'll understand
They could open their eyes, still be blind to the beauty
But march on the heart of this land
Oh oh, why don't you turn around and go home?
They invade your minds and then fill them with nonsense
These things that a man doesn't need
Take out the love and the passion and hope
And they fill it with nothing but greed
While floating through galaxies they said I couldn't
I noticed how sad one can get
Cause the ignorant mind is so peaceful I find
I can't understand nothing no more
If I jump let me fall
If I jump let me fall

[Hook]
Fall
Ooh
Fall
Oh
Fall
Oh, it feels good to fall

[Chorus: T-Pain]
Yeah, I know you waitin' on another one
So girl here go the other one
Now grind on me while ya snap ya fingaz
Snap ya fingaz, snap ya fingaz
I know you waitin' on a special song
So you and your nigga can get it on
Now grind on him while ya snap ya fingaz
Snap ya fingaz, snap ya fingaz, yeah

[Verse 1: T-Pain]
Shawty, lady, what it Mountain Dew?
I can call you later, I can go out with you
If you snap ya fingaz
It look so sexy when you do it 'cause you're doin' it good
I need all my babies, report to the parkin' lot
Chevys and Mercedes, everybody lean and rock
Snap ya fingaz, I see you doin' it
That's just how we do in my hood

[Chorus: T-Pain]

D-D-Daytrip took it to ten (Hey)

[Chorus]
Lookin' for a handout, get the fuck out my face, bitch I'm—
I'm good, I'm good, I'm good
Check came for the

It's full, it's full, it's full, it's full
Lovelight down, I'm back on my wrestler shit
I should, I should, I should, I should
Fuck what you thought, 

[?] the cutter
I'm good, I'm good now, I'm good, I'm good

[Verse]
Went from ragtop bitches, to them five star bitches, I’m the shit now
Three white cars like grits, now
Sign language on me, when I pop my shit now, damn
And I keep green eggs and ham in my bank account
Kick her out after I get that top
She claim I ate her out, that’s lies, put that on my guys
Most these bitches Pi’s that’s on God
I ain’t ever paid, she asked for a five I said no (Nah)
She asked for five, I gave her high five
Took that bitch to Five Guys, cup, doubled up
Sippin’ on a pint of Tie Dye
King of the teens, not no prince, I ain’t Cyi High
No, I just bought a brand new Philippe, that’s your goals
I just fucked your bitch, she was on the Adderall
Put me in the game, 99 my overall
I got 99 thousand in my overalls
I’m not with that bullshit, nope, not at all
Stand on my wallet, yup, I’d be very tall
I could fuck your bitch, even if my dick was small
She in love with clout, she gon’ come and fuck us all
Yup, nigga if I said it I meant it
All of my cars, they be tinted
Tinted, but not rented
If I want guap out, trust me girl I need interest
Interest, I’m not interested at all
If it ain’t bout’ the guap, don’t call
If you not givin’ that pussy girl, don’t stall
Yeah, beat from the back with your hands on the sink
Winter time, walk around with a mink
Neck look like a ice rink, watch look like a lightning bolt
Thirty thousand on the coat
Bitch you know it’s Lil Boat (Lil Boat)
I said that, I meant that, don’t forget that
Went from hitchhike takin’, to the Bentley coupe skatin’
I’m the shit now, twenty K or more for a pic now
No longer safe, gotta walk with the stick now, oh
I just bought myself another cup for the rose
I’m about to skrt, skrt, skrt on them hoes
Whip so exquisite, leave it plain on them hoes
Walk up in the club, make it rain on them hoes, yup
Yup, nigga if I said it I meant it
All of my homes they be scented, scented but not tainted
Bitch had saw Boat, and that bitch had damn near fainted, fainted
I’m not interested at all
If it ain’t bout’ the guap, don’t call
If you not givin’ that pussy girl, don’t stall
If you not givin’ that pussy girl, don’t stall

[Verse 1]
I realized, I belong to you
I feel the darkness when away from you, ayy-ayy

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't stop your lovin', walk out on me
Don't stop for nothin', you're what I bleed
I learned to love you, the way you need
'Cause I know what's pain, this is not the same

[Chorus]
I'd be nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing without you
Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing
I'd be nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing without you
Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing

[Post-Chorus]
I was too busy tryna find you with someone else
The one I couldn't stand to be with was myself
'Cause I'd be nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing without you
Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing

[Verse 2]
Pick up your phone, do you love me? (Oh)
If I die tonight, would you regret it, whoa-whoa?

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Don't stop your lovin', it's all I have
Don't stop for nothin', do it on time
But what I'm before, you know what happens
'Cause I know what's pain, this is not the same

[Chorus]
I'd be nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing without you
Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing
I'd be nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing without you
Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing

[Post-Chorus]
I was too busy tryna find you with someone else
The one I couldn't stand to be with was myself
'Cause I'd be nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing without you
Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing

[Outro]
When I feel the love, did it safely
It's just everyone, ooh, yeah
Not makin' up, 'cause I'm insane
Now we know, on me, me
I'd be nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing without you
Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing
Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing without you
Without you, without you, without you

[Verse 1]
Nine-to-five in London town
I know I'm ready
They talk about my dreams
Here I'm in love already
Thirteen now, let's move out
The parents house, let's go alone
Fifteen then, and since then, I never look back home

[Pre-Chorus]
In a world of my own
I'm in the danger zone
Living in the madness, got no time for sadness
God, you're so loud
I couldn't hear my mouth
Living with the motion, no control
Just devotion

[Chorus]
I won't ever stop 'til I touch the sky
Whoa, whoa
I won't stand alone 'til I win the fight
Whoa, whoa
'Cause I've been on my own, I've been here alone
And I've been on my own for too long
I've been on my own, I've been here alone
I've been on my own for too long
Too long

[Verse 2]
Bright city lights, they're shining bright
They're falling on me
I'm drawn in like a firefly, can't see so clearly
The musical the trees are we smoking heavy all night through
Through eighteen now, don't look down
Dizzy heights for you now

[Pre-Chorus]
In a world of my own
I'm in the danger zone
Living for the high life, never have to think twice
God, you're so loud
I couldn't hear my mouth
Living in the fast lane, this could be a game change

[Chorus]
I won't ever stop 'til I touch the sky
Whoa, whoa
I won't stand alone 'til I win the fight
Whoa, whoa
'Cause I've been on my own, I've been here alone
And I've been on my own for too long
I've been on my own, I've been here alone
I've been on my own for too long

[Verse 3]
I’m in the city light, we yell our lines
If we can’t fight late, then we doublin’ our fines
(Double, double)
I’m gettin’ money, but I’m doublin’ my mind
When I was gettin’ it, I would double up on the credit
But now a fool gonna want a bath with it
Do a song, have a joke, have a laugh with it
(Laugh with it)
I ain’t out here sayin’ what it’s gonna be
No way, ‘cause I’m back where I wanna be
Heatwave will (Will)
I’m mentally ill (Ill)
Life, it looks good, but it’s fallin' uphill
You’re gettin’ green weed
When you forget the mil’ (Yes)
Forget the pills, but remember bills
Fill this hole in this sky like a parachute
I had a rugged heart when I never hollowed you
So when I had another you
I was like “Oh, god, gotta work hard
Laugh when it’s underused”

[Chorus]
'Cause I've been on my own, I've been here alone
I've been on my own for too long
I've been on my own, I've been here alone
I've been on my own for too long
I've been on my own, I've been here alone
I've been on my own for too long
I've been on my own, I've been here alone
I've been on my own for too long
I've been on my own, I've been here alone (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
I've been on my own for too long (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
I've been on my own, I've been here alone (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
I've been on my own for too long
**LYRICS FROM SNIPPET**

[Verse 1: Tory Lanez]
Its so, its so easy
Living your life, the way you want it
Its so, its so easy
Spending your nights, the way you want it, aye
And know that you got no one that does you like
I do and who you got right now can't fuck you like
I do and you got that type that I, seem to like
And it feels like I missed my chance
So lets dance, one more time
Cause you might think you need someone brand new

[Verse 1]
Pick a card
Yeah, I know
Time feels like it's changed, I don't feel the same
Live on Mars
Fuck it up
Emas eht leef t'nod I, degnahc s'ti ekil sleef emiT

[Refrain]
Stop the tube
Kick the head

[Chorus]
(Hit, hit, hit, hit, hit, hit, hit, hit)
Hit that shit, go hit that shit
Hit that shit, go hit that shit
Hit that shit, go hit that shit
Hit that shit, go hit that shit
Hit that shit, go hit that shit
Hit that shit, go hit that shit
Hit that shit, go hit that shit
Hit that shit, go hit that shit

[Verse 2]
Pick a card
Yeah, I know
Time feels like it's changed, I don't feel the same
Try your best
Yeah, I know
Emas eht leef t'nod I-I-I ,--s'ti ekil sleef emiT

[Chorus]
(Hit, hit, hit, hit, hit, hit, hit, hit)
Hit that shit, go hit that shit
Hit that shit, go hit that shit
Hit that shit, go hit that shit
Hit that shit, go hit that shit
Hit that shit, go hit that shit
Hit that shit, go hit that shit
Hit that shit, go hit that shit
Hit that shit, go hit that shit

[Interlude]

[Chorus]
(Hit, hit, hit, hit, hit, hit, hit, hit)
Hit that shit, go hit that shit
Hit that shit, go hit that shit
Hit that shit, go hit that shit
Hit that shit, go hit that shit
Hit that shit, go hit that shit
Hit that shit, go hit that shit
Hit that shit, go hit that shit
Hit that shit, go hit that shit

[Verse 1]
Well, I touch down and run to my connection
Man in the gift shop called me a fag
I feel up my tucked-up erection
There's a pressure all over my head
And I know this is how I get paid, but
It's not really how I wanna get laid, so
Hundred forty when I last got weighed
And I'm gonna lose more by Saturday

[Chorus]
And they're playing your song on the radio station
Mugging me off all across the nation
If you don't eat, then you'll never grow
I should've learnt that quite a while ago
I know it gets hard sometimes
Making out with people that you don't like
I know you don't feel alright
But you look just fine to me

[Verse 2]
Well, I pissed myself on a Texan intersection
With George spilling things all over his bag
And I took shit for being quiet during the election
And maybe that's fair, but I'm a busy guy
I get stoned and go where I get paid, but
It's not really how babies get made, so
I'll take a minute when I think I won't die from stopping
Oh, I'm just a busy guy

[Chorus]
And they're playing your song on the radio station
Mugging me off all across the nation
If you don't shoot, then you'll never know
You should've learnt that quite a while ago
I know it gets hard sometimes
Taking out your shit on the ones you like
You know, I didn't feel alright
Until you spoke to me

[Bridge]
You, I've been waiting for you
My whole life, waiting for you
I've been waiting for you

[Outro]
Well, I'm gonna get a gun but it's for my protection
Or maybe I'll get myself a fun knife

[Chorus]
Life feels like a lie, I need something to be true
Is there anybody out there?
Life feels like there's something missing, maybe it's you
Is there anybody out there?

[Verse 1]
I never fucked in a car, I was lying
I do it on my bed, lying down, not trying
Apathy for me is an issue, you see
I just talk about the things upsetting me
And I get somewhere, I don't like it
Get somewhere, change my mind, eh
Get somewhere but don't find it
I don't find what I'm looking for

[Bridge]
Yes, and if they catch you slippin'
Trippin' over your fibbing and elicit
A ribbing over how they think you should be livin'
That's life, kind of, maybe take some time off
You can't live in denial of setting it right
Because if nothing is revealed, everything denied
Learn up yourself before you talk it
They need to see you walk it
You don't fuck with your poor fans
You need the rich ones to expand your floor plans

[Verse 2]
You can't figure out a heart, you were lying
You're doin' in my head with your non-stop trying
Never gettin' sleep and forgettin' to eat
I pretend that all these things agree with me
And I get somewhere but don't like it
Get somewhere, change my mind, eh
Get somewhere but don't find it (Find it, find it, find it)
I don't find what I'm looking for

[Chorus]
Life feels like a lie, I need something to be true
Is there anybody out there?
Life feels like there's something missing, maybe it's you
Is there anybody out there?

[Outro]
Life feels like a lie, I need something to be true
Is there anybody out there?
Life feels like there's something missing, maybe it's you
Is there anybody out there? (Out there)

[Intro]
I'm a loser
I'm a loser
And I'm not what I appear to be

[Verse 1]
Of all the love I have won or have lost
There is one love I should never have crossed
She was a girl in a million, my friend
I should have known she would win in the end

[Chorus]
I'm a loser
And I lost someone who's near to me
I'm a loser
And I'm not what I appear to be

[Verse 2]
Although I laugh and I act like a clown
Beneath this mask I am wearing a frown
My tears are falling like rain from the sky
Is it for her or myself that I cry?

[Chorus]
I'm a loser
And I lost someone who's near to me
I'm a loser
And I'm not what I appear to be

[Harmonica and Guitar Solos]

[Verse 3]
What have I done to deserve such a fate?
I realise I have left it too late
And so it's true, pride comes before a fall
I'm telling you so that you won't lose all

[Chorus]
I'm a loser
I'm a loser
And I'm not what I appear to be

There were bells on a hill
But I never heard them ringing
No, I never heard them at all
Till there was you

[Verse 2]
There were birds in the sky
But I never saw them winging
No, I never saw them at all
Till there was you

[Bridge]

They tell me in sweet fragrant meadows
Of dawn and dew

[Verse 3]
There was love all around
But I never heard it singing
No, I never heard it at all
Till there was you

But when I get home to you
I find the things that you do
Will make me feel alright

[Verse 2: John Lennon]
You know I work all day
To get you money to buy you things
And it's worth it just to hear you say
You're gonna give me everything
So why on earth should I moan
'Cause when I get you alone
You know I feel okay

When I'm home everything seems to be right
When I'm home feeling you holding me tight, tight, yeah

Will make me feel alright
Ah!

You know my temperature's rising
And the jukebox blows a fuse
My heart's beating rhythm
And my soul keeps singing the blues
Roll over Beethoven
And tell Tchaikovsky the news

[Verse 3: George Harrison]
I got a rocking pneumonia
I need a shot of rhythm and blues (Woo)
I think I caught the arthritis
Sitting down by the rhythm revue
Roll over Beethoven
Rocking in two by two

[Verse 4: George Harrison]
Well if you feel it and like it
Well get your lover and reel and rock it
Roll it over and move on up
Just a trifle further and reel and rock it
Roll it over
Roll over Beethoven
Rocking in two by two (Woo)

[Verse 5: George Harrison]
Well early in the morning
I'm a-giving you the warning
Don't you step on my blue suede shoes
Hey diddle diddle
I'll play my fiddle
Ain't got nothing to lose
Roll over Beethoven
And tell Tchaikovsky the news

[Verse 6: George Harrison]
You know she wiggles like a glow worm
Dance like a spinning top
She's got a crazy partner
Oughta see 'em reel and rock
Long as she got a dime
The music will never stop

[Outro: George Harrison]
Roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven
Dig to these rhythm and blues

Loving, don't ask me why

[Chorus]
Just let me hear some of that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's got to be rock and roll music
If you want to dance with me
If you want to dance with me

[Verse 1]
I've got no kick against modern jazz
Unless they try to play it too darn fast
And lose the beauty of the melody
Until they sound just like a symphony

[Chorus]
That's why I go for that that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's got to be rock and roll music
If you want to dance with me
If you want to dance with me

[Verse 2]
I took my loved one over across the tracks
So she can hear my man a wailin' sax
I must admit they have a rocking band
Man, they were blowing like a hurricane

[Chorus]
That's why I go for that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's got to be rock and roll music
If you want to dance with me
If you want to dance with me

[Verse 3]
Way down South they had a jubilee
Them Georgia folks they had a jamboree
They're drinking home brew from a wooden cup
The folks dancing there are all shook up

[Chorus]
And started playing that rock and roll music
Any old time you use it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
Got to be rock and roll music
If you want to dance with me
If you want to dance with me

[Verse 4]
Don't care to hear them play a tango
And in the mood they take a mambo
It's way to early for a congo
So keep a rocking that piano

[Chorus]
That's why I go for that rock and roll music
Any old time you use it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
Oh, you got rock 'n roll music
If you want to dance with me
If you want to dance with me

Valet the ride, got your bitch in my ride
And she all on me like shit to a fly

And my bitch is a dime, and my Nike size nine

Black skittle on the bezel, wrist candy, two hundred racks

[Chorus]

Mmm, she gon' lick the rapper (Ay)

Tap, tap that pussy, then I do my dance

[Chorus]
Ay, bitch I'm in the town, like Ben Affleck

(We Got London On Da Track)

[Verse 1]
They told us it was good
For us we truly never understood
Two times a day, ten years
Lab rats in cages, they're feeding us their fear
Is there something wrong?
With us they suppressed what made us special all along
Did you swallow your meds?
Routines so their schemes get stuck in our head
Don't question it

[Chorus]
Will this make me good?
Will this shit make me good?
Will this make me good?
Will this shit make me good?

[Verse 2]
Why do we trust these fools?
Profiting from drugging the youth
With systems of control
Intentions make us all the same
But don't give into the master plan
Burn it down, light that shit up in flames

[Chorus]
Will this make me good?
Will this make me good?
Will this shit make us good?
What will it take to make us good?

[Verse 1]
The bees in my heart make honey for me
The bees in my heart make honey for me
Following the bird, the bird
I could give it all with hive mind
Following the ones who move with fire
Slowly we all bend like a tarantula runs
Following the sun, the sun
I could give it all and gently devour
Following the ones who move in silence
Nomadic as whales, monolithic as they come

[Chorus]
And they all go
They all go, they all go
They all go, they all go
They all go, and I will go
I will go, I will go
I will go

[Verse 2]
Empty of fear, stoic as crocodile
Dance in the thousands
Like sand in gathered time
And if you're moving all your life
If your land and mother language is occupied
All the spirits of the past will hold your hand
And lift your head
And gave you your life
And it falls out like
Honey pouring out
Honey pouring out
Honey pouring out
Honey pouring out
Honey pouring out
Honey pouring out

[Chorus]
They all go, they all go
They all go, they all go
They all go, they all go
And I will go, and I will go
I will go, I will go

[Outro]
Ah, they all come
Ah, they all come
Ah, they all come
Ah, they all come
Ah, they all come
Ah, and they will go
Ah, they all come
Ah, and they will go

[Verse 1]
Oh, we have fallen
As a whole
And we're sinking
Down a hole
Without thinking
About our loved ones
Who might be shrinking
Into a sunken space
With glass surrounding
The powers
That are pounding
In their temple
In their mind
There seems to be a complexity
To being kind
To your space
To your temple
To your neighbors
Who've seen the changes
We all feel change
Some of us wear masks
To hide the pain
And I just wish I could ask

[Chorus]
Qadir
Oh, what's the deal now?
What did you plant in your mother's garden?
Qadir
Oh, I miss you dearly
What did you plant in your mother's garden?

[Verse 2]
Oh, hemos sidos esclavos
To these systems
That project false beauty
Exorcisms
Burning out of my body
This dependency don't help nobody
We're sitting in dark rooms
With bags on our heads
Waiting for God to touch us
We just wanna be closer
It's overwhelming
Some of us wear masks
Because some can't adapt
Oh, I just wish I could ask

[Chorus]
Qadir
Oh, what's the deal now?
What did you plant in your mother's garden? (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Qadir
Oh, I miss you dearly
What did you plant in your mother's garden? (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah (Yeah Yeah)

[Verse 1]
Seek a mastermind
A seer who can provide a sign
I've been tryna find
Peace
'Cause I've been bouncing off these walls, I can't sleep
She was walking towards me
Her form was faintly morphing
I said, "Please
Say something"
She grabbed my hand and disappeared
Sinking down these thoughts at night
The scent of you spills through my mind
I've been tryna find 
Peace
'Cause I've been bouncing off these walls, I can't sleep

[Verse 2]
All these lonely strangers
Marching through the snow storm
Trying to get to work on time
Trying to get to work on time
Sinking down these thoughts at night
The scent of you spills through my mind
I've been tryna find 
Peace
'Cause I've been bouncing off these walls, I can't sleep

[Chorus]
All these lonely strangers marching through the snow storm
Tryna find some peace of mind, we all keep bouncing
All these lonely strangers marching through the snow storm
Tryna find some peace of mind, we all keep bouncing
All these lonely strangers marching through the snow storm
Tryna find some peace of mind, we all keep bouncing
All these lonely strangers marching through the snow storm
Tryna find some peace of mind, we all keep bouncing

[Chorus]
All the limbs in her are changing
Growing pain, the hope is fading
Can we bring her love back to health?
We've been guests here for a while
The mortal power lives in style
But everything comes to an end
Some have felt it in her eyes
Cities burning, tides that rise
She's in pain, she's been hurting
Can you feel our mother raging?
She'll flood us out, her heart is flaming
Pretty soon we'll be underwater

[Verse]
Pretty soon we'll be drifting in the ocean
And we'll grow scales so we can breathe
We'll start growing again in the motion
Of her womb, she'll fill our lungs with the sea
We'll be floating through the current and we'll see
New York under our feet

[Chorus]
All the limbs in her are changing
Growing pain, the hope is fading
Can we bring her love back to health?
'Cause we've been guests here for a while
The mortal power lives in style
But everything comes to an end
Some have felt it in her eyes
Cities burning, tides that rise
She's in pain, she's been hurting
And can you feel our mother raging?
She'll flood us out, her heart is flaming
Pretty soon we'll be underwater

[Outro]
Oh
Oh, she will drown us
She is raging
Growing pains
Hope is fading
She will drown us
She is raging
Growing pains
Hope is fading
She will drown us
She is raging
Growing pains
Hope is fading

[Verse 1]
Darlin', what's the deal now?
I've been singing to you
Come here, wipe your face
Can't say we ain't been here before
It's been so damn hard to breathe
In a world that's so damn cold and mean

[Verse 2]
Darling, let's disappear for a while now
Let's find ourselves a home down south
Deep down
Tryna get my head out the clouds
Deep down

[Verse 3]
Darling, sometimes I feel like this world ain't for me
So many folks live care-free
Can't trust anyone anymore 
It's been so damn hard to find some peace
In a world that's so damn cold and mean

[Verse 4]
Baby girl, I'll protect you 'til my last hour
All these instruments around hold strange powers
All these instruments hold strange powers
Bathing us in sound showers
I'll protect you 'til my last hour
All these instruments around hold strange powers

[Verse 1]
Oh, oh
Oh, I never wanna lose one's to blame
Oh, I never wanna make you go insane
This place is making me go crazy
What's it inside of me, tryna tell me
I just wanna get back
And support my family
Fuck all the other shit, that's all that matters to me
Since they point down south
Down south
Try and make sure that you can get over your own bullshit

[Chorus]
'Cause there's nothing more that I wanna give to you
There's nothing that I would do for you

[Verse 2]
I'm sitting right down here
And I'm surrounded by velvet
Oh, I feel so nice right now
Oh, I wanna get naked with you I can't help it
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, ooh
Something tells me, don't ever fuck with it
I'm not one to blame, no
All you motherfuckers think that we're insane
But wanted something real
What's the use?

[Verse 1]
This town has really started to grow on me
My face has become one with the concrete
My limbs have rashes from the road
My voice sounds like
The screaming train
That you’ve been riding
Oh dear, is this where you’ve been hiding?
Come on now let’s go back home

[Verse 2]
This town by the sea will one day drown me
Six drinks in and I start to sink
But your voice is the sound that saves me
God damn I wish my baby was here
'Cause I have violence
Lingering inside but you help me fight it
Come on now let’s go back home

[Instrumental Outro]

[Verse 1]
Concrete roads wait for me
They’re the veins in this machine we feed
That will never sleep
That will never sleep
Bring her flowers that make her laugh and eyes bleed
Get out and ride around violently
Come rain or shine
Doing God’s work

[Chorus]
And this kind of work is hard
But somebody's got to do God’s work
And this kind of work is sparse
But somebody's got to do her dirty work

[Verse 2]
Don’t ask me
For anything but flowers
'Cause we don’t dabble with them other powers
But I know someone who knows someone
And if you want me to say
And help you rearrange your mind
I have something that will help you sleep at night
Oh it'll help you sleep at night

[Chorus]
This kind of work is hard
But somebody's got to do God’s work
And this kind of work is sparse
But somebody's got to do her dirty work

[Bridge]
Oh, oh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Oh, ooh
Got to do her dirty work
Oh, ooh ooh ooh, ooh-ooh
Got to do her dirty work
Ooh ooh ooh

[Outro]
Concrete roads wait for me
They’re the veins in this machine we feed
That will never sleep
That will never sleep
Bring her flowers that make her laugh and eyes bleed
Get out and ride around violently
Come rain or shine
Doing God’s work

[Verse 1]
Rip it all apart and carefully dissect your mess
Re-organize and try to find your self-love that you've suppressed
All the pieces that you're looking for lay at your feet
And no one else can clean this mess
Get up, dissect it piece by piece
I was told that I was holding a long lived curse
Trapped down by my father's, father's line
It's leaving, I feel it moving out
I refuse to wear this mask
That you tied on my face
I need you to look in my eyes and watch what I'm releasing out this cage

[Chorus]
Seeing double
I'm seeing double, seeing double
I'm seeing double, I'm seeing double
I'm seeing double, I'm seeing double
I'm seeing double, I'm seeing double
I'm seeing double, I'm seeing double
I'm seeing double, I'm seeing double
I'm seeing double, I'm seeing double
I'm seeing double, I'm seeing double
Double, double

[Outro]
Rip it all apart and carefully dissect your mess
Re-organize and try to find your self-love that you've suppressed

[Verse 1]
You were smiling cheek to ear (Woo)
A distorted mess with love in your heart
I'm so proud that we're here
And you poured me a glass (Woo)
Of precious wine you kept sealed in the back of your mind
I've been out of (Woo) my head
The warmth of your hands gently arrived and reeled me in (Woo)
I just pray we don't crash (Woo)
I just wanna lay here while it lasts
Time's been moving fast (Woo)

[Chorus]
I stopped abusing myself around you
I started using myself around you
I stopped abusing myself around you
I started using myself around you

[Verse 2]
You were smiling cheek to ear
But this studded mess with love in your heart (Woo)
I'm so proud that we're here
And you poured me a glass (Woo) of precious wine you kept sealed in the back of your mind
I just hope we don't crash
I just wanna lay here while it lasts
Time's been moving fast (Woo)

[Chorus]
(Woo, woo)
I stopped abusing myself around you (Oh, oh-oh-oh)
I started using myself around you
(I started using myself)
I stopped abusing myself around you
(I started using myself)
I started using myself around you
(I started)

[Outro]
(Woo, woo)
I started using myself
I started using myself around you
I stopped abusing myself around you
I started using myself around you
I Don't need anyone, except my cat
She's the only one that knows where i'm at
But I know, I know
If I get out of bed today
Maybe get through all three meals
Maybe it'll be okay

Where's my happy days?
How do I get there, how do we get there?
It's written on your face
We got all my time to spare, all my time to spare
With you
I never worried bout mornings or afternoons
Who knew the days were slipping away
And I hope, I hope
My will is stronger than I think
Maybe just to prove me wrong
Maybe cause I'm scared to say

Where's my happy days?
How do I get there, how do we get there?
It's written on your face
We've got all my time to spare, all my time to spare
I miss the memories that's all

[?]
And I miss my sense of balance in the cold

[?]

[?]

[?]
If it were up to me I'd always be in love
Always be in love

[Chorus]
I've watched it pass on by, I've never said a word
Now regret comes to mind and, oh, how it hurts
No more escaping this, I gotta leave my mark
And if forever takes, forever takes too long I'll let you know

[Post-Chorus]
No more escaping this, I gotta leave my mark
And if forever takes, forever takes, forever takes forever
I will not let it pass 'cause in my past that's what hurt me the most
So if it takes forever, takes forever, takes forever I'll let you know

[Verse 1]
Sweet ocean liner, come and anchor down
Sea of forgiveness, see what I have found
It's long and lanky, awkward at times
I'm going nowhere if you get the time

[Pre-Chorus]
And it's a long hard road until I can get to you
And I'll be holding on, hoping the sun comes shining through

[Chorus]
I'm going nowhere, if you got the time
I'm going nowhere, you're on my mind

[Verse 2]
I took to driving, to see what I would find
A place in history, a little peace of mind
I know what you're thinking
I know just what you mean
I'll never be whole again until I get clean

[Pre-Chorus]
And it's a long hard road until I can get to you
And I'll be holding on, hoping the sun comes shining through

[Chorus]
I'm going nowhere if you got the time
I'm going nowhere you're on my mind
I'm going nowhere won't you stop by?
I'm going nowhere if you got the time

[Chorus]
I'm going nowhere if you got the time

Boom bap bumpin' out the bass
And we still poppin' out the state, no trace
So expensive, he got it by the waist
Left hand said pop it in your face, no case
Barely make no difference if I am home or away
First-class tickets come along for the day
Ain't no trippin' if you flirtin'
Roll call flippin' off the birdy, brring, krrr
A1 cookin', so much love on the plate
A1 drippin', like the sauce on the steak

Whole thing poppin' on a Thursday

'Cause she love when I choke her, huh
Red mink on her coat, huh
Red mink drop on the floor when she walk
Walk with a stick
Sticks and red tips on her wig
That lil bitch must think she Lil' Boat
She got my vote
That hoe give me hope
That hoe give me hopes
That's how it should go
Fans, friends, then again, the diamonds dance
Come here, give me a lil' chance
Hold it and I'll hold by the hand, clans

[Chorus]
Everything you wanna
Everything you want you can have
I'm just for the moment
I was caught up in the moment, yeah
Tell me how you want it
Hope it's everything you wanted, yeah
Just rest on, my baby
Jasmine in the air
the burden of fame is real
never felt so clear

Because the sweetness and one noteness of honeysuckle and Jasmine on the first day of spring always stand in such a stark contrast to the layers of chaos and duality that fame has brought to my life

Call me dramatic but it's the first thing i think of when i see or smell something that is unmistakably itself- something that can't be interpreted in any other way but one way

What a gift for a flower to invoke only one smell and one sense of romance
With no disdain or melancholy attached to its fragrance

And to be enjoyed for free
and for that reason unable to be evaluated

[Intro: Lil Flip]
Ladies and gentlemen!
This is the remix, Houston's finest
Lil' Flip, Beyonce holla at 'em

[Verse 1: Lil Flip]
Posted up in the back of the party girl
'Cause I don't wanna good girl,I wanna naughty girl
I like ya style and ya body girl
And we can leave the spot in my Maserati girl
Anything you need I got it girl
Cause I'm connected my game perfected
I'm reppin' Texas everytime I spit
This ain't a one night stand I wanna make you my chick (yea)

[Verse 2: Beyoncé]
You're sexy, tonight I am all yours, boy
The way your body moves across the floor
Feelin kind of n-a-s-t-y
I just might take you home with me
Baby the minute I feel you're energy
You're vibe's just taken over me
Start feelin' so crazy babe
Lately I feel the funk coming over me
I don't know what's gotten into me
The rhythm's got me feelin' so crazy babe

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
Tonight I'll be your naughty girl
I'm callin all my girls
We gonna turn this party out

I see you look me up and down
And I came to party

[Verse 3: Beyoncé]
I'm feelin' sexy I wanna hear you say my name boy
If you can reach me
You can feel my burning flame
I'm feelin kind of n-a-s-t-y
I just might take you home with me
Baby the minute I feel you're energy
You're vibe's just taken over me
Start feelin' so crazy babe
I feel the funk coming over me
I don't know what's gotten into me
The rhythms got me feelin' so crazy babe

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
Tonight I'll be your naughty girl

[Verse 4: Lil Flip]

You know I want ya,I ain't playin wit ya mind

So holla at Lil' Flip when you ready to roll (woah!)

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
Tonight I'll be your naughty girl

[Outro: Lil Flip]
Houston is in the building
Lil Flip, Beyoncé
You know how we do it

[Pre-Chorus]
Who needs love? (Uh, yeah)
Yeah, who needs love? Ayy

[Chorus]
When I got these diamond VVS's on my neckpiece
Big pointers all in my bezel, call it my bestie
I spent a hundred and thou' and all countin'
Money make me happy every time I count it
Who needs love, when I come around flexin'?
I don't need no lovin' from any one of my exes
I don't need no stressin', phone call, textin'
Don't kiss me, bitch, kiss my necklace

[Post-Chorus]
Who needs love? Ayy
Baby, who needs love? Ayy

[Verse 1]
I got 20/20 vision when I see her
Pulled up in the Lamb', should've pulled up in the BM
Rippers in my denim 'cause a young nigga was flexin'
And if we end it early, baby girl, then it was destined
I even had to stop, answerin' your calls
A nigga had you trappin' with the scammers and the dawgs
Drivin' over border with the hammers in the car
When the cops pulled me over, would've hand it to my dawgs
I mean, who needs love with these hammers in my fists?
And she gon' fuck me over, give a damn about a bitch
Debit, credit cards on me, slammin' in this bitch
Don't wanna take her back, she did the damage in this bitch
Tell me, who needs love?

[Pre-Chorus]
Who needs love? (Uh, yeah)
Yeah, who needs love? Ayy

[Chorus]
When I got these diamond VVS's on my neckpiece
Big pointers all in my bezel, call it my bestie
I spent a hundred and thou' and all countin'
Money make me happy every time I count it
Who needs love, when I come around flexin'?
I don't need no lovin' from any one of my exes
I don't need no stressin', phone call, textin'
Don't kiss me, bitch, kiss my necklace

[Post-Chorus]
Who needs love? Ayy
Baby, who needs love? Ayy

[Verse 2]
I said, I was doin' wrong back when you was livin' right
Cool a couple milli' sittin' with me on the flight, ayy
Tryna get me back and fuckin' niggas out of spite
And you sittin' on that nigga dick when it don't sit right with ya
Had to tell her, look here though
You could fuck a thousand niggas, only thing that's finna be hurt is your pussy, ho
And if I get at it, baby girl, you know I'm superstar status
Don't you ever try to play me like a rookie, though
Big, big dreams got you sittin' in a mansion
Laid up in my covers while you thinkin' 'bout expansion
Can't believe you even fucked that nigga, he a random
Had me embarrassed to tell the story to the mandem
Shawty, I ain't worried 'bout no nigga drip, I'm drippin' the best
The Cullinan seats orange, 'cause it's drippin' Hermès
No matter what she tellin' you, fuck, I dicked her the best
Fuck the drama, I put dick in her chest, yes

[Chorus]
'Cause when I got these diamond VVS' on my neckpiece
Big pointers all in my bezel, call it my bestie
I spent a hundred and thou' and all countin'
Money make me happy every time I count it
Who needs love, when I come around flexin'?
I don't need no lovin' from any one of my exes
I don't need no stressin', phone call, textin'
Don't kiss me, bitch, kiss my necklace

[Post-Chorus]
Who needs love? Ayy
Baby, who needs love? Ayy
Lyrics from Snippet:

[Verse]
Right now I'm sitting in my room writing a song
It’s never felt like home here but I guess it's not far off
Mom is in the kitchen and my clothes are on the floor
Homesick disposition, with one foot out the door
And I live in the suburbs, but it's a quick drive into town
I pretend it’s New York City when no one else is around
And there's parents and their kids there in the lawn
I forgot that in a year it'll be gone

[Chorus]
I miss this, but I'm living it
Wish I could grab life by the shoulders
And scream, "I'm sick of getting older"
'Cause I miss this, but I'm living it
One day I'll move on, one day I’ll move out
And I’ll wish that I was where I am right now
Lyrics from Snippet:

[Verse]
Your hand on my leg under the oil painted sky
Wind blowin' through our hair on the 405
And traffic's at a standstill, it's LA, what'd you expect?
We're listenin' to Zeppelin, you're kissin' my neck
You cradle me in your arms in the dark in the back
We're lookin' at the stars, the moon's lit Cheshire cat
And your parents can probably see from the window
They'll say, "They're just kids, so what the hell do they know?"

[Chorus]
Scared, I love you so much I'm scared
'Cause they say young love's a loss or it's a lesson
Here, I always wanna be here
My heart is tellin' me we're gonna be the exception

[Verse 1]
We broke up a month ago
Your friends are mine, you know I know
You've moved on, found someone new
One more girl who brings out the better in you
And I thought my heart was detached
From all the sunlight of our past
But she's so sweet, she's so pretty
Does she mean you forgot about me?

[Chorus]
Oh, I hope you're happy
But not like how you were with me
I'm selfish, I know, I can't let you go
So find someone great, but don't find no one better
I hope you're happy, but don't be happier

[Verse 2]
And do you tell her she's the most beautiful girl you've ever seen?
An eternal love bullshit you know you'll never mean
Remember when I believed
You meant it when you said it first to me?
And now I'm pickin' her apart
Like cuttin' her down will make you miss my wretched heart
But she's beautiful, she looks kind
She probably gives you butterflies

[Chorus]
I hope you're happy
But not like how you were with me
I'm selfish, I know, I can't let you go
So find someone great, but don't find no one better
I hope you're happy
I wish you all the best, really
Say you love her, baby
Just not like you loved me
And think of me fondly when your hands are on her
I hope you're happy, but don't be happier

[Bridge]
Ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

[Chorus]
I hope you're happy
Just not like how you were with me
I'm selfish, I know, can't let you go
So find someone great, but don't find no one better
I hope you're happy, but don't be happier

[Intro: The Notorious B.I.G.]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
And ya don't stop, and ya won't stop
And ya don't stop

[Verse 1: The Notorious B.I.G.]
I was a terror since the public school era
Bathroom passes, cutting classes, squeezing asses
Smoking blunts was a daily routine
Since 13, a chubby nigga on the scene
I used to have the trey-deuce
And the deuce-deuce in my bubblegoose
Now I got the Mac in my knapsack
Lounging black, smoking sacks up in Ac's and Sidekicks
With my sidekicks rocking fly kicks
Honeys want to chat
But all we wanna know is where the party at
And can I bring my gat?
If not, I hope I don't get shot
Better throw my vest on my chest, 'cause niggas is a mess
It don't take nothing but fronting for me to start something
Bugging and bucking at niggas like I was duck hunting
Dumbing out, just me and my crew
'Cause all we wanna do is

[Chorus: Faith Evans]
Ladies from front to back
Sipping on Champagne glass
It's all where the party's at
(It's where the party's at)
Ladies creeping their ride
Pimping and getting high
To be where the party's at

[Verse 2: The Notorious B.I.G.]
Hugs from the honeys, pounds from the roughnecks
Seen my man Sage that I knew from the projects
Said he had beef, asked me if I had my piece
Sure do, two .22s in my shoes
Holler if you need me, love, I'm in the house
Roam and stroll, see what the honeys is about
Moet popping, ho hopping
Ain't no stopping Big Poppa
I'm a Bad Boy
Niggas wanna front, who got your back? (Biggie!)
Niggas wanna flex, who got the gat? (Biggie!)
It ain't hard to tell I'm the East Coast overdose
Nigga you scared you're supposed to
Nigga, I toast ya, put fear in your heart
Fuck up the party before it even start
Pissy drunk, off the Henny and skunk
On some Brand Nubian shit beating down punks

[Chorus: Faith Evans]
Ladies from front to back
Sipping on Champagne glass
It's all where the party's at
(It's where the party's at)
Ladies creeping their ride
Pimping and getting high
To be where the party's at

[Verse 3: The Notorious B.I.G.]
Bitches in the back looking righteous
In a tight dress, I think I might just
Hit her with a little Biggie 101, how to tote a gun
And have fun with Jamaican rum
Conversation, blunts in rotation
My man Big Jock got the Glock in his waist and
We're smoking, drinking, got the hooker thinking
If money smell bad, then this nigga Biggie stinking
Is it my charm? I got the hookers eating out my palm
She grabbed my arm and said "Let's leave calm"
I'm hitting skins again
Rolled up another blunt, bought a Heineken
Niggas start to loc out, a kid got choked out
Blows was thrown and a fucking fight broke out
Can't we just all get along?
So I can put hickies on her chest like Little Shawn
Get her pissy drunk off of Dom Pérignon
And it's on, and I'm gone, that's that

[Chorus: Faith Evans]
Ladies from front to back
Sipping on Champagne glass
It's all where the party's at
(It's where the party's at)
Ladies creeping their ride
Pimping and getting high
To be where the party's at

[Intro: The Notorious B.I.G. & Tim Westwood]
Uh
Check it out, uh
That's some flavour in the place (Uh, check it out)
Tell 'em what's the deal baby
Alright then, so boy, if you got the box playing on record at home, now's the time to catch the tape
Just representing one of the families, we getting ready Sunday night, no question (Uh)
Notorious B.I.G

[Verse 1: The Notorious B.I.G.]
Who throw gats to Guiliani?
Flows tighter than pigeon punani, try me, die G
Dangerous, since my daddy bust me out the tip of his dick
Biggie Smalls with the Wickedest shit
Spit clips, niggas split like bananas
Flavour like Tropicana; orange, mango, peach
I strangle each
Negro for they dough
Niggas get to bendin', got two cases, one pending
560 V-12 engine, niggas swimmin'
In 929 Mazdas, Tammy and Natasha
The menage-a-trois is at my crib
Like Ill and Al Skratch smokin' 50 sacks in the back of Ac's
Windows cracked, so sit back relax
Craig, crush the hash, the Beretta's in the stash

[Verse 2: The Notorious B.I.G.]
Went from construction Timbs to Acs with rims
Flipping mixtapes to bitches feeding me grapes
Peep my mind state, Big Poppa flow is lethal
That weed make my ass wanna kill four people!
Forget the dames, gimme the range and the wain
My niggas up the pawn drop top jag walls
Blindfold you when you step in the car
That's the superstar status apparatus, more wings than clutches
Cease roll the hash, it's in the pocket with the nine
Lick off the wine as my seats recline
I want a presidential Rollie
So I crush MC's, the guacamole making Robin scream "Holy Molly!"
Big Poppa, off the caper, I'm that paper crusader
Playing Sega in a widebody blazer
And if you don't know now you know
My flow you pick like an afro
Wet like Soul Glo

[Bridge: The Notorious B.I.G. & Craig Mack]
Uh, you don't stop (Ugh)
Come on, let's keep going

Check it, Biggie bring big bowls of beef
Backing bitch niggas down burners bring bundles of belief
Common thief slash drug chief, syndicated
Went from 10k to 24k, competition hated, J.M. sedated
Quarantine
B.I.G. for president, busting shots past your spleen
9 millimeter dreams, Mac 11 nightmares
Which MC's do you fear? Big Poppa, Junior M.A.F.I.A, nuff said
Niggas disrespect just I dead
I'm hot
You’re cold
You go around
Like you know
Who I am
But you don't
You've got me on
My toes (toes, toes)
I’m slipping into the lava
And I'm trying to keep from going under
Baby you turn the temperature hotter
Cause I'm burnin' up, burnin' up
For you baby
Come on girl
I fell (I fell)
So fast (so fast)
Can't hold myself back (back, back)
High heels (high heels)
Red dress (red dress)
All by yourself
Gotta catch my breath
I'm slipping into the lava
And I'm trying to keep from goin’ under
Baby who turned the temperature hotter
Cause I’m burnin' up, burnin’ up
For you baby
Walk in the room
All I can see is you
Oh
Staring me down
I know you feel it too
I'm slipping into the lava
And I'm tryin' to keep from goin under
Baby who turned the temperature hotter
Cuz’ I'm burnin' up, burnin' up
For you baby
Slipping into the lava
And I'm trying to keep from going under
Baby who turned the temperature hotter
Cause I'm burnin' up, burnin' up
For you baby
Burnin' up in the place tonight
And the brothers singing loud (and were feelin' right)
Get up and dance (don't try to fight it)
Big robs for real (and that's no lie)
Stop, drop and roll (and touch the floor, to keep from burnin' up)
More and more
I got JB with me (laying it down)
Come on boys bring the chorus around
I'm slipping into the lava (burnin' up, burnin' up)
And I'm trying to keep from going under (yeahhhh)
Baby who turned the temperature hotter (come on nick)
Cause I'm burnin' up
Burnin' up for you baby
Burnin' up, burnin' up
For you baby
My door
Is the scariest place on earth
I fear what is on the other side
But I love what is there, too
The balance of life in life
On me, I have armor and sword
On me, hang the hopes
On me, call the needy
On me, call the frail
On me, depend the palace
On me, depend the fragile
In this I rally
In this I prepare
Into that I go
My door is the scariest place on earth
For on the other side is me
And my sword and my armor and my hopes
On me, the cause are hung
On me, are the walls
My doors keep me not safe
My doors protect the ills from me
My door is the last chance for that which reared head and breathed fire and stole joy and ended youth
My door is the scariest of doors
To the malady and the kings
When it opens the world will shake, the hearts will fill
When it opens the winds will come with
And the light will shine off my armor and my sword
And the voices will rise and the calls will become hollas
And the temperature will soar, the arrows will strike me
I will be pierced
I will be overwhelmed
I will break
I will collapse
I will be consumed
But I will regain my footing
I will drag my armor my sword in the weight of the cause
Step by step, until I reach the door
The door of crisis
The door of malady
And I will close it

[Chorus]
Day to night to morning, keep with me in the moment
I'd let you had I known it, why don’t you say so?
Didn't even notice, no punches left to roll with
You got to keep me focused; you want it? Say so

[Verse 1]
It's been a long time since you fell in love
You ain’t coming out your shell, you ain't really been yourself
Tell me, what must I do? (Do tell, my love)
'Cause luckily I'm good at reading
I wouldn't bug him, but he won't stop cheesin'
And we can dance all day around it
If you frontin', I’ll be bouncing
If you want it, scream it, shout it, babe
Before I leave you dry

[Chorus]
Day to night to morning, keep with me in the moment
I’d let you had I known it, why don't you say so?
Didn’t even notice, no punches left to roll with
You got to keep me focused; you want it? Say so

[Verse 2]
Let me check my chest, my breath right quick (Ha)
He ain't ever seen it in a dress like this (Ah)
He ain't ever even been impressed like this
Prolly why I got him quiet on the set like zip
Like it, love it, need it, bad
Take it, own it, steal it, fast
Boy, stop playing, grab my ass
Why you actin' like you shy? (Hot)
Shut it, save it, keep it pushin’
Why you beating 'round the bush?
Knowin' you want all this woman
Never knock it 'til you try (Yah, yah)
All of them bitches hating I have you with me
All of my niggas sayin' you mad committed
Realer than anybody you had, and pretty
All of the body-ody, the ass and titties

[Chorus]
Day to night to morning, keep with me in the moment
I'd let you had I known it, why don't you say so?
Didn't even notice, no punches left to roll with
You got to keep me focused; you want it? Say so
Day to night to morning, keep with me in the moment
I'd let you had I known it, why don't you say so?
Didn't even notice, no punches left to roll with
You got to keep me focused; you want it? Say so

[Verse 1]
You hate the sand between your toes
I like the beach on a sunny day
I like pink margaritas
It appears you like beer
I like a foreign accent
You just say "What? What the hell they say?"
We got different perspectives
Night and day, but that's okay

[Chorus]
Sometimes I'd like to trade you in
For someone more like me
You tell me I was right again
We get on famously
Life would be boring without you to disagree
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah
(We agree to disagree)
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah
(We agree to disagree)
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah

[Verse 2]
You like to fight in silence
I like to scream while I'm breaking plates
You like the heavy metal
But I like songs to sing along to

[Chorus]
Sometimes I like to trade you in
For someone more like me
You tell me I was right again
We get on famously
Life would be boring without you to disagree
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah
(We agree to disagree)
Oh yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah
(We agree to disagree)
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah

[Bridge]
And I will, but you won't
And I do, but, but you don't
We won't budge either way
But we like it, we like it

[Chorus]
Sometimes I'd like to trade you in
For someone more like me
You tell me I was right again
We get on famously
Life would be boring without you to disagree
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah
(We agree to disagree)
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah
(We agree to disagree)
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah
(Let's agree to disagree)
Yeah, yeah, yeah

*Lyrics from snippet

Every night you were in my room
My room, my room with me

This 

[?]
Put the channel on advance
Went to China for some fashion
Went overseas so much the past year
I think I'm starting to catch an accent

No sleeper seats, that's a mattress
No sleeper seats, that's a mattress
You ain't stingy, split your tablets with me
You won't flinch when camera's flashing, flashing
Not fake laid back, no, it's natural
And I think you made for the life I lead
I'm not fake patient, I don't fake sick, huh

[Chorus: Thundercat]
Maybe we say bye for now
But I can't let go
You call me back and it brings me to my knees
I can give you what you want
And when it's said and done
There's always room for memories
There's nothing left to give
I remind that time will slip away
I know that there's no guarantees
But we still can dream and be in your deepest thoughts
I hope that you can find a way to let it go
Then we can move on

[Verse: Michael McDonald]
Do these dreams go anywhere?
Don't say I didn't care
And though it hurts to say goodbye
I know what love is for me
And if it's not bad for you
Leave alone what we could do

[Chorus: Thundercat & Michael McDonald, Both]
Maybe we say bye for now
But I can't let go
You call me back and it brings me to my knees (Give)
I can give you what you want
Then when said it's and done
There's always room for memories (Ooh, ooh)
There's nothing left to give (Nothing left to give you)

[Intro: The Weeknd]
Young Metro, Young Metro, Young Metro (Sheesh)
Ayy (Ayy)
Young Metro, Young Metro

[Verse 1: The Weeknd]
Never need a bitch, I'm what a bitch need (Bitch need)
Tryna find the one that can fix me
I've been dodgin' death in the six-speed
Amphetamine got my stummy feelin' sickly
Yeah, I want it all now
I've been runnin' through the pussy, need a dog pound
Hundred models gettin' faded in the compound
Tryna love me, but they never get a pulse down (Why?)

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
'Cause I'm heartless
And I'm back to my ways 'cause I'm heartless
All this money and this pain got me heartless
Low life for life 'cause I'm heartless
Said I'm heartless
Tryna be a better man, but I'm heartless
Never be a weddin' plan for the heartless
Low life for life 'cause I'm heartless

[Verse 2: Lil Uzi Vert]
She got me confused, I swear she got me mixed up (Woah)
I don't need you, girl, so I don't care if I slip up
Yes, I swear I'm heartless, more life, hold my wrist up
She rob me for my love, I feel like this a stickup (Freeze)
Yeah, it's Lil Uzi from the 16
Grade-A bank account, you know I'm with the A-team
Went up in my level, don't know why they hate me
I knew I was gonna be this way since eighteen
I heard she got that water, I'm tryna be waist-deep
I make her beg for it, make that girl want say please
Yes, too heartless, I get chilly in this Chrome fleece
I put emeralds in my Rollie, they don't even make these (Woah)

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
'Cause I'm heartless
And I'm back to my ways 'cause I'm heartless
All this money and this pain got me heartless
Low life for life 'cause I'm heartless
Said I'm heartless
Tryna be a better man, but I'm heartless
Never be a weddin' plan for the heartless
Low life for life 'cause I'm heartless

[Bridge: The Weeknd]
I lost my heart and my mind
I try to always do right
I thought I lost you this time
You just came back in my life
You never gave up on me (Why don't you?)
I'll never know what you see (Why won't you?)
I don't do well when alone (Oh yeah)
You hear it clear in my tone

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
'Cause I'm heartless (Ooh)
And I'm back to my ways 'cause I'm heartless
All this money and this pain got me heartless
Low life for life 'cause I'm heartless
Said I'm heartless
Tryna be a better man, but I'm heartless
Never be a weddin' plan for the heartless
Low life for life 'cause I'm heartless

Get ya fron row, take us to the Gun Show

You all up in my ear, without these heavy breathin'
Say My Name, Say My Name, fuck it
I guess the alcohol's to blame, I love it (Ha)

Blame it on the Goose, gotcha feelin' loose
Blame it on the 'Trón, got you in the zone

Blame it on the blue tap got you feeling dizzy
Blame it on the a-a-a-a-a-alcohol
Blame it on the a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-alcohol

[Verse 2: Jamie Foxx]
Ooh see, she spilled some drink on me
And now I'm knowin' she tipsy
She put her body on me
And she keeps staring me right in my eyes
No tellin' what I'm gon' do
Baby I would rather show you
What you been missin' in your li-i-i-ife
When I get insi-i-i-ide

[Pre-Chorus: Jamie Foxx]
Girl what you drinkin'? Gon' let it sink in
Here for the weekend, thinkin' we can
See where we could be if we press fast forward
Just one more round and you're down, I know it
Fill another cup up, feelin' on your butt, what
You don't even care now, I was unaware how
Fine you was before my buzz set in
My buzz set in

[Chorus: Jamie Foxx & T-Pain]
Blame it on the Goose, gotcha feelin' loose
Blame it on the 'Trón, got you in the zone
Blame it on the a-a-a-a-a-alcohol
Blame it on the a-a-a-a-a-alcohol
Blame it on the vodka, blame it on the Henny
Blame it on the blue tap got you feeling dizzy
Blame it on the a-a-a-a-a-alcohol (Uh-huh, T-Pain)
Blame it on the a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-alcohol

[Verse 3: T-Pain]
Girl, I know you feel good, just like you look
Couple more shots, you open up like a book
I ain't trippin (Cause I'ma read ya)
Shawty I ain't trippin' (I just wanna please ya)
I'ma take a shot of Nuvo, shawty then you know
It's going down, we can go and kick it like judo
You know what I mean
Shawty got drunk, thought it all was a dream
So I made her say ah, ah-ah
Now she got her hand on my leg
Got my seats all wet in my ride (All wet in my ride)
All over my ride (All over my ride)
She look me dead in the eye, eye-eye
Then my pants got bigger, she already knew what to figure
Had her lookin' at her boyfriend like, "Fuck that nigga!"

[Chorus: Jamie Foxx]
Blame it on the Goose, gotcha feelin' loose
Blame it on the 'Trón, got you in the zone
Blame it on the a-a-a-a-a-alcohol
Blame it on the a-a-a-a-a-alcohol
Blame it on the vodka, blame it on the Henny
Blame it on the blue tap got you feeling dizzy
Blame it on the a-a-a-a-a-alcohol
Blame it on the a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-alcohol

[Bridge: Jamie Foxx]
Now to the ballers poppin' bottles with they Henny in they cups
Screamin', "Money ain't a thang", if it ain't, throw it up
In the sky (In the sky)
And hold your drinks up high (High)
And to my independent mamas who can buy they own bottles
If you lookin' like a model, when them broke fellas holla
Tell 'em, "Bye" (Bye)
And hold your drinks up high

[Chorus: Jamie Foxx]
You can blame it on the Goose, gotcha feelin' loose
Blame it on the 'Trón, got you in the zone
Blame it on the a-a-a-a-a-alcohol
Blame it on the a-a-a-a-a-alcohol
Blame it on the vodka, blame it on the Henny
Blame it on the blue tap got you feeling dizzy
Blame it on the a-a-a-a-a-alcohol
Blame it on the a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-alcohol

Oh no, no
Oh no, yeah
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh (Oh, na-na-na)
Yeah, yeah, yeah (Yeah)

[Verse 1: T-Pain, with Chris Brown]
Sleepless nights tryna learn how to die in my sleep
'Cause I don't wanna be the one to wake up without a heartbeat, mm
Trust me, you're gonna love this thing, you'll see
Baby, just tell me you don't love me and I'll admit defeat
It ain't that deep, deep, deep, deep-deep, deep, no
You know I'd kill for some of your real feelings
Oh, no, it ain't that sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet-sweet, sweet, no
Just as long as you're the one who kills me

[Pre-Chorus: T-Pain & Chris Brown]

'Cause, girl, I keep comin' back home

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Oh my gosh, you tryna kill me in my sleep
Rough sex, makin' you my enemy, oh-woah-oh

I kinda like the fact that you kinda crazy
Yeah, you bipolar just like me
That ain't a problem, baby, no, no
Girl, you soakin' wet, 'cause I'm makin' it rain

Girl, you better play nice
Just wait for it, I'ma make you work this time, oh

[Pre-Chorus: T-Pain & Chris Brown]
'Cause I don't wanna wake up dead, wake up dead, wake up dead
'Cause I don't wanna wake up dead, wake up dead, oh-oh-oh
'Cause I don't wanna wake up dead
'Cause I don't wanna turn up missin'
But I can't get you out of my head
Baby, I just need you to listen

[Chorus: T-Pain & Chris Brown, T-Pain]
'Cause I don't wanna wake up dead, ooh-ooh (Dead, dead, dead)

'Cause I don't wanna wake up dead, ooh-ooh (Dead, dead, dead, oh-oh)
I'ma take twenty-three shots of Patrón
Girl, I keep comin' back home
And I don't wanna wake up

[Verse 3: T-Pain]
Oh-oh, oh
Asphyxiation got me losin' my brain
She's my grim reaper, I'm in love with death
It's only been twenty-four hours, I should probably go and get me some rest
But the way that time's been movin' backwards
I've been— Neeb ev'I sdrawkcab 'nivom neeb s'emit
Babe, babe, babe, babe-babe, babe (Yeah)
What the fuck?
Like, what's up?
Why you do me that way?
I can put my heartbeat in my head
You got me stayin' in this bed

[Pre-Chorus: T-Pain & Chris Brown]
'Cause I don't wanna wake up dead, wake up dead, wake up dead
'Cause I don't wanna wake up dead, wake up dead, oh-oh-oh
'Cause I don't wanna wake up dead
'Cause I don't wanna turn up missin'
But I can't get you out of my head
Baby, I just need you to listen

[Chorus: T-Pain & Chris Brown, T-Pain]
'Cause I don't wanna wake up dead, ooh-ooh (Dead, dead, dead)
If I ain't got you, then I'm already gone
Baby, don't leave me alone
'Cause I don't wanna wake up dead, ooh-ooh (Dead, dead, dead, oh-oh)
I'ma take twenty-three shots of Patrón
Girl, if you ain't comin' back home
Then I don’t wanna wake up

[Intro: Nicki Minaj]
So, what's a Barbie to do? I mean.. it's like...
It's like I'm the baddest Barbie in the fucking world, I mean
Come on now, it's Barbie bitch!
(sheesh, sheesh, stop, stop)

[Chorus: Aqua]
I'm a Barbie girl in the Barbie world
Life is plastic, its fantastic!
You can brush my hair, undress me everywhere!
Imagination, life is your creation!
Come on Barbie, lets go party!
Ah, ah, ah, yeah!
I'm a Barbie girl in the Barbie world
Life is plastic, its fantastic!
You can brush my hair, undress me everywhere!
Imagination, life is your creation!
Come on Barbie, lets go party!
Ah, ah, ah, yeah!

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Okay, I was on my way to school, I do's me
I hopped out the drab grabbed my juice-y
I hop skipped and jumped past them hoopdies
But wait, I forgot to grab my loose sleeves
I doubled right b-back like "Who's that?"
I did a little dance like b-kat-b-boom-kat
I like how the jocks be watching me, man
So I grabbed my crotch and said "hee-hee"
I be like bum stickety bum while I popped my gum
They looking dumb dickety dumb think they stopped in some
Uh, I said excuse me honey, I'm B-Bugs Bunny
No more funny - ain't got my carrots he ain't got nothing from me
'Cause we the Mean Girls "yes, we're so fetch"
And when we in the yard - be jumping double dutch
We Back To The Future - Pearl, you were the best!
Now I got everybody looking at me
I got everybody looking at me

[Chorus: Aqua]
I'm a Barbie girl in the Barbie world
Life is plastic, its fantastic!
You can brush my hair, undress me everywhere!
Imagination, life is your creation!
Come on Barbie, lets go party!
Ah, ah, ah, yeah!
I'm a Barbie girl in the Barbie world
Life is plastic, its fantastic!
You can brush my hair, undress me everywhere!
Imagination, life is your creation!
Come on Barbie, lets go party!
Ah, ah, ah, yeah!
I'm a Barbie girl in the Barbie world
Life is plastic, its fantastic!
You can brush my hair, undress me everywhere!
Imagination, life is your creation!
Come on Barbie, lets go party!
Ah, ah, ah, yeah!
Come on Barbie, lets go party!
Ooh-woah, ooh-woah!
Come on Barbie, lets go party!
Ah, ah, ah, yeah!
Come on Barbie, lets go party!
Ooh-woah, ooh-woah!

[Verse 2: ?]
She lives fantasies, my life's dreams are plastic
Her goals are stretched out, my goals arent elastic
Below average D's, same time, she's fantastic
She's the tip of the iceberg, I'm below water (gigantic)
She's a barbie girl - just perfect and flawless
Lives in Utopia, so care free - lawless
I'm stuck in hell, better yet, this place called Earth
Where humans degrade humans over materialistic worth
Where three dollar cotton turns into a three hundred dollar shirt
But Barbie, get that matching three hundred dollar skirt
Maybe it's Maybelline or maybe the people behind it
And if you don't understand that then you can just rewind it
It's okay, I can take some time and wait
'Cause I can spill my heart here but half of you can't relate
And turn around and just debate
Whether Nicki Minaj's verse is real or is it fake?

[Chorus: Aqua]
I'm a Barbie girl in the Barbie world
Life is plastic, its fantastic!
You can brush my hair, undress me everywhere!
Imagination, life is your creation!
Come on Barbie, lets go party!
Ah, ah, ah, yeah!
I'm a Barbie girl in the Barbie world
Life is plastic, its fantastic!
You can brush my hair, undress me everywhere!
Imagination, life is your creation!
Come on Barbie, lets go party!
Ah, ah, ah, yeah!
I'm a Barbie girl in the Barbie world
Life is plastic, its fantastic!
You can brush my hair, undress me everywhere!
Imagination, life is your creation!
Come on Barbie, lets go party!
Ah, ah, ah, yeah!
Come on Barbie, lets go party!
Ooh-woah, ooh-woah!
Come on Barbie, lets go party!
Ah, ah, ah, yeah!
Come on Barbie, lets go party!
Ooh-woah, ooh-woah!

[Outro: Aqua]
Oh, I'm having so much fun!
Well, Barbie, we're just getting started!
Oh, I love you Ken!

[Intro]
Hi, welcome

[Verse 1]
Lock jaw, quick speech
Couldn't hear you talkin' through the grinding of my teeth
Let's take a ride
I haven't left home in a while
Movie muscle, my bones ache
Lights, camera, action, take
It's not complicated, it's the truth
I spend my nights thinkin' of you

[Chorus]
You don't know me but I love you
We were meant to be
My angel baby on the big screen
Tell them who you need

[Post-Chorus]
Say it again, again, again, again
Again, again, again, again
Again, again, again, again
Again, 'gain

[Verse 2]
Stop by your job to see you in real life (Real life)
You must have thought that I'd forgot
Now revving up to retribution, spittin' blood on the pavement
Eyes shut in disillusion, maybe this can change it

[Chorus]
You don't know me but I love you
We were meant to be
My angel baby on the big screen
Tell them who you need

[Post-Chorus]
Say it again, again, again, again
Again, again, again, again
Again, again, again, again
Again, 'gain
Big town
Synthetic apparitions of not being lonely
"Look! He's having a breakdown
Oh, what a letdown, a shame, I think he might die!"
And now she's dancing enthralling, I guess I gotta wait my turn
I said, "Don't fall in love with the moment"
She said, "I've got a lot to learn"

And you know I'm in love with this city
But the green is turning brown
And I just look pathetic now

If she likes it 'cause we just don't eat
And we're so intelligent, she's American
If she says I've got to fix my teeth
Then she's so American (She's American)
And if she likes it 'cause we just don't eat
And we're socially relevant, she's American
If she says I've got to fix my teeth
Then she's so American (She's American)
She's inducing sleep to avoid pain
And I think she's got a gun divinely decreed and custom made
She calls on the phone like the old days, expecting the world
And don't fall in love with the moment
And think you're in love with the girl

There's no more water in this city
But be careful or you'll drown
You think you've got it figured out

If she likes it 'cause we just don't eat
And we're so intelligent, she's American
If she says I've got to fix my teeth
Then she's so American (She's American)
And if she likes it 'cause we just don't eat
And we're socially relevant, she's American
If she says I've got to fix my teeth
Then she's so American (She's American)

Well, your face has got a hold on me
But your brain is proper weird
Are you feeling the same?
You just keep nodding at me, looking vacant

She likes it 'cause we just don't eat
And we're socially relevant
She's American (She's American)
She says I've got to fix my teeth
Then she's so American
She's American
If she likes it 'cause we just don't eat
And we're so intelligent, she's American
If she says I've got to fix my teeth
Then she's so American (She's American)
If she likes it 'cause we just don't eat
And we're socially relevant, She's American
If she says I've got to fix my teeth
Then she's so American (She's American)

[Verse 1]
There is a shadow that follows me
My whole life tinted by the feeling
I would get up and try
But I can't stop the room from spinning

[Chorus]
Bitter taste on my tongue
I can't place where it's from
As the head pain subsides
I remember where we lied
Bitter taste on my tongue
I can't place where it's from
As the head pain subsides
I remember you

[Post Chorus]
I remember where we lied
And it starts to subside (I remember you)
I remember where we lied
And it starts to subside (I remember you)
I remember where we lied
And it starts to subside (I remember you)
I remember where we lied
And it starts to subside

[Verse 2]
Wish I could relive my life
Just to appreciate it more the second time around
Every era so precious
None of which could be crowned better than the rest
On the horizon I see
Holding onto belief
Hope there are new things to find
She said, "Take your time"
She said, "I wish you'd come over or at least come around"
Maybe one day I'll be over 'cause I'm finally found

[Chorus]
Bitter taste on my tongue
I can't place where it's from
As the head pain subsides
I remember where we lied
Bitter taste on my tongue
I can't place where it's from
As the head pain subsides
I remember you

[Post Chorus]
I remember where we lied
And it starts to subside (I remember you)
I remember where we lied
And it starts to subside (Oh, but I remember you)
I remember where we lied
And it starts to subside (I remember you)
I remember where we lied
And it starts to subside

[Verse 1]
In a perfect storm of circumstance
I flirted with fire
When I felt your touch I knew I
Was along for the ride

[Chorus]
It's getting late but I don't want to go
So I look for accommodation
Something's telling me that you're fakin'

[Verse 2]
I'm all out, is there a place we can get some?
No one laughs, does that mean I'm no fun?
All the lights can be so distracting
As I keep the car from crashing

[Chorus]
It's getting late but I don't want to go
So I look for accommodation
Something's telling me that you're fakin'

[Post Chorus]
'Cause I'm walkin' on that made up line
And I'm hopin' I don't fall off blind
And I'm walkin' on that made up line
And I'm hopin' I don't fall off blind (Blind, blind)

[Outro]
I wish that you could see
I wish I could believe in you

[Verse 1]
We were told to love one another
We were told to hold onto each other and
We were taught that two is ideal
But now I'm telling ya how I really feel

[Chorus]
There's more for me (More for me)
More for you if you wanted to (More for you)
There's more for me (More for me)
More for you, too (More for you)

[Verse 2]
'Cause we were trained to stick to the same old
Ways of our fathers, but I'm not about that, so it's
Time for change, God bless the souls of
Those who came and made me feel complete

[Refrain]
Complete
Complete

[Bridge]
Why don't we fool around and just melt ourselves?
To try our luck and re-conduct ourselves
I'll try to steal your heart, still I'm on my knees
I wouldn't run from you, you wouldn't run from me
I couldn't feel the drift happening under me
I didn't wanna take it, didn't wanna see
All possibilities are tryna set me free
And now it won't be so complex for me

[Chorus]
More for me, more for you
More for me (More for you if you wanted to), more for you

[Outro]
I couldn't feel the drift happening under me
I didn't wanna take it, didn't wanna see
All possibilities are tryna set me free
And now it won't be so complex for me

[Chorus: Thundercat]
Let me show you, show you the way
On the edge of dark there's the brightest light
A burning light on the edge of dark
Where no-one can tell they’re worlds apart
We'll live with dark, just take the ride

[Interlude: Thundercat]
It's your boy; Thundercat

[Verse 1: Thundercat]
Heavy-hearted, but my burden's light
I just wanna live, and learn how to fly
When it's all over, breathe into the light
Sink or swim, I'm not scared to die

[Interlude: Thundercat]
Tell 'em how you feel, Kenny
Kenny Loggins

[Verse 2: Kenny Loggins]
Your heart is struggling, baby
Trying to believe
That there might be something you just couldn't see
But what if I told you babe
It’s all so easy

[Chorus: Thundercat]
Let me show you, show you the way
On the edge of dark there's the brightest light
A burning light, on the edge of dark
Where no-one can tell they’re worlds apart
We'll live with dark, just take the ride

[Interlude: Thundercat]
Ladies and gentlemen; Michael McDonald

[Verse 3: Michael McDonald]
Wake up and dream, tear down the wall
Of all you believe that might not be true
Long as love lies waiting there
Just hold your face into the light
Though right now you might not know why
Long as love lies waiting
They ain’t know our way, baby

[Chorus: Thundercat]
Let me show you, show you the way
On the edge of dark there's the brightest light
A burning light, on the edge of dark
Where no-one can tell they’re worlds apart
We'll live with dark, just take the ride

[Outro: Thundercat]
Hey, how's it going? This is your boy, Thundercat. If you're going to fill your water bottle with vodka, always make sure you have a friend with a bottle that actually has water in it

[Verse]
Here it comes
In and out and around
Feeling bare, almost there
Here it comes
This is the best part
This is the best part
Getting weak
But I'm doing fine
How are you? How are you?
Everything and nothing
Twirling around in my head
All at once, all at once

[Outro]
Where am I going?
Can you take me with you?
Can you take me with you?

[Verse 1]
Restless nights in Tokyo
Wanna hear all the sounds and see all the sights
From the Champs-Élysées to the Gundam Cafe
Gonna eat so much fish, I think I'm gonna be sick
Gonna blow all my cash on anime (Yes!)
Don't try to stop me 'cause I'm over 9000
Just point me to the pachinko machines
I think I'm Kenshiro, I think that I'm Goku
Can I just stay one more day?

[Refrain]
Reckless nights in Tokyo
Oh my god, it's Tokyo

[Verse 2]
It was premeditated, tried to get someone pregnant
It wasn't her fault, I'm just kind of psychotic
Left on my own, I would never come back
I'd probably hide in the suicide forest (shit!)
This all started when I was a boy
I went to the dentist and he gave me a toy
It was Dragon Ball Z, a wrist-slap bracelet
Goku fucking ruined me

[Outro]
A love affair with Tokyo

[Hook]
Into the fire
Black skies filled with smoke
Darker horizons ahead

[Chorus]
Out of the pan and into the fire
The descent into madness
Bright as day, dark as night
The inferno

[Hook]
Into the fire
Black skies filled with smoke
Darker horizons ahead (that's right)

[Chorus]
Out of the pan and into the fire
The descent into madness
Bright as day, dark as night
The inferno

[Outro]
Welcome to the madness, madness
Leave your mind at the door, check out
Madness, madness

[Verse]
Bittersweet memories cloud my faded mind
And if I was so lucky, I could press rewind
But could it be I'm crazy?
'Cause I've been wrong before
Let a nigga know

[Chorus]
3 o'clock, just can't close my eyes
Something's wrong with me
No, I can't deal, I can't go to sleep
There's something in my heart
The streets keep calling me

3 o'clock, just can't close my eyes
Something's wrong with me
No, I can't deal, I can't go to sleep
There's something in my heart
The streets keep calling me

[Verse]
Young drifting light
Drift on by
Shine on me
Then pass me by
Warm me up
Can't leave me cold
And when I die
Cave into your light

[Verse 1: Thundercat]
As I sit, as I sit
And I stare into the clouds
And watch the world turn
Is this where we belong?
Or is it a step to fill?
Makes me wonder, makes me think
Everything we do is weak
Turn down
Oh 'cause look at the mess we've made
Who's gonna clean it up?
Oh my God, where's Captain Planet?
Perception, what you see
Compared to reality, so far away
You are so drunk, you miss it all (yay)
Just make sure you have the right Jordans on
Or be left behind to rot and die
Face down in the gutter

[Verse 2: Pharrell]
This is gonna sound like I was just hitting the hash (zone)
They make us think it's a race war when the war is in class (show 'em)
Teachers come through the speakers, images through the glass (foam)
Subliminal messages influencing the whole clash (Alone)
Black, white, gay, straight human beings all pee and want some ass (chrome)
If you scared of different then you should not take the same path
If all lives matter when we mention black, why do you gasp? (bro)
Behind our blue skies is the sun who's surrounded by black (tone)
I love the camo but why have more ammo than MASH? (don't)
Instead of blowing yourself up, take a love pill and laugh (you won't)
And laugh (ha)

[Chorus: Thundercat]
At the end of it all
No one wants to drink alone
Baby, that's how it goes
Don’t walk away from me

[Verse 1: Thundercat]
Fragmented memories
Sentences incomplete
That's when she said
"Don't wanna put up a fight anymore
I’m down to the end of my rope
And I'm freefalling
I'll search inside myself
I need to know why I act this way"
A whisper turns to a scream
I can't ignore it no more

[Chorus: Thundercat]
At the end of it all
No one wants to drink alone
Baby, that's how it goes

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
From my eyewitness binoculars (uh-huh)
To Argentina and Africa (uh-huh)
We mastered the (what?) pressure (yeah)
Hazardous (uh-huh), harassing us (that's right)
You laugh at us (you did)
More accurate at bagging dimes, now we bagging rhymes
Bodybags, price tags on your forehead
Nine times out of ten, young niggas are nine or ten
When the line becomes thin: be a killer or fireman
Fill up the lavish pen if I needed to right my wrongs
I can't deny sin, condolences through these palms
I remember when your cousin was coming home
My bitch, why we plotted to kill him 'cause we ain’t know him
Unfamiliar faces make niggas nervous
Convicted court cases might hit the surface
Restricted territories might come through lurkin’
We ain't want none of that urgent call
Well, I’ma act Turk and fall on my identity, percocets
For all the headaches, I'm 'bout to bring confetti
Tumble out this barrel soon as it ring, you ready?
That was the word 'for we moved on ’em
Treat him like Joe the Plumber
I wonder if someone come and can see this tool on him
Immature and retarded is what you call me
Your cousin wa'n't coming home from the pen but from the army
If I can right my wrongs and pen this verse I read
Even though a bullet hit him in the leg, still walk on by

[Chorus: Thundercat]
At the end of it all
No one wants to drink alone
Baby that's how it goes
Don't walk away from me

[Intro]
Meow, meow
Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow
Meow, meow, meow

[Verse]
I wish I had nine lives
I bet it feels real nice
Sitting in the sun
Letting the rays wash over me
No one watching over me
I do what I want
Everybody wants to be a cat
It's cool to be a cat
Everything the light touches
It's where I will roam
My roar would be so powerful
I would scare off everything

[Hook]
Cool to be a cat (meow, meow, meow, meow)
Cool to be a cat (meow, meow, meow, meow)
Cool to be a cat (meow, meow, meow, meow)
Cool to be a cat

[Outro]
Meow, meow
Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow
Meow, meow
Meow, meow
Meow

[Verse 1]
I want to go right, I'm safe on my block
Except for the cops
Will they attack?
Would it be 'cause I'm black?
I want to ride away, off into space and into the sun
With all those spirits and space dust and aliens
Where we belong (fuck yeah!)

[Verse 2]
Although it seems like it's all crashing down
I just want to ride my bike
Through all the bullshit with the wind in my face
Miss me with that nonsense
I'm free as a bird (free)
And light as the wind
Just leave me alone (easy)
Just let me ride off into space (space ride)
That's where I want to be (space ride)

[Verse 1]
I'm your biggest fan, but I guess that's just not good enough
Is it cause I wear my hair weird or because I like to play Diablo
Don't act like you don't know what I'm talking 'bout
Cause I really don't wanna have to spell it out
And next time you call me
I'm gon' sit and stare at the screen
Waiting for the call to end

[Chorus 1]
You stuck me in the friend zone
That's that bullshit
I'm gonna play Diablo either way
You can come or you can go

[Verse 2]
Because I'd rather play Mortal Kombat anyway, hey
I'm all about my Johnny Cage
If you're not bringing tacos I suggest you start to walk away
Bitch don't kill my vibe
I can tell you've kinda got uncomfortable
So let me break it down for you
Don't call me, don't text me, after 2am
Unless you plan on giving me some
Cause I got enough friends

[Chorus 2]
I will throw you in the garbage
'Cause you play too many games
I'm better off by myself
Loving you's bad for my health

[Outro]
No one wants to be in the friend zone
Friend zone, friend zone

[Verse 1]
Stuck in the clouds
That’s my story and I’m sticking to it
I'm high as a kite
Don’t bother me
I’m out here probably doing the most

[Verse 2]
From the minute I wake up I’m staring at the screen
Watching the world go insane
Gotta stay connected so I know what's happening
In these streets
Thank God for technology ‘cause where would we be if we couldn’t tweet our thoughts?
Won’t you leave some things to mystery?
Opening your mouth removes all doubt
So be quiet
Technology is the key to it all

[Verse 3]
Where did I lose my phone at?
Doesn’t really matter because you’re already behind the curve
It’s okay to disconnect sometimes
We’re out here doing the most

[Verse 1]
Sometimes you're alive
Sometimes you are dead inside
With the time to read between the lines of life and death
Sometimes it's okay
Sometimes it's the worst thing ever
Hopefully you won't get caught and get a DUI

[Verse 2]
You will see that it's not so bad
There's always tomorrow
Bottom of the glass
At this point you've made an ass
And your friends will let you know tomorrow

[Outro]
I'm so tired
One more glass to go
Where this ends we'll never know

[Verse 1]
Travel through the light
Holy, holy
Take me to the highest mountain
And the lowest seas
Glory of your light
Break through

[Verse 2]
I want to experience all the light has to offer me
Bathing in your glow
Patterns in the light
Pressing new frontiers
Totally reborn
Don't be afraid of death
We'll be gone in the twinkling of an eye

[Outro]
Eye, eye, eye

[Chorus]
Drowning away all of the pain
Till I'm totally numb
Sometimes you want to feel alive
But not on someone else's time

[Verse]
Morning heartache
Senses your love
I just can't catch a break
Squirrels and snakes keep me on my toes
Will you go down with me?
Don't care what you say
So many feels, bro
LOL, I'm so over it
'Cause nothing is real
I'd rather be up my mind
Than to be dead alive

[Chorus]
Drowning away all of the pain
Till I'm totally numb
Sometimes you want to feel alive
But not on someone else's time

[Outro]
(Baby) I just can't catch a break

[Verse 1]
Protect the wild, tomorrow's child
Protect the land from the greed of man
Take out the dams, stand up to oil
Protect the plants and renew the soil

[Chorus]
Who's gonna stand up and save the earth?
Who's gonna say that she's had enough?
Who's gonna take on the big machine?
Who's gonna stand up and save the earth?
This all starts with you and me

[Verse 2]
Ban fossil fuel, draw the line
Before we build one more pipeline
End fracking now, let's save the water
And build a life for our sons and daughters

[Chorus]
Who's gonna stand up and save the earth?
Who's gonna say that she's had enough?
Who's gonna take on the big machine?
Who's gonna stand up and save the earth?
This all starts with you and me

[Verse 3]
Damn the dams, save the rivers
Starve the takers and feed the givers
Let's build the green and save the world
We're the people known as Earth

[Chorus]
Who's gonna stand up and save the earth?
Who's gonna say that she's had enough?
Who's gonna take on the big machine?
Who's gonna stand up and save the earth?
This all starts with you and me

[Verse 1]
Someday you’ll want me
Someday you're gonna get back there
Someday you’ll see me, like you used to do

[Verse 2]
I got my problems
But they mostly show up with you
Someday you’ll see me, like you used to do

[Bridge]
I couldn’t satisfy you
Just couldn’t show you my love
But I kept on trying
I tried and I tried
The time went by
You just didn’t want it no more

[Harmonica Solo]

[Verse 1]
Some day you’ll want me
Someday you’re gonna get back there
Someday you’re gonna need me, like you used to do

[Verse 1]
So many people don’t understand
What it’s like to be like me
But I’m not different from anyone else
I’m glad I found you

[Verse 2]
It’s not that we got anything new
It’s not that it’s any better or worse
The way life treats us is a blessing and a curse
I’m glad I found you

[Verse 3]
When you’re walking in a crowded place
I’ll try to hide you and give you space
And I’ll protect you from the things that come
I’m glad I found you

[Verse 4]
The other day when you took my hand
We walked away to the promised land
When I feel your soul in mine
I’m glad I found you

[Bridge]
I'm glad I found you in this sad world
Where so many things have gone wrong
It took me so long just to find you
Right where we belong

I’m glad I found you in this mad world
You’re a lifeline to me
And when I hold you I will shield you
From the things that we both see

[Verse 1]
So many people don’t understand
What it’s like to be like me
But I’m not different from anyone else
I’m glad I found you
I’m glad I found you
I’m glad I found you

[Verse 1]
When I watch you sleeping, there’s nothing that you hide
When I smell you breathing there’s a sweetness from inside
And when I feel you stirring and the day is about to break
Outside wings are whirring and the sky is there to take

[Bridge]
I wonder how I got so close to you
And see the chances that you take
Without thinking I’m going there too
These are the promises you make
When your eyes are blinded by love
And the history of fate

[Verse 2]
When I hear you purring like a kitten and a lion
And I feel your softness, how you got it without trying
Then you roll and tumble with your dreams still holding on
And I hear that rumble in the stomach of the dawn

[Bridge]
Today I paint my masterpiece
Tonight I trace my tears
Thinking through my path to you
And where I stumbled through the years

[Harmonica Solo]

[Bridge]
Today I paint my masterpiece
Tonight I trace my tears
Thinking through the road I took to you
And how I stumbled through the years
That’s when I knew I’d never hold you down
Repeating old roads and fears

[Verse 3]
Now the crows are calling and the blackbirds sing in my ear
You got one eye open and I’m smiling through my tears
But you’ll never see them, they're inside with my fears
In a place that’s fading away and taking on new years

[Intro]
One, two, three, go
Here we go

[Verse 1]
Your touch is so magic to me
The strangest things can happen
And the way that you react to me
I wanna do something you can't imagine
Imagine if there was a million me's talkin' sexy to you like that
You think you can handle, boy
If I give you my squeeze and I need you to push it right back

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, show me, show me what's your favorite trick
That you wanna use on me and I'll volunteer
And I'll be flowin' and goin' till clothin' disappears
Ain't nothin' but shoes on me, oh baby

[Chorus]
All night show with just you and the crowd
Doin' tricks you never seen
And I bet that I can make you believe
In love and sex and magic
So just let me drive my body around ya
I bet you know what I mean
'Cause you know that I can make you believe
In love and sex and magic

[Verse 2]
Everything ain't what it seems, I wave my hands and I got you
And you feel so fly assistin' in me
But now it's my turn to watch you, I ain't gon' stop you
If you wanna crowd my neck, talk sexy to me like that
Just do what I taught you, boy, when I give you my heat
And I need you to push it right back

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, show me, show me what's your favorite trick
That you wanna use on me and I'll volunteer
And I'll be flowin' and goin' till clothing disappears
Ain't nothin' but shoes on me, oh baby

[Chorus]
All night show with just you and the crowd
Doin' tricks you never seen
And I bet that I can make you believe
In love and sex and magic
So just let me drive my body around ya
I bet you know what I mean
'Cause you know that I can make you believe
In my love and sex and magic

[Bridge]
Ohh
This is the part where we fall in love (Love, oh, sugar)
(Oh) Let's slow it down so we fall in love (Oh)
But don't stop whatcha doin' to me
Uhh

[Chorus]
All night show with just you and the crowd
Doin' tricks you never seen
And I bet that I can make you believe
In love and sex and magic
So just let me drive my body around ya
I bet you know what I mean
'Cause you know that I can make you believe
In my love and sex and magic
All night show with just you and the crowd
Doin' tricks you never seen
And I bet that I can make you believe
In love and sex and magic
So just let me drive my body around ya
I bet you know what I mean
'Cause you know that I can make you believe
In my love and sex and magic, oh

Building me a rainbow in my head
Color all my feelings can't be dead
Yet it's such a hard time down to my close friend

The days are passing by
So many cries
You know it's awful clear
But wonder why

Runnin' doesn't find the beggar's meal
Nothin' isn't ever too unreal
Yet, it's such a hard time down to my close friend

Sometimes it's oh so strange
And the pain will remain, still feel the same
I know it's only right to begin with myself
Keep on tryin'
Hard time to live
Easier to give
Yes, and it's such a hard time down to my close friend

Said it's such hard time to live
Makes it so much easier to give
Said it's such a hard time down to my close friend

Sometimes it's oh so strange
And he pain will remain, and you still feel the same
I know it's only right to begin with myself
Keep on tryin'

Hard time to live
Easier to give
Yes, and it's such a hard time down to my close (hard time down to my)
Hard time down to my close (hard time down to my)
Hard time down to my close (hard time down to my)
Friend
Where can she be if she's not here with me
Where, where can she be
Where can she be if she’s not here with me
Where, where can she be

Where has she gone, she's been gone for so long
Makin' me worry and wonder

Where is she
Where is she

Wonder if she’s comin' home
Wonder if she's all alone
Wastin' her time, I'm losin' my mind
Wonderin' she's comin’ home

How do I feel knowin’ love is away
How, how do I feel
No good for myself or to anyone else
Know my love is away
It's just too weird when I think of it now
Why do I have to wonder

Where is she
Where is she

Maybe she’s on her way home
And that could mean she's all alone
Thinkin' of me, I want her to be
On her way home

Where can she be if she's not here with me
Where, where can she be
Where can she be if she’s not here with me
Where, where can she be
Where can she be if she's not here with me
I love to love ya

[Verse 1]
I can't stop dreamin' about you
Your eyes make me melt away into the day
One kiss on my neck drives me crazy (crazy)
One touch leads you close enough
For you I crave

[Chorus]
Ain't got a worry in the world
Ain't got nothin' to care about
When you're around I can't be down
Ain't gotta hold me back from nothin'
Ain't got a problem in the sky (in the sky)
Ain't gotta ever ask me why
When you're around there ain't no doubt
You ain't gotta hold me back just let me

[Post-Chorus]
Go (go)
Watch me get down and
Go (go)
When I come around just let me go
I love to love ya
Go (go)
Watch me go down and
Go (go)
When I come around just let me go
I love to love ya
I just can't help myself (yeah)

[Verse 2]
I can't live one day without you
No stopping the way I feel its so surreal
Make me go "Ahh" boy I lose it
I just can't control myself its so intense

[Chorus]
Ain't got a worry in the world
Ain't got nothin' to care about
When you're around I can't be down
Ain't gotta hold me back from nothin'
Ain't got a problem in the sky (in the sky)
Ain't gotta ever ask me why
When you're around there ain't no doubt
You ain't gotta hold me back just let me

[Pre-Chorus]
Go (go)
Watch me get down and
Go (go)
When I come around just let me go
I love to love ya
Go (go)
Watch me go down and
Go (go)
When I come around just let me go
I love to love ya

[Bridge]
I wanna hold you wherever you are
There ain't no time that's wrong
Ain't no place that's too far
Not a care in the world
Just for you, just for me
Where a boy loves a girl and that girl
That girl is me

[Chorus]
Ain't got a worry in the world
Ain't got nothin' to care about
When you're around I can't be down
Ain't gotta hold me back from nothin'
Ain't got a problem in the sky (in the sky)
Ain't gotta ever ask me why
When you're around there ain't no doubt
You ain't gotta hold me back just let me

[Pre-Chorus]
Go (go)
Watch me get down and
Go (go)
When I come around just let me go
I love to love ya
Go (go)
Watch me go down and
Go (go)
When I come around just let me go
I love to love ya
Wouldn't it be nice to live again
High on a hill making love again

Who ever said that love would die
Who ever said the very first lie
Who ever said goodbye
Tell me who ever said a man can't cry?
I know I can cry

And we'll live our life alone
And I know it's alright
It's alright

I'll show you a place
That can't be seen
High above the clouds
Just you and me

I know we can live with love
Simple little life
Just you and me
Who ever said goodbye
Tell me who ever said a girl shouldn't cry?
I know you can cry

And we'll live our life alone
And I know it's alright
Honey, it's alright

Don't you think we can live again?
Don't you think we can live again?
Don't you think we can live again?
Don't you think we can live again?
Don't you think we can live again?
Don't you think we can live again?
Don't you think we can live again?
Don't you think we can live again?
Don't you think we can live again?
Don't you think we can live again?
Don't you think we can live again?
Don't you think we can live again?
Don't you think we can live again?
Sherry, she needs me
And there's nothing I can do
Sherry, she needs me
And I think I need her, too

Sherry, if you start cryin'
It'll break my heart
So before we both start cryin'
I'll just walk away

Sherry baby, I just can't stand it
It didn't work out the way we planned it
Sherry baby, I just can't stand it
Sherry baby

Sherry baby, it's time we said goodbye

Sherry, believe me
It's so hard to say we're through
Please keep your cool dear
And I'll still be friends with you
Sherry, don't hate her guts
Just 'cause she took me away
And maybe you'll wanna make friends
With her someday

Sherry baby, I just can't stand it
It didn't work out the way we planned it
Sherry baby, I just can't stand it
Sherry baby

Sherry baby, it's time we said goodbye

[Intro]
Man
This happened one, two, three times too much
These dumb-ass niggas

[Chorus]
Niggas ain't shit, come up in your crib
All up in your fridge, can't pay rent
Look at what you did, listen to your friends
When they say niggas ain't shit, 'cause
Niggas ain't shit, come up in your crib
All up in your fridge, can't pay rent
Look at what you did, listen to your friends
When they say niggas ain't shit

[Verse 1]
Umm, you could say that again
Niggas is square like Madison
I can't even really get mad at them
They fall, then I gotta facepalm
Shook him like an 8-ball and it's embarrassin'
Ten-page text, shoulda wrote a book, coulda made a bag
But he broke and he still waitin' 'til I can chill
And he really think I'ma get back to him
Doin' too much, relax a bit
Actin' like that 'cause your dad's a bitch
Must be the way that the planets is
Must be your face 'cause it's not your dick
I'm a freak, not a masochist
Shoulda known you had the baddest bitch
Left on read and can't give head
Really, you ain't shit, need a laxative

[Chorus]
Niggas ain't shit, come up in your crib
All up in your fridge, can't pay rent
Look at what you did, listen to your friends
When they say niggas ain't shit, 'cause
Niggas ain't shit, come up in your crib
All up in your fridge, can't pay rent
Look at what you did, listen to your friends
When they say, niggas ain't shit, 'cause

[Verse 2]
Said that's not cheating if I wasn't with your ass, yo
You kept secrets and your cousin told me that, so (Your cousin)
Logical thinkin' is just something that you lack, so
What you even mad for? Lookin' like a stick up in your asshole
I'm not your mommy, nigga, find a new hobby, nigga
Return, yo, 'fore I get picked up, your shit's in the lobby, nigga
I'm not gon' key your car, I'll call your fuckin' mom
You should have paid my rent, go get a fuckin' job

[Chorus]
Niggas ain't shit, come up in your crib
All up in your fridge, can't pay rent
Look at what you did, listen to your friends
When they say niggas ain't shit, 'cause
Niggas ain't shit, come up in your crib
All up in your fridge, can't pay rent
Look at what you did, listen to your friends
When they say niggas ain't shit, 'cause–

[Intro: Dr. Dre]
Yo Tim, Bob
Gimme one of them hot ones!
Yeah!
Yeah yeah yeah!
Y'all feelin that shit?
Hell yeah!
Coming at ya from the depths of the aftermath
Yeah
Ain’t nothing sweet about it
Peep me out

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
For every mother fucker that dissed me, what y'all hope to gain?
Recognition? You just another broke nigga riffin, so listen
Cause my communication is brief, you in the game?
You got to trim the pork and cut the beef
Indeed we both gotta eat, that's a given
The only difference is, you on the corner, I own acres, I’m livin
We can get down, but I choose to stay around few
And that's Benjamin and Franklin, what this shit boils down to!
Anyway you see it, whether rapping or acting
I took the game to the next level, and you gone see it when I'm absent
What you think I hold is a fraction, cause a niggas mind is simple
The cost of a kilo is sneaker money, and that's what you limited to
Must I prove? Financially, I can call and get Clinton to answer me
Understand me, inside the party with the chronic
I'ma flood the world like Noah til my word be accomplished

[Chorus: Dr. Dre]
(Hey, you!)
Don't make me come back with the..
(One, two!)
Uh, I thought ya knew, about my whole fucking crew!
(What)
Niggas like you
(What)
Don't know what to do when we come after you

(Hey, you!)
Don't make me come back with the..
(One, two!)
Uh I thought ya knew, about my whole fucking crew!
(What)
Niggas like you
(What)
Don’t know what to do when we come after you

[Verse 2: Dr. Dre]
Production dealing wide body my dreddys for realer
My sons that come next, they come with the formula
I holds it down because I gots ta
And when you get sick of the bullshit entertainers, call the doctor
(Hey)
Throw a ounce of, straight heat over the counter
When the balls in my court, I stall til the last kick
Brought up and trained to go platinum over plastic
Fruits and fiber stored in my aftermath basket
(Hey)
I took a break to see which niggas was fake
Who was loyal, who was fake, what type of moves would they make
I stayed patient, taking my time like rehabilitation
Good thing I had a strong foundation
Be on the look out, we bring the flames like cookouts
With that hot shit, that got major labels with check books out
Entrepreneur, over-seer, guide my own career
Get on your job, y’all niggas don't wanna pull cards

[Chorus: Dr. Dre]
(Hey, you!)
Don’t make me come back with the..
(One, two!)
Uh, I thought ya knew, about my whole fucking crew!
(What)
Niggas like you
(What)
Don't know what to do when we come for after you

(Hey, you!)
Don't make me come back with the..
(One, two!)
Uh, I thought ya knew, about my whole fucking crew!
(What)
Niggas like you
(What)
Don't know what to do when we come after you

Take drugs

[Chorus]
Yeah, don't do
Drugs
Yeah, everybody, don't do
Drugs
Yeah, don't do
Drugs
Haha, yeah

[Verse 1]
Well, it's a, crazy motherfucker named Mac
Shit, I'm in it too deep, ain't no time for goin' back
And the flow is jacked, Colt .45 in the grocery bag
You know it's that explosion rap, fire cracker, broken glass
These motherfuckers ain't bubblin', the soda flat
Forever I'ma go to bat, bitches wanna hold him back
Impulsive, irrational, he a maniac, but fuck gossip
Keep it casual, where the paper at?
A couple problems, fuck options, too late for that
I need the check, someone tell me where the waiter at
Oh, it's the devil, tell me where the angels at
And tell 'em I want my—, I want my—, want my baby back
Insane shit, my brain probably ain't attached
Don't show your face round here, it isn't safe for that
Bitch, I got my heart broke, on lock though
Keep a couple keys out in Longboat

[Chorus]
Drugs
Yeah, don't, do
Drugs
Yeah, don't do
Drugs
Yeah, don't do
Drugs
Yeah

[Verse 2]
Okay, well
Well, the assets deeper than the rap check
They sleepin' on the ether still, I ain't take a nap yet
They all up in my shit like a airport bag check
Well, that shit is tactics, you haven't seen me mad yet
Dalai Lama, motherfucker, chill out
Weed was so cool, but everybody poppin' pills now
Yup, the Broke Till I'm Dead hoodie on
I make the songs that the bitches throw the pussy on
I'm a king on the board, y'all be lookin' pawn
Pissin' on a lawn with my dick in my palm
Isn't he on? Officially the ticker of bomb
At the crib chillin', thinkin' 'bout Nicki Minaj
It's a mirage, don't believe half the shit that we say
Me, I'm on the freeway, motherfuckin' PA
Droppin' like D-Day, shoppin' like eBay
Always gotta ball up, I'm Fuamatu-Ma'afala that

[Chorus]
Drugs
Yeah, don't, do
Drugs
Yeah, don't do
Drugs
Yeah, don't do
Drugs
Yeah, okay

[2D]
Feeling better now Murdoc? I haven't heard you crying for a few hours.

[Murdoc & 2D]
My tear ducts dried up years ago. I watched The Notebook last night (Oh yeah), dry as the Gobi Desert. Oh, man! Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah! This is eyeball sweat, eh? I told you about that in 2007.
Thank you very much for your concern. And this...

Listen, keep your portal, I'm fine! Bye!

[Verse 1]
I'm Miss American Dream, since I was 17
Don't matter if I step on the scene, or sneak away to the Philippines
They're still gon' put pictures of my derriere in the magazines
You want a piece of me? (You want a piece of me?)
I'm Miss Bad Media Karma
Another day, another drama
Guess I can't see the harm in working and being a mama
And with a kid on my arm, I'm still an exceptional earner

Well, get in line with the paparazzi who's flipping me off
Hoping I'll resort to some havoc, end up settling in court
Now, are you sure you want a piece of me?

[?]
I'm Mrs. 'Most Likely to Get on the TV For Strippin' on the Streets When Gettin' the Groceries'
Now, for real, are you kiddin' me?
No wonder there's panic in the industry, I mean, please
Do you want a piece of me?

Common love isn't for us

You got me feeling diamond rich
Nothing on this planet compares to it

Don't you agree?

Adrenaline keeps on rushing in
Love the simulation we're dreaming in

Love suicide
You and I drove for miles
Knew I'd be here, be here, be here with you
Knew I'd be here, be here, be here with you
We took a dive in the blue, scared to lose
All my feelings, feelings, feelings for you
Knew I'd be here, be here, be here with you

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, now we gotta let this go
Drove the car off the road
I gotta give you time to grow
You're not a ghost, you're in my head
I didn't wanna leave you low
Drove the car off the road
I hope you get some time to grow
You're not a ghost, you're in my head (In my head...)

[Chorus]
I will always love you (Love you)
I'll love you forever
Even when we're not together
I will always love you (Love you)
I'll love you forever
Said I'll love you forever
I know in the future (Future)
We won't see each other (We won't see each other)
Cold just like December
But I will always love you (Love you)
I'll love you forever
Yeah, I'll love you forever

[Post-Chorus]
Head, in my head

[Verse 2]
You take your time, I'll take mine, we'll be fine
Knew I'd be here, be here, be here with you
When the roof caved in and the water fell through
Hope when we're old, we'll be friends, reminisce
Hope we'll be there, be there, be there, us two
All the memories, all the photos we took

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, now we gotta let this go
Drove the car off the road
I gotta give you time to grow
You're not a ghost, you're in my head
I didn't wanna leave you low
Drove the car off the road
I hope you get some time to grow
You're not a ghost, you're in my head

[Chorus]
I will always love you (Love you)
I'll love you forever
Even when we're not together
I will always love you (Love you)
I'll love you forever
Said I'll love you forever

We won't see each other (We won't see each other)
Cold just like December
But I will always love you (Love you)
I'll love you forever
Yeah, I'll love you forever
I will always love you (Love you)
I'll love you forever (Ever)
Even when we're not together
I will always love you (Love you)
I'll love you forever
Said I'll love you forever (I know-I know)
I know in the future (Love you)
We won't see each other
Cold just like December
But I will always love you (Love you)
I'll love you forever
Yeah, I'll love you forever

Front of my mind, in the front of my mind
You stay right in front, in the front of my mind
Front of my mind, in the front of my mind
You stay right in front, in the front of my mind
Front of my mind, never leave you behind
We say promises and we gave up the lies
Front of my mind, in the front of my mind
You stay right in front of my mind

[Intro]
For my nigga Hush
Yeah, look

[Verse 1]
Dressed in fatigues, I rep the East with my trustees
Smokin' on crushed leaves
They turn they back on everything we built, then they must bleed
I've seen splatter hit the snow when the blood freeze
Straps over territory they know we must keep
Get home and white Air Forces get brushed clean
Back when my mama would interrupt sleep
To tell me hurry up 'cause the bus leaves
Summertime heatwaves, I used to just cut sleeves
My shorty really love me, man, she want me to cut keys
I can't do that normal type of life, is it just me?
Niggas steady try to ride the wave, but it's rough seas
I'm losin' enough sleep dealin' with envy
And the news that they sent for me got the block in a frenzy
It's on Meech like it's trendy
Runnin' round from Laurier to MacKenzie when the city's empty, yeah
Early twenties, but I want fifties, hundreds, not pennies
I need plenty
Got me ready to flip the F out like Fendi
Whatever's in me, it's takin' over
I gotta bust it down, break it open
Until somebody starts takin' notice, then we rollin'

[Chorus]
Yeah, then we rollin', then we rollin'
Deep pockets on a nigga, I can't find my phone in
Now we rollin'
Yeah, then we rollin', then we rollin'
Deep pockets on a nigga, I can't find my phone in
Now we rollin'

[Verse 2]
Look
Back when Big Apple sold dreams, I stuck to my own thing
Back when the house that I own now was my home screen
Before I'd ever hit the road and feel like the home team
Runnin' missions
Pyramid schemes just like the Egyptians
Back when hotlines were still flippin'
Now I'm seein' money off of hotlines blingin' but it feels different
Transitions, plans switchin', ambition
Mindin' my business, buildin' a business, et cetera
Inspired by a few, but my mind really drives itself like Tesla
I always had a little somethin' extra
Back when Corey was our sole investor
And the car could get from A to B, but won't impress ya
Look, I ain't no baller
Still need my accounts longer like the way my nephew's gettin' taller
My soundtrack is the second Carter, dreamin' of acceptin' offers
And easin' tensions
Keepin' family out of East Detention
And out of Pine Hill Funeral Center
Spots we got no business enterin'
Back when Jill Scott was the apple of my afrocentric eye
I had to find a way to get someone's attention

[Chorus]
Then we rollin', then we rollin'
Deep pockets on a nigga, I can't find my phone in
Now we rollin'
Yeah, then we rollin', then we rollin'
Deep pockets on a nigga, I can't find my phone in
Now we rollin'

[Chorus]
Yeah, I'm outside in an AMG
Right outside, TT
Too turnt, baby girl, you know me, yeah
Still with the dawgs that I grew beside
All the niggas 'round me ride or they die
Gotta watch the time 'cause it's flyin' right by
I'm outside in an AMG, yeah
Right outside, TT
Too turnt, baby girl, you know me
Who am I? All the niggas 'round me ride or they die
Gotta watch the time 'cause it's flyin' right by
Too turnt, baby girl, you know me

[Verse 1]
I just caught a shawty off a finsta
Just threw on a hoodie, it's a Crenshaw
Way that I been livin' unconventional
I'm just tryna make it to the end, ya know
Certain things just started gettin' tenser
Think we need to have us an adventure
I could be your man but maybe down the road
Right now I would rather see my heart turn to chrome
Rather see my heart turn crystal
I can't even front like I don't miss ya
Right now I'm just stuck inside the crib on my own
Soon as I free up, I'm 'bout to pop up on your phone like

[Chorus]
I'm outside in an AMG
Right outside, TT
Too turnt, baby girl, you know me, yeah
Who am I? All the niggas 'round me ride or they die
Gotta watch the time 'cause it's flyin' right by
Too turnt, baby girl, you know me
Yeah

[Verse 2]
Heart's still on javelin, baby
Too turnt, baby girl, you know me
I was pullin' off 'fore they knew me
Sometimes I wish there was two of me or three of me
When it was you and me
I felt like I love you too much to change you
You believe in angles more than angels
Feel like I've been going through too much to explain to you
But I'm still the same way I was when I came to you
Everything I have, what I had to exchange for you
Everything I've been through, I can't even complain to you
Wish it stayed the same for you, sorry
I'm sorry

[Outro]
And-and-and-and—

The love, the love is bigger
The love, the love is bigger
The love, the love is bigger, big

[Verse 1]
Gotta believe in me (Gotta believe in me)
Believe me like a fairy tale
Your tooth under your pillowcase
No, I won't, I won't, ever, ever let you down
Like a seesaw let you down
You know why?
'Cause we ain't on the playground no more, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
We're big enough to stand in the picture
We're big enough to stand next to love

[Chorus]
I was a player when I was little
But I'm bigger, I'm bigger
A heartbreaker when I was little
But I'm bigger, I'm bigger
And all the haters, I swear, they look so small from up here
'Cause we bigger, our love's bigger
I'm bigger, you bigger, woah

[Verse 2]
Remember when my heart was young?
It was still bigger than me
Is that the reason that you stayed?
Most would've got rid of me
Now the bullies in the schoolyard can't take our hugs and our kisses from us
Because we ain't pushovers, no more, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
We're big enough to stand in the picture
We're big enough to stand next to love

[Chorus]
I was a player when I was little
But I'm bigger, I'm bigger
A heartbreaker when I was little
But I'm bigger, I'm bigger
And all the haters, I swear, they look so small from up here
'Cause we bigger, our love's bigger
I'm bigger, you bigger
I was a player when I was little
But I'm bigger, I'm bigger
A heartbreaker when I was little
But I'm bigger, I'm bigger
And all the haters, I swear, they look so small from up here
'Cause we bigger, our love's bigger
I'm bigger, you bigger, woah

[Bridge]
Remember those stone washed jeans (I remember that)
Don't knock your earrings (Like yesterday)
They shined on me (We were little then)
In class daydreaming of you (My babe, wow, just a little love getting bigger)
You, wow wow
Since then all I can remember is the love's only gotten bigger
I think, it's gone out of control

[Chorus]
I was a player when I was little (Just a little bigger, hahaha)
But I'm bigger, I'm bigger
A heartbreaker when I was little
But I'm bigger, I'm bigger
And all the haters, I swear, they look so small from up here
'Cause we bigger, our love's bigger
I'm bigger, you bigger
I was a player when I was little
But I'm bigger, I'm bigger
A heartbreaker when I was little
But I'm bigger, I'm bigger
And all the haters, I swear, they look so small from up here
'Cause we bigger, our love's bigger
I'm bigger, you bigger, woah

[2-D & Murdoc]

The light?

[Russel & Murdoc]
Did you see Peter Hook in the light?
I think his eyeballs are sweating again (Thank you)

[2D & Murdoc]
His eyeballs are sweating again, ew (They're not)
Do you need some, um, do you need some antiperspirant for your eyeballs?

[Murdoc]
Oh, wait a minute. Yeah, they probably are a little bit

[Verse 1]
He said, "Let's get out of this town
Drive out of this city, away from the crowds"
I thought, "Heaven can't help me now"
Nothing lasts forever
But this is gonna take me down

[Pre-Chorus 1]
He's so tall and handsome as hell
He's so bad, but he does it so well
I can see the end as it begins
My one condition is

[Chorus]
Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress
Staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your
Wildest dreams, ah-aah, haa
Wildest dreams, ah-aah, haa
In your Wildest dreams
Wildest dreams, ah-aah

[Verse 2]
I said, "No one has to know what we do"
His hands are in my hair, his clothes are in my room
And his voice is a familiar sound
Nothing lasts forever
But this is gettin' good now

[Pre-Chorus 2]
He's so tall and handsome as hell
He's so bad, but he does it so well
And when we've had our very last kiss
My last request, it is

[Chorus]
Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress
Staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your
Wildest dreams, ah-aah, haa (Ah-aah, haa)
Wildest dreams, ah-aah, haa
In your Wildest dreams
Wildest dreams, ah-aah

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Cold enough to chill my bones
It feels like I don't know you anymore
I don't understand why you're so cold to me
With every breath you breathe
I see there's something going on
I don't understand why you're so cold

[Verse 1: Adam Levine]
Are we taking time or a time out?
I can't take the in-between
Asking me for space here in my house
You know how to f- with me
Acting like we're not together
After everything that we've been through
Sleeping up under the covers
How am I so far away from you?

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Cold enough to chill my bones
It feels like I don't know you anymore
I don't understand why you're so cold to me
With every breath you breathe
I see there's something going on
I don't understand why you're so cold
I don't understand why you're so cold

[Post-Chorus: Adam Levine]
Whoa, yeah
Whoa, yeah
I don't understand why you're so cold

[Verse 2: Adam Levine]
What you holdin' on, holdin' on for?
If you wanna leave, just leave
Why you wanna bite your tongue for?
The silence is killing me
Acting like we're not together
If you don't want this, then what's the use?
Sleeping up under the covers
How am I so far away from you?

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Cold enough to chill my bones
It feels like I don't know you anymore
I don't understand why you're so cold to me
With every breath you breathe
I see there's something going on
I don't understand why you're so cold
I don't understand why you're so cold

[Verse 3: Future & Adam Levine]
Never thought that you were like this
I took the tag off, and made you priceless
I just spent half a mill' on a chandelier
Now you tryna cut me off like a light switch, yeah
Tryna stay in our league
Saying that you need some time to breathe
Thinking that I'm sleeping on the four-letter word
But the four-letter word don't sleep
We goin' two separate ways
You ain't been actin' the same
You gotta go, girl, where your heart used to be
You gold-dig every day
I switched the four-door to the two-door
'Cause I can't let my driver hear what you say
Girl, I tried to give you space
Baby, tell me how did you get so cold

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Cold enough to chill my bones
It feels like I don't know you anymore
I don't understand why you're so cold to me
With every breath you breathe
I see there's something going on
I don't understand why you're so cold

[Post-Chorus: Adam Levine]
Whoa, yeah
Whoa, yeah
I don't understand why you're so cold

[Verse 1]
Come in to me, I know mystical garden
Orchards and violets, all mysteries are parted
Life is a mirage-ghost, imagination
Pure inspiration called justification
Nothing's impossible, nothing's concealed
Everything here is for real
What gives fantastical ghouls all in your head?
Who creates these wonders like nobody can?

[Chorus]
Siegfried & Roy
You know it's Siegfried & Roy
So be it, Siegfried & Roy
I'm gonna, Siegfried & Roy
When it's Siegfried & Roy
It's the mind over magic is true
Your own thoughts play the game
In the magical wonders they do
The mind in the magic is you

[Verse 2]
Move of the head and I'll change your emotions
Strange things appear from euphoric, devotions
Everything's happening, nothing's unreal
Hallucinating the mind in the real
Seeing black panthers, they suddenly fly
White tigers stalking your mind
Hallucinating the things that you see
This kind of magic's so hard to believe, be it

[Chorus]
Siegfried & Roy
You know it's Siegfried & Roy
So be it, Siegfried & Roy
I'm gonna Siegfried & Roy
'Cause when it's Siegfried & Roy
It's the mind over magic in true
When it's Siegfried & Roy
It's the mind over magic in true
When it's Siegfried & Roy
It's the mind over magic in true
Hallucinations, the game of this kind
This kind of magic, throw over mind

Siegfried & Roy
You know it's Siegfried & Roy
So be it, Siegfried & Roy
I'm gonna Siegfried & Roy
So be it, Siegfried & Roy
You know it's Siegfried & Roy
So be it, Siegfried & Roy
So be it, Siegfried & Roy
I'm gonna Siegfried & Roy
Okay
One, two, three, four

As the years blow by, baby
The more I come to know myself
The more it seems my love grows, for you
Surely I'd be dead, baby
Had I gone with someone else
For this and more, my love sold to you

K, anytime it feels as though my love has gone, away
K, settle down, turn around
Take this song, let it play

Got to know your heart, baby
Still so much for me to learn
As I do, my love stays with you
Surely I'd be done, baby
Had I made another turn
Glad the turn that I made was you
K, anytime it feels as though my love has gone, away
K, settle down, turn around
Take this song, let it play
K, anytime it feels as though my love has gone, away
K, settle down, turn around
Take this song, let it play

[Verse 1]
For every day we were together
To all the time we were a part
Of each other's lives
Heart to heart
So I had a late arrival
So we never saw the start
Of each other's lives

[Chorus]
Heart to heart
Heart to heart
Heart to heart
Heart to heart
Heart to heart
Heart to heart

[Verse 2]
Now it seems too quick and easy
Sentimentally assumed
Walkin' parallels
Heart to heart
And all the days we were together
To all the times we were a part
Of each other's lives

[Chorus]
Heart to heart
Heart to heart
Heart to heart
Heart to heart
Heart to heart
Heart to heart
Heart to heart
Heart to heart
Heart to heart

Whole crew full of captains, baby, suck these
Yeah, I think all of 'em scandalous
Ever since I saw R. Kelly make her drink the piss
'Bout that cash, it get hot, kerosene
Stop the starin', watch that money lean
Smokin' Backwoods, that's a fuckin' leaf
Serve a lot of white like a bunch of Tees
Room full of hoes like a bunch of squids
Heard them hoes yellow like a bunch of fees
Never had to take, I never wore a ski
I'm talkin' all blue hunnids and I ain't have to scheme
All my jewelry wet, your shit a bunch of cheese
Kickin' shit, surrounded by a bunch of flees
I'm used to these hoes, I got a bunch of these
Neck flooded lookin' like a bunch of Mr. T's
Run them numbers up like a crew full of geeks, huh
Wet racks, iron on it, huh
Mink coat gators got the swine, don't it? Huh
Bitches wanna fuck, I'm in my prime, homie, huh

Word to my mama

[Outro: Swizz Beatz]
Oh
Word to my mama, word to
Word to my mama
Word to my mama and my whole niggas bring the fuckin' drama
Goddamn

[Intro]
Froze hearted, she left me out for dead
They left me out for dead, just like my mama told me
I'm back on road, I'm like, fuck a friendship
That's a costly pleasure, I can't afford no homies
Niggas plotted on me, damn near laid on me
I was beggin' 'em for my shot and niggas played on me
I'm back on road, tellin' them wait on it
I call the shots now and I make the plays on it

[Verse]
Lied to my bitch so much, I'm startin' to believe it
I done brought her one Chanel, then she got conceited
At school, I was sellin' dope to students and the teachers
I'm a self-made nigga, bitch, you wanna leave, then leave me
Got my heart broken, bitch, and threw me back in savage mode
If she ever let me fuck again, it be a grab-and-go
Woulda held it down but, bitch, you got me lookin' goofy
The way I'm feelin', see your man, it might just slap his Kufi off
Niggas think I'm wildin', they should see me out in action
Stop sign on my hip for niggas seein' me in traffic
You don't get no points for pullin' faggot moves
It's cat and mouse, out with this cheese, I call it rata-tool
Watchin' out for feds, I gotta keep some dawgs with me
Niggas swoop and sneak, they'll lay down and get robbed with you
Used to hit that pot up with that finger-roll
Shit, I used to hit that pot up with that finger-roll
Lied to myself so much, I'm startin' to believe it
I tell her that I'm dippin' when we both know I ain't leavin'
Tell her that I'm faithful, we both know that I'm cheatin'
I been keepin' this shit hunnid since like '93
Live from the trap, bitch, I ain't supposed to be here
I get caught with certain guys, and they gon' give me three years
Lil' nigga break his arm fuckin' with that kickback
Niggas stole our cousin from us, now we want our lick back

[Intro: Conor McGregor]
I just wanna say from the bottom of me heart
I'd like to take this chance to apologize to absolutely nobody
The double champ does what the **** he wants

[Chorus]
Uh, woo, ayy
'Bout to go stupid again
She out the roof of the Benz
I'm 'bout to do her to get her
I'ma fuck two of her friends
Just made a flip off the wop
Fuck the Franck Mueller, I jump out the jeweler again
I fucked my money up on the re-up
But I got it right back and I blew it again
Uh, ayy

[Verse]
Bag full of bricks
Back sellin' Knicks like Ewing again
Trap ain't bump like this since '06, Soulja Boy shit, start you-in' again
Clear it out
Grrrr, stick 'em
Air it out
Brrrr, flip 'em
Whereabouts
I ain't never 'bout to give 'em
Fair amounts
I ain't never finna hit 'em with
Triple in it, double-up the stash, caught a brick
Another half, finna got another twenty on the vision
Spatula, flippin' it, a Caddy from the kitchen
I'ma hustle 'til the car came with another brick in it
Crib came with another bitch in it
If you ain't gettin' litty with the shitty, I'ma put another bitch in it
Bitch better hit me with deep throat (Oh)
And no, I ain't talkin' 'bout Michigan, ayy
Oh, uh, damn, shit
I'm goin' stupid and shit (Woo)
She play the flute with my dick
Wrist, sick, I got the flu on a bitch
I play it cool on a bitch
Hit, stick, that's how I do on your bitch (Uh)
What I'ma do in this bitch
Pussy was great, flew out and flew in this bitch
.40, shinin' and shinin'
Way in the hills, I'm high in the climate
Niggas is trickin' and niggas is simpin'
Payin' for heels, and winin' and dinin'
Jewish lawyers on the phone call
I said I'ma sign that lil' shit when I sign it
I got these Benjamin Frank on my body
Ain't finna fuck if this shit ain't exotic, woo
Ten trap phones 'cause the bitch keep on callin'
Sleepin' on the floor, I be scammin', gettin' it all in
Do the money dance when the money fall
Nigga, fuck my ex, I'm uninvolved
You can suck my dick and lick a nut too (Woo)
Yeah, you don't like me, nigga, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you
(Fuck you, nigga)
Damn, he runnin' through all his paper
That's what I do to a hater
Don't touch two things, my hair or my paper (Woo)
Passin' that bitch and she hot
Pass her like hot potato
I grind, I skate her (Uh)
And she look good, I might date her
Pussy was good and I ate it
Lil' bitch, I'm Bajan, woo

[Interlude]
Wait, hold the fuck up, hold the fuck up, hold up
So we both at the function, you know what I'm sayin'
You pull up with your bitch in the 458
I pull up with my bitch in the 488
You pull up beside my shit, like, "Yo, what's the difference between  my 458 and your 488?"
'Bout like eighty to hundred thousand, cock sucker, beat it
Woo, ayy

[Chorus]
'Bout to go stupid again
She out the roof of the Benz
I'm 'bout to do it her to get her
I'ma fuck two of her friends
Just made a flip off the wop
Fuck the Franck Mueller, I jump out the jeweler again
I fucked my money up on the re-up
But I got it right back and I blew it again

[Outro]
Hahaha
We don't wanna hear no sucker shit after this shit either, nigga
Know what I'm sayin'?
Oh, you worried 'bout your bitch?
Yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah, she's here
Know what I'm sayin'?
Oui, oui, parlez-vous français and all that good shit
Ha, straight off the runway in Paris, nigga
Give ten fucks about a bitch

[Intro]
Yeah
Shit, felt this shit in my soul, nigga, like
Got me feelin' this shit
Time for niggas to start payin' me

[Chorus]
No license, top down, you still pushin'
Fuck a nigga, we slide the block, they still pussy
12 watchin', but you got kids, you gotta get it
And I gotta put some food up in that kitchen
These niggas can't feel my pain in it, ayy
And all this shit it took a nigga just to get here
Nigga try me, I let it bang on him
We came from nothin', never thought that we would get here
And my circle is full of made niggas
You don't bring bread to the table, then you can't sit here
I know these niggas don't feel my pain, nigga, nah, nah
But I promise I'm 'bout to have it rockin' this year, uh-huh

[Verse]
Talkin' packs in diesel, sellin' that liquid by the liter
I ain't go to school today, my nigga, I got holes in my Adidas
I got stains on most my t-shirts and these niggas, they used to laugh
But they can't laugh now that that flow come out them speakers
Nigga, nah
And they thought they caught me slippin', but I turned around and banged on 'em
Turned around and flamed on 'em
Shit just sound insane, don't it?
Icy on my wrist, you know my jeweler go insane on it
Shooters that'll kill you for a chain with the gang on it
You can't feel they pain on it, you can't feel they pain on it
Snatch a nigga soul and his chain in the same moment
My baby cryin' tears and who the fuck am I finna blame on it?
So I hit that corner, if I die, I'll be a stain on it
Know I'm from that block, I swing an Ox, I do my thang on it
Life is not a game, so I ain't got no time to play opponents
Life is not a game, so I just hit the block and spray opponents
In the pockets, layin' on 'em
In the drop, I'm waitin' on 'em
Sellin' soda, mama worried, I pay dues, baby
Hug the corner, mama worried I make the news, baby
Back then, did it all for a pair of shoes, baby
Lookin' back at it, I couldn't understand my views, baby
On the come-up, and I want ice and flashy rings, nigga
Everything we never had as kids drove us insane, nigga
You had it, we had it, but it wasn't the same, nigga
Now imagine niggas havin' fame, nigga
We was on the train, nigga, bust down the chain, nigga
Bust down the jewels like we bust down the thing, nigga
Got rid of some niggas, they mood, I couldn't hang with 'em
Smile in my face, but them niggas was hidin' hate in 'em
Oh, no

[Interlude]
Yeah, we was born champions
And we was turned soldiers
Somewhere encaged in the concrete jungle, we all lost touch
Head to the sky, back to the wall
Young and not fully prepared to understand the facts of it all
With starvation in our stomachs and concentration in our eyes
You see niggas deprived of a life we thought was perfect
So what that mean is every scheme, hustle, and jugg is worth it until we murdered, nigga

[Chorus]
No license, top down, you still pushin'
Fuck a nigga, we slide the block, they still pussy
12 watchin', but you got kids, you gotta get it
And I gotta put some food up in that kitchen
These niggas can't feel my pain in it, ayy
And all this shit it took a nigga just to get here
Nigga try me, I let it bang on him
We came from nothin', never thought that we would get here
And my circle is full of made niggas
You don't bring bread to the table, then you can't sit here
I know these niggas don't feel my pain, nigga, nah, nah
But I promise I'm 'bout to have it rockin' this year, uh-huh

[Intro]
Yeah, yeah

[Verse]
Dope stash in my Bimmer, I can cash out on Adidas
Should I trap or should I rap and spend this cash all on a feature?
My niggas is in the field and they adopted, so I teach
But I gotta spend this cash all on this motherfuckin' re-up
I'm tryna be a leader but, shit, I'm fallin' in my past
The trap callin' for this cash, I scrape the bottom of the stash
Front a nigga one and I can press it, I can stretch that bitch to half
A lot of shit a nigga never had a nigga's tryna grab
And R.I.P. my nigga Black 'cause they done chopped him into pieces
He was tryna duck polices, I was tryna duck the Reaper
I was on the block, hustlin', just tryna stuff the reefer
In the pocket with the nina, shit, I'm poppin' with the heater if I need her
I'm in the kitchen bakin' like Anita, tryna freak it like Adina, sell and sneak it to a beaner
I was younger, was fuckin' up the re-up coppin' sneakers
'Cause the OGs never taught me how to be up, I got beat up
On them corners, but I came back
Trap back jumpin', had it poppin' on the same track
Lil' mama thuggin', got my name as her face tat
Shit, you gotta face facts
It's some real niggas in this shit, you can't replace that
Same block, same strap, shoot a nigga face back
Leave his head in his legs, waist in his wave cap
Cocked the K back, was blowin' blades where his braids at
Cocked the K back, had so much pain so I stained that
Mama cried tears, we did bids throughout the years
I had a couple niggas die and I'm just wishin' you was here, but shit is clear
I'm ridin' with my pistol like a Piston through the fear and let them niggas know I'm here
I promise when I die, they celebrate me like I'm 'Pac
It'll be because I reached my goal, not 'cause I sold this rock
Any nigga that try to hate me, promise, dawg, they gon' get shot
I'm from the Dot and I got some niggas that's still down to knock your top
I put this on my baby, this being broke shit done drove me crazy
All my friends done got ghost and went Swayze
My number-one question now is, "Lord, am I gon' make it?"
'Cause it's times I feel alone and just so hopeless on this pavement
I tried to work a nine-to-five, but I can't wait for payment
Shit, that shit just take too long and plus the feelin' so complacent
But I look at that road and it's like my goals are so adjacent
The devil on my shoulder, it's gettin' colder in this basement
I got killers on the left of me, drug dealers on my right
To the world they look scary, but I knew these niggas all my life
And now my little nigga scammin', he tryna cop it off a swipe
I remember different nights, duckin' cops and runnin' flights of stairs
Niggas gettin' scared, but, pussy boy, that ain't my type
I threw it up with niggas past my weight and twice my height
Ever sat up in that dark place just tryna find a light?
I can't even trust myself, my left hand don't know my right
I can put this on my dead mama
Marijuana sales done bought this Ferragamo
Out of state licks, done got to flex some Moncler on 'em
Bitch, I'm all smiles like the logo of the Murakami
Niggas can't stop me, now they fearin' on me
Only thing I fear is God, I can never fear the odds
Eric committin' a suicide the only time you seen the tears fall
Shot my nigga Nesta in his head, they tried to clear 'em off
Then my cousin Dave got shot in front of grandma's
I been in them shootouts in the parkin' lots and standoffs
Real plugs where I'm from, no niggas never ranned off
Give it to my lil' nigga, pass it by the hand-off
Had to sell him game, you gotta pass and put your man on

[Outro]
'Cause even if I
Even if I don't get it
Then I might die trying
'Cause I was born broke but I'ma die rich
Even if I
If I never get it
I'll still have this dope stash when I blow past
Sellin' snow like it's winter in the forecast
I gotta make it
I gotta make it
Said, I gotta make it
And if they won't give it to me, I'm gon' take it, woah
I gotta make it
I gotta make it
And if they won't give it to me, I'm gon' take it

[Intro]
C-Sick

[Verse]
Uh
Soon as you hear this verse, I'm out the record deal
Exceeded twelve albums, four years, and that's a record still
Hand to the sky like Emmett Till off the steppin' wheel
And minus all the sex appeal, your boy about to flex for real
Rolls-Royce Cullinan, four-doors 'cause my son in it
I'm drivin' down the Gardiner, Toronto, home city
With two tings that I partnered up, playin' putter and possum
Then I puff with my girls like Buttercup with a Blossom
Excessive needs for pussy, power, and SUVs
That drop us to the back-door entrances, stress relief
And no less, indeed, the shooters is pressin' like refugees
And the fee at the entranceway too high just to let 'em free
What can't alarm me is whose crew's finna harm me
My little dudes move like new recruits in the army
And all they see is food, shrimps, scallops, and calamari
I gallivant at a Barbie while they gather back at your party
Uh, should let the women I fuck raw and unprotected
Like, fuck, if you get pregnant, I'll keep it
Keep a secret, only in town for a week, and I'm
Datin' women knowin' I'm cheatin' for foreign reasonin'
Fuck y'all niggas throwin' y'all beef in, I'm goin' vegan with Heaven's timin'
Shootin' and set designin', they're movin' like I sold ten million records in record timin'
I did, then I kept on climbin'
I started at 90 Orenda, plays and private agendas
Tryna get fly, but niggas tried and I kindly reject 'em
They ran my name through the mud, but I'm finally respected
This here out of the plan, this more of a God purpose
This here out of my hands, this'll never feel like 2012
Signin' to Sean Kingston for clout and advance
I'm still proud of that man, know I fell out from his hands
He didn't do me worse than — and all of his friends
Them niggas out of this world, they came out of the sands
I'm still 'bout it, my mans
Thought this shit was mad love 'til I see my album advance
They took radio from me, I stayed proud of my stance
I kept slappin' the world with hits like I powdered my hands
I would've been ten times bigger if — wasn't bein' bitter and doubtin' my chance
Threatenin' to shelf my whole career for five years
As if he wasn't takin' money from out my advance
I got out by chance
Them nights was like the Super Bowl, watchin' out from the stands
God don't make things happen by chance
And it's some things you gon' have to experience
I'm dappin' up the border officer passin' the clearance
He always makes a corny joke 'bout my rapper appearance
Then I do a fake laugh that he catches like pass interference
I fly back into Paris
Blunt smoke ash on my terrace
My competition's just a empty-ass class full of chairs
Talkin' to myself, it's lonely, minus the fact that I'm here
I'm tryna see all of my niggas blossom
Mariah sellin' shows, Coachella her first year
And minus all the times we disagree, I'm still here
Pierre, Papi Yerr 'bout to be a whole millionaire
Davo comin' out the cut with a chick with Sicilian hair
Mansa droppin' next month, you niggas should be in fear
Watchin' Melii do the numbers like she runnin' track and field
Plus we just got Kaash in here
And it's all Umbrella army on full attack mode, for real
New Toronto 3, I'll leave it at that
And ain't nobody fuckin' with me, folk, I'll keep it at that, yeah
The next move is goin' fully independent
And any label offer under hundred mill' is just offensive
I promise

[Verse]
'90s televisions, that raised me
Made me feel like it was gravy, I wasn't crazy
Nowadays, the kids all lazy, the pics all crazy
In the land of doin' drugs and bustin' clips off safety
I be cryin' to the Lord in the times that I feel unsure
Wisdom of the Scriptures like carvin' lines in the sword
I pray we stick together like all the vines on the wall
Climbin' until we fall and drivin' until we stall
Designer clothes got us here dyin' in every store
Buyin' it when we poor, knowin' this shit a hassle and
Money that should've been going to ownin' bigger castles
And still we'll dibble-dabble and try to find it abroad
Livin' life in this fog, our eyes covered
With all the self-inflicted danger, we could die from it
I'm runnin' through the game just tryna find some ties from it
I was buggin' the times that I said that I love it
Because I grew to love myself and who hovers above me
And plus my family and my brothers who love me
This is God purpose
I know the Devil wanna scratch me off surface
But every attempt he tryin' is worthless, that boy'll never get me
Or represent me, fall out and get to resent me
I'm part of Jehovah army, I know exactly who sent me
And I don't mean to sound like I'm preachin' you down
Disregard my past ways, this what I'm teachin' you now
Words that I should've been spoke, I'ma speak 'em up now
Niggas try to ether my style while keepin' me down
I can tell you, so many people wan' find reason for livin'
Wanna be a helpin' hand, but don't know how to give it
I told 'em, "Fall on your knees, repent for your evil deeds
Ask God to show you, but, nigga, actually seek
Mean it when you say it, don't pray it because I told you
Do it for the need of Him to show you," I'm tellin' y'all
I ain't never, ever, ever felt better, dawg
Bentley pullin' off, Bentayga, still smellin' off, yeah
I love my haters when they jealous, dawg, uh
'Cause all that I can do is flourish, dawg
Yeah, Daystar

[Verse 1]
They say, "Keep your friends close''
But you're closer, I love when you're here
I'm so far away sometimes, I'm distant, yeah
You might help me, intimacy, I'll admit, I'm scared
Maybe, maybe you can reach me, yeah

[Chorus]
Maybe you're my enemy
Now I've finally let you come a little close to me, oh
Maybe you're my enemy
You're the only one who knows the way I really feel, oh
Now it's really clear to me
You could do a little damage, you could cut me deeper
Maybe you're my enemy
Baby, you're my enemy, yeah

[Verse 2]
Suddenly, you're in my bedroom under my sheets every night
Suddenly, I lose my fear, it feels good, yeah
I feel guilty, I feel nervous, I feel certain now
Maybe, maybe you can reach me, yeah

[Chorus]
Maybe you're my enemy
Now I've finally let you come a little close to me, oh
Maybe you're my enemy
You're the only one who knows the way I really feel, oh
Now it's really clear to me
You could do a little damage, you could cut me deeper
Maybe you're my enemy
Baby, you're my enemy, yeah

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, yeah
Yeah, oh
Maybe you're my enemy
Baby, you're my enemy, yeah

[Bridge]
So calm at the surface
I'm scared of nothin'
Underneath, I'm nervous
Can you reach me?
So calm at the surface
Told you I'm scared of nothin'
Underneath, I'm nervous, yeah
Can you reach me?

[Interlude]
I think a tough journey to be on
Whilst you're around a lot of people
I feel like I'm learning that about myself
And I don't fully really understand it yet
It hurts here, it like hurts here

[Chorus]
Maybe you're my enemy
Now I've finally let you come a little close to me, oh
Maybe you're my enemy
You're the only one who knows the way I really feel, oh
Now it's really clear to me
You could do a little damage, you could cut me deeper
Maybe you're my enemy
Baby, you're my enemy, yeah

[Post-Chorus]
Can you reach me?
Maybe you're my enemy
Can you reach me?
Baby, you're my enemy, yeah
Can you reach me?
Baby, you're my enemy, yeah
Can you reach me?

[Outro]
I seem to think that I'm a really bad person

[Intro]
I like, I like, I like, I like
I like, I like, I like, I like, I like, I like
I like, I like, I like

[Verse 1]
Like your mind, like your smile
Like your eyes, I could die
Aeroplane, you are so fly

Slip and slide up my thighs (Ah)

[Verse 1: Khalid]
Got my headlights off, we're sittin' outside
If you climb in my car, then we're here all night, ooh
A couple blunts rolled and I got my windows down
Shorty, it's been a while since you've been this high

[Pre-Chorus: Khalid]
If you're waitin' on love, then you waitin' for a while
If your neighbors wake up, then we gotta turn it down
So you say I'm the type you like keepin' around
You like keepin' around

[Chorus: Khalid with Summer Walker]
Late at night, eleven, we're cruisin'
Lately, I've been watchin' your movements
If I'm the only one that you're choosin'
Am I your favorite drug you've been usin'?
Late at night, eleven, we're crusin'
Lately, I've been watchin' your movements
If I'm the only one that you're choosin'
Am I your favorite drug you've been usin'?

[Verse 2: Summer Walker]
Lost track of time
If I'm waitin' on love, I'll be waitin' all night
I can't get this high from nowhere else
And I'm tryin' to let you go, but it's all alright
I know I can't stay up on my feelings when I'm with you
I know, I admit it, I'm addicted when I'm with you
Whenever I'm with with you

[Chorus: Khalid with Summer Walker, Summer Walker]
Late at night, eleven, we're cruisin' (Ah)
Lately, I've been watchin' your movements
If I'm the only one that you're choosin'
Am I your favorite drug you've been usin'?
Late at night, eleven, we're cruisin'
Lately, I've been watchin' your movements
If I'm the only one that you're choosin'
Am I your favorite drug you've been usin'?

[Bridge: Khalid, Summer Walker, Both]
Ooh, don't you forget about me
Ooh, don't you forget about me (Na, na)
Ooh, don't you forget about me (Oh na, na)
Ooh, don't forget about me
Ooh, don't you forget about me (Oh, oh whoa)
Ooh, don't you forget about me, yeah
Ooh, don't you forget about me (Oh whoa)
Ooh, don't you forget about me

[Chorus: Khalid with Summer Walker, Summer Walker]
Late at night, eleven, we're cruisin' (Yeah, yeah)
(Lately, I've been watchin' your, watchin' your)
If I'm the only one that you're choosin'
Am I your favorite drug you've been usin'?

[Outro: Khalid]
Don't you forget about me
If I'm the only one that you're
Am I your favorite drug you've been usin', usin'?
If I'm the only one that you're
Am I your favorite drug you've been usin', usin'?
Don't you forget about me
If I'm the only one that you're
Am I your favorite drug you've been usin', usin'?
If I'm the only one that you're
Am I your favorite drug you've been usin', usin'?

[Intro]

Mmm, uhh uhh

[Verse 1]
It doesn't matter where we started
Just as long as we finish together
It's a ballad for the broken-hearted
Make you feel as light as a feather
One foot in front of the other
You always gotta take your time
You just gotta trust your lover
Everything will work out fine

[Chorus]
Lead me, by example
Lead me, 'cause I've been goin' nowhere
Lead me, to the promise land
I'll follow you through fire
You're more than a friend

[Verse 2]
What if we just kept on walkin'
And count the cracks along the ground?
And quitting's crossed my mind quite often
But we've come too far to turn around
Baby, you don't have to worry
And darlin' you don't have to fear
If we ever feelin' worry
Love will lead us both from it

[Chorus]
So lead me, uh, by example
Lead me, 'cause I've been goin' nowhere
Lead me, to the promise land
I'll follow you through fire
You're more than my friend
Lead me, by example
Lead me, 'cause I've been goin' nowhere
Lead me, to the promise land
I'll follow you through fire
You're more than my friend

[Bridge]
Doesn't matter where we started
As long as we finish together
I said it doesn't matter where we started
As long as we finish together

[Chorus]
Lead me (Lead me), by example, darlin'
Lead me, baby I ain't goin' nowhere
Lead me (Lead me), you are the promise land
Follow you through fire
More than a friend

[Outro]
Lead me (Lead me)
Hmm, hmm
Lead me (Lead me)
Show me the way
Lead me (Lead me)

[Verse 1]
When the speed kicks in
I go to the store for nothing
And walk right by
The house where you lived with Snow White
I wonder if she ever thought
The storybook tiles on the roof were too much
But from the window, it's not a bad show
If your favorite thing's Dianetics or stucco

[Pre-Chorus]
The drugstores are open all night
The only real reason I moved to the east side
I love a good place to hide in plain sight

[Chorus]
What if I told you
I feel like I know you?
But we never met

[Verse 2]
And here, everyone knows you're the way to my heart
Hear so many stories of you at the bar
Most times, alone, and some, looking your worst
But never not sweet to the trust funds and punishers

[Pre-Chorus]
Man, I wish that I could say the same
I swear I'm not angry, that's just my face
A copycat killer with a chemical cut
Either I'm careless or I wanna get caught
Who I'm not

[Chorus]
What if I told you
I feel like I know you?
But we never met
It's for the best

[Outro]
I can't open my mouth and forget how to talk
'Cause even if I could
Wouldn't know where to start
Wouldn't know when to stop

[Verse 1]
I've been running around in circles
Pretending to be myself
Why would somebody do this on purpose
When they could do something else?
Drowning out the morning birds
With the same three songs over and over
I wish I wrote it, but I didn't so I learn the words
Hum along 'til the feeling's gone forever

[Chorus]
Took a tour to see the stars
But they weren't out tonight
So I wished hard on a Chinese satellite
I want to believe
Instead, I look at the sky and I feel nothing
You know I hate to be alone
I want to be wrong

[Verse 2]
You were screamin' at the Evangelicals
They were screamin' right back from what I remember
When you said I will never be your vegetable
Because I think when you're gone, it's forever
But you know I'd stand on the corner
Embarrassed with a picket sign
If it meant I would see you when I die

[Chorus]
Sometimes, when I can't sleep
It's just a matter of time before I'm hearing things
Swore I could feel you through the walls
But that's impossible
I want to believe
That if I go outside I'll see a tractor beam
Coming to take me to where I'm from
I want to go home

[Verse 1]
You asked to walk me home
But I had to carry you
And you pushed me in
And now my feet can't touch the bottom of you

[Verse 2]
You couldn't have
You couldn't have
Stuck your tongue down the throat of somebody
Who loves you more
So I will wait for the next time you want me
Like a dog with a bird at your door
Mmm

[Verse 3]
We hate Tears In Heaven
But it's sad that his baby died
And we fought about John Lennon
Until I cried
And then went to bed upset

[Verse 4]
But now I am dreaming
And you're singing at my birthday
And I've never seen you smiling so big
It's nautical themed
And there's something I'm supposed to say
But can't for the life of me
Remember what it is

[Chorus]
And if I could give you the moon
I would give you the moon

[Outro]
You are sick and you're married
And you might be dying
But you're holding me like water in your hands
When you saw the dead little bird
You started crying
But you know the killer doesn't understand

[Verse 1]
Emotional affair
Overly sincere
Smoking in the car, windows up
Crocodile tears, run the tap 'til it's clear
Drift off on the floor
I drag you to the shore
Sweating through the sheets
You're gonna drown in your sleep for sure
Wake up and start a big fire
In our one room apartment
But I'm too tired
To have a pissing contest
All the bad dreams that you hide
Show me yours, I'll show you mine

[Verse 2]
Call me when you land
I'll drive around again
One hand on the wheel, one in your mouth
Turn me on and turn me down
Baby, you're a vampire
You want blood and I promised
I'm a bad liar
With a savior complex
All the skeletons you hide
Show me yours, and I'll show you mine

[Outro]
All the bad dreams that you hide
Show me yours

[Verse 1]
Somewhere in Germany, but I can't place it
Man, I hate this part of Texas
Close my eyes, fantasize
Three clicks and I'm home
When I get back I'll lay around
Then I'll get up and lay back down
Romanticize a quiet life
There's no place like my room

[Chorus]
But you had to go, I know, I know, I know
Like a wave that crashed and melted on the shore
Not even the burnouts are out here anymore
And you had to go, I know, I know, I know

[Verse 2]
Out in the park, we watch the sunset
Talking on a rusty swing set
After a while you went quiet
And I got mean
I'm always pushing you away from me
But you come back with gravity
And when I call, you come home
A bird in your teeth

[Chorus]
So I gotta go, I know, I know, I know
When the sirens sound, you'll hide under the floor
But I'm not gonna go down with my hometown in a tornado
I'm gonna chase it, I know, I know, I know
I gotta go now, I know, I know, I know

[Verse 3]
Driving out into the sun
Let the ultraviolet cover me up
Went looking for a creation myth
Ended up with a pair of cracked lips
Windows down, scream along
To some America First rap country song
A slaughterhouse, an outlet mall
Slot machines, fear of God
Windows down, heater on
Big bolt of lightning hanging low
Over the coast, everyone's convinced
It's a government drone or an alien spaceship
Either way, we're not alone
I'll find a new place to be from
A haunted house with a picket fence
To float around and ghost my friends
No, I'm not afraid to disappear
The billboard said "The End Is Near"
I turned around, there was nothing there
Yeah, I guess the end is here

[Outro]
The end is here
The end is here
The end is here
The end is... ahh!

[Chorus]
Everywhere everywhere, everywhere I go
Everywhere that I've been the only thing I see is
Is beautiful people, beautiful people
Beautiful people, beautiful people
Oh-woah, don't you know? Don't you know?
Oh-woah, you're beautiful, don't you know?
Oh-woah, don't you know? Don't you know?
Oh-woah, beautiful, don't you know, know, know?

[Verse 1]
Live your life, live your life, let the love inside
It's your life, it's your life
Got to live it right
Take your time, take your time
Take your sexy time
Don't lose your head, lose your head
Your beauty's deep inside, inside you
Don't let 'em bring you down, no
The beauty is inside you
Don't let 'em bring you down, no

[Pre-Chorus]
The beauty is inside you
Don't let 'em bring you down
'Cause you start your life today
Live any thoughts you've dreamed of

[Chorus]
Everywhere everywhere, everywhere I go
Everywhere that I've been the only thing I see is
Is beautiful people, beautiful people
Beautiful people, beautiful people
Oh-woah, don't you know? Don't you know?
Oh-woah, you're beautiful, don't you know?
Oh-woah, don't you know? Don't you know?
Oh-woah, beautiful, don't you know, know, know?

[Verse 2]
Take your time, take your time, take your sexy time
Don't lose your head, lose your head
Your beauty's deep inside, inside you
Don't let 'em bring you down, no
The beauty is inside you
Don't let 'em bring you down, no

[Pre-Chorus]
The beauty is inside you
Don't let 'em bring you down

[Chorus]
Everywhere everywhere, everywhere I go
Everywhere that I've been the only thing I see is
Is beautiful people, beautiful people
Beautiful people, beautiful people
Oh-woah, don't you know? Don't you know?
Oh-woah, you're beautiful, don't you know?
Oh-woah, don't you know? Don't you know?
Oh-woah, beautiful, don't you know, know, know?

[Verse 1: Jamie Foxx & Tank]
You shouldn't have left me alone with her
She shouldn't have looked so damn (so damn good)
And I tried to walk away but
I am just a man (just a man)
Tryin' to understand (oooh)

Girl I've never meant it, to happen like that (happen like that)
She found out my weakness
There was no turning back (no turning back)
She whooped that thing on me
And I couldn't handle it (nooo)
I ain't worth a shit, all I know is, till I ...

[Chorus: Jamie Foxx & Tank]
Till I meet your sister
(Oooh, till I ...) till I meet your sister

(Ooooh) love with you, till I ...

[Verse 2: Jamie Foxx & Tank]
What took you so damn long to make it back home?
Knew I was looking, as long as she would get 

[?]
She turned around and she said: "Do you like that ass?" (hell yeah)
Damn I'm sleeping fast oooh (oooh)
Why was she all in my business? (I don't know)
Why would she wearin' that dress? (ooh, I don't know)
But did you do this on purpose?
Testing me (oooh)
Just to see (oooh)
If you could (oooh) persuade me (oooh)
Till I met ...

[Chorus: Jamie Foxx & Tank]
Till I meet your sister
(Oooh, till I ...) till I meet your sister
(I was in love with you) till I meet your sister
(Mmm, ooooh) love with you, till I

[Verse 3: Jamie Foxx & Tank]
I am so far from your forgiveness
I hurt you deeply I can tell
And I know for all my witness
I probably gonna burn in hell

If I had a chance to fix it (fix it)
Your broken heart, I'd take it back (take it back)
The promises, a reminisce, of what we had
Until I met your sister (sister)

[Outro: Jamie Foxx & Tank]
Wooo wooo yeah
Baby till I met your (sister)
Oooh (yeah)
I don't know what to do
All I can say
(baby, till I met)
Till I met
Till I met, (listen)
Till I met yeah
(baby till I met)
Oooooh
Till I (till I met your sister)
(baby till I met)
Let me tell you one thing
One thing about your sister

Let me be honest with you (baby till I met)
Didn't mean to make her cry
Just couldn't know could I  (till I met your sister)
I don't know what but
(baby till I met)
I'm so 

[?]
I didn't mean to hurt you all  (till I met your sister)
Sorry baby
Yeah, yeah, yeah
(baby till I met)
Your mama already don't like me
I've made it worst  (till I met your sister)
Tell her I'm so sorry, so sorry, so sorry
(baby till I met)
But till I met
Till I met (till I met your sister)
Till I, till I, till I ...
Wooo, noooo

[Verse 4: Jamie Foxx, Tank and more backing voices]
(If it wasn't for your sister)
We would go to the movies
Hand on hand, you and I
Do all the things we'll always do
(If it wasn't for your sister)
We would probably can marry
Build a crib
Have some kids
Grow together
(If it wasn't for your sister)

[Intro]
We got London on da track

[Chorus]
I will never never forgive you
So you might as well stay away (I got like 24 hundred in my pocket, but I got extras)
No way, no way, no

[Post-Chorus]
I'm sittin' on top of the world, I'm sittin' on top of the world
I'm mountain high right now
I'm sittin' on top of the world, I'm sittin' on top of the world
I'm sittin' on top of the world, I'm mountain high, hey
Woah
I'ma turn up every time I think about a nigga
Turn up every time I think about a nigga

[Verse 1]
Up in my house, then I go and hop out the shower
Then I go and down me a ounce
Hop in the car, then I go let off the top
Then I go and look at the stars
I'm one of those, I see that bitch from afar
I'ma throw it like Brett Farve
She do her job, suck me like corn on the cob
So many bands, it's a fraud
Go to her job, then I'm gon' walk in her job
Then I'm gon' cum in her jaw
Hennessy boys, we are the Hennessy boys

[?] remedy boys
I'm tellin' his broad we are the TTG boys
I'm in love with the Birdman 'cause he in love with me, broad

[Chorus]
I will never never forgive you
So you might as well stay away
I won't ever ever forgive you
No way, no way, no way, no way

[Verse 2]
He ain't goin' down like that
Pay the lil' bitty bitch while the bitch go down like that
Young nigga bangin' red like the nose on a clown like that
So you just gon' tell me you stealin' my sound like that?
Okay, okay, okay, okay then
Let them bitches spend the night, she tryna stay in
I can't be with you, baby, you cannot lay in
But 

[?] that's what I'ma lay in
I'ma use your titty for my pillow, baby, baby
My Maison Margielas the latest, latest, latest
I could've took care of ten of them little babies
Nigga want war, he better pull up with the Navy
The way I'm ballin', it ain't basic
I beat a case and then I went and bought ten cases
Ace of spades, pour it on her fragrance
Call of Duty, I hop out with TECs and them Uzis
I drink that Actavis until I wake up woozy
Boulevard, poke it
Brought me bitch, she was the bomb, a lotus
I got my ice off the Titanic, it was cold as shit
I hate you like you let my blunt get moldy

[Chorus]
I will never never forgive you
So you might as well stay away
I won't ever ever forgive you
No way, no way, no way, no way

[Verse 1]
Here I go breakin' my own heart again
I didn't know that things could get this outta hand
If I called home right now, I'd guarantee
I'd get my share of advice that I don't want, but I might need

[Chorus]
'Cause Daddy says at dinner, "Ain't you to meet a man"
And Mama says, "It don't hurt to find a good one if you can"
Oh, they can't help their preachin'
And they can't stop the reachin' for all the livin' that I ain't done
Got my own road to run
I got my own road to run, yeah

[Verse 2]
I got dreams and I don't really wanna put 'em down
That boy can't see past the edges of this town
And I'm not hangin' around

[Chorus]
'Cause Daddy says at dinner, "Ain't you to meet a man"
And Mama says, "It don't hurt to find a good one if you can"
Oh, they can't help their preachin'
They can't stop the reachin' for all the livin' that I ain't done
Got my own road to run
I got my own road to run, yeah

[Bridge]
I know the truth is that they're usually right, but
I gotta point this steering wheel my own way
Tonight 'cause

[Chorus]
Daddy says at dinner, "Ain't you to meet a man"
And Mama says, "It don't hurt to find a good one if you can"
Oh, they can't help their preachin'
They can't stop my reachin' for all the livin' I ain't done
Got my own road to run
I got my own road
I got my own road to run
I got my own road to run, yeah
Uh, uh, yeah. Lube up, get ready boys, Little Crusty D is going in raw. Yeah, lets go! Pube jungle, Lustful uncle, my toaster is plugged in and ready to go! Stick my dick in and watch the cum flow! My meat is wide, it's tender and tough. I love it when my uncle handles me rough. Crunchy asshole, writhing erection, Little Crusty D loves circumflexion. Bending shaft, cracking cock, smash my balls with a cinder block. My goliath of a cock can destroy entire villages in one fell swoop. I am currently searing my defiled shaft on a Lodge Cast Iron Frying pan. My balls hang down 4 inches, I should seek immediate medical attention. They continue to sag lower everyday. Little Crusty D is out
In the palace in the tower
My dreams were getting louder
It was there in the corner
That I finally found her
It was me
It was me all along
Strongboi

'tween these thighs
I got honey, I got sighs
And I really, really like
What's between your eyes
The things I find
When I'm running all over your mind

Maybe we can fix one another
Open me up and put me back together
I wanna change again
I'm a little flame in a hurricane
There's something pretty big about the small things
Just shake it up you're doing just fine
All you've ever done, my darling
Is just try to feel alright
I said let's try to keep it playful, honey
Try to keep our loving light and sunny
'fore I go running away

Running my hands all over my body
I'm not afraid and I won't say sorry
This is me
It was me all along
Strongboi

Maybe we can fix one another
Open me up and put me back together
I wanna change again
I'm a little flame in a hurricane
There's something pretty big about the small things
Just shake it up you're doing just fine
All you've ever done, my darling
Is just try to feel alright

When I heard you calling out my name
Begging me to come out and play
But I gotta play with myself, baby

[Verse 1]
Love suicide
You and I drove for miles
Knew I'd be here, be here, be here with you
Knew I'd be here, be here, be here with you
We took a dive in the blue, scared to lose
All my feelings, feelings, feelings for you
Knew I'd be here, be here, be here with you

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, now we gotta let this go
Drove the car off the road
I gotta give you time to grow, yeah
You're not a ghost, you're in my head
I didn't wanna leave you low
Drove the car off the road
I hope you get some time to grow, yeah
You're not a ghost, you're in my head

[Chorus]
I will always love you
I'll love you forever
Even when we're not together
I will always love you
I'll love you forever
Said I'll love you forever
I know in the future
We won't see each other
Cold just like December
But I will always love you
I'll love you forever
Yeah, I'll love you forever

[Verse 2]
You take your time, I'll take mine, we'll be fine
Knew I'd be here, be here, be here with you
When the roof caved in and the water fell through
Hope when we're old, we'll be friends, reminisce
Hope we'll be there, be there, be there, us two
All the memories, all the photos we took

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, now we gotta let this go
Drove the car off the road
I gotta give you time to grow, yeah
You're not a ghost, you're in my head
I didn't wanna leave you low
Drove the car off the road
I hope you get some time to grow, yeah
You're not a ghost, you're in my head

[Chorus]
I will always love you
I'll love you forever
Even when we're not together
I will always love you
I'll love you forever
Said I'll love you forever
I know in the future
We won't see each other
Cold just like December
But I will always love you
I'll love you forever
Yeah, I'll love you forever

[Chorus]
Five A.M. when I walked in (Walked in)
Could not believe what I saw, yeah (Saw, yeah)
You were on another one's body (Body)
Ghosts of the past came to haunt me (Haunt me)
I caught you but you never caught me (Caught me)
I was sitting here waiting on karma (Karma)
There goes my guilty conscience (Conscience)
There goes my guilty conscience (Conscience)
Five A.M. when I walked in (Walked in)
Could not believe what I saw, yeah (Saw, yeah)
You were on another one's body (Body)
Ghosts of the past came to haunt me (Haunt me)
I caught you but you never caught me (Caught me)
I was sitting here waiting on karma (Karma)
There goes my guilty conscience (Conscience)
There goes my guilty conscience (Conscience)

[Verse]
No, I won't let you stay
Thanks for the hours, thanks for the days
If I see your eyes, I turn to stone
I look away, I gotta go
Gone for the week, don't bother
'Til pigs fly, she'll keep on callin'
I been workin' for me, not sorry
Next time that we speak'll be calmly
Next time that I go in, I'm all in
Why you so close but you feel so far?
You look the moon in the mornin'
Jaded, faded, almost gone

[Pre-Chorus]
Restin' while I'm inside your presence
I don't wanna think nothin' bad
Goodnights are never really good nights, nights, nights
Feel something that's heavy inside

[Chorus]
Five A.M. when I walked in (Walked in)
Could not believe what I saw, yeah (Saw, yeah)
You were on another one's body (Body)
Ghosts of the past came to haunt me (Haunt me)
I caught you but you never caught me (Caught me)
I was sitting here waiting on karma (Karma)
There goes my guilty conscience (Conscience)
There goes my guilty conscience (Conscience)
Five A.M. when I walked in (Walked in)
Could not believe what I saw, yeah (Saw, yeah)
You were on another one's body (Body)
Ghosts of the past came to haunt me (Haunt me)
I caught you but you never caught me (Caught me)
I was sitting here waiting on karma (Karma)
There goes my guilty conscience (Conscience)
There goes my guilty conscience (Conscience)

[Outro]
There goes my guilty conscience (Conscience)
There goes my guilty conscience (Conscience)
There goes my guilty conscience (Conscience)
There goes my guilty conscience (Conscience)

[Verse 1]
You stir my heart around in your pot
You mix it up with your vinegar smiles
And you tell me I'm the child
You never believed me
When I told you I'm a fairy
I was birthed from a flower
Feeling all sweet and sour

[Chorus]
I spoke all the words that you said
Don't tell me your lovin' is dead
No, where's the glow?
Oh, babe, you got some dust in your head
We ran out of things to have said
No, where's the glow?
Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah

[Verse 2]
I had a carbon copy lady
Back in my school days
She looked like she was going
To dream me away
If I ever met you in my dreams or on the street
I would not say hello
I'd catch you in the afterglow
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Chorus]
I spoke all the words that you said
Don't tell me your lovin' is dead
No, where's the glow?
Oh, babe, you got some dust in your head
We ran out of things to have said
No, I'll catch you in the afterglow

[Outro]
You said that you would never leave me
But you denied me of my daydream
Oh how I love you but I need to explore
How to be alone, alone

[Verse 1]
If I fall in love with you
I need to know that you will love me too
Nobody else for you
And if I give my heart away
Then I must be sure that I will be the one
The only one for you

[Chorus]
If you're only playing games
I don't want to feel a thing
I think I'm proud enough
But you know I'm wanting to believe
You're the one who'll give to me
The bright shining miracle of love

[Verse 2]
And if I fall in love with you
I'll need to know that you love me too
Nobody else for you
Oh..

[Bridge]
Oh promise me there'll be no games
I don't want anything
I have cried enough

[Chorus]
I really want to believe
You're the one who'll give to me
That shining miracle of love

[Outro]
Oh, if I fall in love with you
I need to know that you will love me too
Nobody else for you
Absolutely no one else for you
Oh, no one else
For you

[Chorus]
Little Mama
You're as perfect as I dreamed you would always be
Little Mama
Every part of your mother and the heart of me
Ah yeah

[Verse 1]
I was running like a freight train
Working like a hurricane
Everything seemed like a blur
Then me and your mother focused on each other
I blinked my eyes and there you were

[Chorus]
My little Mama
You're as perfect as I dreamed you would always be
Little Mama
You're the present that the heavens gave to me
Ah yeah
Alright

[Verse 2]
Well, it was barbie dolls and dresses
Birthdays and messes
A house cluttered up with toys
That was prom nights and makeup
Heartaches and breakups
Make me wanna kill those boys

[Chorus]
And little Mama
You're as perfect as I dreamed you would always be
Little Mama
Every part of your mother and the heart of me
Ah yeah

[Bridge]
Ain't nobody ever gonna hurt my baby
You know that's the way I am
You're growing up to be a real special lady
It's gonna take a special man
If he wants to take your hand

[Chorus]
My little Mama
You're as perfect as I dreamed you would always be
Little Mama
You're a present that the heavens gave to me
Ah yeah

[Outro]
Alright
Ah yeah
Precious little baby girl
Daddy loves you
Alright
Daddy loves you
I'll always love you

[Verse 1]
Even when the child is bad you know you can't complain
And even when they do you wrong, you love them just the same
When you look them in the eye, they're as plain to see
You're staring in the eyes of a child that you used to be

[Chorus]
If you love them then show them
You give them what you owe them
But whatever you do
Don't lie
Don't lie

[Verse 2]
Right before you eyes, all grown up and gone away
And it all depends on you if they are gonna stay

[Chorus]
If you love them then show them
You give them what you owe them
But whatever you do
Don't lie

[Outro]
If you don't listen, you lose them
You can choose you or choose them
But whatever you do
Don't lie
Don't lie

[Verse 1]
How can you really know
If you're just spinning wheels
They're moving awfully slow
I wonder how love feels

[Verse 2]
Where does the story go?
Where do I go from here?
Where are the signs that show
I wonder how love feels

[Chorus]
I don't mind wasting my time
As long as you know it's all I have
The only thing that keeps me from crying
Is to look in the mirror and laugh

[Verse 3]
All this pain I ignore
All of the joy it steals
I've always wanted more
I wonder how love feels

[Chorus]
I don't mind wasting my time
As long as you know it's all I have
The only thing that keeps me from crying
Is to just look in the mirror and laugh

[Outro]
All this pain I ignore
All of the joy it steals
I've always wanted more
I wonder how love feels

[Verse 1]
Sittin' on the front porch
With a cold one in my hand
People watching (watching)
A young couple on the corner
Lookin' like forever
And sweet talking (talking)

There's an old man with a cane
I think Jethro is his name
He's havin' a little trouble
While he's street crossin'

[Chorus]
But I'm not going nowhere
I'm just sittin' right here
People watching

[Verse 2]
Miss Tina in her tight dress
High heels on, oh, I guess
She's going downtown (downtown)
The old men all aflutter
Elbowing each other
When she comes around (comes around)
Mmh, mmh, oh
I think my beer is getting low
Why does that seem to happen to me so often?

[Chorus]
But I ain't going nowhere
I'm just sitting right here
People watching

[Refrain]
Everybody's got a story
Everybody's got a song
I could sit here forever
While the parade keeps marching on and on and on
All along
People watching

[Break]

[Refrain]
Everybody's got a story
Everybody's got a song
I could sit here forever
While the parade keeps marching on and on and on
All along
People watching

[Outro]
I said, "Wonder if there's someone watching me while
I'm people watching"
It's better than anything that's on TV
People watching

[Verse 1]
Gotta be my friend and my lover
Gotta be my sister and my brother
You gotta be a helpin' hand
Ah, to catch me when I fall
I hate to put pressure on you
You gotta do it all

[Verse 2]
You got to be my mother and my father
When you see me tryin', you try a little harder
Gotta always be willing to answer when I call
Hate to put pressure on you, baby
But you gotta do it all

[Chorus]
See, I'm not ashamed to say I need you
And I'm not ashamed to say that I need you

[Verse 3]
Be my reason and my rhyme
I'm gonna need you my whole life, whole lifetime
Just lift me up and make me feel ten feet tall
Hate to put pressure on you
You gotta do it all

[Bridge]
Ah yes
You understand what I'm sayin?
Mmm
I'm gonna tell you one more time

[Chorus]
I'm not ashamed to say that I need you
No, I'm not ashamed to say that I need you

[Outro]
Be my friend and my lover
Be my sister and my brother
I need a helpin' hand sometimes
To catch me when I fall
Oh, I don't mean to put pressure on you
You got to do it all
Don't wanna put pressure on you, baby
You gotta do it all
Gotta do it all
I'm nothin', nothin' without you
Can't help myself
I need you
Ah, save my life, take my hand

[Verse 1]
I need, need you
You need me too
That means
We're doin' it all together

I'm here, you're there
You're kind and fair
And that means
We're doin' it all together

[Chorus]
Promises, promises
You just can't promise
Then take it away
If you're a liar
Then just 'cause you're beautiful
It's not okay

[Verse 2]
Through wind and rain
My friend, we've changed
But we still remain
Doin' it all together

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Promises, promises
You just can't promise
Then take it away
If you're a liar
Then just 'cause you're beautiful
It's not okay

[Outro]
'Cause I need, need you
You need me too
And that means
We're doin' it all together
Doin' it all together
Doin' it all together
Doin' it all together

Doin' it all together, 'gether, yes
We're doin' it all together, 'gether, yes
Doin' it all together, oh oh

[Chorus]
Slow down
I'm losin' control of my heart
Slow down
I knew it was you from the start

[Verse 1]
It doesn't matter how long it takes
As long as I'm with you
Lying here till the daylight breaks
Loving the whole night through

[Chorus]
Slow down
I'm losing control of my mind
Slow down
It's only a matter of time

[Verse 2]
When I'm away I can feel you there
Watching over me
I've found a love that's beyond compare
The way it's meant to be
Slow down
Slow down

[Verse 3]
It doesn't matter how long it takes
As long as I'm with you
Lying here till the daylight breaks
Lovin' the whole night through

[Chorus]
Slow down
I'm losing control of my heart
Slow down
I knew it was you from the start
Oh, slow down

[Outro]
Have mercy on me, darling
Slow down
Have mercy
Slow down

[Verse 1]
I'm getting older
There's no time to waste
Mmm.. the inevitability
That I must face

[Chorus]
But before it's all said and done
And there's nowhere left that I can run
I'm going
Going down with the sun

[Verse 2]
I'm weary
Tired of chasing the dream
And I'm burning
Trying to blow off some steam

[Chorus]
But before it's all said and done
And there's nowhere left that I can run
I'm going
Going down with the sun

[Bridge]
I've been exiled
Another high, another low
The punished still here
Our minds already gone
Calling this loneliness helps me hold

[Chorus]
But before it's all said and done
And there's no where left that I can run
I'm going
Going down with the sun

[Outro]
Oh baby
Oh baby

[Verse 1]
I miss you, miss you
Though you haven't gone away
I miss you
Begging, pleading, praying
That I get the chance to kiss you

[Chorus]
Guess I'm rambling and thinking out loud all alone
Can't imagine living this life on my own

[Verse 2]
I'm sorry, sorry
Tell me what I have to do and I'll do it
Mercy, lover
Let me make it up to you
I will prove it

[Chorus]
Guess I'm rambling and thinking out loud all alone
Can't imagine living this life on my own
On my own

[Verse 3]
I miss you, miss you
Though you haven't gone away
I still miss you
Begging, pleading, praying
That I get the chance to kiss you

[Chorus]
Guess I'm rambling and thinking out loud all alone
Can't imagine living this life on my own
Guess I'm rambling and thinking out loud

[Outro]
I'm sorry, please forgive me
That's my greatest fear, darling
I love you too much
Love you way too much
Please
Don’t ever leave me, baby
Guess I'm rambling and thinking out loud
Oh yes, I am
Going crazy
Crazy about you woman

[Verse 1]
There's no civilization in sight
We're losing the light of day
Even in the darkest nights
I'm gonna find my way
Said I'm gonna find my way

[Verse 2]
Another broken neon sign
The circling of the birds of prey
They know it's gonna take some time
But I'm gonna my find my way
Said I'm gonna find my way

[Chorus]
Find my way if it takes forever
Find my way where I belong
We will make a life together
Until then nowhere is home
Until then nowhere is home

[Chorus]
Find my way if it kills me
Till my name is carved in stone
We will make a life together
Until then, nowhere is home
Until then, nowhere is home
Lyrics from Snippet

You kiss me and tell me that you're mine to keep

Mm

Too much I think you went wrong oh baby, oh

And I don't wanna say goodbye
Too much made me feel good, baby

[Chorus]
I know you won't make me alone
And I know you won't make me alive
And I don't want you, baby alone

And I know you won't leave me alone
And I know you won't leave me
Don't make me come back
Don't make me come back, no

[Verse 1]
So hard, things that we've been through, yeah
Could've fallen, but we only grew, yeah (Uh)
So I made my house a home with you (Oh)
I'm right here and it feels brand new
I used to live inside a lie with you (With you)
And now we're honest and it feels so good (Ah, ah)

[Pre-Chorus]
Hello, hello, hello, I see clearly
So long, been scared to show off my feelings
Hello, hello, hello, got new meanin'
Now I really see it

[Chorus]
I know that look inside my eyes means always
Even if we fall apart, split two ways
Used to be afraid to say it, that's so strange
Seven years and it's been you and I, always
Really complicated, we're too deep, babe (Deep, babe)
Really sad, the way our song drives me insane (Me insane)
Used to be afraid to say it, now that's changed
Seven years and it's been you and I, always

[Post-Chorus]
Uh, uh, yeah
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, no

[Verse 2]
Oh yeah, I really, really love you for life (For life)
Without the Holy matrimony, I'm wife (I'm wife)
We went from distant to inseparable types (That's right)
Oh yeah, it's really, really, really, really nice (It's really nice)
And now I never, ever, ever think twice (Not twice)
'Cause you're exactly really, really my type (My type)
I think we took some sleeping pills on that flight (That flight)
The seven years, it really, really flown by (Swoosh)

[Chorus]
I know that look inside my eyes means always (Always)
Even if we fall apart, split two ways (Two ways)
Used to be afraid to say it, that's so strange
Seven years and it's been you and I, always (Always)
Really complicated, we're too deep, babe (Deep, babe)
Really sad, the way our song drives me insane (Me insane)
Used to be afraid to say it, now that's changed
Seven years and it's been you and I, always

Uh, uh, yeah
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, no

I know that look inside my eyes means deep pain (So strange)
Really sad, the way our song drives me insane
(Now, now) Ooh

Oh, yeah, yeah (So strange)
I, always (No way)
(Now that's changed) Ooh
(No, no, no way)
Seven years and it's been you and I, always (Always)
(So strange)
No, oh

[Verse 1]
Close myself off in new ways
Building walls in my sleep, I can't turn back
I've been reelin' for twelve days (Twelve)
When I start to see if it gets real bad

[Chorus]
Hurt me, know you won't hurt me
I'm about to detonate
Pull you close, and then, I'll be gone
Sorry, never say sorry
All my silence resonates
Think you worked me out, but you're wrong
Dirty, I can talk dirty
I can make you feel so sick
Switch your faith and leave you so low
Hurt me, know you'll never hurt me
I'm about to detonate
Pull you close, and then, I'll be gone

[Post-Chorus]
I don't trust myself at all
Why should you trust me?
I don't trust myself alone
Why should you love me?

[Verse 2]
I'm not tryna be rude
I'm just feelin' confused
My emotions get blue
Had to push 'em all through
Know you hope that I'll prove
Everything will stay cool
But I can't promise that's true
'Cause my emotions so blue

[Chorus]
Hurt me, know you won't hurt me
I'm about to detonate
Pull you close, and then, I'll be gone
Sorry, never say sorry
All my silence resonates
Think you worked me out, but you're wrong
Dirty, I can talk dirty
I can make you feel so sick
Switch your faith and leave you so low
Hurt me, know you'll never hurt me
I'm about to detonate
Pull you close, and then, I'll be gone

[Post-Chorus]
I don't trust myself at all
Why should you trust me?
I don't trust myself alone
Why should you love me?

Do-do-do-do you love me?
So do you love me?
Do-do-do-do you love me?
Why should you love me?

Do-do-do-do you love me?
Why should you love me?
Do-do-do-do you love me?

Why should you love me?

[Verse 1]
Hello friends, Cudder again
Gotta smack 'em with some shit before the world ends
Same old denims, wore 'em for days
I'm at home makin' jams in many wonderful ways
I see in many wondrous shades
Peekin' out the shadows at a new landscape
I've been trapped in my mind, I've been tryna escape
Fame and loneliness, the recipe for disaster
I can't handle this shit, I'ma get plastered
I just wanna go fast, I'm a bastard
I won't stop 'til I'm where I wanna be in line
And there's so many things to do in the in-between time
That's to say I don't get lost and lose my fuckin' mind
Thinkin' 'bout the days I was broke fuck me up sometimes
How did I do it, why the kids love me so?
'Cause they connect with Cudder, real simple
Now let me set the groove with some cello
From the outside lookin' in, shit is mellow
But sometimes I wanted to shoot my fuckin' face off
I'm talkin' game over, defeated the boss
Hope with age, I can cope with my rage
I'm so damn passionate, there's no safe plane
To chill or dwell in, I'm always in the zone
Why did God let Hell in? To test a nigga?
Man, listen, I'm tryna find a way to tuck this nina in my skinnies
It's kinda tough, I don't see how they did it in the '80s
My angels ride for me at all cost
My dad is tellin' me, "Don't stress, go and floss"
"Live a little," I got you, pop
Love, Kiddo, my negro
Somebody better save them, God
'Cause young Scott Mescudi stayed on his job

[Chorus]
The leader of the delinquents, delinquents
The leader of the delinquents, delinquents
The leader of the delinquents, delinquents
The leader of the delinquents, delinquents (Yahm, haha, uh, aight)

[Verse 2]
Put the flow in the bag, kept it sealed on 'em
What I'm drivin'? Well it depends, so many things to ponder
Broke up with this girl, she was trippin'
Couldn't understand my life in the world, I can't be stressin' 'bout it
My SLS is pearl, bitch, please don't call it white
Been that nigga even back when I was trippin' off that white
A jealous motherfucker, that's the shit that I don't like
You got a girl? Better love her, man, you gotta cuff her tight
Because so many people love the nerd
You ask about Cudder and I bet you fuckin' heard
They call me legend and I'm feelin' twenty-six
You mad, you mad, you mad Cudder in this bitch
I'm an unstoppable fucker, from the land where my niggas be
Bumpin' "1st of tha Month" with my fam, jokin', rollin' tree
You see this walk, you know my face
All hail King Wizard in your motherfuckin' space, you love it

[Chorus]
The leader of the delinquents, delinquents
The leader of the delinquents, delinquents
The leader of the delinquents, delinquents
The leader of the delinquents, delinquents

Love suicide
You and I drove for miles
Knew I’d be here
Knew I'd be here
We took a dive in the blue, scared to lose
All my feelings
Knew I'd be here

[Chorus: Charli XCX]
I will always love you
I’ll love you forever
Even when we're not together
I will always love you
I'll love you forever
Said, "I'll love you forever"
I know in the future
We won't see each other
Cold just like December
But I will always love you
I'll love you forever
Yeah, I'll love you forever

[Post-Chorus: Charli XCX]
I love you, I love you, I love you
Said, "I'll love you forever, forever"
I’ll love you forever
I love you, I love you, I love you
Said, "I’ll love you forever, forever"
Cold just like December
But I will always love you
I'll love you forever
Yeah, I’ll love you forever

[Verse 2: Charli XCX]
You take your time, I'll take mine, we'll be fine
Knew I'd be here, be here, be here with you
When the roof caved in and the water fell through
Hope when we’re old, we'll be friends, reminisce
Hope we'll be there, be there, be there, us two
All the memories, all the photos we took, yeah

[Verse 3: ELIO]
Wish that you were at my door
The world looked like it was before now
We fight then we forget it all
'Cause I can't live my life without you
Never get to see you much
So I'm always missing your touch, yeah
Don't think I'm asking too much, just forever

[Chorus: Charli XCX]
I will always love you
I'll love you forever
Even when we're not together
I will always love you
I'll love you forever
Said, "I'll love you forever"
I know in the future
We won't see each other
Cold just like December
But I will always love you
I'll love you forever
Yeah, I'll love you forever

[Outro: Charli XCX]
Forever
I love you, I love you, I love you
Said, "I'll love you forever, forever"
Front of my mind, in the front of my mind
You stay right in front, in the front of my mind
I love you, I love you, I love you
Said, "I'll love you forever, forever"
Front of my mind, in the front of my mind
You stay right in front, in the front of my mind
Yeah, I'll love you forever

[Verse 1]
Uh, hit me when you good, you get mad
And you call me every name under the sun
Remember times when you always used to say I was the one
Nowadays all I ever hear you say is, "I'm done"
And I know that I could probably do some things better
But I ain't sign up for this when I met you
And I always come over whenever
You say you're fed up, but you let us
Get this far, you know you did, oh-oh
You can't get me out your head, no
You say time gon' let me know but
I need to know right at this moment, 'cause

[Chorus]
Yeah, I see it now

Never out in public 'cause they talk
Got a taste and got shell-shocked
Drive me to Hell in a drop-top

[Verse 1: The Kid LAROI]
Uh, drive me to Hell in a drop-top
I need you to save me 'fore I fuck up and go too far
I hate that you blame me for the things that I cannot control
I'm out here tryna make it work for us, it's too much
On my plate, got it all at stake
Say you hate me now, but you're at my place
Tell me lies, tell me that it's all okay
Tell me why you love me, even if it's fake

[Chorus: The Kid LAROI & Corbin]
It's not fair
No matter what, I'm still gon' be here
It's hard for me to show you I care
Crash and burn, Princess Diana
Better off, better off dead
You don't wanna come around here
It's hard for me to show you I care
Don't wanna be myself, I'm too scared
Yeah-yeah, I'm too scared

[Verse 2: Corbin]
Even if it isn't real, I wanna hear it (Oh, Oh)
Pour my heart out on the floor and now it's leaking (Oh, Oh)
Spent two-thousand on an F and N, don't make me squeeze it
I don't care if it was all pretend, I wanna feel it

[Verse 3: The Kid LAROI]
M.O.B. 'cause if I lose it all, you leavin'
Bitch, you don't love me, that's a lie, I don't believe it (Nah, nah)
Money make these bitches go insane, yeah, I done seen it (Oh, no)
I don't wanna hear it anymore if you don't mean it
(I don't want, I don't want) Don't wanna fall too deep
Trust issues, it's too hard to give you all of me
Love isn't what you see and what you want it to be
I want you, but I just can't give you all of me

[Chorus: The Kid LAROI & Corbin]
It's not fair
No matter what, I'm still gon' be here
It's hard for me to show you I care
Crash and burn, Princess Diana
Better off, better off dead
You don't wanna come around here
It's hard for me to show you I care
Don't wanna be myself, I'm too scared
Yeah-yeah, I'm too scared

[Chorus: The Kid LAROI]
Yeah, I can never break, never fold too
And I can never conversate like a ho do
Shit, I don't really know what they told you

Shawty think she special, but she old news
I just told her ass hit the road, like she 'posed to

I'm just getting money, fucking hoes like I'm 'posed to

[Verse 1: G Herbo]
Yeah, on the road (Uh)

Rockin' icy shit, that's rolls, in a Rolls (In a Rolls Royce)
Know how to make her touch her toes, and her soul (Yeah)
And I'm with my bros, everywhere I go (Uh-huh)
Quarter million ain't none, like three to five shows (For real)
I don't want no credit for this, I do what I'm 'posed to (I'm posed)
Can't go toe-to-toe to a nigga like me, I'll expose you (I'll expose)
What you know, I showed you, I was tryna mold you (Mold you)
Could've kept that shit all to myself, but yet I told you (I told you)
To my left and my right shoulder, all soldiers
VVS on my neck, baby, ain't none but boulders (Never, yeah)

[Chorus: The Kid Laroi, G Herbo, and Both]
Yeah, I can never break, never fold too
And I can never conversate like a ho do (Uh-huh)
Shit, I don't really know what they told you (Don't really know )
I'm just getting money, fucking hoes like I'm 'posed to
Shawty think she special, but she old news (Old news)
I just told her ass hit the road, like she 'posed to
I don't got the time, thought I motherfuckin' told you
I'm just getting money, fucking hoes like I'm 'posed to

[Verse 2: G Herbo]
Probably fucked more than a thousand hoes 'fore I slow down
I'ma take myself some funny stories when I'm older
I been thuggin' all my life, so my heart colder
Fuck around and hit a hundred shots when we roll down
Other than designer clothes, l'll never fold down (I ain't never)
Tryna deck the county jail, gave a hundred bros up (I ain't lyin')
Know some niggas down the road, 'til they cellmate older
But if you elevate your mind, they'll never hold you
Yo, LAROI, you my lil' bro, I'm gon' forever go for you (LAROI)
And you get some paper now, but there's a lot more for you (A lot more)
Niggas trippin' 'bout a slice, but won't get a loaf (Get the fucking loaf)
And if they ever in your way, you gotta clear the road (Uh)

[Chorus: The Kid LAROI]
Yeah, I can never break, never fold too
And I can never conversate like a ho do
Shit, I don't really know what they told you
I'm just getting money, fucking hoes like I'm 'posed to
Shawty think she special, but she old news
I just told her ass hit the road, like she 'posed to
I don't got the time, thought I motherfuckin' told you
I'm just getting money, fucking hoes like I'm 'posed to

[Intro: Mac Miller]
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Mac Miller & Unknown Woman]
She doin'
Nothin' with her life, she go out every night
It's alright, alright, alright, she just takin' her time
She don't have a plan, on nights, she'd rather dance
Here, there, can't be everywhere at the same time
Better make up your mind, baby
Better make up your mind, today, you're alive
Stop wastin' your time and maybe
You're crazy, but hey, so am I

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Yeah, well, she got a
Split personality, she wake up half asleep
Walk up to the mirror, ask herself if she gon' have something today
How easily she changed
She wear so many faces, but she wanna stay the same, yeah
And everybody think she playin' games
Yeah, that pretty smile hidin' all her pain

[Refrain: Mac Miller]
No one ever listen when she tryin' to explain
And it's probably the reason for how wild she became

[Pre-Chorus: Mac Miller]
Okay, now she just wanna be
Anywhere but here, anywhere but here
She believes people are free
Far away from here, far away from here

[Chorus: Mac Miller & Unknown Woman]
She doin'
Nothin' with her life, she go out every night
It's alright, alright, alright, she just takin' her time
She don't have a plan, on nights, she'd rather dance
Here, there, can't be everywhere at the same time
Better make up your mind, baby
Better make up your mind, today, you're alive
Stop wastin' your time and maybe
You're crazy, but hey, so am I

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
I remember when I met you, you intimidated me
I tried to get your number, you said, "Only in your dreams"
Okay, so I thought about you when I go to sleep
You never notice me, you was way out of my league
Until you broke your crown, girl, you used to be a queen
What happens now? Life after royalty

[Refrain: Mac Miller]
No one ever listen when she tryin' to explain
And it's probably the reason for how wild she became

[Pre-Chorus: Mac Miller]
Okay, now she just wanna be
Anywhere but here, anywhere but here
She believes people are free
Far away from here, far away from here

[Chorus: Mac Miller & Unknown Woman]
She doin'
Nothin' with her life, she go out every night
It's alright, alright, alright, she just takin' her time
She don't have a plan, on nights, she'd rather dance
Here, there, can't be everywhere at the same time
Better make up your mind, baby
Better make up your mind, today, you're alive
Stop wastin' your time and maybe
You're crazy, but hey, so am I

[Outro: Paige Montgomery]
Yeah, daddy
Oh yeah, right there
Oh my God!
Hello? (Hello, hello, hello)
Is there anybody in there?
Just nod if you can hear me
Is there anyone home?
Come on (Come on, come on), now
I hear you're feeling down
Well, I can ease your pain
And get you on your feet again
Relax (Relax, relax, relax)
I'll need some information first
Just the basic facts
Can you show me where it hurts?

There is no pain, you are receding
A distant ship, smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move, but I can't hear what you're saying
When I was a child, I had a fever
My hands felt just like two balloons
Now I've got that feeling once again
I can't explain, you would not understand
This is not how I am
I have become comfortably numb

[Guitar Solo 1]

I have become comfortably numb

Okay (Okay, okay, okay)
Just a little pinprick
There'll be no more
But you may feel a little sick
Can you stand up? (Stand up, stand up)
I do believe it's working, good
That'll keep you going through the show
Come on, it's time to go

There is no pain, you are receding
A distant ship, smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move, but I can't hear what you're saying
When I was a child, I caught a fleeting glimpse
Out of the corner of my eye
I turned to look, but it was gone
I cannot put my finger on it now
The child is grown, the dream is gone
I have become comfortably numb

[Guitar Solo 2]

Run, run, run, run
Run, run, run, run
Run, run, run, run
Run, run, run, run

[Verse 1: Roger Waters]
You better make your face up with your favourite disguise
With your button down lips and your roller blind eyes
With your empty smile and your hungry heart
Feel the bile rising from your guilty past
With your nerves in tatters as the cockleshell shatters
And the hammers batter down your door
You better run!

[Instrumental Pre-Chorus/Guitar Riff]

[Chorus: David Gilmour & Roger Waters]
Run, run, run, run
Run, run, run, run
Run, run, run, run
Run, run, run, run

[Verse 2: Roger Waters]
You better run all day and run all night
And keep your dirty feelings deep inside
And if you're taking your girlfriend out tonight
You better park the car well out of sight
'Cause if they catch you in the back seat trying to pick her locks
They're gonna send you back to Mother in a cardboard box
You better run!

[Synth Solo]

[Instrumental Outro]

[Verse 1]
Time's getting old like a shadow
In a house with no name or a key
I threw a stone at the window
To knock on the door where she sleeps

[Verse 2]
She said...
"Wait by the door I will come there
Patience is hard to teach"
I lit a match in the summer
By winter it burned at my feet

[Pre-Chorus]
Day comes as it goes

[Chorus]
Waiting for the end
Like she was a friend
I've been born again
I've been born again

[Verse 3]
I'm getting old like a shadow
In a house I made my keep
A stone smashes through my window
Patience is hard to teach

[Chorus]
Waiting for the end
Like she was a friend
I've been born again
I've been born again

[Chorus]
Waiting for the end
Like she was a friend
I've been born again
I've been born again

[Verse 1]
We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes, and the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, "hello"
Little did I know

[Pre-Chorus 1]
That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, "stay away from Juliet"
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, "please don't go," and I said

[Chorus 1]
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story baby just say "yes"

[Verse 2]
So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet, 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while

[Pre-Chorus 2]
'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet"
But you were everything to me
I was begging you please don't go and I said

[Chorus 2]
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story baby just say "yes"
Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story baby just say "yes"
Oh, oh

[Bridge]
I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town, and I said
Romeo save me I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring

[Chorus 3]
And said: "Marry me Juliet
You'll never have to be alone
I love you and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story baby just say 'yes'"

[Outro]
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
'Cause we were both young when I first saw you

[Intro]
Dougie on the beat

[Verse]
Yeah, nigga, you can't kill your way to the Clearport
And real nigga credit don't work at the bank
Ain't 'bout no money, what the fuck is you here for?
'Cause bad bitches only respect Benny Frank, uh
I never seen

[Verse 1]
The time may come where I won't be there
A voice that you remember, but not from where
Maybe then when you put down roots
Then all this aggravation won't feel so huge

[Chorus]
Come on and walk with me, we can make it
Talk with me and let me answer your heart
Life could be the greatest
You and me, can we open our hearts?

[Verse 2]
And all I ask of you when I saw you there
A simple conversation between two friends
Nothing that I said was true
A concrete fascination for me and you

[Chorus]
Come on and walk with me, we can make it
Talk with me and let me answer your heart
Life could be the greatest
You and me, can we open our hearts?

[Post Chorus]
I've got far to go
And the road is looking dark
And I've got only dreams
And a broken heart

[Chorus]
Walk with me, we can make it
Talk with me and let me answer your heart
Life could be the greatest
You and me, can we open our hearts?

[Post Chorus]
I've got far to go
And the road is looking dark
And I've got only dreams
And a broken heart

[Outro]
Bottom line, no matter what, face everything and rise

[Verse 1]
Girl, our mamas are best friends and so are we
The whole town's rooting for us like the home team
Most likely to settle down
Plant a few roots real deep and let 'em grow
But we can't stop this real world from spinnin' us
Your bright lights called, I don't blame you for pickin' up
Your big dream bags are all packed up and ready to go
But I just need you to know

[Chorus]
That I love you more than a California sunset
More than a beer when you ain't twenty-one yet
More than a Sunday morning Lord
Turnin' some poor lost souls 'round, and Hallelujah bound
Yeah, I love you more than the feeling when the bass hits the hook
When the guy gets the girl at the end of the book
But, baby, this might be the last time I get to lay you down
'Cause I can't love you more than my hometown

[Verse 2]
I ain't the runaway kind, I can't change that
My heart's stuck in these streets like the train tracks
City sky ain't the same black
Ain't that a map dot shame, man, to think that

[Chorus]
I love you more than a California sunset
More than a beer when you ain't twenty-one yet
More than a Sunday morning Lord
Turnin' some poor lost souls around, and Hallelujah bound
Yeah, I love you more than the feeling when the bass hits the hook
When the guy gets the girl at the end of the book
But, baby, this might be the last time I get to lay you down
'Cause I can't love you more than my hometown

[Bridge]
Yeah, you got a wild in your eyes that I just wasn't born with
I'm a same gas station cup of coffee in the mornin'
I need a house on the hill, girl, not in 'em
So hang onto these words 'til them avenues help you forget 'em

[Chorus]
'Cause I love you more than a California sunset
I love you more in a twenty-dollar sundress
Hate that loaded down car you got your keys in
Girl, but I hate even more that you're leavin'
'Cause I love you more than the feeling when the bass hits the hook
When the guy gets the girl at the end of the book
But that ain't you and me so I guess I'll see you around
'Cause I can't love you more than my hometown

[Outro]
Love you more than my hometown
Love you more than my hometown
Love you more, baby, love you more

I hear the cry of an angel

We got London On Da Track

[Verse 1]
Uh, I got London on the Track, baby
He might go jail for serving this crack, baby
Rich the Kid, we in the trap, baby
But he might be lucky 'cause he’ll serve all of these rappers, baby (Ah)
I'm sitting up high, I'm in the nose bleed (Ayy)

Momma, I'm not gon' let these niggas murk me
I'll be damned if these Bloods let him hurt me
I think I see some blood, my baby hurt me

Why, why would you do this to me?
It hurts if it don't seems
I'ma, I'ma block it out just by counting these knots
I'm just kidding, I think not
I'ma hold this weight down, even though it's a lot
And I'ma take off on your nigga, no astronaut
And I'm the motherfucking man, I'm not no boy
And I got a playroom if you wanna see some toys
And I got extendo, look like I got two rods
And I got a 6 Plus, look like an iPod

[Bridge]
My kids go by uh, Jacob, Kyvion, Haiti, Hayden, Amir, Maury
And I swear to God I ain't sorry, bitch
I got a maid that'll watch 'em in the dark
And I got some sisters that'll watch 'em like a guardian
Plus I got some elders that'll watch 'em like a guard
It don't matter if I leave, I know my bro gon' do my part

[Verse 2]
Hey, hey, bitch come stumbling in my car
I'll just terminate him, then I'll leave him with a scar
I can't be no hater, bitches gambling when in Vegas
I'd be bustin' tomatoes if I was ever gated
Bitch, I know the business, I been nominated lately
I bust in her face, so yeah, she know that's not my baby
Hey, I'ma cook them cakes no Easy Baker
We got something to get so we need that tow truck stable
Hey, bitches see these floors and get hot
Yes, I'm living it up, my bed in the sky
Yes, I heard you're the king of the rock
But when I hit it like a hit stick I make it shock, yeah
Flip flop paint going down the street
Minks all on my floor, now that bitch look just like a sheep
Help me find love, help me find love, Stevie, I can't see
I'm a snake, you know my tail stinging, plus I'm a Bee
I might turn you up if you get right, no Mama Dee
Yeah, no Mama Dee, but
I'm spitting so hard I might just lose my teeth (Woah)
Tree top, trill lil leaf (Hah)
Baby bought the Gerby
Feed her lobster, Kirby
I don't trust you, no worry
Oops, I meant worthy
I know it's kinda hard to get the
Words I'm saying, I'm steady praying, amen
Please forgive me for my sins, please twin
I don't wanna be departed from you, you me and
You know I'm you
Hundred miles an hour, you control the coupe
Thank you for giving me these golds, no flute
Please make 'em understand that I ain't no fruit
Please make 'em understand I only fuck coochie
Please forgive me for my sins
Please, please, please forgive me
All I wanna do is win
I don't write so I don't want the pen
I promise I'm in love with my kids
I'm thankful for everything I get
Lord knows that I take care of my kin
I promise I hope it never ends

[Outro: Sample]
I hear the cry of an angel
I hear the scream of a man

[Verse 1]
Fingertip sun at sideshow stalls
They throw the balls
At coconut fur that hides behind
Colored shades that blind your eyes
Every child's mother holds an ice-cream cone
They circle round
Perceived unknown by an eye that peers
From a hole in the tent where no one goes
A figure sitting cross-legged on the floor
He's clogged and clothed in saffron robes
His beads are all he owns

[Chorus]
Slow down
Slow down
Someone must have said "let's slow him down"
Slow down
Slow down
It's pictured on the arms of the karma man

[Verse 2]
Fairy tale skin
Depicting scenes from human zoos
Impermanent toys like peace and war
A gentle face you've seen before

Karma man tattooed on your side
The wheel of life
I see my times and who I've been
I only live now and I don't know why
I struggle hard to take these pictures in
But
All my friends can see is just the pinkness of his skin

[Chorus]
Slow down
Slow down
Someone must have said "let's slow him down"
Slow down
Slow down
It's pictured on the arms of the karma man

Slow down
Slow down
Someone must have said "let's slow him down"
Slow down
Slow down
It's pictured on the arms of the karma man
London bye ta-ta
Strange young town
London bye ta-ta
Brought me down
Don't like your new face
That’s not nice
Got to go far, far
London bye ta-ta

Gigi, Gigi, Gigi, Gigi
Take me away
Gigi, Gigi, Gigi, Gigi
Take me today
The boys in the clothes shop
Sold me curry for a pound
His cardboard face is soggy
And his sellings thorny crown

I loved her!
I loved her!
I've got to get away
But I loved her!
Oh-oh-oh
London bye ta-ta
Strange young town
London bye ta-ta
Brought me down
Don't like your new face
That’s not nice
Got to go far, far
London bye ta-ta

Red light, green light
Make up your mind
Red light, green light
You're far too un-kind
She loves to love all beauty
And she says the norm is funny
But she whimpers in the morning
When she finds she has no money

I loved her!
I loved her!
I've got to get away now
But I loved her!
Ahhh!

Oh-oh-oh
London bye ta-ta
Strange young town
London bye ta-ta
Brought me down
Don't like your new face
That's not nice
Got to go far, far
London bye ta-ta
Ahh
Oh-oh-oh
London bye ta-ta
Strange young town
London bye ta-ta
Brought me down
Don't like your new face
That's not nice
Got to go far, far
London bye ta-ta
Oh, London bye ta-ta
Oh, London bye ta-ta
Oh, eh

[Verse]
Mountains of Lhasa are feeling the rain
People are walking the Botella lanes
Preacher takes the school
One boy breaks a rule
Silly boy blue, blue, silly boy blue

Yak butter statues that melt in the sun
Cannot dissolve all the work you've not done
A chela likes to feel
That his overself pays the bill
Silly boy blue, blue, silly boy blue

You wish and wish, and wish again
You've tried so hard to fly
You'll never leave your body now
You've got to wait to die

La la la la la la la la la la 

[x2]
La la la la la 

[x2]
Silly boy blue, blue, silly boy blue
Child of the Tibet, you're a gift from the sun
Reincarnation of one better man
The homeward road is long
You've left your prayers and song
Silly boy blue, blue, silly boy blue

In the port of Amsterdam, there's a sailor who sings
Of the dreams that he brings from the wide open sea
In the port of Amsterdam, there's a sailor who sleeps
While the river bank weeps to the old willow tree

In the port of Amsterdam, there's a sailor who dies
Full of beer, full of cries in a drunken town fight
In the port of Amsterdam, there's a sailor who's born
On a hot muggy morn by the dawn's early light

In the port of Amsterdam, where the sailors all meet
There's a sailor who eats only fish heads and tails
And he'll show you his teeth that have rotted too soon
That can haul up the sails, that can swallow the moon

And he yells to the cook with his arms open wide
"Hey! Bring me more fish, throw it down by my side"
And he wants so to belch but he's too full to try
So he stands up and laughs and he zips up his fly

In the port of Amsterdam, you can see sailors dance
Paunches bursting their pants, grinding women to porch
They've forgotten the tune that their whiskey voice croaked
Splitting the night with the roar of their jokes
And they turn and they dance and they laugh and they lust
Till the rancid sound of the accordion bursts
And then out of the night with their pride in their pants
And the sluts that they tow underneath the street lamps
In the port of Amsterdam, there's a sailor who drinks
And he drinks and he drinks and he drinks once again
He'll drink to the health of the whores of Amsterdam
Who've given their bodies to a thousand other men
Yeah, they've bargained their virtue, their goodness all gone
For a few dirty coins, well, he just can't go on
Throws his nose to the sky and he aims it up above
And he pisses like I cry on the unfaithful love
In the port of Amsterdam
In the port of Amsterdam

[Intro]
I was walking through the counters of a national concern
And a cash machine was spitting by my shoulder

[Verse 1]
And I saw the multitude of faces, honest, rich and clean
As the merchandise exchanged and money roared
And a woman hot with worry slyly slipped a tin of stewing steak
Into the paper bag at her side
And her face was white with fear in case her actions were observed
So she closed her eyes to keep her conscience blind

[Chorus]
Crying
God knows I'm good
God knows I'm good
God knows I'm good
God may look the other way today
God knows I'm good
God knows I'm good
God knows I'm good
God may look the other way today

[Verse 2]
Then she moved toward the exit clutching tightly at her paper bag
Perspiration trickled down her forehead
And her heart it leapt inside her as the hand laid on her shoulder
She was led away bewildered and amazed
Through her deafened ears the cash machines were shrieking on the counter
As her escort asked her softly
For her name
And a crowd of honest people rushed to help a tired old lady
Who had fainted to the whirling
Wooden floor

[Chorus]
Crying
God knows I'm good
God knows I'm good
God knows I'm good
Surely God won't look the other way
God knows I'm good
God knows I'm good
God knows I'm good
Surely God won't look the other way

[Verse 1]
In the corner of the morning in the past
I would sit and blame the master first and last
All the roads were straight and narrow
And the prayers were small and yellow
And the rumour spread that I was aging fast
Then I ran across a monster who was sleeping by a tree
And I looked and frowned and the monster was me

[Verse 2]
Well, I said hello and I said hello
And I asked "Why not?" and I replied "I don't know"
So we asked a simple black bird, who was happy as can be
And he laughed insane and quipped Khalil Gibran
And I cried for all the others untill the day was nearly through
For I realized that God's a young man too

[Verse 3]
So I said "So long" and I waved bye-bye
And I smashed my soul and traded my mind
Got laid by a young bordello
Who was vaguely half asleep
For which my reputation swept back home in drag
And the moral of this magic spell
Negotiates my hide
When God did take my logic for a ride
(Riding along)

[Instrumental]

[Verse 4]
He swallowed his pride and puckered his lips
And showed me the leather belt round his hips
My knees were shaking, my cheeks aflame
He said, you'll never go down to the Gods again
(Turn around, go back!)
He struck the ground, a cavern appeared
And I smelt the burning pit of fear
We crashed a thousand yards below
I said, do it again, do it again
(Turn around, go back!)
His nebulous body swayed above
His tongue swollen with devil's love
The snake and I, a venom high
I said, do it again, do it again
(Turn around, go back!)
Breathe, breathe, breathe deeply
And I was seething, breathing deeply
Spitting sentry, horned and tailed
Waiting for you

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Spy, spy, pretty girl
I see you see me through your window
Don't turn your nose up
Well, you can if you need to
You won't be the first or last

[Verse 2]
It must strain you to look down
So far from your father's house
And I know what a louse like me
In his house could do for you

[Verse 3]
I'm the cream
Of the great Utopia dream
And you're the gleam
In the depths of your banker's spleen

[Verse 4]
I'm a Phallus in pigtails
And there's blood on my nose
And my tissue is rotting
Where the rats chew my bones
And my eye socket's empty
See nothing but pain
I keep havin' this brainstorm
About twelve times a day

[Chorus]
So now, you could spend the morning walking with me
Quite amazed
As I am unwashed and somewhat slightly dazed

[Verse 5]
I've got eyes in my backside
That see electric tomatoes
On credit card rye bread
There are children in washrooms
Holding hands with a Queen
And my heads full of murders
Where only killers scream

[Chorus]
So now you could spend your morning talking with me
Quite amazed
Look out, I'm raving mad and somewhat slightly dazed

[Verse 6]
Now you run from your window
To the porcelain bowl
And you're sick from your ears
To the red parquet floor
And the Braque on the wall
Slides down your front
And eats through your belly
It's very catching

[Chorus]
So now, you should spend the morning, lying to your father
Quite amazed
About the strange unwashed and happily slightly dazed
I'm not following

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah, baby, yeah
Yeah, yeah, baby, yeah
Yeah, yeah, baby, yeah
Yeah
Don't sit down
Don't sit down
Don't sit down

[Chorus 1]
I bless you madly
Sadly as I tie my shoes
I love you badly
Just in time, at times, I guess
Because of you I need to rest
Because it's you
That sets the test

[Verse 1]
So much has gone
And little is new
And as the sparrow sings
Dawn chorus for
Someone else to hear
The Thinker sits alone growing older
And so bitter
"I gave Them life
I gave Them all
They drained my very soul
...dry
I crushed my heart
To ease Their pains
No thought for me remains there
Nothing can They spare
What of me?
Who praised Their efforts
To be free?
Words of strength and care
And sympathy
I opened doors
That would have blocked Their way
I braved Their cause to guide
For little pay
I ravaged at my finance just for Those
Those whose claims were steeped in peace, tranquility
Those who said a new world, new ways ever free
Those whose promises stretched in hope and grace for me

[Chorus 1]
I bless you madly
Sadly as I tie my shoes
I love you badly
Just in time, at times, I guess
Because of you I need to rest
Because it's you
That sets the test

[Verse 2]
So much has gone
And little is new
And as the sunrise stream
Flickers on me
My friends talk
Of glory, untold dream, where all is God and God is just a word
"We had a friend, a talking man
Who spoke of many powers that he had
Not of the best of men, but Ours
We used him
We let him use his powers
We let him fill Our needs
Now We are strong
And the road is coming to its end
Now the damned have no time to make amends
No purse of token fortune stands in Our way
The silent guns of love
Will blast the sky
We broke the ruptured structure built of age
Our weapons were the tongues of crying rage
Where money stood
We planted seeds of rebirth
And stabbed the backs of fathers
Sons of dirt
Infiltrated business cesspools
Hating through Our sleeves
Yea, and We slit the Catholic throat
Stoned the poor
On slogans such as
"Wish You Could Hear
Love Is All We Need
Kick Out The Jams
Kick Out Your Mother
Cut Up Your Friend
Screw Up Your Brother or He'll Get You In the End
And We Know the Flag of Love is from Above
And We Can Force You to Be Free
And We Can Force You to Believe"
And I close my eyes and tighten up my brain
For I once read a book in which the lovers were slain
For they knew not the words of the Free States' refrain
It said:
"I believe in the Power of Good
I Believe in the State of Love
I Will Fight For the Right to be Right
I Will Kill for the Good of the Fight for the Right to be Right"
And I open my eyes to look around
And I see a child laid slain
On the ground
As a love machine lumbers through desolation rows
Ploughing down man, woman, listening to its command
But not hearing anymore
Not hearing anymore
Just the shrieks from the old rich
And I Want to Believe
In the madness that calls 'Now'
And I want to Believe
That a light's shining through
Somehow

[Bridge]
And I Want to Believe
And You Want to Believe
And We Want to Believe
And We Want to Live
Oh, We Want to Live
We Want to Live
We Want to Live
We Want to Live
We Want to Live
I Want to Live
I Want to Live
I Want to Live
I Want to Live
I Want to Live
I Want to Live

[Outro]
Live
Live
Live

[Intro]
"Maybe I should announce it, should I?
Memory of a free festival."

[Verse 1]
The Children of the summer's end
Gathered in the dampened grass
We played Our songs and felt the London sky
Resting on our hands
It was God's land
It was ragged and naive
It was Heaven

[Verse 2]
Touch, We touched the very soul
Of holding each and every life
We claimed the very source of joy ran through
It didn't, but it seemed that way
I kissed a lot of people that day

[Verse 3]
Oh, to capture just one drop of all the ecstasy that swept that afternoon
To paint that love upon a white balloon
And fly it from the topest top of all the tops
That man has pushed beyond his brain
Satori must be something just the same

[Verse 4]
We scanned the skies with rainbow eyes
And saw machines of every shape and size
We talked with tall Venusians passing through
And Peter tried to climb aboard but the Captain shook his head
And away they soared
Climbing through the ivory vibrant cloud
Someone passed some bliss among the crowd
And We walked back to the road, unchained

[Outro]
The Sun Machine is coming down, and we're gonna have a party
The Sun Machine is coming down, and we're gonna have a party
The Sun Machine is coming down, and we're gonna have a party
The Sun Machine is coming down, and we're gonna have a party
The Sun Machine is coming down, and we're gonna have a party
The Sun Machine is coming down, and we're gonna have a party

[Verse 1]
When you climb to the top of the mountain
Look out over the sea
Think about the places perhaps, where a young man could be
Then you jump back down to the rooftops
Look out over the town
Think about all of the strange things circulating round

[Chorus]
It ain't easy, it ain't easy
It ain't easy to get to heaven when you're going down

[Verse 2]
Well, all the people have got their problems
That ain't nothing new
With the help of the good Lord
We can all pull on through
We can all pull on through
Get there in the end
Sometimes it'll take you right up and sometimes down again

[Chorus]
It ain't easy, it ain't easy
It ain't easy to get to heaven when you're going down

[Verse 3]
Satisfaction, satisfaction
Keep me satisfied
I've got the love of a Hoochie Koochie woman
She calling from inside
She's a-calling from inside
Trying to get to you
All the woman really wants
You can give her something too

[Chorus]
It ain't easy, it ain't easy
It ain't easy to get to heaven when you're going down
It ain't easy, it ain't easy
It ain't easy to get to heaven when you're going down
All clear wail the sirens
Sunshine on the wasteland
Old man sitting in the white sand
Think we're in for a big surprise
Right between the eyes

Seemed a good idea
To drop a bomb on the wasteland here
Only one man could be seen
And he was old and so serene
Captain sat in his deck chair
And the red light flashed, beware
Pilot felt quite big-time
As the bomb sailed through the air
Well, they danced and sang
When the bang went bang
When the lights popped out
And the smoke began to clear
It was positively queer

All clear wail the sirens
Sunshine on the wasteland
Old man sitting in the white sand
Think we're in for a big surprise
Right between the eyes
"Die" said the General
"Cobblers" said the man
So the Pentagon sent a cable
And the Queen a telegram
A-bombs, H-bombs, even very small ones
Ripped apart that sand
'Til the stench was just revolting
And the sky a greenish tan
But the soldier said "Sir
There's a crack in the world"
And the figures went "squash"
And the bits flew far and wide
How the universe sighed!

All clear wail the sirens
Sunshine on the wasteland
Old man sitting in the white sand
Think we're in for a big surprise
Right between the eyes

All clear wail the sirens
Sunshine on the wasteland
Old man sitting in the white sand
Think we're in for a big surprise
Right between the eyes
When the smoke had blown away
There was nothing left to view
Except a man dear Lord who looked like you
Floating high up in the sky

[Chorus]
Will you stay in our lovers' story?
If you stay you won’t be sorry
'Cause we believe in you
Soon you'll grow, so take a chance
With a couple of kooks hung up on romancing

Will you stay in our lovers’ story?
If you stay you won't be sorry
'Cause we believe in you
Soon you'll grow, so take a chance
With a couple of kooks hung up on romancing

[Verse 1]
We bought a lot of things to keep you warm and dry
And a funny old crib on which the paint won't dry
I bought you a pair of shoes
A trumpet you can blow and a book of rules
On what to say to people when they pick on you
'Cause if you stay with us you're going to be pretty kooky too

[Chorus]
Will you stay in our lovers' story?
If you stay you won’t be sorry
’Cause we believe in you
Soon you'll grow, so take a chance
With a couple of kooks hung up on romancing

[Verse 2]
And if you ever have to go to school
Remember how they messed up this old fool
Don’t pick fights with the bullies or the cads
'Cause I'm not much cop at punching other people's Dads
And if the homework brings you down
Then we’ll throw it on the fire and take the car downtown

[Chorus]
Will you stay in our lovers' story?
If you stay you won't be sorry
'Cause we believe in you
Soon you'll grow, so take a chance
With a couple of kooks hung up on romancing

[Outro]
Will you stay in our lovers' story?
If you stay you won't be sorry
'Cause we believe in you
Soon you'll grow, so take a chance
With a couple of kooks hung up on romancing

[Verse 1]
When all the world was very young
And mountain magic heavy hung
The supermen would walk in file
Guardians of a loveless isle
And gloomy browed with superfear
Their tragic endless lives could heave nor sigh
In solemn, perverse serenity
Wondrous beings chained to life

[Chorus 1]
Strange games they would play then
No death for the perfect men
Life rolls into one for them
So softly a supergod cries

[Verse 2]
Where all were minds in uni-thought
Powers weird by mystics taught
No pain, no joy, no power too great
Colossal strength to grasp a fate
Where sad-eyed mermen tossed in slumbers
Nightmare dreams no mortal mind could hold
A man would tear his brother's flesh
A chance to die, to turn to mold

[Chorus 2]
Far out in the red-sky
Far out from the sad eyes
Strange, mad celebration
So softly a supergod cries
Far out in the red-sky
Far out from the sad eyes
Strange, mad celebration
So softly a supergod dies
The tactful cactus by your window
Surveys the prairie of your room
The mobile spins to its collision
Clara puts her head between her paws
They've opened shops down West side
Will all the cacti find a home
But the key to the city
Is in the sun that pins the branches to the sky

[Verse 1]
Well, she's a tongue twisting storm
She'll come to the show tonight
Praying to the light machine
She wants my honey not my money
She's a funky-thigh collector
Laying on electric dreams

[Chorus]
Well, come on, come on
We've really got a good thing going
Well, come on, well, come on
If you think we're gonna make it you better hang on to yourself

[Verse 2]
We can't dance, we don't talk much, we just ball and play
But then we move like tigers on Vaseline
Well, the bitter comes out better on a stolen guitar
You're the Blessed, we're The Spiders From Mars

[Chorus]
Well, come on, come on
We've really got a good thing going
Well, come on, well come on
If you think we're gonna make it you better hang on to yourself

[Bridge]
Come on
Lay it on

[Chorus]
Come on, come on
We've really got a good thing going
Well, come on, well, come on
If you think we're gonna make it you better hang on to yourself

[Chorus]
Well, come on, come on
We've really got a good thing going
Well, come on, well, come on
If you think we're gonna make it you better hang on to yourself

[Outro]
Come on, ah, come on, ah, come on, ah, come on, ah
Come on, ah, come on, ah, come on, ah, come on, ah
Come on, ah, come on, ah, come on, ah, come on, ah
Come on, ah, come on, ah, come on, ah, come on, ah

[Intro]
Oh yeah

[Verse 1]
Now Ziggy played guitar
Jamming good with Weird and Gilly
And The Spiders from Mars
He played it left hand
But made it too far
Became the special man
Then we were Ziggy's Band

[Verse 2]
Ziggy really sang
Screwed up eyes and screwed down hairdo
Like some cat from Japan
He could lick ’em by smiling
He could leave 'em to hang
He came on so loaded, man
Well hung, snow white tan

[Chorus 1]
So where were the spiders
While the fly tried to break our balls?
Just the beer light to guide us
So we bitched about his fans
And should we crush his sweet hands?
Oh yeah

[Verse 3]
Ziggy played for time
Jiving us that we were Voodoo
The kids was just crass
He was the naz
With God-given ass
He took it all too far
But boy, could he play guitar

[Chorus 2]
Making love with his ego
Ziggy sucked up into his mind (ah)
Like a leper messiah
When the kids had killed a man
I had to break up the band

[Bridge]
Oh yeah
Ooh

[Outro]
Ziggy played guitar

[Verse 1]
I'm up on the eleventh floor
And I'm watching the cruisers below
He's down on the street
And he's trying hard to pull sister Flo
Oh, my heart's in the basement
My weekend's at an all time low
'Cause she's hoping to score
So I can't see her letting him go
Walk out of her heart, walk out of her mind
Oh, not her

[Chorus]
She's so swishy in her satin and tat
In her frock coat and bipperty-bopperty hat
Oh God, I could do better than that

[Verse 2]
She's an old-time ambassador
Of sweet talking, night walking games
And she's known in the darkest clubs
For pushing ahead of the dames
If she says she can do it then she can do it
She don't make false claims
But she's a Queen and such are queens
That your laughter is sucked in their brains
Now she's leading him on
And she'll lay him right down
Yes, she's leading him on
And she'll lay him right down

[Refrain]
But it could have been me
Yes, it could have been me
Why didn't I say
Why didn't I say, no, no, no

[Chorus]
She's so swishy in her satin and tat
In her frock coat and bipperty-bopperty hat
Oh God, I could do better than that

[Verse 3]
So I lay down a while
And I gaze at my hotel wall
Oh, the cot is so cold
It don't feel like no bed at all
Yeah, I lay down a while
And I look at my hotel wall
And he's down on the street
So I throw both his bags down the hall
And I'm phoning a cab
'Cause my stomach feels small
There's a taste in my mouth
And it's no taste at all

[Refrain]
It could have been me
Oh yeah, it could have been me
Why didn't I say
Why didn't I say, no, no, no

[Chorus]
She's so swishy in her satin and tat
In her frock coat and bipperty-bopperty hat
Oh God, I could do better than that

[Outro]
Ooh, you bet ya!
Oh yeah
Uh-huh
Mmm
I'm waiting for the man
Twenty-six dollars in my hand
Up to Lexington 1-2-5
So sick and dirty, more dead than alive
I'm waiting for the man

Hey white boy, what you doin' in town
Hey white boy, chasin' all the women around
Oh pardon me, sir, it's the last thing on my mind
I'm just looking for a good friend of mine
I'm waiting for the man

Here he comes, he's all dressed in black
Real shoes and a big straw hat
He's never early, he's always late
First thing you learn is that you always gotta wait
I'm waiting for the man

Big dirty building, up three flights of stairs
Nobody stops you 'cause nobody cares
He's got the works, gives you sweet taste
Then you gotta split because he's got no time to waste
I'm waiting for the man
Baby, don't you holler, darlin', don't you bawl and shout
I'm feeling good, I'm gonna work it on out
I'm feeling good, I'm feeling so fine
Until tomorrow but that's just another time
I'm waiting for the man

I'm waiting for the man
Twenty-six dollars in my hand
Up to Lexington 1-2-5
So sick and dirty, more dead than alive
I'm waiting for the man
Waiting for the man

To welcome me home

[Verse 1]
Pushing through the market square
So many mothers sighing
News had just come over
We had five years left to cry in (cry in)
News guy wept and told us
Earth was really dying (dying)
Cried so much his face was wet
Then I knew he was not lying (lying)
I heard telephones, opera house, favourite melodies
I saw boys, toys, electric irons and TVs
My brain hurt like a warehouse, it had no room to spare
I had to cram so many things to store everything in there
And all the fat, skinny people
And all the tall, short people
And all the nobody people
And all the somebody people
I never thought I'd need so many people

[Verse 2]
A girl my age went off her head
Hit some tiny children
If the Black hadn't have pulled her off
I think she would have killed them
A soldier with a broken arm
Fixed his stare to the wheels of a Cadillac
A cop knelt and kissed the feet of a priest
And a queer threw up at the sight of that
I think I saw you in an ice-cream parlour
Drinking milkshakes cold and long
Smiling and waving and looking so fine
Don't think you knew you were in this song
And it was cold and it rained, so I felt like an actor
And I thought of Ma and I wanted to get back there
Your face, your race
The way that you talk
I kiss you, you're beautiful
I want you to walk

[Outro]
We've got five years, stuck on my eyes
Five years, what a surprise
We've got five years, my brain hurts a lot
Five years, that's all we've got
We've got five years, what a surprise
Five years, stuck on my eyes
We've got five years, my brain hurts a lot
Five years, that's all we've got
We've got five years, stuck on my eyes
Five years, what a surprise
We've got five years, my brain hurts a lot
Five years, that's all we've got
We've got five years, what a surprise
We've got five years, stuck on my eyes
We've got five years, my brain hurts a lot
Five years, that's all we've got
Five years
Five years
Five years
Five years

[Verse 1]
I'm an alligator
I'm a mama-papa coming for you
I'm a space invader
I'll be a rock 'n' rollin' bitch for you
Keep your mouth shut
You're squawking like a pink monkey bird
And I'm busting up my brains for the words

[Chorus]
(U-u-u-u-u-u) Keep your 'lectric eye on me babe
(U-u-u-u-u-u) Put your ray gun to my head
(U-u-u-u-u-u) Press your space face close to mine, love
Freak out in a moonage daydream, oh yeah

[Verse 2]
Don't fake it, baby
Lay the real thing on me
The church of man, love
Is such a holy place to be
Make me, baby
Make me know you really care
Make me jump into the air

[Chorus]
(U-u-u-u-u-u) Keep your 'lectric eye on me babe
(U-u-u-u-u-u) Put your ray gun to my head
(U-u-u-u-u-u) Press your space face close to mine, love
Freak out in a moonage daydream, oh yeah

[Chorus]
Keep your 'lectric eye on me babe
Put your ray gun to my head
Press your space face close to mine, love
Freak out in a moonage daydream, oh-
Keep your 'lectric eye on me, babe
(Keep your 'lectric eye on me, babe)
('Lectric eye on me babe)
Put your ray gun to my head
(Put your ray gun to my head)
(Ray gun to my head)
Press your space face close to mine, love
(Press your space face close to mine, love)
(Press your space face close to mine, love)
Freak out in a moonage daydream, oh yeah
(Freak out in a moonage daydream, oh yeah)
(Freak out in a moonage daydream
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah...)

[Outro]
Freak out (Freak out, freak out, freak out, freak out...)
Far out (Far out, far out, far out, far out...)
In out (In out, in out, in out, in out...)

[Verse 1]
Well, she's a tongue twisting storm
She'll come to the show tonight
Praying to the light machine
She wants my honey not my money
She's a funky-thigh collector
Laying on electric dreams

[Chorus]
Well, come on, come on
We've really got a good thing going
Well, come on, well, come on
If you think we're gonna make it you better hang on to yourself

[Verse 2]
We can't dance, we don't talk much, we just ball and play
But then we move like tigers on Vaseline
Well, the bitter comes out better on a stolen guitar

Well, come on, come on

Well, come on, well come on

Come on
Lay it on

Come on, come on
We've really got a good thing going
Well, come on, well, come on
If you think we're gonna make it you better hang on to yourself

[Chorus]
Well, come on, come on
We've really got a good thing going
Well, come on, well, come on
If you think we're gonna make it you better hang on to yourself

Come on, ah, come on, ah, come on, ah, come on, ah
Come on, ah, come on, ah, come on, ah, come on, ah
Come on, ah, come on, ah, come on, ah, come on, ah

[Verse 1]
(Hey man) oh leave me alone you know
(Hey man) oh Henry, get off the phone, I gotta
(Hey man) I gotta straighten my face
This mellow thighed chick just put my spine out of place
(Hey man) my schooldays insane
(Hey man) my work's down the drain
(Hey man) well, she's a total blam-blam
She said she had to squeeze it but she, and then she

[Chorus]
Oh, don't lean on me, man, 'cause you can't afford the ticket
Back from Suffragette City
Oh, don't lean on me, man, 'cause you ain't got time to check it
You know my Suffragette City
Is outta sight
She's all right

[Verse 2]
(Hey, man) oh, Henry, don't be unkind, go away
(Hey, man) I can't take you this time, no way
(Hey, man) droogie, don't crash here
There's only room for one and here she comes, here she comes

[Chorus]
Oh, don't lean on me, man, 'cause you can't afford the ticket
Back from Suffragette City
Oh, don't lean on me, man, 'cause you ain't got time to check it
You know my Suffragette City
Is outta sight
She's all right
Oh, hit me

[Chorus]
Oh, don't lean on me, man, 'cause you can't afford the ticket
Back from Suffragette City
Oh, don't lean on me, man, 'cause you ain't got time to check it
You know my Suffragette City
Don't lean on me, man, 'cause you can't afford the ticket
Back from Suffragette City
And don't lean on me, man, 'cause you ain't got time to check it
You know my Suffragette City
Is outta sight
Whoa, she's all right

[Outro]
A Suffragette City
A Suffragette City
I'm back on Suffragette City
I'm back on Suffragette City
Whoa, Suffragette city
Ooh, Suffragette City
Ooh-how, Suffragette City
Ooh-how, Suffragette City
Ooh-how, Suffragette
Oh, wham, bam, thank you, Ma'am!
A Suffragette City
A Suffragette City
Quite all right
A Suffragette City
Too fine
A Suffragette City
Ooh, a Suffragette City
Oh, my Suffragette City
Oh, my Suffragette City
Oh, Suffragette
Suffragette!

Hey now, now
Oh, oh, oh

[Verse 1]
Didn't know what time it was, the lights were low
I leaned back on my radio
Some cat was layin down some rock 'n' roll
"Lotta soul," he said
Then the loud sound did seem to fade
Came back like a slow voice on a wave of phase
That weren't no DJ, that was hazy cosmic jive

[Chorus]
There's a starman waiting in the sky
He'd like to come and meet us
But he thinks he'd blow our minds
There's a starman waiting in the sky
He's told us not to blow it
'Cause he knows it's all worthwhile
He told me
Let the children lose it
Let the children use it
Let all the children boogie

[Verse 2]
I had to phone someone so I picked on you
Hey, that's far out, so you heard him too
Switch on the TV, we may pick him up on channel two
Look out your window, I can see his light
If we can sparkle he may land tonight
Don't tell your poppa or he'll get us locked up in fright

[Chorus]
There's a starman waiting in the sky
He'd like to come and meet us
But he thinks he'd blow our minds
There's a starman waiting in the sky
He's told us not to blow it
'Cause he knows it's all worthwhile
He told me
Let the children lose it
Let the children use it
Let all the children boogie

[Chorus]
Starman waiting in the sky
He'd like to come and meet us
But he thinks he'd blow our minds
There's a starman waiting in the sky
He's told us not to blow it
'Cause he knows it's all worthwhile
He told me
Let the children lose it
Let the children use it
Let all the children boogie

This is Ground Control to Major Tom
You've really made the grade
And the papers want to know whose shirt you wear
Now it's time to leave the capsule if you dare
This is Major Tom to Ground Control
I'm stepping through the door
And I'm floating in a most peculiar way
And the stars look very different today

[Chorus]
For here am I sitting in my tin can
Far above the world
Planet Earth is blue
And there's nothing I can do

[Verse 3]
Though I'm past 100,000 miles
I'm feeling very still
And I think my spaceship knows which way to go
Tell my wife I love her very much
She knows
Ground Control to Major Tom
Your circuit's dead, there's something wrong
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you

[Chorus]
Here am I floating 'round my tin can
Far above the moon
Planet Earth is blue
And there's nothing I can do

[Instrumental outro]

[Intro]
Oh yeah
Mmm

[Verse 1]
Still don't know what I was waiting for
And my time was running wild, a million dead-end streets and
Every time I thought I'd got it made
It seemed the taste was not so sweet
So I turned myself to face me
But I've never caught a glimpse
Of how the others must see the faker
I'm much too fast to take that test

[Chorus]
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes (Turn and face the strange)
Ch-ch-changes, don't want to be a richer man
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes (Turn and face the strange)
Ch-ch-changes, just gonna have to be a different man
Time may change me
But I can't trace time

[Interlude]
Oh yeah

[Verse 2]
I watch the ripples change their size
But never leave the stream of warm impermanence and
So the days float through my eyes
But still the days seem the same
And these children that you spit on
As they try to change their worlds
Are immune to your consultations
They're quite aware of what they're going through

[Chorus]
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes (Turn and face the strange)
Ch-ch-changes, don't tell them to grow up and out of it
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes (Turn and face the strange)
Ch-ch-changes, where's your shame?
You've left us up to our necks in it
Time may change me
But you can't trace time

[Bridge]
Strange fascination, fascinating me
Ah, changes are taking the pace I'm going through

[Chorus]
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes (turn and face the strange)
Ch-ch-changes, oh, look out you rock 'n rollers
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes (turn and face the strange)
Ch-ch-changes, pretty soon now you're gonna get older
Time may change me
But I can't trace time

[Outro]
I said that time may change me
But I can't trace time

[Verse 1]
Wake up you sleepy head
Put on some clothes, shake up your bed
Put another log on the fire for me
I've made some breakfast and coffee
Look out my window and what do I see
A crack in the sky and a hand reaching down to me
All the nightmares came today
And it looks as though they're here to stay

[Verse 2]
What are we coming to
No room for me, no fun for you
I think about a world to come
Where the books were found by the Golden ones
Written in pain, written in awe
By a puzzled man who questioned what we were here for
All the strangers came today
And it looks as though they're here to stay

[Chorus]
Oh, you Pretty Things
Don't you know you're driving your Mamas and Papas insane?
Oh, you Pretty Things
Don't you know you're driving your Mamas and Papas insane
Let me make it plain
You gotta make way for the Homo Superior

[Verse 3]
Look out at your children
See their faces in golden rays
Don't kid yourself, they belong to you
They're the start of the coming race
The earth is a bitch, we've finished our news
Homo Sapiens have outgrown their use
All the strangers came today
And it looks as though they're here to stay

[Chorus]
Oh, you Pretty Things
Don't you know you're driving your Mamas and Papas insane
Oh, you Pretty Things
Don't you know you're driving your Mamas and Papas insane
Let me make it plain
Gotta make way for the Homo Superior

[Verse 1]
Like to take a cement fix
Be a standing cinema
Dress my friends up just for show
See them as they really are
Put a peephole in my brain
Two New Pence to have a go
I'd like to be a gallery
Put you all inside my show

[Chorus]
Andy Warhol looks a scream
Hang him on my wall
Andy Warhol, Silver Screen
Can't tell them apart at all

[Verse 2]
Andy walking, Andy tired
Andy take a little snooze
Tie him up when he's fast asleep
Send him on a pleasant cruise
When he wakes up on the sea
Be sure to think of me and you
He'll think about paint
And he'll think about glue
What a jolly boring thing to do

[Chorus]
Andy Warhol looks a scream
Hang him on my wall
Andy Warhol, Silver Screen
Can't tell them apart at all
Andy Warhol looks a scream
Hang him on my wall
Andy Warhol, Silver Screen
Can't tell them apart at all

[Verse 1]
People stared at the makeup on his face
Laughed at his long black hair, his animal grace
The boy in the bright blue jeans
Jumped up on the stage
And lady stardust sang his songs
Of darkness and disgrace

[Chorus]
And he was alright
The band was altogether
Yes, he was alright
The song went on forever
And he was awful nice
Really quite out of sight
And he sang all night long

[Verse 2]
Femme fatales emerged from shadows to watch this creature fair
Boys stood upon their chairs to make their point of view
I smiled sadly for a love I could not obey
Lady stardust sang his songs of darkness and dismay

[Chorus]
And he was alright
The band was altogether
Yes, he was alright
The song went on forever
And he was awful nice
Really quite paradise, and he sang
All night, all night long

[Bridge]
Ooh, how I sighed when they asked if I knew his name

[Chorus]
Oh, it was alright
The band was altogether
Yes, he was alright
And the song went on forever
He was awful nice
Really quite paradise, he sang
All night long

(Get some pussy now)

[Verse 1]
Time takes a cigarette, puts it in your mouth
You pull on your finger, then another finger, then your cigarette
The wall-to-wall is calling, it lingers, then you forget
Oh oh, oh, oh, you're a rock 'n' roll suicide

[Verse 2]
You're too old to lose it, too young to choose it
And the clock waits so patiently on your song
You walk past a cafe but you don't eat when you've lived too long
Oh, no, no, no, you're a rock 'n' roll suicide

[Verse 3]
Chev brakes are snarling as you stumble across the road
But the day breaks instead so you hurry home
Don't let the sun blast your shadow
Don't let the milk float ride your mind
You're so natural - religiously unkind

[Bridge]
Oh no, love! You're not alone
You're watching yourself but you're too unfair
You got your head all tangled up
But if I could only make you care
Oh no, love! You're not alone
No matter what or who you've been
No matter when or where you've seen
All the knives seem to lacerate your brain
I've had my share, I'll help you with the pain
You're not alone!

[Outro]
Just turn on with me and you're not alone
Let's turn on with me and you're not alone (wonderful)
Let's turn on and be not alone (wonderful)
Gimme your hands 'cause you're wonderful (wonderful)
Gimme your hands 'cause you're wonderful (wonderful)
Oh, gimme your hands

[Chorus]
Let me break it to you, boy, I, I, I, I
I can give it to you all night
All in all, we pullin' all nighters
We ain't gotta turn on them lights

[Post-Chorus]
Finna be up, ain't no sleepin' all night, yuh
Finna be up, ain't no sleepin' all night, yuh
Finna be up, yea-yuh, finna be up, yea-yuh
Finna be up ain't no sleepin' all night

[Verse]
Yuh, yuh, we up 'til the day break off
Make up when I take, take off
No sleep, you my sunshine, though
Just me, you, and some wine, look
'Cause we tryna unwind, look
We sleep baby, sometimes, look
Yeah, we got the same schedule, sexual drive
Speed through, I just led you
Spent 15 on it and that's fine
'Cause we already been around five
Lil' weed, Hennessy, kinda sound nice
Finna need new sheets by around nine
Feelin' weak in the knees
Make it bounce like blap-blap-blap
Bed smack to the wall tap-tap-tap
Wait, lemme throw it all back-back-back
Neighbor bangin' on the door (Yuh)

[Refrain]
Ain't no sleepin', fuck Monday, it's the weekend 'til Sunday
Our moon will be sunlight, he love that t-shirt, no undies
Ain't no sleepin', fuck Monday, it's the weekend 'til Sunday
Our moon will be sunlight, he love that t-shirt, no undies, okay

[Chorus]
Let me break it to you, boy, I, I, I, I
I can give it to you all night
All in all, we pullin' all nighters
We ain't gotta turn on them lights

[Post-Chorus]
Finna be up, ain't no sleepin' all night, yuh
Finna be up, ain't no sleepin' all night, yuh
Finna be up, yea-yuh, finna be up, yea-yuh
Finna be up ain't no sleepin' all night, yeah

[Verse 1]
Welcome, my son
Welcome to the machine
Where have you been?
It's alright, we know where you've been
You've been in the pipeline, filling in time
Provided with toys and 'Scouting for Boys'
You bought a guitar to punish your ma
And you didn't like school
And you know you're nobody's fool
So welcome to the machine

[Bridge]

[Verse 2]
Welcome, my son
Welcome to the machine
What did you dream?
It's alright, we told you what to dream
You dreamed of a big star
He played a mean guitar
He always ate in the Steak Bar
He loved to drive in his Jaguar
So welcome to the machine

[Synthesizer Solo]

You know I'ma wait if you don't take long

But a nigga had to prove a point, hold up

Back up, nigga, ayy, ayy (One word)
Back up, give us some space (One word)
Come on, get in the car, buddy, come on

[Intro]
Yeah

[Verse 1]
I've been tryna call
I've been on my own for long enough
Maybe you can show me how to love, maybe
I'm going through withdrawals
You don't even have to do too much
You can turn me on with just a touch, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
I look around and
Sin City's cold and empty (Oh)
No one's around to judge me (Oh)
I can't see clearly when you're gone

[Chorus]
I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night
Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust
Hey, hey, hey

[Verse 2]
I'm running out of time
'Cause I can see the sun light up the sky
So I hit the road in overdrive, baby, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
The city's cold and empty (Oh)
No one's around to judge me (Oh)
I can't see clearly when you're gone

[Chorus]
I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night
Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust

I'm just coming back to let you know (Back to let you know)
I could never say it on the phone (Say it on the phone)
Will never let you go this time (Ooh)

[Chorus]
I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey

[Outro]
I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch

[Verse 1]
I been tryin' hard to find the words to say (Find the words to say)
If we tried again, we'd make the same mistakes (Ooh yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah)

[Pre-Chorus]
Asphyxiated (Asphyxiated)
I'll never make it (I'll never make it)
Without my baby, oh-ooh-oh
So I fill the void, I know you do the same
Oh, ooh-ooh-ooh, oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
Nothing compares to the emptiness we both share (Yeah)
And nobody cares like you do (Oh yeah)
You asked for my heart, but I didn't know where to start (Oh no)
But they won't think of you like I do (Ooh, ooh)

[Verse 2]
I try my best to not get high again (Oh, baby, I can't get high again)
But I've been stuck inside this place for days on end (La-da-da-da-da-da-da-da)

[Pre-Chorus]
Intoxicated (Intoxicated)
I'll never make it (I'll never make it)
Without my baby, oh-ooh-oh
So I fill the void just like I did back then
Oh, ooh-ooh, oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Light a blunt up with the flame
Put that cocaine on a plate
Molly with the purple rain
'Cause I lost my faith
So I cut away the pain, uh
Got it swimming in my veins
Now my mind is outta place, yeah, uh
'Cause I lost my faith

[Chorus]
And I feel everything
I feel everything from my body to my soul
No, no
Well, I feel everything
When I'm coming down is the most I feel alone
No, no

[Post-Chorus]
I've been sober for a year, now it's time for me
To go back to my old ways, don't you cry for me
Thought I'd be a better man, but I lied to me and to you

[Verse 2]
I take half a Xan' and I still stay awake
All my demons wanna pull me to my grave
I choose Vegas if they offer Heaven's gate
I tried to love, but you know I'd never stay
I'd never stay
But if I OD, I want you to OD right beside me
I want you to follow right behind me
I want you to hold me while I'm smiling
While I'm dying
And if you know me
When I go missing, you know where to find me
Driving down the boulevard is blinding
Always blinded by the desert lights and
I'm alive when

[Chorus]
I feel everything
I feel everything from my body to my soul
No, no
Girl, I feel everything
When I'm coming down is the most I feel alone
No, no

[Bridge]
I lost my faith
I'm losing my religion every day
Time hasn't been kind to me, I pray
When I look inside the mirror and see someone I love
Oh, someone, I love
Faith
I'm losing my religion every day
Time hasn't been kind to me, I pray
When I look inside the mirror and see someone I love
Oh, someone, I love

[Outro]
I ended up in the back of a flashing car
With the city shining on my face
The lights are blinding me again
I ended up in the back of a flashing car
With the city shining on my face
The lights are blinding me again
I ended up (I ended up), in the back of a flashing car (Back of a flashing car)

I resent you for being raised right
I resent you for being tall
I resent you for never getting any opposition at all
I resent you for having each other
I resent you for being so sure
I resent you presenting your life like a fucking propaganda brochure

[Pre-Chorus]
And I see that you keep trying to bait me
And I'd love to get up in your face
But I know if I hate you for hating me
I will have entered the endless race

[Outro]
Wipe it all away
Wipe it all away
I used to go to the Ferris wheel every morning
Just to throw my anger out the door

[Verse 1]
Your face ignites a fuse to my patience
Whatever you do, it's gonna be wrong
There's no time to interrupt the detonation
Be good to me before you're gone
When I met you, I was fine with my nothing
I grew with you and now I've changed
What I've become is something I can't be without your loving
Be good to me, it isn't a game

[Pre-Chorus]
Now let me see, it's you and me, forgive, good God
How do you suppose that we'll survive?
Come on, that's right, left, right
Make lighter of all the heavier

[Chorus]
'Cause you and I will be like a couple of cosmonauts
Except with way more gravity than when we started off
Oh, you and I will be like a couple of cosmonauts
Except with way more gravity than when we started off

[Bridge]
When you resist me, hon', I cease to exist
Because I only like the way I look when looking through your eyes
And when you come back
You commemorate the penetration of the sun into the deep, dark sky

[Pre-Chorus]
Now let me see, it's you and me, forgive, good God
How do you suppose that we'll survive?
Come on, that's right, left right
Make lighter of all the heavier

[Chorus]
'Cause you and I will be like a couple of cosmonauts
Except with way more gravity than when we started off
Oh, you and I will be like a couple of cosmonauts
Except with way more gravity than when we started off

[Post-Chorus]
Start it, start it off, start it off
Start it, start it off, start it off, baby
Start it, start it off, start it off now
Start it, start it off, start it off, baby
Start it, start it off, start it, start it
Start it, start it

[Chorus]
You and I will be like a couple of cosmonauts
Except with way more gravity than when we started off
Oh, you and I will be like a couple of cosmonauts
Except with way more gravity than when we started off

[Post-Chorus]
Start it, start it off, start it off
Start it off, start it off, start it off, baby
Start it off, start it off, start it off now
Start it off, start it off, start it off, baby
Start it off, start it off, start it, start it
Start it, start it

Start it off, start it off, start it off now
Start it off, start it off, start it off, baby
Start it off, start it off, start, start, start, start

[Outro]
Now we'll be like a couple of cosmonauts
Except with way more gravity than when we started off
Oh, you and I will be like a couple of cosmonauts
Except with way more gravity than when we started off

[Verse 1]
It's a god-awful small affair
To the girl with the mousy hair
But her mummy is yelling, "No!"
And her daddy has told her to go
But her friend is nowhere to be seen
Now she walks through her sunken dream
To the seat with the clearest view
And she's hooked to the silver screen

[Pre-Chorus 1]
But the film is a saddening bore
For she's lived it ten times or more
She could spit in the eyes of fools
As they ask her to focus on

[Chorus]
Sailors fighting in the dance hall
Oh man! Look at those cavemen go
It's the freakiest show
Take a look at the lawman
Beating up the wrong guy
Oh man! Wonder if he'll ever know
He's in the best selling show
Is there life on Mars?

[Verse 2]
It's on America's tortured brow
That Mickey Mouse has grown up a cow
Now the workers have struck for fame
Because Lennon's on sale again
See the mice in their million hordes
From Ibiza to the Norfolk Broads
Rule Britannia is out of bounds
To my mother, my dog, and clowns

[Pre-Chorus 2]
But the film is a saddening bore
Because I wrote it ten times or more
It's about to be writ again
As I ask you to focus on

[Chorus]
Sailors fighting in the dance hall
Oh man! Look at those cavemen go
It's the freakiest show
Take a look at the lawman
Beating up the wrong guy
Oh man! Wonder if he'll ever know
He's in the best selling show
Is there life on Mars?

[Intro]
Put your hands up, hands up, hands up

[Verse 1]
I've been tryna call
I've been on my own for long enough
Maybe you can show me how to love, maybe
I'm going through withdrawals
You don't even have to do too much
You can turn me on with just a touch, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
I look around and
Sin City's cold and empty (Oh)
No one's around to judge me (Oh)
I can't see clearly when you're gone

[Chorus]
I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night
Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust
Hey, hey, hey

[Verse 2]
I'm running out of time
'Cause I can see the sun light up the sky
So I hit the road in overdrive, baby, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
The city's cold and empty (Oh)
No one's around to judge me (Oh)
I can't see clearly when you're gone

[Chorus]
I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night
Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust (Hey, hey, hey)

Plants that grow and open your mind
Things that swim with a neon glow
How we all got here, nobody knows

[Pre-Chorus]
These are real things
These are real things

Oh, what a world, don't wanna leave
All kinds of magic all around us; it's hard to believe
Thank God it's not too good to be true
Oh, what a world, and then there is you

Did I know you once in another life?
Are we here just once or a billion times?

And these are real things
These are real things

Smile though your heart is breaking
Smile even though it's aching
When there are clouds in the sky, you'll get by
If you smile through your fear and sorrow
Smile and maybe tomorrow
You'll see the sun come shining through for you

[Verse 2]
Light up your face with gladness
Hide every trace of sadness
Although a tear may be ever so near
That's the time you must keep on trying
Smile, what's the use of crying?
You'll see that life is still worthwhile
If you just smile

Sometimes I get tired of being in here
Is this the way that it's always been?
Could it ever have been different?

Do you ever get tired of the waiting?
Do you ever get tired of being in there?
Don't worry, nobody lives forever

I will always be here
I will always look out from behind these eyes
It’s only a lifetime
It’s only a lifetime
It’s only a lifetime

I am not frightened of dying
Any time will do, I don't mind
Why should I be frightened of dying?
There's no reason for it, you've gotta go sometime

[Verse 1]
A restless eye across a weary room
A glazed look and I was on the road to ruin
The music played and played as we whirled without end
No hint, no word her honour to defend
"I will, I will" she sighed to my request
And then she tossed her mane while my resolve was put to the test
Then drowned in desire, our souls on fire
I led the way to the funeral pyre
And without a thought of the consequence
I gave in to my decadence

[Chorus]
One slip, and down the hole we fall
It seems to take no time at all
A momentary lapse of reason
That binds a life for life
A small regret, you won’t forget
There’ll be no sleep in here tonight

[Verse 2]
Was it love or was it the idea of being in love?
Or was it the hand of fate, that seemed to fit just like a glove?
The moment slipped by and soon the seeds were sown
The year grew late and neither one wanted to remain alone

[Chorus]
One slip, and down the hole we fall
It seems to take no time at all
A momentary lapse of reason
That binds a life to a life
One regret, you will never forget
There’ll be no sleep in here tonight

[Outro]
One slip… one slip…

[Intro]
Yeah
Well God damn baby
Yeah, okay

[Verse 1]
Down down sugar love, nothing ever good enough
You be out there with your friends, tell you keep that pussy tucked
Lookin' up, never lookin' down to the danger
Take your hand, will you leave the club with a stranger?
All I make is bangers and they pay the bills right
Ask you how you feelin', you just tell me that you feel right (Oh my God)
Is this real life or is this fantasy, love you like my family
Can it be, will it be, poems and soliloquies
You be chasin' mystery, while I be makin' history
Will you be Mrs. me, when I leave you missin' me
Distance make the heart grow fonder, I long for, her
And everything that she does, we love
My soul was dirty, got it cleaned up
Only the best for you, never the cheap stuff
Gotta leave ya, see ya when I see ya

[Chorus]
Downtown lookin' for my baby, every time she leave
It make my heart go crazy my love, make my heart go crazy my love (Wow, wow wow)
And do you get a little lonely (I do), want to see inside
Is there something you can show me? (I can show you)
Yeah, make my heart go crazy my love yeah (Wow, wow wow)
My love is like my drug (My drug), my love is like my drug yeah (My drug)
My love is like my drug, can't get enough of, yeah (Can't get enough of you, baby)
My love is like my drug (My drug), my love is like my drug yeah (My drug)
My love is like my drug, can't get enough of (I can't get enough)

[Verse 2]
Yeah, yeah
Sweeter than cinnamon she sizzlin' hot
I may be trippin', I just figured I would give it a shot
Perfect of synonym, picturin' her image inside my thoughts
Wanna kick it with you, this the only life that we got
I hit your spot, lick your body then wax it Mr. Miyagi
Need a taste of you every single mornin', girl you my coffee
And I drink you up, stay in bed all day no point in gettin' up
Swear I can't get enough(No)
Girl you so different, brilliant, you one in a billion
Make everythin' simple in this crazy world innocent
There somethin' bout you so dangerous
You try to make it through this tainted blood
Feel like it's made for us
Do you fantasize a feelin' so strong
That when it slip into your finger tips, you try to hold on
For your life, I've been wrong I've been right
But when I saw you tonight, you made me reconsider all that I know to be true
I need you back, I get that pussy wetter than a stream or river
A little weed and liquor, expensive cuisine for dinner
I can change your life drastically and hold you down like gravity
But if you need me I'm

[Chorus]
Downtown lookin' for my baby, every time she leave
It make my heart go crazy my love, make my heart go crazy my love (Wow, wow wow)
And do you get a little lonely (I do), want to see inside
Is there something you can show me? (I can show you)
Yeah, make my heart go crazy my love yeah (Wow, wow wow)
My love is like my drug (My drug), my love is like my drug yeah (My drug)
My love is like my drug, can't get enough of, yeah (Can't get enough of you, baby)
My love is like my drug (My drug), my love is like my drug yeah (My drug)
My love is like my drug, can't get enough of (I can't get enough)

[Verse 3]
Yeah, my little genius
We just in a game of hide and seek love
Keep up, on the run, I'ma lead ya (Lead ya), I need ya (Need ya)
You be Rome I'll be Ceasar, what do you dream of (Huh)
Girl you my pre-love, I be stuck, freeze up
Got me nervous, mumblin' my words tell me speak up
Burn this motherfucker down, it'll be fun, earnest
What you wanna learn, I can teach ya
Jesus, we drunk, she down for the threesome
She just, wanna go crazy while she be young
Yeah, and it never get old, give her the world shit
Anything goes (I can't get enough)

Lime and limpid green, a second scene
A fight between the blue you once knew
Floating down, the sound resounds
Around the icy waters underground
Jupiter and Saturn, Oberon, Miranda and Titania
Neptune, Titan, stars can frighten

Flicker, flicker, flicker, blam
Pow, pow

Lime and limpid green, the sound surrounds
The icy waters under
Lime and limpid green, the sound surrounds
The icy waters underground

[Verse 1]
Dogs of war and men of hate
With no cause, we don’t discriminate
Discovery is to be disowned
Our currency is flesh and bone
Hell opened up and put on sale
Gather round and haggle
For hard cash we will lie and deceive

One world, it’s a battleground
One world, and we will smash it down
One world… One world

[Verse 2]
Invisible transfers, long distance calls
Hollow laughter in marble halls
Steps have been taken, a silent uproar
Has unleashed the dogs of war
You can’t stop what has begun
Signed, sealed, they deliver oblivion
We all have our dark side to say the least
And dealing in death is the nature of the beast

[Hook]
One world, it’s a battleground
One world, and they're gonna smash it down
One world… One world

[Verse 3]
The dogs of war don’t negotiate
The dogs of war won’t capitulate
They will take and you will give
And you must die so that they may live
You can knock at any door
But wherever you go, you know they’ve been there before
Well winners can lose and things can get strained
But whatever you change you know the dogs remain

One world, it’s a battleground
One world, and we gonna smash it down
One world… One world

[Verse 1]
Tell me how should I feel
When I know what I know

Telling me you a dog
People told me 'bout the flames
I couldn't see through the smoke
When I need answers, accusations
What you mean you gone choke?

[Pre-Chorus 1]
You can't stay, you gotta go
Ain't no other chick spending ya dough

And the thought of you just touching her is what I hate most
I don't want you, but I want it and I can't let it go
To know you give it to her like you gave it to me, come on

[Pre-Chorus 2]
(Oh)
He's so arrogant and bold (Oh)
But she gon' love that shit, I know
I done put in a call
Time to ring the alarm
'Cause you ain't never seen a fire like the one I'm gon' cause

She gon' be rockin' chinchilla coats

How can you look at me
And not see all the things that I kept only just for you?
Why would you risk it, baby?
Is that the price I that pay?
But this is my show and I won't let you go
All it's been paid for, and it's mine
How could you look at me
And not see all the things?
(See all the things, see all the things)

[Chorus]
She gon' be rockin' chinchilla coats
If I let you go

[Outro]
Baby
Of all the money that e'er I had
I spent it in good company
And of all the harm that e'er I done
Alas it was to none but me
For all I've done for want of wit
To memory now I can't recall
So fill to me the parting glass
Good night and joy be with you all

Of all the comrades that e'er I had
They're sorry for my going away
And of all the sweethearts that e'er I had
They'd wish me one more day to stay
But as it falls unto my lot
That I must go and you must not
I gently rise and I'll softly call
Good night and joy be with you all
Grabbing hold of my hand
Evil moves like silver
Dripping out all over you
Dash through the orchids naked
Breaking daylight stabs
Through the middle
Of our opulent high

Ooh, girl
Stay cool, girl
She’s got nothing on you, girl

I wanna play
Your wicked game

I wanna play
Your wicked game

[Verse 1]
Heaven knows I’ve been dreaming
Cut the cord
Leave me here
Suspended on a whim

Or maybe I’ll get another drink in
Lose all sense of rhyme
And reason
And slow down my thinking

[Chorus]
Blacken out the sun
With a new point of view
Ideologies stumble out of
This smoky room
How can I be so young
But feel so used?
Breaking out of the mold
I feel brand new (new, new, new)
How about you?
(How about you? ooh ooh)
(How about you? ooh ooh)
(How about you? ooh ooh)

[Verse 2]
Stepping out of mind
Been in here for a minute
Tainted youth
Devilish schemes
Left me black and blue
Forge another identity
To live by
God, I’d do just about anything
To get through to you (Hm)

[Chorus]
Blacken out the sun
With a new point of view
Ideologies stumble out of
This smoky room
How can I be so young
But feel so used?
Breaking out of the mold
I feel brand new (new, new)
How about you?
(How about you?)
(How about you? ooh ooh)
(How about you? ooh ooh)

It's all in my mind
These visions of you
Burn straight through the night
No matter how high I try and get
Your demon won't allow me to forget
He's got me set on you
Drives a stake straight through my heart
Every time I drift past
I can’t believe it
The state of my heart
Makes for unappealing reading
The livid demons await
By my bedside in the morning
Calling for me to tell you
That I want you bad
Though I’d die for the story
I’m one heartbreak away
From never coming back

Stand and deliver a sermon
Upon the mount of sinners
The devil slithers
In and out of my mind
Thoughts of you kick back
Like a heart attack
But I can’t take you back
The hot taste of your loving
Is too sweet for my liking
I couldn’t keep myself together
Now you’re leaving with another
I guess that’s what I get
For dreaming
So much of my life
Spent thinking about somebody
Or another
Strung out
On the taste of the weekend
Bittersweet
Burning on my tongue
Your lips drip sweet memories
Of passion
And despair

I’m weak with fear
That I could never
Get you out of here
Slow down
Come over here
The nights were made
For inhibitions to disappear

Oozing and heaving
Lustful and deceiving
Oh, the taste of this world
Leaves me reeling
I misplaced my faith in
Circles of excess
I’m trying so hard
But none of this makes sense
Dreaming too much
Too much drinking
Too much sex
I don’t know how
We’ll ever make it through this

[Intro]
Well, I didn't know it would come to this
But that's what happens when you're on your own
And you're all right with letting nice things go

[Verse 1]
Well, I pawned the earrings that you gave me
Gold and made of flowers dangling
And I almost cried as I sold them all
And I don't mind living on bread and oranges, oh, oh
But I gotta get to and from where I come
And it's gonna take money to go

[Chorus]
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh

[Verse 2]
In the name of higher consciousness
I let the best man I know go
'Cause it's nice to love and be loved
But it's better to know all you can know
Yeah, it's nice to love and be loved
But I'd rather know what God knows

[Chorus]
Oh no, oh no, oh no, no, no no, oh

[Outro]
Well, I didn't know it would come to this
But that's what happens when you're on your own
And you're all right with letting nice things go

[Verse 1]
Alright, you caught me, I don't play a good guitar
But what do want from me? It's just a stupid bar
And I didn't promise anything
You think I'm pretty and I like way you talk
You like my music and I like the way you walk
I think we're going to get along
I like the way you wear your sweater off your shoulder
The way your hair come down and make you look older
How you get so handsome, my boy?

[Chorus]
Pretty baby, yeah
Pretty baby, ah

[Verse 2]
The way your face is shaped, I wonder if you know
The way you stand up and your silhouette glows
I'm electrified, I'll be up all night now
Use that voice, sing that song
And tell me, and tell me, to come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on
You won't hear no, you won't hear no, oh

[Chorus]
Pretty baby, yeah
Pretty, oh, mm

[Verse 1]
Alright, you caught me, I don't play a good guitar
But what do want from me? It's just a stupid bar
And I didn't promise anything
You think I'm pretty and I like way you talk
You like my music and I like the way you walk
I think we're going to get along
I like the way you wear your sweater off your shoulder
The way your hair come down and make you look older
How you get so handsome, my boy?

[Chorus]
Pretty baby, yeah
Pretty baby, ah

[Verse 2]
The way your face is shaped, I wonder if you know
The way you stand up and your silhouette glows
I'm electrified, I'll be up all night now
Use that voice, sing that song
And tell me, and tell me, to come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on
You won't hear no, you won't hear no, oh

[Chorus]
Pretty baby, yeah
Pretty, oh, mm

[Intro]
Mmm, mmm, mmm

[Verse 1]
Flowers in hand, waiting for me
Every word in poetry
Won't call me by name, only "baby"
The more that you give, the less that I need
Everyone says I look happy
When it feels right

[Chorus]
I know that you're wrong for me
Gonna wish we never met on the day I leave
I brought you down to your knees
'Cause they say that misery loves company
It's not your fault I ruin everything
And it's not your fault I can't be what you need
Baby, angels like you can't fly down here with me

[Post-Chorus]
I'm everything they said I would be
La, la, la
I'm everything they said I would be

[Verse 2]
I'll put you down slow, love you goodbye
Before you let go, just one more time
Take off your clothes, pretend that it's fine
A little more hurt won't kill you
Tonight, mother says you don't look happy
Close your eyes

[Chorus]
I know that you're wrong for me
Gonna wish we never met on the day I leave
I brought you down to your knees
'Cause they say that misery loves company
It's not your fault I ruin everything
And it's not your fault I can't be what you need
Baby, angels like you can't fly down here with me

[Post-Chorus]
I'm everything they said I would be
La, la, la, la
La, la, la
La, la, la
Oh, ah, ah
Ah, oh
Ah, oh

[Chorus]
I know that you're wrong for me
Gonna wish we never met on the day I leave
I brought you down to your knees
'Cause they say that misery loves company
It's not your fault I ruin everything (Everything)
And it's not your fault I can't be what you need
Baby, angels like you can't fly down here with me, oh

[Outro]
Angels like you can't fly down here with me

[Outro: Kanye West, Drake]
Man, I just got like a little half of it done
That shit is tight

[Verse 1]
Midnight and the moon is out
Careful, you might hurt yourself
Pleasure leads to pain
To me, they're both the same
Sweat drippin' down to the floor
Bite marks like an animal
You might be insane
But maybe we're the same

[Pre-Chorus]
Tonight you came here
'Cause you know what I need
And no one likes to be alone

[Chorus]
I don't need a future, I don't need your past
I just need a lover
So gimme what I want or I'll give it to my
Self-inflicted torture, you don't have to ask
I just need a lover
So gimme what I want or I'll give it to myself

[Verse 2]
I can tell that you're new to this
Slow it down, but you can't resist
Beat your fantasy
Give yourself to me

[Pre-Chorus]
Tonight, you came here
'Cause you know what I need
And no one likes to be alone

[Chorus]
I don't need a future, I don't need your past
I just need a lover
So gimme what I want or I'll give it to my
Self-inflicted torture, you don't have to ask
I just need a lover
So gimme what I want or I'll give it to myself

[Bridge]
Give it to me, babe (Give it to me, babe)
Give it to me, babe (Give it to me, babe)
Give it to me and nobody else, babe
Give it to me, babe (Give it to me, babe)
Give it to me, babe (Give it to me, babe)
Give it to me and nobody else, babe

[Outro]
Gimme what I want (Want, want, want)
Gimme what I want or I'll give it to myself
Lyrics from Snippet:

[Verse]
Blonde hair falls just above her shoulders
She's nineteen, but she looks a little older
With the prom queen smile, the cool vintage style
You're obsessed with her, and I don't blame you for it

[Chorus]
But I'll never look like her
Not even if I tried
I'll never be cooler
Not even if I lied
Oh, she's whole where I am broken
She's great where I am good
And I'll never be like her
But you know I wish I could

[Intro]
Uh, okay
Longer would you- (Ooh)
Longer would you- (Ooh)

[Pre-Chorus]
If I got one thing right it was you and me
But I go in through the window so nobody sees

[Chorus]
Pull me closer please (Longer)
I don't even need you to explain
How much longer will you (Longer would you-)
Keep me on your chain (Yeah)

[Verse 1]
I'm running out of options (Okay)
You're running through my mind with a shotgun
I think she might be robbing, she can take what she want
I just wanna make you late, would you wanna waste that?
I know you like my goofy ass, how could you hate that
I see what's underneath and I love you more now
And now I know how (Yeah)

[Pre-Chorus]
If I got one thing right it was you and me
But I go in through the window so nobody sees

[Chorus]
Pull me closer please (Longer)
I don't even need you to explain
How much longer will you (Longer would you-)
Keep me on your chain

[Verse 2]
Too bad it's good, or else I'd be gone
My down she cured
And then we go back to your place, don't lie
You wanna get high, so we gonna get high
And then I see a laugh on your face, so I might die

[Bridge]
So I might die... so I might die...
If I got one thing right it was you and me
So I'll go in so nobody sees

[Chorus]
Pull me closer please (Longer)
I don't even need you to explain
How much longer will you (Longer would you-)
Keep me on your chain

[Outro]
How much longer?

Lyrics from Instagram Live

[Intro]
Stay off the weed, uh
Hm, hm
Hm, hm
Hm, hm (What it is?)

[Verse 1]
While I cough up this blunt, I sit back in the cut
All my niggas ridin' with me, more excuses to stunt
And we pull up the cup, and we fill up the Woods
Loud plane, got this plug, and the rest lookin' good
Get your girl off her, hey, said she ready to play
It's all a game, it's all a game, and I'm doin' my thang
More rage, more rage, black Porsche in the rain
Someone stop me, bitch, get off me, man, my life ain't the same
Natural killer, once I'm done feelin' in pain
Now it's like I'm on my Sepeher and I'm feelin' them games
Let dude hum it back, man, that's a wrap
Can't keep a nigga down, down, baby, that's a fact
And I rep it, Cleveland, city runnin' through my veins
To BK, East New York, and I never change
And I keep my niggas close, just like I'm supposed
'Cause this is for people, truth is what I wrote, uh-huh

[Chorus]
And I feel like I can do what I want
Livin', livin', livin', livin', I'ma do what I want
And I feel like I can do what I want
Livin', livin', livin', livin', I'ma do what I want
And I feel like I can do what I want
Livin', livin', livin', livin', I'ma do what I want (Yeah)
And I feel like I can do what I want
Livin', livin', livin', livin', I'ma do what I want (Ayy, ayy)

[Intro]
Ah!

[Verse 1]
Hello
The sunny place for shady people
A crowded room where nobody goes
You can be whoever you wanna be here
And oh, I've been livin' at the Chateau
Shouldn't drive, but I should really go home
I don't even know 'em, but they won't leave here

[Pre-Chorus]
Frightened by my own reflection
Desperate for a new connection
Pull you in, but don't you get too close
Love you now, but not tomorrow
Wrong to steal, but not to borrow
Pull you in, but don't you get too close

[Chorus]
I've been California dreamin'
Plastic hearts are bleedin'
Keep me up all night (Keep me up)
Keep me up all night (All night)
Lost in black hole conversation
Sunrise suffocation
Keep me up all night (Keep me up)
Keep me up all night

[Post-Chorus]
I just wanna feel (Feel)
I just wanna feel somethin' (Feel somethin' now)
But I keep feeling nothin' all night long

[Bridge]
All night long
All night long
All night long

[Verse 2]
Hello (Hello)
I'll tell you all the people I know (I know)
Sell you somethin' that you already own (You own)
I can be whoever you want me to be

[Pre-Chorus]
Love me now, but not tomorrow
Fill me up, but leave me hollow
Pull me in, but don't you get too close (Oh)

[Chorus]
I've been California dreamin'
Plastic hearts are bleedin'
Keep me up all night (Keep me up)
Keep me up all night (All night)
Lost in black hole conversations
Sunrise suffocation
Keep me up all night (Keep me up)
Keep me up all night

[Post-Chorus]
I just wanna feel (Feel)
I just wanna feel somethin' (Feel somethin' now)
But I keep feelin' nothin' all night long

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
All night long
All night long
All night long
All night long

[Chorus]
I've been California dreamin' (Dreamin')
Plastic hearts are bleedin' (Are bleedin')
Keep me up all night (Yeah)
Keep me up all night (All night)
Lost in black hole conversations
Sunrise suffocation
Keep me up all night (Keep me up, oh yeah)
Keep me up all night

[Outro]
I just wanna feel (Feel)
I just wanna feel somethin' (Feel somethin' now)
But I keep feelin' nothin' all night long

[Verse 1]
Last night was the nail in the coffin
Lord knows we were already dead
Look back and the memory's haunted
Can't believe we did it again, yeah
Can't count all the times that I faked it
Thank God for the thoughts in my head
Killed time, but we both gotta face it
Welcome to the end of the end, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
You know me the best
But you hurt me the worst, my darling
I can't pretend anymore
You win some, you lose some

[Chorus]
Everybody talks, but they don't know our history
Everybody loves you, but they won't forgive me
Shot through the sky, we burned in the sun
What's done is done, we had some fun
You win some, you lose some

[Verse 2]
One drink and we're fighting in public
Two drinks and we're back in the bed
Wake up and I'm sick to my stomach
Can't believe we did it again, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
You know me the best
But you hurt me the worst, my darling
I can't pretend anymore
You win some, you lose some

[Chorus]
Everybody talks, but they don't know our history
Everybody loves you, but they won't forgive me
Shot through the sky, we burned in the sun
What's done is done, we had some fun
You win some, you lose some
Everybody talks, but they don't know our history
Everybody's shocked when they all saw her kiss me
Shot through the sky, we burned in the sun
What's done is done, we had some fun
You win some, you lose some

[Bridge]
I'm faded, sedated
See the fire, can't feel it burning
I'm cried out, goodbye now
Oh well, you win some, you lose some
(You win some, but you lose some)

[Chorus]
Everybody talks, but they don't know our history
Everybody loves you, but they won't forgive me
Shot through the sky, we burned in the sun
What's done is done, we had some fun
You win some, you lose some
Everybody talks, but they don't know our history
Everybody's shocked when they all saw her kiss me
Shot through the sky, we burned in the sun
What's done is done, we had some fun
You win some, you lose some

[Verse 1]
What lies
Behind
Your pretty house with the white picket fence
And all the Barbies that you call your friends?
Is your life
A lie?
Nothing's as good as it seems
And you're not the girl of their dreams

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, and maybe your life is all flowers
Maybe I'm insecure
Maybe you're good at taking pictures
Maybe you're a pretender (Oh)

[Chorus]
Pretender
I'm pointing my finger at you
Pretender
If only they knew what I knew
Yeah, if only they knew what I knew (Mmm, mmm)

[Verse 2]
I'm happy
With me
Think that's supposed to be enough
So why am I sulking, calling your bluff?

[Pre-Chorus]
Maybe your life is all flowers
Maybe I'm insecure
And maybe you're good at taking pictures
You're a pretender-er-er

[Chorus]
Pretender
I'm pointing my finger at you
Pretender
If only they knew what I knew
Yeah, if only they knew what I knew (Ah, mmm)

[Bridge]
Pretender
I guess you're really not so bad
Maybe you pretend
But you look like you got the life I wish I had
I created you
To be plastic and deadly
I created you
To hide my own envy
To hide my own envy, yeah

[Chorus]
Pretender
I wish I knew what you knew
Pretender
If only I was like you
Maybe I'm a pretender like you
Today, and tomorrow, and yesterday, too
The flowers are dyin' like all things do
Follow me close, I’m going to Bally-na-Lee
I'll lose my mind if you don't come with me
I fuss with my hair, and I fight blood feuds
I contain multitudes

Got a tell-tale heart like Mr. Poe
Got skeletons in the walls of people you know
I’ll drink to the truth and the things we said
I'll drink to the man that shares your bed
I paint landscapes, and I paint nudes
I contain multitudes

A red Cadillac and a black mustache
Rings on my fingers that sparkle and flash
Tell me, what's next? What shall we do?
Half my soul, baby, belongs to you
I rollick and I frolic with all the young dudes
I contain multitudes
I'm just like Anne Frank, like Indiana Jones
And them British bad boys, the Rolling Stones
I go right to the edge, I go right to the end
I go right where all things lost are made good again
I sing the songs of experience like William Blake
I have no apologies to make
Everything's flowing all at the same time
I live on a boulevard of crime
I drive fast cars, and I eat fast foods
I contain multitudes

Pink pedal-pushers, red blue jeans
All the pretty maids, and all the old queens
All the old queens from all my past lives
I carry four pistols and two large knives
I'm a man of contradictions, I'm a man of many moods
I contain multitudes

You greedy old wolf, I'll show you my heart
But not all of it, only the hateful parts
I’ll sell you down the river, I’ll put a price on your head
What more can I tell you? I sleep with life and death in the same bed
Get lost, madame, get up off my knee
Keep your mouth away from me
I'll keep the path open, the path in my mind
I’ll see to it that there's no love left behind
I'll play Beethoven's sonatas, Chopin’s preludes
I contain multitudes

[Intro]
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah

[Verse 1]
Imagine I'm in love with you
It's easy 'cause I know
I've imagined I'm in love with you

But I'll get you, I'll get you in the end
Yes I will, I'll get you in the end, oh yeah, oh yeah

I think about you night and day
I need you and it's true
When I think about you, I can say
I'm never, never, never, never blue

[Chorus]
So I'm telling you, my friend
That I'll get you, I'll get you in the end
Yes I will, I'll get you in the end, oh yeah, oh yeah

[Bridge]
Well, there's gonna be a time
When I'm gonna change your mind (When I'm gonna make you mine)
So you might as well resign yourself to me, oh yeah

[Verse 1]
Imagine I'm in love with you
It's easy 'cause I know
I've imagined I'm in love with you

But I'll get you, I'll get you in the end
Yes I will, I'll get you in the end, oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Woah yeah

They don't want me to Kanye
They don't want Kanye to be Kanye

They tryna sign a calm Ye
That's right, I call 'em Calm-Ye
But don't take me the wrong way (God)

[Verse 1]
I've seen the world, done it all

Hot summer nights, mid-July
When you and I were forever wild
The crazy days, city lights
The way you'd play with me like a child

[Chorus]
Will you still love me when I'm no longer young and beautiful?
Will you still love me when I got nothing but my aching soul?

I've seen the world, lit it up as my stage now

All that face makes me wanna party
He's my sun, he makes me shine like diamonds

[Chorus]
Will you still love me when I'm no longer young and beautiful?
Will you still love me when I got nothin' but my aching soul?
I know you will, I know you will, I know that you will

[Intro]
Sour Hour

[Chorus]
I'm flyin' away
Here I go, here I go
Got a little bit of drink in my cup
Little something to smoke, a little something to smoke
Call me later, call me later
I ain't comin' back around
Call me later, call me later
'Cause I don't think I'm comin' down

[Verse 1]
Haha, uh
You can find me way up in the clouds, flyin' through the stratosphere
Don't need three strikes to know I'm outta here

[?], boy, I ain't even on your radar
Learned to play every single game like it's the playoffs
I ain't got a day job, chillin' for the moment
Blowin' potent, my schedule's pretty open
Eat, chief, grind and sleep
And if I'm in the mood go and find a freak
I am above and beyond, puffin' 'til the weed gone
Eons and eons, I'm tryna get my cheese long
Cup of tea and some china plates to eat on
Tempur-Pedic mattress that I count my sheep and sleep on
Flyer than a helicopter, homie, you a kamikaze
Feelin' good like I popped a molly
Drivin' slow, I ain't gettin' stopped by no cops
Speakers keep punchin' like a Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robot (Aha)

[Chorus]
I'm flyin' away
Here I go, here I go
Got a little bit of drink in my cup
Little something to smoke, a little something to smoke
Call me later, call me later
I ain't comin' back around
Call me later, call me later
'Cause I don't think I'm comin' down

[Verse 2]
Uh-huh, yeah, look
I smoke my weed from the Garden of Eden
Followin' a dream that ain't hard to believe in
My money European, got a market in Sweden
Hittin' on this L 'til it's harder to breath and to see
No iPhone, I got a 'droid, bitch
I'm makin' money now, you unemployed, bitch
Ha, 24, livin' at your moms crib
Get ya ass up, go and get a job, shit
I'm on the road, puttin' money in my pockets
Plus the kid got the finest ho to go to prom wit'
To be honest, I'm the illest now
For real, I'm feelin' like killin' it up in Tinseltown
Ask the bitches I'm hittin', they know I get around
You? Another face in the crowd
I'm stayin' on your girls mind
She screamin' out like it's her first time, ha

[Interlude: Marc Cohen & Stephen Baldwin]
"Hey, man, we're out of papers."
"All right. Then get me a toilet paper roll, a corkscrew and some tin foil."
"We don't have a corkscrew."
"All right. Then get me an avocado, an ice pick and my snorkel. Trust me, bro. I've made bongs with less. Hurry up!"

[Verse 1]
Someday I'll be caught up in the wind 
Maybe I'll spill it out my skin 
And the Earth will take me down 
One day I'll no longer have my bed 
And I'll forget the things you said 
On a rainy week in June 

[Chorus]
Blowin' away I'm sippin' on rosé 
Turning gold into grey 
And the silver into rain 
Blow me away, I'm too young for my age 
Too shy for the stage 
Too careful to be brave 

Blowin' away I'm sippin' on rosé 
Turning gold into grey 
And the silver into rain 
Blow me away I'm sippin on rosé 
Gold into grey 
And the silver into rain 

[Bridge]
I'm blowing away sippin' on rosé 
Gold into grey 
And the silver woo-woo-ooh 
I'm blowing away sippin on rosé 
Turning gold into grey 
And the silver

I'm too young for my age

[Verse1: Lana Del Rey]
I had a vision
A vision of my nails in the kitchen
Scratching counter tops, I was screaming
My back arched like a cat
My position couldn't stop, you were hitting it
And I shouldn't cry, but I love it, star boy
And I shouldn't cry, but I love it (I love it), star boy
And I shouldn't cry, but I love it, star boy
And I shouldn't cry, but I love it, star boy

[Hook: The Weeknd]
I just want to see you shine 'cause I know you are a star, girl
I just want to see you shine 'cause I know you are a star, girl
I just want to see you shine 'cause I know you are a star, girl
I just want to see you shine 'cause I know you are a star, girl

[Verse 2: Lana Del Rey]
All my intentions
Wrapped around your shape in my bedroom
Boy, come let me play, love's our target (target, baby)
My feelings are intense
Yeah i thought you would be mine, ever endless
And I shouldn't cry, but I love it, star boy (star boy)
And I shouldn't cry, but I love it (I love it), star boy
And I shouldn't cry, but I love it, star boy
And I shouldn't cry, but I love it, star boy (no, no, no, no)

[Outro: The Weeknd]
I just want to see you shine 'cause I know you are a star, girl
I just want to see you shine 'cause I know you are a star, girl
I just want to see you shine 'cause I know you are a star, girl
I just want to see you shine 'cause I know you are a star, girl

[Verse 1]
Go ahead, you can say it's my fault
If it still hurts at all
I thought one of these days you might call
When you were feelin' small

[Pre-Chorus]
Drownin' in my thoughts
Starin' at the clock
And I know I'm not on your mind

[Chorus]
I wonder what would happen if I die
I hope all of my friends get drunk and high
Would it be too hard to say goodbye?
I hope that it's enough to make you cry
Maybe that day, you won't hate me

[Verse 2]
Go ahead, you can say that I've changed
Just say it to my face
One drink and I'm back to that place (To that place)
The memories won't fade (Won't fade)

[Pre-Chorus]
Drownin' in my thoughts (My thoughts)
Starin' at the clock (The clock)
And I know I'm not on your mind

[Chorus]
I wonder what would happen if I die
I hope all of my friends get drunk and high
Would it be too hard to say goodbye?
I hope that it's enough to make you cry
Maybe that day (Maybe that day), you won't hate me

[Outro]
Wonder what would happen if I die (If I die)
I hope all of my friends get drunk and high (Oh)
Would it be too hard to say goodbye? (Say goodbye)
I hope that it's enough to make you cry
And maybe that day, you won't hate me

[Verse 1]
So you're still thinking of me
Just like I know you should
I can not give you everything, you know I wish I could
I'm so high at the moment
I'm so caught up in this
Yeah, we're just young, dumb and broke
But we still got love to give

[Chorus]
While we're young dumb
Young, young dumb and broke
Young dumb
Young, young dumb and broke
Young dumb

Young dumb broke high school kids
Yadadadadadadada

Young dumb broke high school kids

[Verse 2]
We have so much in common
We argue all the time
You always say I'm wrong
I'm pretty sure I'm right
What's fun about commitment?
When we have our life to live
Yeah, we're just young dumb and broke
But we still got love to give

[Chorus]
While we're young dumb
Young, young dumb and broke
Young dumb
Young, young dumb and broke
Young dumb
Young, young dumb and broke
Young dumb broke high school kids

Jump and we think - do it all in the name of love
Love
Run into sin, do it all in the name of fun

Whoa-oa-oa

He sits on the stairs
Waiting for someone to get him
Bring him down to the party
But everyone forgets him
So for times will o stams

[?] and shams the daddy get his mother too

Fine young people can still be calloused

And time keeps turning while you're still jealous
That life means nothing while you're still headless
No time won't wait for no man to come down
To come down

[Verse 2: T.I.]
I'm the one to bill, excuse me, miss, I see me and you in a new G6
Booted up to the max with some stank hoes on it, if I want it, I'ma spend a bankroll on it, goddamn
We havin' shit, far from average, you used to have the bitch, now she a badder bitch
Got Molly, Percocet, Cannabis, coke too, but I ain't no fan of that
I done ran the whole rag and then ran it back, and then ran it back
Say no to me, they can't imagine that, nope, I'm way too raw for that
Drill soft 'fore I left off, get it all in your mouth, wipe your lips off
You can put on what you want, get it ripped off, down to your G strings and your lil' bra
Introduced to the time of our life, when I'm rhymin', she might just get high and go down on a dyke
Ain't no back and forth 'cause I know what she like, you get all in the bed with a ho and be night, no!
She just want me, let me treat it, eat on that pussy and beat it
I fuck her good, send her home, make her move out, the kinda shit, man, ain't nothin' you can do about, you dig?

[Verse 3: Stuey Rock]
You know we lit, baby, lookin' like the shit, baby

Young niggas on the come-up, niggas better not run up, ayy, ayy, ayy
Hustle every day, gettin' money 'til the sun up, ayy, ayy, ayy
And ain't nobody fuckin' with me and my niggas, ayy, ayy

[Verse 1]
(Hey)
Once upon a younger year
When all our shadows disappeared
The animals inside came out to play (Hey)
Hey, went face to face with all our fears
Learned our lessons through the tears
Made memories we knew would never fade

[Pre-Chorus]
One day my father he told me
Son, don't let it slip away
He took me in his arms, I heard him say (Hey)
When you get older
Your wild heart will live for younger days
Think of me if ever you’re afraid

[Chorus]
He said, one day you'll leave this world behind
So live a life you will remember
My father told me when I was just a child
These are the nights that never die
My father told me
(Hey, hey)
(Hey, hey)
(Hey, hey)
(Hey, hey)
(Hey, hey)
(Hey, hey)
(Hey, hey)

[Verse 2]
When thunderclouds start pouring down
Light a fire they can't put out
Carve your name into those shining stars
He said, go venture far beyond the shores
Don’t forsake this life of yours
I'll guide you home no matter where you are

[Pre-Chorus]
One day my father he told me
Son, don't let it slip away
When I was just a kid, I heard him say
When you get older
Your wild heart will live for younger days
Think of me if ever you're afraid

[Chorus]
He said, one day you'll leave this world behind
So live a life you will remember
My father told me when I was just a child
These are the nights that never die
My father told me
(Hey, hey)
(Hey, hey)
Oooh, oooh
(Hey, hey)

[Outro]
These are the nights that never die
My father told me
(Hey, hey)
(Hey, hey)
Oooh, oooh
(Hey, hey)
Oooh, oooh
(Hey, hey)
(Hey, hey)
(Hey, hey)
Oooh, oooh
(Hey, hey)
My father told me
When the night
Comes falling in your eyes
And you rain your love of me
I feel your heartbeat
Beating next to mine
There's nothing more for me
Let it beat...
When it's alright
The feeling is so good
And when it's alright
I know my heart is understood
And when it's alright
There's nothing I can do
But give my life to you
When it's alright...
When it's alright...
When it's alright...
When it's alright
The feeling is so good
And when it's alright
I know my heart is understood
And when it's alright
There's nothing I can do
But give my life to you
When the morning
Comes dawning in your eyes
And you rain your love of me
While I am as helpless
As a cloud up in the sky
You push away my fears
And now you're here
And when it's alright
The feeling is so good
And when it's alright
I know my heart is understood
And when it's alright
There's nothing I can do
But give my life to you
When it's alright
When it's alright...
When it's alright...
The feeling is so good
And when it's alright...
And when it's alright
The feeling is so good
And when it's alright
I know my heart is understood
And when it's alright
There's nothing I can do
But give my life to you
And when it's alright
The feeling is so good
I know my heart is understood
There's nothing I can do
But give my life to you
Moments I make momentarily mine
Are moments I take a step back in time
Each step that I take is leading me to
A time when I felt closer to you
Moments I gain, moments I lose
I'm just killing time trying to find
What we had once has been left behind
Here we both stand as it slips through our hands
Moments we care a little too much
Moments we care are never enough
Clinging to pride, our heads held high
What we truly feel is pushed to the side
Moments we gain are moments we lose
We're just killing time trying to find
What we had once has been left behind
Yet we stand as it slips through our hands
We know we can
We can survive
Survive before
That comes be before pride
That comes before pride
I'll be just killing time
What we had once has been left behind
And here we stand as it slips through our hands
Moments we gain and moments we lose

[Intro: Ty Dolla $ign & YG]

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Know you hate, I should motivate
I got more to make, sorry for the wait, know your place
Say she love the taste, y'all don't wanna race
My new whip straight from outer space
New bitch bad, yours outta shape
I know why they mad, 'cause they down bad
She call you her nigga, but she call me daddy
Wonder why I'm always postin' shit online laughin'
You be posted up on IG sad
Puff, puff, pass, shawty so bad
Had to get her number, she had so much ass
Give good brain, but she don't go to class
Drink it out the bottle, she don't want no glass
My bankroll's bigger than your man's (Yeah, yup)
My watch look sicker than your man's (Yeah, yup)
If I ain't take time just to flex, girl, I wouldn't be the nigga that I am
Haha

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign, Wiz Khalifa & Megan Thee Stallion]

[Verse 2: Megan Thee Stallion]
I'm poppin' tags, I ain't taggin' hoes, rich, what I'm mad for?
I don't wanna fight, but if you run up, then I'm draggin' hoes
Why you think I want your boo? Who the fuck you talkin' to?
I would never ever fuck a nigga who would fuck with you (Ew)
Bitch, I'm expensive, my hair and nails cost a ticket
You wanna fuck with me, book me, you talkin' shit, but ain't at me (Huh?)
And I ain't droppin' no addy, you can't know where I live
I got a whole lot of cheese and I don't need rats at the crib (Ah)
I'm a bad bitch (Yeah), and you a mad bitch (Ugh)
Put the baddest bitch next to Megan, I make her average
Bitch, I'm in a drop-top coupe goin' fast in it (Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt)
Rich nigga get behind me, I'ma put my back in it (Baow, baow, baow)
I got him real heated (Yeah)
I know he wanna fuck me, but I only let him eat it (Mwah)
And every time he send a long text, I never read it (Huh)
I see how hard she tryin', but your girl could never be me
Ah, mwah

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
Stackin' my paper up, no, I ain't make enough
Won't let these niggas up, smoke when I'm wakin' up
No, I ain't fake enough, money, I'm rakin' up
Time, I ain't takin' up, got your girl bakin' up
Your bed, she makin' up, my crib, I'm takin' up
Pillow, her face in it, whole lot of space in it
My car, I'm racin' it, crash and replacin' it
Don't want the basics in, smokin' and facin' it
Came from the bottom, I know where the basement is
Real G's move in silence, my niggas are dangerous
Smoke every day and I don't miss a plane
Stack everythin', at the club, make it rain
Got a new broad and she gettin' me paid
Fuck niggas hate, guess that come with the game

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Got a new car and a bustdown
I was down bad, but I'm up now
And I puff loud when I come 'round
And we just met, she in love now
I'm a straight player, I don't cuff now
I get to the bag, I just run 'round
I'm on KK, I need one pound
When I call a play, it's a touchdown
I'ma beat it down, money, need a pile of it
Blowin' strong and I even fly with it
Team that I'm with, they don't violate it
Got a man, but she couldn't hide in it
Say she can't get enough, late night, I hit her up
Smokin', not drinkin', so I'm 'bout to pick her up
Had me one rolled soon as her nigga left
Like when I choke her, don't let her get her breath

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa & Quavo]
Stackin' my paper up, no, I ain't make enough
Won't let these niggas up, smoke when I'm wakin' up
No, I ain't fake enough, money, I'm rakin' up
Time, I ain't takin' up, got your girl bakin' up
Your bed, she makin' up, my crib, I'm takin' up
Pillow, her face in it, whole lot of space in it
My car, I'm racin' it, crash and replacin' it
Don't want the basics in, smokin' and facin' it
Came from the bottom, I know where the basement is
Real G's move in silence, my niggas are dangerous
Smoke every day and I don't miss a plane
Stack everythin', at the club, make it rain
Got a new broad and she gettin' me paid
Fuck niggas hate, guess that come with the game (Quavo, woah)

[Verse 2: Quavo]
Connected, my Cookie, that's what Huncho rollin' up
Walk around Takeoff, do not kick his double cup
Offset so crazy, you might end up poured up (Pour 'em up)
Lookin' for your bitch, she out somewhere cuddled up
Circle is tight, look like a huddle-up
Tryna get right, young nigga double up (Double up)
I paid for the bitch to go get a new tummy tuck
Gang come in first, we don't run with runner-ups
Walk in the club with my motherfuckin' burner tucked (Burner tucked, grraow)
I am your leader, your favorite achiever
I bought the baguettes, the Pave is cheaper
Quavo Huncho, I'm trappin' with Wiz Khalifa

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
Stackin' my paper up, no, I ain't make enough
Won't let these niggas up, smoke when I'm wakin' up
No, I ain't fake enough, money, I'm rakin' up
Time, I ain't takin' up, got your girl bakin' up
Your bed, she makin' up, my crib, I'm takin' up
Pillow, her face in it, whole lot of space in it
My car, I'm racin' it, crash and replacin' it
Don't want the basics in, smokin' and facin' it
Came from the bottom, I know where the basement is
Real G's move in silence, my niggas are dangerous
Smoke every day and I don't miss a plane
Stack everythin', at the club, make it rain
Got a new broad and she gettin' me paid
Fuck niggas hate, guess that come with the game

[Outro]
(Jerm on the boards)

[Chorus: Logic]
Where is my mind? It's far away
Up in the sky, I'm high today
Break it on down, then we rollin' it up
I can see my house from up here
Who needs a jet when you're fly like me? Tell 'em
You don't need a jet to get high like me

[Refrain: Wiz Khalifa]
I started off slow, but I finally made it
No matter the cost, chances I'm takin'
Ride with my dawgs, no, we ain't fakin'
Travel the world, countin' up faces
Jump in my car, roll up and face it
No, I don't call, I'm on her faces
All of 'em model, none of 'em basic
Girl, I'm a star, look in amazement

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Top of the game, that's where my place is
Started off small, runnin' from cases
Can't take it back, I can't erase it
Money got long, I'm tryna chase it
Puffin' the J, I wanna get paid
It's one and the same, but that's every day
I'm livin' my life as real as I say
I spent it all once, so I'm tryna save
I'm rollin' that dank, she pourin' that drank
I'm out of my brain, weed got me all faded
Lovin' my life, I'm never gon' trade it
I want success, don't wanna be famous
Know how to stay on your grind, it's contagious
Rollies with diamonds for time that it's takin'
People these days, they easily change
But I stay the same 'cause life's what you make it

[Refrain: Wiz Khalifa]
I started off slow, but I finally made it
No matter the cost, chances I'm takin'
Ride with my dawgs, no, we ain't fakin'
Travel the world, countin' up faces
Jump in my car, roll up and face it
No, I don't call, I'm on her faces
All of 'em model, none of 'em basic
Girl, I'm a star, look in amazement

[Chorus: Logic]
Where is my mind? It's far away
Up in the sky, I'm high today
Break it on down, then we rollin' it up
I can see my house from up here
Who needs a jet when you're fly like me? Tell 'em
You don't need a jet to get high like me

[Verse 2: Logic]
From the sun up to the sundown
No, we never come down
Bobby Boy loud when he come around
Drivin' down Malibu
Stay driven like the valet do, I be cruisin'
Steady winnin', but I'm playin' like I'm losin'
I know that this shit can be confusin'
Talkin' rap, talkin' life, talkin' choosin'
Money over happiness, abusin'
Losin' your mind, losin' your heart
Second that I wake up, I feel like this world just wants to tear me apart
But I don't
Let it get me down, let it fuck me up
What my therapist say
They don't matter, no way

[Refrain: Wiz Khalifa]
I started off slow, but I finally made it
No matter the cost, chances I'm takin'
Ride with my dawgs, no, we ain't fakin'
Travel the world, countin' up faces
Jump in my car, roll up and face it
No, I don't call, I'm on her faces
All of 'em model, none of 'em basic
Girl, I'm a star, look in amazement

[Intro: Wiz Khalifa]
Haha
Hahaha
Yeah

But you know I heard that before, though, right?
(d.a. got that dope)
Uh

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
How she know what to do with the pack when she keep sayin' that she don't smoke? (Keep sayin' that she don't smoke)
Why her clothes smell like kush when she keep sayin' that she don't smoke? (Keep sayin' that she don't smoke)
Why she got weed in her nails when she keep sayin' that she don't smoke? (Keep sayin' that she don't smoke)
How she keep blowin' clouds in the air when she keep sayin' that she don't smoke? (Keep sayin' that she don't smoke)

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Pack too loud, pack too loud
Smell me in the club when I came through the crowd
Say we can't do it, rollin' up right now
Anything that I rock, niggas takin' my style
All white Benz, think snow gettin' plowed
She say I'm the realest nigga that she seen in a while
Blowin' this KK, it got me up in the clouds
I be wakin' and bakin', and me, I puff by the pound
Throwin' this money, they waitin' for it to come down
Fall in the spot where only real ones allowed
Start from the bottom, that mean we built from the ground
Don't want no problems, I want mils in my account
New whips, new shit for my house
Tell her take two puffs, kick her out
Say she roll with me, then she lyin' then
We ain't even have sex, we was vibin'

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa & K CAMP]
How she know what to do with the pack when she keep sayin' that she don't smoke? (Keep sayin' that she don't smoke)
Why her clothes smell like kush when she keep sayin' that she don't smoke? (Keep sayin' that she don't smoke)
Why she got weed in her nails when she keep sayin' that she don't smoke? (Keep sayin' that she don't smoke)
How she keep blowin' clouds in the air when she keep sayin' that she don't smoke? (Keep sayin' that she don't smoke, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2: K CAMP]
Roll the gas up (Roll it)
Fully loaded, what you waitin' on?
Ass up (Ass up)
She a freak, and that pussy, I can't pass up
Heard you lookin' for the vibe, should've asked us (Should've asked us)
For real (Yeah)
Yes, I need a Rollie for a walkthrough (Rollie for a walkthrough, yeah)
I don't give a fuck what he bought you (Fuck what he bought you, ooh)
Bought me a foreign, bought a watch too (Bought me a foreign, yeah)
I see you kickin' shit, but who taught you? (Hey)
Love that (Love)
Keep a bottle like I'm Tommy, I'm a Rugrat (Rug')
Throw the pussy 'til you found out where the love at (Love)
He got ten, I got ten, this a dub sack
Ayy, Wiz, let's get some more, fool (Haha)

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa & K CAMP]
How she know what to do with the pack when she keep sayin' that she don't smoke? (RARE Gang, keep sayin' that she don't smoke)
Why her clothes smell like kush when she keep sayin' that she don't smoke? (Keep sayin' that she don't smoke)

[Spoken Intro]
Hey Damon, Damon! Is that you, man?
Hey, what's, what's happenin'?
What it is, what it is!
What you into man? I see you got a heavy ride, all clean ...
Yeah I just copped man, just copped, you know, like hey, dig it!

What you got? What is it?
Mm, dig it man, you just take this and it's a brand new experience!
Nah, nuh-uh, it ain't me man, you know

Everything will be alright tomorrow
(Everything will be alright tomorrow)
Come on man, just take it, it's really hip, I mean, i tried it, I tried it, it's cool
(Everything will be alright tomorrow)

[Verse 1]
Melting colours
That paint a picture of a new day in my mind
That I can't find at the present time, mmm
Reaching out and touching nothing
A feeling I've never felt before
(Pacing, racing, and chasing myself)
In a room without a floor or door

[Chorus]
Hurry tomorrow
Tomorrow, I need you now
Hurry tomorrow
Tomorrow, I need you now

[Verse 2]
I'm goin' down, down, down
I'm goin' round
Where am I now? (Where am I now?)
The world is crumbling down
I'm laughing, I'm crying
But I still can't hear a sound

[Chorus]
Hurry tomorrow, please
Tomorrow, I need you now
Oh, hurry tomorrow
Tomorrow, I need you now

[Verse 3]
Good morning sunshine
(Or is it rain? It's hard to tell without windows)
I'm hurting all over
But I can't feel the pain
Screaming sounds of silence
Pound against the walls of my mind
The sun's shinin' in the middle of the night
I'm locked in, and tomorrow's nowhere in sight

[Chorus]
Hurry tomorrow, hmm
Tomorrow, I need you now
Hurry tomorrow
Tomorrow, I need you now

Hurry tomorrow, mmm
Tomorrow, I need you now
Hurry tomorrow
Tomorrow, I need you now

(You better hurry)
Hurry tomorrow, mmm
Tomorrow, I need you now (Body's filled with pain)
Hurry tomorrow (Don't you know I forgot my name)
Tomorrow, I need you now

Hurry tomorrow (Why don't you hurry tomorrow?)
Tomorrow, I need you now (Ooh, hurry, hurry, hurry)
Hurry tomorrow (Please, please, please, please)
Tomorrow, I need you now (Somebody bring me down)

Hurry tomorrow (Bring me down)
Tomorrow, I need you now
Hurry tomorrow (Body's racked in a whole lotta pain)
Tomorrow, I need you now
Hurry tomorrow (Can't you see?)
Tomorrow, I need you now (Bring me down)
Hurry tomorrow
Tomorrow, I need you now

Hurry tomorrow (Somebody, somebody)
Tomorrow, I need you now
Hurry tomorrow (Won't you come and help me now)
Tomorrow, I need you now

Hurry tomorrow

Hurry tomorrow
Tomorrow, I need you now

Hurry tomorrow
Tomorrow, I need you now
Hurry tomorrow
Tomorrow, I need you now

Hurry tomorrow
Tomorrow, I need you now
Hurry tomorrow
Tomorrow, I need you now

[Verse 1]
Sometimes in our lives, we all have pain
We all have sorrow
But if we are wise
We know that there's always tomorrow

[Chorus]
Lean on me when you're not strong
And I'll be your friend, I'll help you carry on
Won't, it won't be long
But I'm gonna need somebody to lean on

[Verse 2]
You just call on me brother when you need a hand
We all need somebody to lean on
I just might have a problem that you'll understand
Hey, we all need somebody to lean on

[Verse 3]
Good morn or evening, friends
Here's your friendly announcer
I have serious news to pass on to everybody
What I'm about to say
Could mean the world's disaster
Could change your joy and laughter
To tears and pain

[Chorus]
It's that love's in need of love today
Don't delay, send yours in right away
Hate's goin' 'round breakin' many hearts
Stop, stop it, stop it, please before it's gone too far

[Outro]
People, let's give the world love

[Verse 1]
When it rains, it pours
But you didn't even notice
It ain't rainin' anymore
It's hard to breathe when all you know is
The struggle of stayin' above the risin' water line

[Chorus]
Well, the skies have finally opened
The rain and wind stopped blowin'
And you're stuck out in the same ol' storm again
You hold tight to your umbrella
But, darlin', I'm just tryin' to tell ya
That there's always been a rainbow hangin' over your head

[Verse 2]
If you could see what I see
Yeah, you'd be blinded by the colors
Yellow, red, and orange, and green
And at least a million others
So tie up the boat, take off your coat, and take a look around

[Chorus]
'Cause the skies have finally opened
The rain and wind stopped blowin'
But you're stuck out in the same ol' storm again
You hold tight to your umbrella
But, darlin', I'm just tryin' to tell ya
That there's always been a rainbow hangin' over your head
Yeah, there's always been a rainbow hangin' over your head

[Outro]
Hmm
It'll all be alright

[Spoken Outro]
It's gonna be alright, everybody
Stay strong and stay inside

[Verse 1]
You could never know what it's like
Your blood, like winter, freezes just like ice
There's a cold, lonely light that shines from you
You'll wind up like the wreck you hide behind that mask you use

[Verse 2]
And did you think this fool would never win?
Look at me, I'm a-coming back again
Got a taste of love in a simple way
You need to know while I'm still standing
You just fade away

[Chorus]
You know I'm still standing better than I ever did
Looking like a true survivor, feeling like a little kid
I'm still standing after all this time
Picking up the pieces of my life without you on my mind
I'm still standing, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm still standing, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 3]
Once, I never coulda hoped to win
You starting down a road and leaving me again
The threats you made were meant to cut me down
And if our love was just a circus, you'd be a clown by now

[Chorus]
You know I'm still standing better than I ever did
Looking like a true survivor, feeling like a little kid
I'm still standing after all this time
Picking up the pieces of my life without you on my mind
I'm still standing, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm still standing, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Outro]
I'm still standing, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm still standing, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm still standing, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
The buttons of my coat were tangled in my hair
In doctor's office lighting, I didn't tell you I was scared
That was the first time we were there
Holy orange bottles, each night, I pray to you
Desperate people find faith, so now I pray to Jesus too
And I say to you...

[Chorus]
Ooh-ah
Soon, you'll get better
Ooh-ah
Soon, you'll get better
Ooh-ah
You'll get better soon
'Cause you have to

[Verse 2]
I know delusion when I see it in the mirror
You like the nicer nurses, you make the best of a bad deal
I just pretend it isn't real
I'll paint the kitchen neon, I'll brighten up the sky
I know I'll never get it, there's not a day that I won't try
And I say to you...

[Chorus]
Ooh-ah
Soon, you'll get better
Ooh-ah
Soon, you'll get better
Ooh-ah
You'll get better soon
'Cause you have to

[Bridge]
And I hate to make this all about me
But who am I supposed to talk to?
What am I supposed to do
If there's no you?

[Pre-Chorus]
This won't go back to normal, if it ever was
It's been years of hoping, and I keep saying it because
'Cause I have to

[Chorus]
Ooh
You'll get better
Ooh
You'll get better
Ooh-ah
You'll get better soon
'Cause you have to

[Verse]
People, people who need people
Are the luckiest people in the world
We're children, needing other children
And yet letting our grown-up pride
Hide all the need inside
Acting more like children, than children
Lovers are very special people
They’re the luckiest people in the world
One person
One very special person
A feeling deep in your soul
Says you were half, now you're whole

[Chorus]
No more hunger and thirst
But first, be a person who needs people
People who need people
Are the luckiest people in the world

[Intro]
(I'll remember that, I'll remember that)
(I'll remember that, that I)
(I'll remember that, I'll remember that)
(I'll remember that, that I)

[Verse 1]
I walk the downtown, hear my sound
No one knows me yet, not right now
But I am bound to set this feeling in motion
I walk the downtown, hear my sound

[Pre-Chorus]
I say that I want it, want it (Be free)
Don't fight it, fight it
But if I'm gonna go for it
I'll remember that, that
I say that I want it, want it (Be free)
Don't fight it, fight it
But if I'm gonna go for it
I'll remember that, that I

[Chorus]
I'm not nothing without a steady hand
I'm not nothing unless I know I can
I'm still something if I don't got a man
I'm a free woman, oh-oh (Be free)

[Post-Chorus]
Oh yeah
(Be free)

[Verse 2]
This is my dancefloor I fought for
A heart, that's what I'm livin' for
So light up my body and kiss me too hardly
We own the downtown, hear our sound

[Pre-Chorus]
I say that I want it, want it (Be free)
Don't fight it, fight it
But if I'm gonna go for it
I'll remember that, that
I say that I want it, want it (Be free)
Don't fight it, fight it
But if I'm gonna go for it
I'll remember that, that I

[Chorus]
I'm not nothing without a steady hand (I'm a free woman)
I'm not nothing unless I know I can (I'm a free woman)
I'm still something if I don't got a man
I'm a free woman, oh-oh (Be free; c'mon, woo)

[Post-Chorus]
I'm a free woman
I'm a free woman (Be free)
I'm a free woman
I'm a free woman, oh-oh (Be free)
Oh yeah (I'm a free woman)

[Chorus]
I'm not nothing without a steady hand (I'm a free woman)
I'm not nothing unless I know I can (I'm a free woman)
I'm still something if I don't got a man
I'm a free woman (Oh), oh-oh (Be free)
Girl's muscles in my bones
But I'm too poor to pay the penance
You know the cadilac's her man
But I don't have a licence

I drive, I'm mean
Boys that I choose
Never come out clean

I doubt you are sleeping
And dreaming of me on your own
I'm thinking about the ways
I can hurt you so don't
Don't, don't, don't

Don't open my eyes
Don't let her out
She's not nice

Yeah, my little rapture
Open up and maybe I'll capture it
Yeah, you met your match, sir
You know you've met the master heartbreaker
Oh this devil in my mouth
And when we kiss I'll pull him out
I think my love is sworn
Up with my rose with stinging thorns

I kiss, I'm mean
Boys like you
They never come out clean

And while you are cursing
And crying 'cause I sent you home
I'm thinking about the ways
I can hurt you so don't
Don't, don't, don't

Don't open my eyes
Don't let her out
She's not nice

Yeah, my little rapture
Open up and maybe I'll capture it
Yeah, you met your match, sir
You know you've met the master heartbreaker

Huh, huh huh, huh
I'm thinking about the ways
I can hurt you so don't
Don't, don't, huh, huh, huh
Don't open my eyes
Don't let her out
She's, no, she's not nice

Yeah, my little rapture
Open up and maybe I'll capture it
Yeah, you met your match, sir
You know you've met the master heartbreaker
Heartbreaker, heartbreaker, heartbreaker

[Intro: Mos Def]
I'm not sure anymore, more
Who is knocking at my door, door
All the faces that I know
Ja make them so sunny and true

[Chorus: Mos Def]
I don't wanna say goodbye, to you
So I'll just say good night, to you
My people, no goodbyes to you
I'm just gon' say good night

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Uh
Good night
Right now I can see it so vivid
Like it was just yesterday, like I could relive it
Me and my grandparents on a field trip
And I'm the little kid tryna touch the exhibits
But it'll fade before I get to get a hold of that
Man, I wish I could stop time like a photograph
Every joke that they told I'd know to laugh
Man (man), I wouldn't let a moment pass
What do it mean when you dream that you fallin'?
What do it mean when you dream that you ballin'?
What do it mean when you never dream at all then
And you don't really know 'cause you can't recall them?
It's sorta fly you get a chance to say hi to
People you never got a chance to say bye to
Maybe you could pull em up outta your dreams
Into real life (real life), if you try to
So close (so close), but so far (but so far)
And so far (and so far), no cigar (no cigar)
We can't dwell on the past, all we got is today
So I'ma live like it's no tomorrow, no goodbyes

[Chorus: Mos Def]
I don't wanna say goodbye, to you
So I'll just say good night, to you
My people, no goodbyes to you
I'm just gon' say good night

[Verse 2: Al Be Back]
Uh, to you
If I part, my art will live through you
Dream beautiful and unusual
Wake up like every day new to you
Stay true to you, a hood musical
My art will live through you
Dream beautiful and unusual
Wake up like every day new to you
Stay true to you, a hood musical

[Chorus: Mos Def]
I don't wanna say goodbye, to you
So I'll just say good night, to you
My people, no goodbyes to you
I'm just gon' say good night

[Outro: Mos Def]
I'm not sure anymore, more
Who is knocking at my door, door
All the faces that I know
Ja make them so sunny and true
I'm not sure anymore, more

[Verse 1]
Okay
Chillin' for an hour, smokin' weed, watchin' Worldstar
Benz in the garage, pro'bly gotta drive your girl car
You ain't a rapper if my homies never heard y'all
I just spit a punchline, smile then they bird call (Brr)
Hit your sister in the face with a Nerf Ball
Dealin' with some shit that really don't concern y'all
Punch a fan if he get a fucking word wrong
Wavy, givin' you some shit that you can surf on

[?] findin' me a bitch I can swerve on
Frank Thomas, homie, 'bout to put the hurt on
Your bitch a night light, in bed she turned on
I roll some weed, tell her burn one, burn one

[Vocal Sampling: DJ ClockWork]

[Verse 2]
Okay
I used to give a fuck about success
Now I just want to see Mila Kunis undress
Hope she down for butt sex, it would be a cum fest
Uh, sorry, that's some shit I had to confess
Crazy-ass bitch doing 911 threats
Came in the game smoking Newport Hundreds
Now I'm at the top and the crown fit, gold on my outfit
Surrounded by the pussy I'ma—Pat
You got that wet pack, bitch, come and gimme that
You know we wanna know where them titties at
Got 'em gassed, they be askin' what I'm cooking wit'
Have your little brother ask your moms what a pussy is
Corruption, stunting at the function
Your girl pussy smell like Sour Cream & Onion
Woo, pay attention, you gon' learn somethin'
Roll that weed up, and then we burn one

[Vocal Sampling: DJ ClockWork]

[Verse 3]

[?]
On the playground is where I spent most of my days
Chilling out, maxing, relaxing all cool
And all shooting some b-ball outside of the school
When a couple of guys, they were up to no good
They started making trouble in my neighborhood
I got in one little fight and my mom got scared
And said "You're moving with your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air"
I whistled for a cab and when it came near
The license plate said 'Fresh' and it had dice in the mirror
If anything I could say that this cab was rare
But I thought "Nah, forget it, yo, Holmes, to Bel-Air!"

[Chant: Mac Miller & DJ ClockWork]
Hands up, said put your, said put your motherfucking
Hands up, put your motherfucking
Hands up, your hands up

[?] hands up, hands up, hands up, yo, yo
Get 'em up
Now get 'em up, motherfucker, put 'em up
Keep 'em up, 

[?] keep 'em up
London keep your hands in the air

[Intro]
Said people
People
People, said people
Said people, yeah
People, yeah
Said

[Verse 1]
People love you when they on your mind
A thought is love's currency
And I been thinkin' 'bout her all the time
I never seen somebody put together perfectly
Said, what would I have to do to call you mine?
Said, someone like you is so hard to find
You can open up your eyes, or you can walk in blind
All I ask is that you hurry, I won't hurt you, don't you worry
Listen to me, I'ma set you free
Yeah, he ain't gonna break your heart again
Said, go through the worst to reach the ecstasy
When your imagination's on pretend
I never thought that it would feel this way
You never taught me how to heal the pain
I wish you caught me on a different day
When it was easier to be happy

[Chorus 1]
Just a little taste and you know she got you
Can you hide away? Can you hide away?
Sound of silence as they all just watch you
I kinda find it strange how the times have changed
But I wish we could go and be
Free once, baby, you and me
And never come back again
Let's leave it all in the rear-view
Oh—whoa—oh—oh
Oh—whoa—oh—oh—oh
Said, leave it all in the rear-view
Girl, you don't have to cry

[Vocalisations]

[Verse 2]

[?]
Mend a broken heart, girl, if you can
Said, I don't expect you to be capable
Yeah, you got the world right in your hands
That responsibility is unescapable
Said, I promise that I'll be a different man
Please give me the chance to go and live again
I'm havin' some trouble, can you give a hand?
It seems perfection really is so unattainable
Yeah, don't even say you 'bout to end it all
Your life precious, ain't no need to go and kill yourself
And I'm not so sure that there's an end at all
I wish the truth would just reveal itself
Yeah, who do you call to make it to the top?
And who do you call to make the shootin' stop?
And who do you call to give the coupe a wash?
After everything I did I think I'm still myself

[Chorus 2]
Just a little taste and you know she got you
Can you hide away? Can you hide away?
Sound of silence as they all just watch you
I kinda find it strange how the times have changed
But I wish we could go and be
Free once, baby, you and me
I said, we could change the world forever
And never come back again
And let's leave it all in the rear-view
Oh—whoa—oh—oh
Oh—whoa—oh—oh—oh
Said, leave it all in the rear-view
Girl, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh—whoa—oh—oh
It's all in the rear-view, girl
Oh—whoa—oh—oh, oh—whoa—oh
Said, leave it all in the rear-view, girl
Yeah, you don't have to cry
You don't have to cry

Afternoon and you're out for a break
By the shore by the blue wall
Rollercoasters and a Coca-Cola
Honey, I would hate to see you go

[Intro]
Hello

[Verse 1]
I'm so bored (Woo)
Wake up late, eat some cereal
Try my best to be physical
Lose myself in a TV show
Staring out to oblivion
All my friends are invisible
24/7, miss 'em all
I might cry like a waterfall
I feel afraid when I feel alone, yeah, uh
Have sex, me and my Romeo
He says I'm irresistible
I'm gassed up like I'm Texaco
I ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride it
Sometimes, I feel okay, some days, I'm so frightened

[Chorus]
I want anthems
Late nights, my friends, New York
I sleep, wanna wake up brand new
I sleep, wanna wake up with you (You)
I want anthems
Late nights, my friends, New York
Finally, when it's over
We might be even closer, uh, uh

[Verse 2]
Uh, uh, uh, uh
These days exhausting
Uh, uh, uh, uh
Go online shopping
I'm so uninspired, I just wanna breathe
Flowers and the trees, dirt all on my knees
Got some hands to hold on to
I get existential and so strange
I hear no sounds when I'm shouting
I just wanna go to parties
Up high, wanna feel the heat from all the bodies

[Chorus]
I want anthems
Late nights, my friends, New York
I sleep, wanna wake up brand new
I sleep, wanna wake up with you (You)
I want anthems
Late nights, my friends, New York
Finally, when it's over
We might be even closer, uh, uh

[Bridge]
We might, we might, we might, we might, we might
We might, we might, we might, we might, we might
We might, we might, we might, we might, we might
Yeah

[Chorus]
I want anthems
Late nights, my friends, New York
I sleep, wanna wake up brand new

We might be even closer, uh, uh

People worship these idols 'til they come in contact with Gods
Hoes is all my disciples, you get mind fucked with these broads
Life is just a recital, better 'member all that you practiced
When I die, throw a couple bad bitches in my casket, whoa
Think it's time for a revolution, me and my dogs 'bout to start a riot
Still they sleeping but I'm eating, you and your people are on a diet
Tim Allen off Home Improvement, 'telligent but we going stupid
This the new shit, hit the strip club, see some hoes that I went to school with
Out in London like Lennox Lewis, bitch looking like Farrah Fawcett
I'm just tryna make better music, get this money, share the profits
Now this class gettin' led by students, smoke some weed, get head while I do it
Started out under the ground, they didn't fuck with me, now they all coming around
Money, I'm hunting it down, planting the seeds, working and watching it grow
I got so many ways I can make money, I'll always be straight, I just thought you should know

Been on my grind, taking what's mine, I got my eyes on the throne
I'ma be fine, no matter the time, we all go along with the—said

[Chorus]

Lookin' at my life, it's like you watchin' movies
Said, lookin' at my life, it's like you watchin' movies
Lookin' at my, okay, here we go

[Verse 2]
People worship these idols 'til they come in contact with Gods
Hoes is all my disciples, you get mind fucked with these broads
Life is just a recital, better 'member all that you practiced
When I die, throw a couple bad bitches in my casket, whoa
Fuck a day job, fuck a day job, got ya bitch here in just a tank top
Getting paid, roll my face off, bitch you're bank fraud: Bernie Madoff
Educate y'all then erase y'all, LL Cool J without the Kangol

This bitch love me long time, don't know why she wouldn't
Say my D could win the Heisman, yeah, I'm Charles Woodson
Couple million off a tour, thats a lot of bookings
My bitches gorgeous looking, imported from the shore to Brooklyn
Coming from out of the 'Burgh, bitch, I'm absurd, fuck you, I hope you insured
Hating? I'll give you just what you deserve, that's my word, put it on all that I'm worth

[Refrain]
Been on my grind, taking what's mine, I got my eyes on the throne

Lookin' at my life, it's like you watchin' movies
Lookin' at my life, it's like you watchin' movies
Lookin' at my life, it's like you watchin' movies

[Verse 1]
My lover's got humor
She's the giggle at a funeral
Knows everybody's disapproval
I should've worshiped her sooner
If the heavens ever did speak
She's the last true mouthpiece
Every Sunday's getting more bleak
A fresh poison each week
"We were born sick"
You heard them say it
My church offers no absolutes
She tells me, "Worship in the bedroom"
The only Heaven I'll be sent to
Is when I'm alone with you
I was born sick, but I love it
Command me to be well

[Pre-Chorus]
Amen, Amen, Amen, Amen

[Chorus]
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
And good God, let me give you my life
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
And good God, let me give you my life

[Verse 2]
If I'm a pagan of the good times
My lover's the sunlight
To keep the goddess on my side
She demands a sacrifice
Drain the whole sea
Get something shiny
Something meaty for the main course
That's a fine looking high horse
What you got in the stable?
We've a lot of starving faithful
That looks tasty
That looks plenty
This is hungry work

[Chorus]
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
And good God, let me give you my life
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me my deathless death
And good God, let me give you my life

[Bridge]
No masters or kings when the ritual begins
There is no sweeter innocence than our gentle sin
In the madness and soil of that sad earthly scene
Only then I am human
Only then I am clean

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, Amen, Amen, Amen

[Chorus]
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
And good God, let me give you my life
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
And good God, let me give you my life

[Chorus]
I don't wanna think about nothing
Just watching you dancing
Feel like the beginning of something

In the end, in the end
All I wanna do is just fall in
I don't wanna think about nothing

Everybody got so much to say
Every time we pushing away
Everyday, a new reason to stay

'Cause we got a big love
Won't ever give it up
We got a one-way ticket love
We ain't going no place but up
Nothing can stop this, no one can top us
We got a bigger love

I don't wanna think about nothing
The world feels like it's crumbling
Everyday, another new something
But in the end, in the end
Can't nobody do us in
I just wanna think about loving

'Cause we got a bigger love
Won't ever give it up
We got a one-way ticket love
We ain't going no place but up
Nothing can stop this, no one can top us
We got a bigger love

We got a bigger love
Won't ever give it up, no
We got a one-way ticket love
We ain't going no place but up
Nothing can stop this, no one can top us

Oh, we got a bigger love
Won't ever give it up
We got a one-way ticket love
We ain't going no place but up
Nothing can stop this, no one can top us

'Cause we got a bigger love
Oh, won't ever give it up, no
We got a one-way ticket love
We ain't going no place but up
Nothing can stop this, no one can top us
We got a bigger love

The days of wine and roses
Laugh and run away, ooh, like a child at play
Through a meadowland towards a closing door
A door marked "nevermore" that wasn't there before

Ooh, the lonely night discloses
Just a passing breeze, ooh, filled with memories
Of the golden smile that introduced me to
The days of wine and roses and you

[Instrumental break]

Just a passing breeze, it is filled with memories
Of the golden smile that introduced me to
The days of wine and roses and you
Thank you, thank you

God is my friend (God is love, God is love, God is love, God is love)
Yeah, and I know He's your friend, yeah (Love your mother, love your father, love your sister, love your brother)
Oh, Jesus is my friend (God is love, God is love, God is love, God is love)
And, I, I know He's wonderful (Love your mother, love your father, love your brother, love your brother)
He makes the winter blow, He makes it rain (God is love, God is love, love is God, love is God)
He makes the snowflakes fall, yeah (Love your father, love your father, love your sister, love your mother)
I know there's a God, don't deny it, hee (God is love, God is love, God is love, God is love)

[Verse 1]
Mercy, mercy me
Things ain't what they used to be, no no
Where did all the blue skies go?
Poison is the wind that blows from the north and south and east

[Verse 2]
Mercy, mercy me
Things ain't what they used to be, no no
Oil wasted on the ocean and upon our seas
Fish full of mercury

[Verse 3]
Mercy, mercy me
Things ain't what they used to be, no no
Radiation under ground and in the sky
Animals and birds who live nearby are dying

[Verse 4]
Mercy, mercy me
Things ain't what they used to be
What about this overcrowded land
How much more abuse from man can she stand?

[Intro]

People, we all got to come together
Because we need the strength, power and all the feeling

[Verse 1]
Wholy holy
Oh Lord, get together, one another

[Verse 1]
I don't know how to cry
Does anyone these days
Know what's real?
Won't you take me by the hand
I didn't want to feel
'Cause life felt too hard
Now it's all a game that I don't understand

[Chorus]
Wake up
Live someone else's dream
Smile, smile
'Cause they're all watching
Shakeup, shakedown
They can't hear you scream
Smile, smile
Can't you hear me sing?

[Verse 2]
I don't know how to feel
Does anyone these days
Even care if the next man is 'live or dead?
I didn't want to look
The daylight is too hard
I feel like somethings changed
But I can't understand

[Chorus]
Wake up
Live someone else's dream
Smile, smile
'Cause they're all watching
Shakeup, shakedown
They can't hear you scream
Smile, smile
Can't you hear me sing?

[Outro]
There’s something strange
In my brain
Thats coming through (And I never)
I hear your name
And my brain
Tears me in two

Here comes the big beat, big beat to blast ya'
No time to quit now, just time to get it now
Pick up what I'm puttin' down, pick up what I'm puttin' down

Uhh, Tired of chasing after objects in the rear view
Tired of praying when I don't know who I'm praying to
Tired of hoping like a penny with a hole in it
Tired of going when I got no one to go with it
Tired of reaching like a crab in a fucking nab
And motherfucker it was fuck it then, fuck it now
After 

[?] got the motherfucking budget down
So what the fuck is what your motherfucking budget now
They wanna kill me but death is too good for me
Tired of taking when I'm taking what they took from me
Tired of looking at the man in the mirror, man
Cause that motherfucker gon make me wanna kill a man...
Ahhh!

[Chorus: Shanell]
Doctor doctor why won't you answer
Before it's too late, Teacher, Preacher
Don't trust your weakness, Someone lead the way
Tryna make it home, Tryna make it home
Oh, tryna make it home, Tryna make it home

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
I know my greatest pain is in the future
I know I left a stain in a future
What do you wish for, What are you wishing for
It take too long for your wish to make it to the store
The well run guy, the town runs by
The spirits walk with me, I am silents cry
Pay the pastor, preachers profit from the prophesized
But ain't no proof in your prophecy

[Chorus: Shanell & (Lil Wayne)]
Doctor doctor why won't you answer, Before it's too late (Yeah!)
Teacher, Preacher, Don't trust your weakness

All blue money on me now because I'm paid (Blue, blue)
Bitches comin' on me now like I'm a gay (Yeah, yeah)
Got black diamonds on me now cause' I'm a ape (Yeah, yeah)

All that she wants is another baby
She's gone tomorrow, boy
All that she wants is another baby (Yeah)

[Verse 1]
Needed a fight as an excuse
To get away from me, you've misused
Sit there, make me look guilty
You will leave in anyway
But, with me
You have a career? I can't tell
I train you men so well
No more boosting your egos
Come on, you're smoking, what the hell knows

[Chorus]
All that she wants is another baby
She's gone tomorrow, boy
All that she wants is another baby (Yeah)
All that she wants is another baby
She's gone tomorrow, boy
All that she wants is another baby (Yeah)

[Verse 2]
No more chains that you gave me
Enough of pain, now I'm craving
Something sweet, so delight
How can you men stand sleeping at night?
The silly pattern that I followed
I saw my mama being swallowed
By the one, who she loved
He pulled her down, couldn't see up above
Manipulation was his key
He screwed it in, 'cause she was naive
We're not perfect, we must say
But, now I've got to run away

[Chorus]
All that she wants is another baby
She's gone tomorrow, boy
All that she wants is another baby (Yeah)
All that she wants is another baby
She's gone tomorrow, boy
All that she wants is another baby (Yeah)
All that she wants is another baby
She's gone tomorrow, boy
All that she wants is another baby (Yeah)
All that she wants is another baby
She's gone tomorrow, boy
All that she wants is another baby (Yeah)
Lyrics from Snippet:

[Verse]
Why you talk about me like I'm not there?
Why you talk about me like I can't hear?
You act so different around your friends
Why you talk about me like I'm not there?
Why you talk about me like I can't hear?
I know you know I'm more than skin

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I'm not a high score, I'm not a trophy
I'm not a girl in those high school movies
And I'm not down for manipulation
Not here to be your validation, no

[Chorus]
So if you need me
I'll be at the piano, love
'Cause I'm yours
But not like that

[Verse 1]
Sitting in my room
What’s it all about?
Feels like the world is gonna end
Before I figure her out
Drink up, my friend
My potion of emotion
Can you feel the love, the hate
The jealousy, the sheer confusion?

[Chorus]
'Cause I don't really know who I am
Or how to present that to you
I don't really know just who I am
I'm a rebel without a clue (Ooh, oh)

[Verse 2]
Let's sit
Watch the trains all derail
They want me to learn
Well, they can sit and watch me fail
Are my friends changing
Or is it in my mind?
Will I ever shake hands
With time? (Mmm)

[Chorus]
'Cause I don't really know who I am
Or how to present that to you
I don't really know just who I am
I'm a rebel without a clue (Ooh)
No, I don’t really know who I am
And now you want me to change
I don't really know what I am
Isn't everything just so strange?

[Outro]
Sitting in my room
What's it all about?

[Intro]
My name isn't Alice
But I'll keep looking, I'll keep looking for Wonderland
My name isn't Alice
But I'll keep looking, I'll keep looking for Wonderland, Wonderland
Ah, ah, ah, oh, ah, ah, ah (Ah)
Set me free (Ah-ah-ah)
Ah, ah, ah, oh, ah, ah, ah (Ah)
Set me free (Ah-ah-ah)

[Verse 1]
Could you pull me out of this alive?
(Ah, ah, ah, oh, ah, ah, ah)
Where's my body? I'm stuck in my mind
(Ah, ah, ah, oh, ah, ah, ah)

[Pre-Chorus]
(Oh ma-ma-ma, oh ma-ma-ma)
I'm tired of screaming
(Oh-ma-ma-ma, oh-ma-ma-ma)
At the top of my lungs
(Oh my mother, oh my mother)
I'm in the hole, I'm falling down, down
So down, down

[Chorus]
My name isn't Alice
But I'll keep looking, I'll keep looking for Wonderland
My name isn't Alice
But I'll keep looking, I'll keep looking for Wonderland, Wonderland

[Post-Chorus]
Take me home
Take me to Wonderland, Wonderland
Take me home
Take me to Wonderland, Wonderland

[Verse 2]
Sick and tired of waking up
Screaming at the top of my lungs
Think I might've just left myself behind
Maestro, play me your symphony
I will listen to anything
Take me on a trip, DJ, free my mind

[Chorus]
My name isn't Alice
But I'll keep looking, I'll keep looking for Wonderland
My name isn't Alice
But I'll keep looking, I'll keep looking for Wonderland, Wonderland

[Post-Chorus]
Take me home
Take me to Wonderland, Wonderland
Take me home
Take me to Wonderland, Wonderland
Take me home
Take me to Wonderland, Wonderland
Take me home
Take me to Wonderland, Wonderland

[Outro]
Ah, ah, ah, oh, ah, ah, ah, oh (Ah)
Set me free (Ah-ah-ah)
Ah, ah, ah, oh, ah, ah, ah, oh (Ah)
Set me free (Ah-ah-ah)

[Verse 1]
Feelin' something that I can't explain (Oh)
Think it's a wound I still entertain (Oh)
I'd do anything to numb the flame (Oh)
I guess I'm just on fire these days (Oh)

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't see straight, I can't see me
There's too much hurt caught in between
Wish I could be what I know I am
This moment's hijacked my plans

[Chorus]
I'm feelin' the way that I'm feelin', I'm feelin' with you (Ooh, ooh)
I stare at the girl in the mirror, she talks to me too
Yeah, I can see it in your face
You don't think I've pulled my weight
Maybe it's time for us to say goodbye 'cause
I'm feelin' the way that I'm feelin', I'm feelin' with you
I'm not havin' fun tonight

[Verse 2]
You love the paparazzi, love the fame
Even though you know it causes me pain
I feel like I'm in a prison hell
Stick my hands through the steel bars and yell

[Pre-Chorus]
What happens now? I'm not okay
And if I scream, you walk away
When I'm sad, you just wanna play
I've had enough, why do I stay?

[Chorus]
I'm feelin' the way that I'm feelin', I'm feelin' with you (Ooh, ooh)
I stare at the girl in the mirror, she talks to me too
Yeah, I can see it in your face
You don't think I've pulled my weight
Maybe it's time for us to say goodbye 'cause
I'm feelin' the way that I'm feelin', I'm feelin' with you
I'm not havin' fun tonight

[Bridge]
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
I'm not havin' fun tonight
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
I'm not havin' fun tonight

[Chorus]
Yeah, I can see it in your face
You don't think I've pulled my weight
Maybe it's time for us to say goodbye 'cause
I'm feelin' the way that I'm feelin', I'm feelin' with you
I'm not havin' fun tonight

[Verse 1]
Turnin' up emotional faders
Keep repeating self-hating phrases
I have heard enough of these voices
Almost like I have no choice
This is biological stasis
My mood's shifting to manic places
Wish I laughed and kept the good friendships
Watch life, here I go again

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't see me cry
Can't see me cry ever again (Ooh)
I can't see me cry
Can't see me cry, this is the end (Ooh)

[Chorus]
My biggest enemy is me, pop a 911
My biggest enemy is me, pop a 911
My biggest enemy is me ever since day one
Pop a 911, then pop another one

[Verse 2]
Keep my dolls inside diamond boxes
Save 'em 'til I know I'm gon' drop this
Front I've built around my oasis
Paradise is in my hands
Holdin' on so tight to this status
It's not real, but I'll try to grab it
Keep myself in beautiful places
Paradise is in my hands

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't see me cry
Can't see me cry ever again (Ooh)
I can't see me cry
Can't see me cry, this is the end (Ooh)

[Chorus]
My biggest enemy is me, pop a 911
My biggest enemy is me, pop a 911
My biggest enemy is me ever since day one
Pop a 911, then pop another one

[Bridge]
Pop, pop another one (Ooh)
Pop a 911, then pop another one (Ooh)

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't see me cry
Can't see me cry ever again (Ooh)
I can't see me cry
Can't see me cry, this is the end (Ooh)

[Chorus]
My biggest enemy is me, pop a 911
My biggest enemy is me, pop a 911
My biggest enemy is me ever since day one
Pop a 911, then pop another one

[Outro]
Please patch the line, please patch the line
Need a 911, can you patch the line?
Please patch the line, please patch the line
Need a 911, can you patch the line?

[Intro]
Am I E-I-E-I-E-I-E-I
Am I pl-plastic?
Pl-plastic do-o-o-o-oll
Pl-plastic, technologic

[Verse 1]
Open me up and cut me loose
I come with a purse and new shoes
Am I your type? Am I your type?
(Ooh la la, ooh la la, ooh, ooh, ooh la la)
I've lived in a pink box so long
I am top shelf, they built me strong
Am I your type? Am I your type?
(Ooh la la, ooh la la, ooh, ooh, ooh la la)

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I've spent too long
Dancing all alone
Dancing to the same song
I'm no toy for a real boy
(Ooh la la, ooh la la)
If you're a real boy

[Chorus]
Don't play with me
It just hurts me
I'm bouncin' off the walls
No, no, no, I'm not your plastic doll
(Your plastic doll)

[Verse 2]
I've got blonde hair and cherry lips
I'm state of art, I'm microchipped
Am I your type? Am I your type?
(Ooh la la, oh la la, ooh, ooh, ooh la la)

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I've spent too long
Dancing all alone
Dancing to the same song
I'm no toy for a real boy
(Ooh la la, ooh la la)
If you're a real boy

[Chorus]
Don't play with me
It just hurts me
I'm bouncin' off the walls
No, no, no, I'm not your plastic doll (Ooh la la)
Don't play with me
It just hurts me
I'm bouncin' off the walls
No, no, no, I'm not your plastic doll
(Your plastic doll)

[Bridge]
Tell me, who dressed you? Where'd you get that hat?
Why is she cryin'? What's the price tag?
Who's that girl, Malibu Gaga?
Looks so sad, what is this saga? (Oh)

[Chorus]
Don't play with me
It just hurts me
I'm bouncin' off the walls
No, no, no, I'm not your plastic doll
(Your plastic doll)
Don't play with me
It just hurts me
I'm bouncin' off the walls
No, no, no, I'm not your plastic doll

Pl-plastic, technologic (Ooh la la)

[Intro]
Am I, am I, am I
Am I, am I, am I

[Verse 1]
Am I still alive? Where am I? I cry
Who was it that pulled the trigger, was it you or I?
I'm completely numb, why you acting dumb?
I won't blame myself 'cause we both know you were the one

[Chorus]
I don't know what to do, you don't know what to say
The scars on my mind are on replay, r-replay
The monster inside you is torturing me
The scars on my mind are on replay, r-replay, eh-eh

[Post-Chorus]
Replay, r-replay, eh-eh
The scars on my mind are on replay, r-replay, eh-eh

[Verse 2]
Every single day, yeah, I dig a grave
Then I sit inside it, wondering if I'll behave
It's a game I play, and I hate to say
You're the worst thing and the best thing that's happened to me

[Chorus]
I don't know what to do, you don't know what to say
The scars on my mind are on replay, r-replay
The monster inside you is torturing me
The scars on my mind are on replay, r-replay, eh-eh

[Post-Chorus]
Replay, r-replay, eh-eh
The scars on my mind are on replay, r-replay, eh-eh

[Bridge]
Psychologically, it's something that I can't explain
Scratch my nails into the dirt to pull me out okay
Does it matter, does it matter? Damage is done
Does it matter, does it matter? You had the gun
You had the gun
You had the gun
You had the gun

[Chorus]
I don't know what to do, you don't know what to say
The scars on my mind are on replay, r-replay
The monster inside you is torturing me
The scars on my mind are on replay, r-replay, eh-eh

[Outro]
Your monsters torture me
Your monsters torture me
Your monsters torture me
The scars on my mind are on replay, r-replay, eh-eh

[Verse 1]
I need you to listen to me, please believe me
I'm completely lonely, please don't judge me
When your tears are falling, I'll catch them as they fall
I need you to listen to me, please don't leave me
I'm not perfect yet, but I'll keep trying
When your tears are falling, I'll catch them as they fall

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause inside, we are really made the same (Oh)
In life, waiting's just a stupid game (Oh)

[Chorus]
Lift me up, give me a start
'Cause I've been flying with some broken arms
Lift me up, just a small nudge
And I'll be flying like a thousand doves

[Post-Chorus]
A thousand do-o-o-o-o-oves
Oh (Doves)
A thousand do-o-o-o-o-oves
Oh (Doves)

[Verse 2]
I'd do anything for you to really see me
I am human, invisibly bleeding
When your smile is shaking, I'll catch you as you fall

[Pre-Chorus]
I cry more than I ever say (Oh)
Each time, your love seems to save the day (Oh)

[Chorus]
Lift me up, give me a start
'Cause I've been flying with some broken arms
Lift me up, just a small nudge
And I'll be flying like a thousand doves

[Post-Chorus]
A thousand do-o-o-o-o-oves
Oh (Doves)
A thousand do-o-o-o-o-oves
Oh (Doves)

[Bridge]
I've been hurting, stuck inside a cage
So hard my heart's been in a rage
If you love me, then just set me free
And if you don't, then baby, leave
Set me free

[Chorus]
Lift me up, give me a start
'Cause I've been flying with some broken arms
Lift me up, just a small nudge
And I'll be flying like a thousand doves

[Post-Chorus]
A thousand do-o-o-o-o-oves (Flying, flying)
Oh (Flying like a thousand doves)
A thousand do-o-o-o-o-oves (Flying, flying)
Oh (Flying like a thousand doves)
Flying, flying, flying like a thousand doves
Flying, flying, flying (Doves)

[Intro]
Would you love me right?

[Verse 1]
My life is a story
Do you wanna know the truth?
I'm tall in high heels
But I am only five foot two
What you see ain't always
What you gonna get, it's true
You see the best in me
Even when I have no clue

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't wanna feel this way no more
I don't wanna feel this weight
I'm sick of hiding from myself
I don't wanna feel this pain
I don't wanna run far from my home
I don't wanna lose my way
I don't wanna be my friend no more
I don't wanna play this game

[Chorus]
Would you still love me if I gave it all up just to cry?
Would you still love me?
Would, would you still love me right?
Would you still need me if I didn't t-tell you goodbye?
Would you still love me?
Would, would you still love me right?

[Verse 2]
Take my picture from me
And imagine what I'd do
I know what's best for me
Tryna do what's best for you
This could all be fiction
I know that it sounds taboo
I wear my heart on my sleeve
It's making its debut

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't wanna feel this way no more
I don't wanna feel this weight
I'm sick of hiding from myself
I don't wanna feel this pain
I don't wanna run far from my home
I don't wanna lose my way
I don't wanna be my friend no more
I don't wanna play this game

[Chorus]
Would you still love me if I gave it all up just to cry?
Would you still love me?
Would, would you still love me right?
Would you still need me if I didn't t-tell you goodbye?
Would you still love me?
Would, would you still love me right?

[Outro]
Would you still love me right?
Would you still love me right?
Would you still love me right?
Would you still love me right?

[Verse 1]
I need you to listen to me, please believe me
I'm completely lonely, please don't judge me
When your tears are falling, I'll catch them as they fall
I need you to listen to me, please don't leave me
I'm not perfect yet, but I'll keep trying
When your tears are falling, I'll catch them as they fall

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause inside, we are really made the same
In life, waiting's just a stupid game

[Chorus]
Lift me up, give me a start
'Cause I've been flying with some broken arms
Lift me up, just a small nudge
And I'll be flying like a thousand doves

[Post-Chorus]
Flying like a thousand, flying like two thousand
Flying like ten thousand doves
Flying like a thousand, flying like two thousand
Flying like ten thousand doves

[Verse 2]
I'd do anything if you would just believe me
I am human, invisibly bleeding
When your smile is shaking, I'll catch you as you fall
If I had a painter's mind, then I would paint it
Or a sculptor's hands, then I would shape it
But instead, I guess I'll sing it in this song

[Pre-Chorus]
I cry more than I ever sang
Each time, your love seems to save the day

[Chorus]
Lift me up, give me a start
'Cause I've been flying with some broken arms
Lift me up, just a small nudge
And I'll be flying like a thousand doves

[Post-Chorus]
Flying like a thousand, flying like two thousand
Flying like ten thousand doves
Flying like a thousand, flying like two thousand
Flying like ten thousand doves

[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I was born in New York, I let it rock away
In down in the South, I laid them shots away
Put the bands in the four, let 'em cop today
Bitch, they all want a 25, they cop today
You could ride on my face
Got that beam on your face
Let that bitch go to waste, yeah
Got that beam on your face
Dark green beam on your face
Let my bitch go to waste, yeah

And I wanna, yeah, wanna fill up, yeah

You now wanna fall when I met you
It's another fall when I met you
You now wanna fall when I met you
When I met you

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Rollie on the wrist, it's how my baby come
Diamonds on my car, I let my baby know
Rollie on the wrist, it's how my baby come
And I wanna fuck me and my baby cold

[Chorus]
It's no way, you know my bitch do
Goin' away, it's only me and you
Goin' away, it's only me and you (It's only me and you)

Got me baby soul
Please don't baby, let me know
Got me on that baby soul
Please don't baby, let me know

[Chorus]
It's no way, you know my bitch do
Goin' away, it's only me and you
Goin' away, it's only me and you (It's only me and you)

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
You're the engine that makes all things go
And you're always in disguise, my hero
I see your light in the dark
Smile in my face when we all know it's hard
There's no way to ever pay you back
Bless your heart, know I love you for that
Honest and selfless
I don't know if this helps it, but

[Chorus]
Good job
You're doin' a good job, a good job
You're doin' a good job
Don't get too down
The world needs you now
Know that you matter, matter, matter, yeah
You're doin' a good job, a good job
You're doin' a good job
Don't get too down
The world needs you now
Know that you matter, matter, matter, yeah

[Verse]
Six in the morning
And soon as you walk through that door
Everyone needs you again
The world's out of order
It's not as sound when you're not around
All day on your feet, hard to
Keep that energy, I know
When it feel like the end of the road
You don't let go
You just press forward

[Pre-Chorus]
You're the engine that makes all things go
Always in disguise, my hero
I see your light in the dark
Smile in my face when we all know it's hard
There's no way to ever pay you back
Bless your heart, know I love you for that
Honest and selfless
I don't know if this helps it, but

[Chorus]
Good job
You're doin' a good job, a good job (Good job)
You're doin' a good job
Don't get too down
The world needs you now
Know that you matter, matter, matter, yeah
(Yeah, that's a good job)
You're doin' a good job, a good job (Good job)
You're doin' a good job
Don't get too down
The world needs you now
Know that you matter, matter, matter, yeah

[Bridge]
The mothers, the fathers, the teachers that reach us
Strangers to friends that show up in the end
From the bottom to the top, the listeners that hear us
This is for you, you make me fearless

[Outro]
You're doin' a good job, a good job (Oh)
You're doin' a good job
Don't get too down
The world needs you now
Know that you matter, matter, matter, yeah
Oh, ain't she sweet?
Well see her walking down that street
Yes I ask you very
Ain't she sweet?

Ain't she nice?
Well look her over once or twice
Yes I ask you, very hyperbolically
Ain't she nice?

Just cast an eye
In her direction
Oh me, oh my
Ain't that perfection?

Oh, ain't she nice?
Well look her over once or twice
Yes I ask you, very confidentially

Just cast an eye
In her direct
Oh me, oh my
Ain't that perfection?
Oh, ain't she sweet?
Ain't she sweet?
Well I ask you, very confidentially
Ain't she sweet?

[Intro: Maxo]
Uh, uh
Uh, uh
Uh, uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh, uh, uh

[Verse 1: Maxo]
Runnin' after shit, I think I want to double back
Devil hittin' my peripherals, ton laughin' (Yeah)
Goin' off of what I know and wanna see from that
Growin' up I know I changed, know that things happen
Look a man in his face
Dreads in the way and on his chains
Gold writing in a day, forgot his name
But he told me, "Never change," we parted ways (Uh, uh)
I had to face what the man in the mirror said
Grew complacent with the human that I was
Angels sittin' on my dome, had to recognize
All the feelings I disguised, just dead when I bleed
Eyes to my feet, can't stand what I see

[Bridge: Maxo & Earl Sweatshirt]
World 'round me steady crumblin' (Crumblin')
World 'round me
World 'round me (Steady)
World 'round (Me)

[Verse 2: Earl Sweatshirt]
Made a home outta house, lotta closet room
Bones stackin' like dominoes
Catacombs, after the glow, the battle carrion
Get all that malice out your soul, the efficacy strong
I finish what I start, the funeral was hella long
I fell asleep, the effigy was short
My effervescence lost, but not entirely, I shrug the venom off
Kept a tiny piece for times we in a war
I like to think of life as deep, chilly water (Water)
We in it, feelin' warm, swimmin' upstream
Fuck is niggas on?
Icicles hangin' in my heart, cagey as strays
Stay away, I hate to say they made me a dog
Anxious, movin' at a pallbearer's pace
My family flanked me in the rain
Enemy of the state, fuck a allegation
Caskets and cradles to the grave and back again
Thanks to the source of the creation
A match fixed like a batch of fresh lemonade
They still couldn't fade us
How much shrapnel can your soul take?
The visions wasn't shabby at an angle
A phantom face in the hallway, carnations
Angels, aura coordinated with the fifth to the floor
Let's go half on a baby, I'm just playin', of course
I'm just sayin', maybe, later on? (Maybe)

[Outro: Maxo]
I got the, whole world 'round me
Whole world 'round me crumblin' in my vision
Whole world 'round me
I got the whole world 'round me crumblin'
I just standin' in my pivot (Whole world)
Whole world round me
Whole world round me
Whole world 'round (Whole world 'round me crumblin')

[Verse 1]
I've been thinkin' 'bout ya lately
Reminiscin', goin' crazy
Miss the way your kiss would keep me up
Ayy, wish that you were here tonight
Drinkin' vodka soda, extra limes
And we could just get back to bein' us

[Chorus]
'Cause I just wanna be cool again, cool again, cool again
Like we were last summer
Want you again, you again, you again
To be stealin' my covers
All tangled in each other, nights still playin' back in my head
I just wanna be cool again, cool again, cool again, yeah

[Verse 2]
Do you ever think about
The days we couldn't live without each other?
Where the hell did we go wrong?
Ayy, how'd we go from that to this?
How'd we let a good thing slip?
Do we really have to go move on?

[Chorus]
I just wanna be cool again, cool again, cool again
Like we were last summer
Want you again, you again, you again
To be stealin' my covers
All tangled in each other, nights still playin' back in my head
I just wanna be cool again, cool again, cool again, yeah

[Bridge]
Yeah, I just wanna be, cool again
(Cool again, cool again, cool again, cool again)

[Chorus]
'Cause I just wanna be cool again, cool again, cool again
Like we were last summer
Want you again, you again, you again
To be stealin' my covers
All tangled in each other, nights still playin' back in my head
I just wanna be cool again, cool again, cool again, yeah

[Outro]
(Cool again, cool again, cool again)
Y'all know that I just wanna be cool again (Cool again, cool again, cool again)
Last summer with you (Cool again, cool again, cool again)
Cool again
(Cool again, cool again) Cool again, yeah

[Verse 1: The Notorious B.I.G.]
Niggas in my faction don't like askin' questions
Strictly gun-testin', coke-measurin'
Givin' pleasure in the Benz-ito
Hittin' fanny, spendin' chips at Manny's
Hope you creeps got receipts, my peeps get dirty like cleats
Run up in your crib, wrap you in your Polo sheets
Six up in your wig-piece, nigga decease
Muah, may you rest in peace
With my Sycamore style, more sicker than yours
Four-four and fifty-four draw
As my pilot, steers my Lear; yes, my dear
Shit's official, only the Feds I fear
Here's a tissue, stop your bloodclaat cryin'
The kids, the dog, everybody dyin', no lyin'
So don't you get suspicious
I'm Big Dangerous, you're just a Lil Vicious
As I leave my competition, respirator style
Climb the ladder to success escalator style
Hold y'all breath, I told y'all
Death controls y'all, Big don't fold y'all, uhh
I spit phrases that'll thrill you
You're nobody 'til somebody kills you

[Chorus: Korn]
You ain't nobody, get smashed by the drop top
'Cause you got the wrong colors on the wrong block
Nobody, see, you can run but you can't hide
'Cause the rebel boy won't be denied
You ain't nobody, here today, gone tomorrow
Lights out, I don't care who you are
You ain't nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody
Nobody, no, you're just a memory

[Verse 2: Korn]
6 in the morning, feds at my door
Grab your guns and hide the work, we're going to war
Did the landlord flip and lose her mind?
It's got to be her that dropped the dime
Bitch, please, 6 G's, every month, cold cash
You done fucked around and got a nigga dipping in the stash
If I'ma catch a case, you gon' have to catch me fast
But how you gon' do that floatin' in the blood bath?
Hold on, I hear the helicopters comin'
See, it's a hundred cops, they runnin'
They got the dogs and the warrant for my arrest
But they just don't know that I'm a hard pimp to catch
I wipe my finger prints off of the safe, hell
I strike a match and burn this whole fucking place down

[Chorus: Korn]
You ain't nobody, get smashed by the drop top
'Cause you got the wrong colors on the wrong block
Nobody, see, you can run but you can't hide
'Cause the rebel boy won't be denied
You ain't nobody, here today, gone tomorrow
Lights out, I don't care who you are
You ain't nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody
Nobody, no, you're just a memory

[Verse 3: The Notorious B.I.G.]
You can be the shit, flash the fattest five (that's right)
Have the biggest dick, but when your shell get hit (Ha)
You ain't worth spit, just a memory
Remember he used to push the champagne Range (I 'member that)
Silly cat, wore suede in the rain
Swear he put the G in game, had the Gucci frame
Before Dana Dane, thought he ran with Kane
I can't recall his name (What was his name?), you mean that kid
That nearly lost half his brain over two bricks of cocaine?
Gettin' his dick sucked by Crackhead Lorraine?
A fuckin' shame, duke's a lame, what's his name?
Dark-skin Jermaine, see what I mean?

[Chorus: Korn]
You ain't nobody, get smashed by the drop top
'Cause you got the wrong colors on the wrong block
Nobody, see, you can run but you can't hide
'Cause the rebel boy won't be denied
You ain't nobody, here today, gone tomorrow
Lights out, I don't care who you are
You ain't nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody
Nobody, no, you're just a memory

[Intro: Eminem]
Guess who? D'you miss me?
Jessica Simpson, sing the chorus!

[Chorus: Charmagne Tripp & Eminem]
When you walked through the door (Woo!)
It was clear to me (Clear to me)
You’re the one they adore
Who they came to see (Who they came to see)
You’re a rock star (Baby) (Yeah)
Everybody wants you (Everybody wants you)
Player, who can really blame you? (Who can really blame you?)
We’re the ones who made you

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Ahem, back by popular demand
Now pop a little Zantac for antacid if you can
You're ready to tackle any task that is at hand?
How does it feel? Is it fantastic? Is it grand?
Well, look at all the massive masses in the stands
"Shady, man, no, don't massacre the fans!"
Damn, I think Kim Kardashian's a man
She stomped him, just ‘cause he asked to put his hands
On her massive gluteus maximus again
Squeeze it, then squish it, then pass it to a friend
Can he come back as nasty as he can?
Yes, he can-can; don't ask me this again
He does not mean to lesbian offend
But Lindsay, please come back to seeing men
Samantha's a 2; you're practically a 10
I know you want me, girl, in fact, I see you grin
Now come in, girl

[Chorus: Charmagne Tripp & Eminem]
When you walked through the door (Woo!)
It was clear to me (Clear to me)
You’re the one they adore
Who they came to see (Who they came to see)
You’re a rock star (Baby)
Everybody wants you (Everybody wants you)
Player, who can really blame you? (Who can really blame you?)
We’re the ones who made you

[Verse 2: Eminem]
The enforcer, looking for more women to torture
Walk up to the cutest girl and charley-horse her
Sorry, Portia, but what's Ellen DeGeneres
Have that I don't? Are you telling me tenderness?
Well, I can be as gentle and as smooth as a gentleman
Give me my Ventolin inhaler and two Xenadrine
And I'll invite Sarah Palin out to dinner, then
Nail her, baby, say hello to my little friend!
Brit, forget K-Fed, let's cut off the middleman
Forget him or you're gonna end up in the hospital again
And this time it won't be for the Ritalin binge
Forget them other men, girl, pay them little attention
And little did I mention that Jennifer's in
Love with me, John Mayer, so sit on the bench
Man, I swear them other guys, you give 'em an inch
They take a mile; they got style, but it isn't Slim

[Chorus: Charmagne Tripp & Eminem]
When you walked through the door (Woo!)
It was clear to me (Clear to me)
You’re the one they adore
Who they came to see (Who they came to see)
You’re a rock star (Baby)
Everybody wants you (Everybody wants you)
Player, who can really blame you? (Who can really blame you?)
We’re the ones who made you

[Bridge: Eminem]
And that's why, my love
You'll never live without
I know you want me, girl
'Cause I can see you checking me out
And baby, you know
You know you want me too
Don't try to deny it, baby
I'm the only one for you (*fart*)

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Damn, girl, I'm beginning to sprout an Alfalfa
Why should I wash my filthy mouth out?
You think that's bad, you should hear the rest of my album
Never has there been such finesse and nostalgia
Man, Cash, I don't mean to mess with your gal, but
Jessica Alba put her breasts on my mouth (Blup!)
Wowzers! I just made a mess in my trousers
And they wonder why I keep dressing like Elvis
"Lord, help us, he's back in his pink Alf shirt
Looking like someone shrinked his outfit!"
I think he's 'bout to flip, Jessica
Rest assured Superman's here to rescue ya
Can you blame me? You're my Amy, I'm your Blake
Matter of fact, bake me a birthday cake
With a saw blade in it to make my jailbreak
Baby, I think you just met your soulmate
Now break it down, girl

[Chorus: Charmagne Tripp & Eminem]
When you walked through the door (Woo!)
It was clear to me (Clear to me)
You’re the one they adore
Who they came to see (Who they came to see)
You’re a rock star (Baby)
Everybody wants you (Everybody wants you)
Player, who can really blame you? (Who can really blame you?)
We’re the ones who made you

[Outro: Eminem]
So baby
Baby, get down, down, down
Baby, get down, down, down
Baby, get down, down, down
Baby, get down, get down
Baby, get down, down, down
Baby, get down, down, down
Baby, get down, down, down
Baby, get down, get down
Oh Amy! Rehab never looked so good!
I can't wait, I'm going back
Ha-ha, woo!
Dr. Dre! 2020!
Yeah!

[Verse]
The sun is in your eyes
The sun is in your eyes
Throw me the cold
Throw me the cold, cold water of your smile again
To take me by surprise
You take me by surprise
Throw me the bold
Throw me the bold, bold treasure of your lips again

[Chorus]
And where I go
You lead me in the right direction
And with your love as my protection
I'll be a world of your projection
And where I go
Singing songs of your affection
With rhymes to your perfection
In my eyes see a reflection
Of you

[Outro]
I see you clearly now
I hold you dearly now
The sun is in my eyes

[Verse 1]
Untouchable like a distant diamond sky
I'm reaching out and I just can’t tell you why
I'm caught up in you, I'm caught up in you

[Pre-Chorus]
Untouchable, burning brighter than the sun
And when you’re close, I feel like coming undone

[Chorus]
In the middle of the night when I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars spelling out your name
You got to come on, come on, say that we'll be together
Come on, come on, little taste of heaven

[Verse 2]
It's half full and I won't wait here all day
I know you're saying that you'd be here anyway

[Pre-Chorus]
But you’re untouchable, burning brighter than the sun
Now that you’re close, I feel like coming undone

[Chorus]
In the middle of the night when I'm in this dream
It’s like a million little stars spelling out your name
You got to come on, come on, say that we'll be together
Come on, come on, oh
In the middle of the night waking from this dream
I want to feel you by my side, standing next to me
You got to come on, come on, say that we'll be together
Come on, come on, little taste of heaven

[Bridge]
I'm caught up in you
Oh, oh, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
But you’re untouchable, burning brighter than the sun
Now that you're close, I feel like coming undone

[Chorus]
In the middle of the night when I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars spelling out your name
You got to come on, come on, say that we'll be together
Come on, come on, oh
In the middle of the night when I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars spelling out your name
You got to come on, come on, say that we'll be together
Come on, come on, oh
In the middle of the night waking from this dream
I want to feel you by my side, standing next to me
You got to come on, come on, say that we'll be together
Come on, come on, little taste of heaven
And in the middle of the night when I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars spelling out your name
You got to come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, oh, oh, oh

[Outro]
Like a million little stars spelling out your name
They're spelling out your name, oh

[Verse 1]
We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes, and the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, "hello"
Little did I know

[Pre-Chorus 1]
That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, "stay away from Juliet"
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, "please don't go," and I said

[Chorus 1]
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story baby just say "yes"

[Verse 2]
So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet, 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while

[Pre-Chorus 2]
'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet"
But you were everything to me
I was begging you please don't go and I said

[Chorus 2]
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story baby just say "yes"
Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story baby just say "yes"
Oh, oh

[Bridge]
I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town, and I said
Romeo save me I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring

[Chorus 3]
And said: "Marry me Juliet
You'll never have to be alone
I love you and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story baby just say 'yes'"

[Outro]
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
'Cause we were both young when I first saw you

[Verse 1]
There's something 'bout the way the street looks when it's just rained
There's a glow off the pavement, you walk me to the car
And you know I wanna ask you to dance right there
In the middle of the parking lot, yeah
Oh, yeah

We're driving down the road, I wonder if you know
I'm trying so hard not to get caught up now
But you're just so cool, run your hands through your hair
Absentmindedly making me want you

[Chorus]
And I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress, fearless

[Verse 2]
So, baby, drive slow 'til we run out of road in this one horse town
I wanna stay right here, in this passenger's seat
You put your eyes on me
In this moment now, capture it, remember it

[Chorus]
'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress, fearless

[Bridge]
Well, you stood there with me in the doorway
My hands shake, I'm not usually this way but
You pull me in and I'm a little more brave
It's the first kiss, it's flawless, really something
It's fearless
Oh, yeah

[Chorus]
'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress, fearless

[Chorus]
'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress, fearless

[Outro]
Oh, oh
Oh, yeah

[Verse 1]
Your beautiful eyes
Stare right into mine
And sometimes I think of you late at night
I don't know why, I

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I wanna be somewhere where you are
I wanna be where

[Chorus]
You're here, your eyes are looking into mine
So baby, make me fly
My heart has never felt this way before
I'm looking through your
I'm looking through your eyes

[Verse 2]
I wake up, I'm alive
In only a little while I'll cry
'Cause you're my lullaby
So baby, come hold me tight 'cause I-I

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I wanna be everything you need
I wanna be where

[Chorus]
You're here, your eyes are looking into mine
So baby, make me fly
My heart has never felt this way before
I'm looking through your
I'm looking through your eyes

[Outro]
Just as long as you're mine
I'll be your everything tonight
Let me love you, kiss you
Oh, baby, let me miss you
Let me see your
Dream about, dream about
Dream about your eyes
Eyes, eyes
Beautiful eyes

[Verse 1]
Drew looks at me
I fake a smile so he won't see
That I want and I'm needing
Everything that we should be

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I'll bet she's beautiful, that girl he talks about
And she's got everything that I have to live without

[Verse 2]
Drew talks to me
I laugh 'cause it's so damn funny
That I can't even see
Anyone when he's with me

[Pre-Chorus 2]
He says he's so in love, he's finally got it right
I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night

[Chorus]
He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car
I keep singing, don't know why I do...

[Verse 3]
Drew walks by me
Can't he tell that I can't breathe?
And there he goes, so perfectly
The kind of flawless I wish I could be

[Pre-Chorus 3]
She'd better hold him tight, give him all her love
Look in those beautiful eyes and know she's lucky 'cause

[Chorus]
He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car
I keep singing, don't know why I do...

[Bridge]
So I drive home alone, as I turn off the light
I'll put his picture down and maybe get some sleep tonight

[Chorus]
He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only one who’s got enough of me to break my heart
He's the song in the car
I keep singing, don't know why I do...

[Outro]
He's the time taken up, but there's never enough
And he's all that I need to fall into
Drew looks at me
I fake a smile so he won't see

[Verse 1]
State the obvious, I didn't get my perfect fantasy
I realize you love yourself more than you could ever love me
So go and tell your friends that I'm obsessive and crazy
That's fine, you won't mind if I say
By the way

[Chorus]
I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned, you're just another picture to burn

[Verse 2]
There's no time for tears
I'm just sitting here planning my revenge
There's nothing stopping me
From going out with all of your best friends
And if you come around saying sorry to me
My daddy's gonna show you how sorry you'll be

[Chorus]
'Cause I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match an all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned, you're just another picture to burn

[Bridge]
And if you're missing me, you'd better keep it to yourself
'Cause coming back around here would be bad for your health

[Chorus]
'Cause I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
In case you haven't heard
I really really hate that
Stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak, who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned, you're just another picture to burn

[Outro]
Burn, burn, burn, baby, burn
You're just another picture to burn
Baby, burn

[Verse 1]
It's strange to think the songs we used to sing
The smiles, the flowers, everything is gone
Yesterday I found out about you
Even now just looking at you: feels wrong

[Pre-Chorus]
You say that you'd take it all back, given one chance
It was a moment of weakness and you said, "Yes"

[Chorus]
You should've said, "No"
You should've gone home
You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
You should've known that word, 'bout what you did with her’d
Get back to me (Get back to me)
And I should've been there, in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself, "Why?"
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should've said no, baby, and you might still have me

[Verse 2]
You can see that I've been crying
Baby, you know all the right things to say
But do you honestly expect me to believe
We could ever be the same?

[Pre-Chorus]
You say that the past is the past, you need one chance
It was a moment of weakness and you said, "Yes"

[Chorus]
You should've said, "No"
You should've gone home
You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
You should've known that word, 'bout what you did with her’d
Get back to me (Get back to me)
And I should've been there, in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself, "Why?"
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should've said no, baby, and you might still have me

[Bridge]
I can't resist
Before you go tell me this
Was it worth it?
Was she worth this?
No no, no, no

[Chorus]
You should've said, "No"
You should've gone home
You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
You should've known that word, 'bout what you did with her’d
Get back to me (Get back to me)
And I should've been there, in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself, "Why?"
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should've said no, baby, and you might still have me

[Verse 1]
And it's a sad picture, the final blow hits you
Somebody else gets what you wanted again and
You know it's all the same, another time and place
Repeating history and you're getting sick of it
But I believe in whatever you do
And I'll do anything to see it through

[Chorus]
Because these things will change
Can you feel it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
This revolution, the time will come
For us to finally win
And we'll sing hallelujah, we'll sing hallelujah
Oh, oh

[Verse 2]
So we've been outnumbered, raided, and now cornered
It's hard to fight when the fight ain’t fair
We're getting stronger now, finding things they never found
They might be bigger but we're faster and never scared
You can walk away, say we don't need this
But there's something in your eyes says we can beat this

[Chorus]
'Cause these things will change
Can you feel it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
This revolution, the time will come
For us to finally win
And we'll sing hallelujah, we'll sing hallelujah
Oh, oh

[Bridge]
Tonight we stand, get off our knees
Fight for what we've worked for all these years
And the battle was long, it's the fight of our lives
But we'll stand up champions tonight

[Chorus]
It was the night things changed
Can you see it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back fell down
It's a revolution, throw your hands up
'Cause we never gave in
And we'll sing hallelujah, we sang hallelujah
Hallelujah

[Verse 1: Joe Jonas]
I woke up on my roof with my brothers
There's a whale in the pool with my mother
And my dad paints the house different colors
Where would we be, if we couldn't dream?

[Chorus: Nick Jonas]
And I know we get a little crazy
And I know we get a little loud
And I know we're never gonna fake it
We are wild, we are free, we are more than you think
So, call us freaks, but that's just the way we roll

[Verse 2: Joe Jonas]
You've got moves, I've got shoes, let's go dancing
Pop and lock, battle dance against Hanson
If we lose, all the girls, they'll be laughing
Where would we be, if we couldn't dream?

[Chorus: Nick Jonas]
And I know we get a little crazy
And I know we get a little loud
And I know we're never gonna fake it
We are wild, we are free, we are more than you think
So, call us freaks, but that's just the way we roll

[Bridge: Joe Jonas]
'Cause we're old enough to know
We're never letting go
'Cause that's just the way we roll

[Chorus: Nick Jonas]
And I know we get a little crazy
And I know we get a little loud
And I know we're never gonna fake it
We are wild, we are free, we are more than you think
So, call us freaks, but that's just the way we roll
And I know we get a little crazy
And I know we get a little loud
And I know we're never gonna fake it
We are wild, we are free, we are more than you think
So, call us freaks, but that's just the way we roll
That's just the way we roll
Oh, that's just the way we roll

[Verse 1]
We don’t have time left to regret (Hold on)
It will take more than common sense (Hold on)
So stop your wondering, take a stand (Hold on)
'Cause there's more to life than just to live (Hold on)

[Chorus]
'Cause an empty room can be so loud
It's too many tears to drown them out
So hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on

[Verse 2]
One single smile, a helping hand (Hold on)
It's not that hard to be a friend (Hold on)
So don’t give up, stand till the end (Hold on)
There's more to life than just to live (Hold on)

[Chorus]
'Cause an empty room can be so loud
It's too many tears to drown them out
So hold on, hold on (sing it), hold on, hold on
When you love someone and they break your heart
Don’t give up on love, have faith, restart
Just hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on

[Bridge]
When it falls apart
And you're feeling lost
All your hope is gone
Don’t forget to hold on, hold on

[Chorus]
'Cause an empty room can be so loud
It's too many tears to drown them out
So hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on
When you love someone and they break your heart
Don’t give up on love, have faith, restart
Just hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on
'Cause an empty room can be so loud
It's too many tears to drown them out
So hold on (one more time), hold on, hold on
When you love someone and they break your heart
Don’t give up on love, have faith, restart
Just hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on

[Verse 1: Joe Jonas]
You met in work, you should've known better
It's gonna suck when the camera stops rolling
And you'll find out soon that the treatment wasn't worth it
They're all the same, they all want the money
They're all insane, they live for fame, honey
They laugh at you when you're not even being funny

[Pre-Chorus 1: Nick Jonas]
Well, I've been here before
And I've seen firsthand and front row seat
This little thing they call a video girl

[Chorus: Joe Jonas & Nick Jonas]
Video girl rocked my world for a whole two seconds
And now I know I'm not about to be another victim
Get out of my face, get out of my space
Get some class and kiss the past
'Cause I'm not about to be another victim
Of the video girl syndrome

[Verse 2: Joe Jonas]
You know it's bad when your mama doesn't like her
All your friends saying she's a liar
Never ending phone calls aren't enough
(It's not enough, it's never enough)
Move to LA, got no talent
Not even like you won a Miss Teen pageant
Daddy pays your bills, but you still whine

[Pre-Chorus 2: Nick Jonas]
Well, I've been here before
And I've seen firsthand and front row seat
What happens to a man when he gets in the hands of a

[Chorus: Joe Jonas & Nick Jonas]
Video girl rocked my world for a whole two seconds
And now I know I'm not about to be another victim
Get out of my face, get out of my space
Get some class and kiss the past
'Cause I'm not about to be another victim
Of the video girl syndrome

[Bridge: Joe Jonas & Nick Jonas]
You are never gonna see me miss her
Video girl syndrome
I'm not gonna be another victim
Of the video girl syndrome

[Chorus: Joe Jonas & Nick Jonas]
Video girl rocked my world for a whole two seconds
And now I know I'm not about to be another victim
Get out of my face, get out of my space
Get some class and kiss the past
'Cause I'm not about to be another victim
Of the video girl syndrome
'Cause I'm not about to be another victim
Of the video girl syndrome

But I don’t fucking care

'Cause you're just a man
It's just what you do
Your head in your hands
As you color me blue
Yeah, you're just a man
All through and through

As you color me blue
Blue, blue, blue

You keep changing all the time
You're changing your goddamn mind
You know you like to shine

[Intro: Big Pun & 2Pac]
What I gotta do is let y'all niggas know I am the nicest
Once upon a crime, someone who was once fragile, innocent, and pure was suddenly corrupted and adopted by the streets. But the gift he brought with him to this world will effect our outlooks on not only rap music but on life as well, forever, forever

[Verse 1: Big Pun]
It's not a game, it's war, plain and raw
Blood stain the wall when I bring the chain with the saw
Bring the pain to your door like death was knockin'
Unless you got my ends, I'ma make you twins
With the Headless Horseman, hell extortion
Sell your soul, live your dreams, don't pay the cost then
Chop, chop, say hello to the guillotine
A killer fiends for blood, screams of thugs like
Fiends for drugs, I don't need no love
Give me your fear, money, respect, beer, honeys and sex
We're here, I'll bend them checks for years, hungry and stressed
You fuckin' with Chris, fuck Pun, dead the wrath for later
Get your calculator, the head decapitator's back forever
Can't count how many heads I had to sever (Woo, c'mon)
Half the niggas I keep, and put 'em back together
That's the terror, cut open your girl
And make a truss out her flesh, like Buffalo Bill

[Chorus: Big Pun & 2Pac]
It's not a game, it's war, plain and raw
Blood stain the wall when I bring the chain with the saw
It's not a game, it's war, plain and raw
Blood stain the wall when I bring the chain with the saw
It's not a game, it's war, plain and raw
Blood stain the wall when I bring the chain with the saw (Get on yo knees, nigga, get on yo knees and pray)
It's not a game, it's war, plain and raw
Blood stain the wall when I bring the chain with the saw

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
No insanity plea from me, I ride the beef 'til I burn
Censor me and bar your kids from the lessons I learned
And in turn I'm hostile, guess you can recall me antisocial
Niggas shakin' like they caught the Holy Ghost when I approach
Try to politic before I smoke 'em, like Sun Tzu
Niggas do unto these snitches, before it's done to you
And if the cops come arrest me in the evening
Best believe they comin' for my dogs in the morning
And if I die by a slug, the death of a true thug
Tell me will my niggas mourn me? Gettin' blowed out
High, watch me murder the bird before he testify
Strikes walkin' close to my third, I live a troubled life
And if you dream, be a part of my team
From Long Beach to Queens
Drug dealers to ex-fiends
Keep yo eyes on the prize, nigga watch for bustas (Watch)
Either heaven or jail, it's still hell for a hustler

[Chorus: Big Pun]
It's not a game, it's war, plain and raw
Blood stain the wall when I bring the chain with the saw
It's not a game, it's war, plain and raw
Blood stain the wall when I bring the chain with the saw
It's not a game, it's war, plain and raw
Blood stain the wall when I bring the chain with the saw
It's not a game, it's war, plain and raw
Blood stain the wall when I bring the chain with the saw

[Verse 3: The Notorious B.I.G.]
I got seven Mac-11's, about eight .38's
Nine 9's, ten Mac-10's the shits never end
You can't touch my riches
Even if you had MC Hammer and them 357 bitches
Biggie Smalls, the millionaire, the mansion, the yacht
The two weed spots, the two hot Glocks
Huh, that's how I got the weed spot
I shot dread in the head, took the bread and the lamb spread
Lil' Gotti got the shotty to your body
So don't resist or you might miss Christmas
I tote guns, I make number runs
I give MCs the runs dripping
When I throw my clip in the AK, I slay from far away
Everybody hit the D-E-C-K
My slow flows remarkable, peace to Matteo
Now we smoke weed like Tony Montana sniff the yayo
That's crazy blunts, mad L's
My voice excels from the avenue to jail cells
Oh my God I'm dropping shit like a pigeon
I hope you're listening, smacking babies at they christening
So you better grab your pistol
'Cause if you sit still, I'm gonna make your fucking shit spill
And I'm talking 'bout buckets, why did I have to do it?
Fuck it, you got a gun, nigga bust it

[Chorus: Big Pun]
It's not a game, it's war, plain and raw
Blood stain the wall when I bring the chain with the saw
It's not a game, it's war, plain and raw
Blood stain the wall when I bring the chain with the saw
It's not a game, it's war, plain and raw
Blood stain the wall when I bring the chain with the saw
It's not a game, it's war, plain and raw
Blood stain the wall when I bring the chain with the saw

[Outro: 2Pac The Notorious B.I.G.]
I personify every image that niggas fake
I personify, really bring it to 'em
Because I'm -- I-I looked up to these niggas
While on bail, they gon' take my spot, big mistake, know what I'm saying?
My spot is wedged in, it ain't going nowhere, you know what I'm saying?
I'm coming right back for my place, anybody that's there, they gon' have to move

[Intro: Too $hort]
Biatch

[Verse 1: The Notorious B.I.G.]
I got a bitch that suck my dick 'til I nut
Spit it on my gut and slurp that shit back up
Ain't that a slut, (Hell yeah) she even take it in the butt
Fuck for about an hour, now she want a golden shower
You didn't know that we be pissing on hoes, bitch
Luke and Biggie straight shitting on hoes, bitch
Lick your toes bitch, fuck no, you must be crazy
Squirt in your face and then I'm swayze
Recognize G, straight up, I can't knock ya
After Big Poppa, fuck all of Junior M.A.F.I.A
The whole clique, dick sucked, ass licked
Leave your number by the phone, bring your ass on home
I roam in Lexuses and Benzes, the fly way
With the flyest bitch getting head on the highway
My way, deep throat on Luke's boat
When the moon rises, I'm cuming in her eyes-es
Just the way playas play
Leave it up to me, I get fucked all day
Sucked all day, smoking blunts, counting cheese
Fucking bitches 'til they assholes bleed
Check it out

[Chorus: The Notorious B.I.G.]
In this world of fly girls
Tanqueray and Hennessy until I call earl
Hit it, split it, and recognize a pimp
Don't love no ho, that's my principle
In this world of fly girls
Tanqueray and Hennessy until I call earl
Stop it, hit it, and recognize a pimp
Don't love no ho, that's my principle

[Verse 2: Webbie]
Action, ass clappin', back bends
White and Filipin-ian with a black friend
Lil' 'tiva, lil' Hen, room 810
Got them hoes loose as a goose and I ain't playin'
Hit that nigga Biggie and told him to fall in
Boosie big head and Diddy was all there
Suck that dick good, put all of the balls in
Had to make sure them hoes had teeth so y'all grin
I want a lil' anal, ya heard me, so y'all bend
All the way over, y'all knees to y'all chin
Buss that ass open, I squeeze that log in
What's wrong with ya, baby? Y'all scream like y'all kids
Grippin' on the titties, I like when they all big
Mouth got dry, had to take me a small swig
Bent that ass right back over and hauled in
Nutted all over the flo', shit, we all did

[Chorus: The Notorious B.I.G. & (Too $hort)]
In this world of fly girls
Tanqueray and Hennessy until I call earl
Hit it, split it, and recognize a pimp

Tanqueray and Hennessy until I call earl
Stop it, hit it, and recognize a pimp ($hort Dog in the house)
Don't love no ho, that's my principle

[Verse 3: Too $hort]
That bitch ain't mine
But when I spit that line
That was all it took for me to get that dime
And right away she let me hit one time
Niggas talk a lot of game but that shit don't rhyme
I was all up in her head when that bitch got scared
Realized I was a pimp and not just a player
Me and Biggie took some hoes to see the city
When they found out Diddy's Rolls cost 350
They was cryin', ain't no feelings involved
You can save your emotions, girl, give me it all
She's beautiful, but I ain't tryna steal her heart
If you don't understand $hort, I'm just realer than y'all
I got the game from the streets and you went to college
But game is just a street term, it means knowledge
Books and bitches, it's all the same
They know our names, we live forever through the game

[Chorus: The Notorious B.I.G.]
In this world of fly girls
Tanqueray and Hennessy until I call earl
Hit it, split it, and recognize a pimp
Don't love no ho, that's my principle
In this world of fly girls
Tanqueray and Hennessy until I call earl
Stop it, hit it, and recognize a pimp
Don't love no ho, that's my principle

[Verse 4: The Notorious B.I.G.]
Biggie bag bitches from barbecues to Barmitzvah's
The Big don't fit, use your lips cause
I'm feeling kinda itchy for a quicky
Don't take off your coat, all you got to do is lick me
Me eat you, I beat you, then greet you to the door
Bitch, cause I don't love you no more
Which one of these hoes in the lobby wanna slob me
You know me, I like my dick brown like Bobby
In the duke shoot, then the bitch get the boot
Unless you lick ass and blow dicks like flutes
I like 'em cute, round tits and fat asses
Educated, so I can bust off on they glasses
I wanna cum on your tongue and gums, all night
The bitch drink nuts by the pint

[Chorus: The Notorious B.I.G.]
In this world of fly girls
Tanqueray and Hennessy until I call earl
Hit it, split it, and recognize a pimp
Don't love no ho, that's my principle

Stop it, hit it, and recognize a pimp
Don't love no ho, that's my principle

Hello, hello, call me cold, call me icy
I've been buildin' up a wall to protect my heart
I get nervous to reveal what's inside me
I'm lookin' at you, I'm tellin' the truth
'Cause I wanna show you sides that you ain't seen
But I'm scared in case you run when I fall apart
Think I'm ready to reveal what's inside me
I'm lookin' at you, now tell me the truth, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
So if I cried, would you do anything to keep me safe?
Would you stand by or would my honesty make you afraid?
Yeah, if I cried, would you know all the things to do
Would you, would you-ou?
So if I cried, would you do anything to feel my pain?
Would you stand by or would you hide and slowly fade away?
Yeah, if I cried, would you know all the things to do
Would you, would you-ou?

[Verse 2]
Would you understand how I feel?
Would you give me patience? Be real
Make me smile, keep the water so still (So still, so still)
Oh, would you make sure I was alright?
Would you wrap your arms all around my body, so tight?
I need these things to feel okay with you
Now tell me the truth, yeah

[Chorus]
So if I cried, would you do anything to keep me safe?
Would you stand by or would my honesty make you afraid?
Yeah, if I cried, would you know all the things to do
Would you, would you-ou?

If I, if I, if I, if I, if I
If I, if I, if I, if I, if I
If I, if I, if I, if I, if I
If I, if I, if I, oh-oh
If I, if I, if I, if I (if I, if I)

[Chorus]
So if I cried, would you do anything to feel my pain?
Would you stand by or would hide and slowly fade away?
Yeah, if I cried, would you know all the things to do
Would you, would you-ou? (If I, if I, if I, if I, if I)
So if I cried, would you do anything to feel my pain?
Would you stand by or would you hide and slowly fade away?
Yeah, if I cried, would you know all the things to do
Would you, would you-ou?

G-G-G-G-G
G-G-G-G-G-Unit!
Niggas know who the don is (Live from Bedford-Stuyvesaunt)

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
I go hard for mine, I work 9 to 5
And I stay on the grind, I stay on the grind (What, what?)
I ain't got time for love, I'm tryna get mine
And I stay on the grind, I stay on the grind
I got Moe in the middle and I'm always gon' shine
'Cause I stay on the grind, I stay on the grind
If you call and I'm busy when you got spare time
It's 'cause I stay on the grind, I stay on the grind

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
All I do is sit and think of ways I can come up
Catching jooks and run up, and leave your nigga done up
My pockets are hurting, homie, I ain't feeling this shit
Have your mama screaming ("Baby, move, it's a hit!")
I ain't Scarface -- "No women, no kids" -- I don't give a fuck
Better teach that bitch and that little nigga to duck
With a P90 Ruger I put shots all through ya
If you survive, you gon' feel what talons do to ya
I'm a hard-headed nigga, I came up so hard
Had to get shot 9 times for me to find God
If them planes hit the projects, nobody would care
Look around, ain't nothing but black folks around here
We brothers become political and start to maneuver
They give you 100 years, man, they did it to Hoover
Now, you can hate me or love me
When you see me, busts shots or come and hug me
The showman shit's lovely

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
I go hard for mine, I work 9 to 5
And I stay on the grind, I stay on the grind (What, what?)
I ain't got time for love, I'm tryna get mine
And I stay on the grind, I stay on the grind
I got Moe in the middle and I'm always gon' shine
'Cause I stay on the grind, I stay on the grind
If you call and I'm busy when you got spare time
It's 'cause I stay on the grind, I stay on the grind

[Verse 2: The Notorious B.I.G.]
Niggas talkin' it but ain't livin' it
Cristal pops I'm sippin' it, mob hats and lizard shit
'Gator trunks bitch, rollin' blunts with the williest of the willy
Heckler Koch, M-1's and nine millies
Stories like a motherfucker
Model bitches wondering if I'ma fuck with her
She know I treat my bitches like Ivana
Dolce and Gabana drippin', Big Poppa never slippin'
H-class diamonds shinin', dinner with wifey winin', dinin'
Smoking cigars in Bogotá with Colombian niggas named Panama
And Englique and shit, games we play life endin'
Bitches bending over with ease for a pair of Moschino jeans
And Donna Karan tank tops, I got your bank stopped
Singles on top, Benjamins under the rest of 'em
Advancin' from duplex to mansions
Stashing keys hidin' G's overseas, VCR's in my V's
Game elevates money I make into stocks and real estates, bitch
Jet skiing in the Caribbean, white sand
Discussing plans with my man
Dark blue land, smoke tint chrome rims and a system
That leaves my rear views tremblin'
What you gonna do when poppa catch an attitude?
Drop to your knees and show gratitude
Kiss my ring, it's a Frank White thing I stay potent
Bitch is devoted, take my dick and deep throat it

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
I go hard for mine, I work 9 to 5
And I stay on the grind, I stay on the grind (What, what?)
I ain't got time for love, I'm tryna get mine
And I stay on the grind, I stay on the grind
I got Moe in the middle and I'm always gon' shine
'Cause I stay on the grind, I stay on the grind
If you call and I'm busy when you got spare time
It's 'cause I stay on the grind, I stay on the grind

[Intro]
Fuck you

[Verse 1]
Back like niggas on the bus with a Rosa Park state of mind
I don't give a fuck
And I'm strollin' down south like Good Luck Chuck
In a Malcolm X shirt chilling with the Ku Klux
Circus cost five, but I'm charging niggas six
Don't touch the fuckin' bottle, the doctor gave a prescription
For antidepressants, demons sign the petition
In the devil's home banging pots and pans in the kitchen

[Chorus]
And fuck you
This is the nosebleed
And fuck you
(And the devil's comin')
(Mothafucka)

[Verse 2]
I'm from the city where it's windy and the church
They got them niggas with cold feet and bitches with gold teeth
Weren't dressed the same color or the stripes was Polkadot
With green eyes, long hair, black bitch like Pocahontas
When niggas fail in college
Nikons and Canons for them black and white collages
Your pocket cheese is cottage
Yeah, them blue is wet, dumb niggas bang your set
I scream "OF" like I just learned the fucking alphabet
And my favorite color, what is it? Oh, yeah, it's yellow
'Cause the bass that I kick sound like a Tonka
BAPE section in my closet, look like Willy Wonka
Better hide them Oompa Loompas, I'm a motherfuckin' monster

[Chorus]
And fuck you
This is the nosebleed
Yeah, and fuck you
(And the devil's comin')
(Mothafucka)

[Verse 3]
Now my family matters and everyone's a Urkel
Now the fuckin' losers and the squares got they own circle
Niggas with some mullets and they got some trigger pullies
It's revenge of the lames, what? We're torturin' the bullies
Niggas hoodies and hoodies with patches
We some rebels ridin' on that war ship, pray devil, worship
Crucify the horses in the stable when I'm able
When the horse shit, bootleg cable with the text
Talkin' to the ghost of Amistad posters
Soul made of bacon of that bread to get a loaf of
Lay you out, same chick, no gay shit
If you got a fuckin' problem, catch me on my day-shift
You can check your history back to the Karl Marx
The only Newton laws that I follow is "Fuck 'em all"
Fuck the government and Reagan, that's in any season
I'm a fuckin' animal, somebody better warn a vegan
Fuck LAUSD I mean that shit for me
Here's a "Fuck you", give that to the district for free
Dark deep coral for your brain oral
Just a bunch of teenagers with no morals

[Outro]
Bitch
Lyrics from Snippets

[Pre-Chorus]
When reality too much (Yeah we talk)
Yeah, there were sometimes where I used to ball in the park
All that time home has taught me a lot (yeah)
All the nights that I used to spend alone in the dark (shit)
I found myself
No, no, rawr, yo
Yo, yo, yo

[Chorus]
Better than I was, must be for ourself
Better than I was, must be for ourself

[Verse]
Life's changed, switch my lane
Nowadays I just switch my plane..

[Pre-Chorus]
When reality too much (Yeah we talk)

I found myself
No, no, rawr, yo
Yo, yo, yo

[Chorus]
Better than I was, must be for ourself
Better than I was, must be for ourself

[Verse 1]
It's so relieving to know that you're leaving
As soon as you get paid
It's so relaxing to hear that you're asking
Whenever you get your way
It's so soothing to know that you'll sue me
Starting to sound the same

[Chorus]
I miss the comfort in being sad
I miss the comfort in being sad
I miss the comfort in being sad

[Verse 2]
In her false witness hope you're still with us
To see if they float or drown
Our favorite patient, a display of patience
Disease-covered Puget sound
She'll come back as fire to burn all the liars
Leave a blanket of ash on the ground

[Chorus]
I miss the comfort in being sad
I miss the comfort in being sad
I miss the comfort in being sad

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 1]
It's so relieving to know that you're leaving
As soon as you get paid
It's so relaxing to know that you're asking
Whenever you get your way
It's so soothing to know that you'll sue me
Starting to sound the same

[Chorus]
I miss the comfort in being sad
I miss the comfort in being sad
I miss the comfort in being sad

[Verse 1]
Zephyr in the sky at night, I wonder
Do my tears of mourning sink beneath the sun?
She's got herself a universe gone quickly
For the call of thunder threatens everyone

[Chorus]
And I feel like I just got home
And I feel
And I feel like I just got home
And I feel

[Verse 2]
Faster than the speeding light she's flying
Trying to remember where it all began
She's got herself a little piece of heaven
Waiting for the time when Earth shall be as one

[Chorus: Earl Sweatshirt, Navy Blue & Both]
True indeed, I see you creeping
Oh, what else you need to know?
Truancy was when I left, when I was needed most
Gold noose, I learned to see the ropes
I need a spot where I can see the coast
Nah, we the light, I keep my demons close
Nah, pree the plot, you never seen me ghost
Uh, uh, see me ghost

[Verse: Navy Blue]
Know four years later, know I got better
Praise to my God, that armor all metal
Iron sword, know my spirits gon' get on, huh
I know my pops guilty 'cause he left 'em
I wore his blessings, honorary cloak
And sacred Yoruba is what he spoke
I pray I say goodbye but know I won't
At best, uh
'Cause if he live, he'd be a vegetable
Know he next to go
Had to show love, we had grown apart
Can't dwell on what it was
Singing from my heart Paloma is a dove

[Pre-Chorus: Earl Sweatshirt]
Nah, true indeed, you never see the scope
Every which way the ouija go
Really nothing niggas ain't seen before
True indeed, true indeed, uh

[Chorus: Earl Sweatshirt, Navy Blue & Both]
True indeed, I see you creeping
Oh, what else you need to know?
Truancy was when I left, when I was needed most
Gold noose, I learned to see the ropes
I need a spot where I can see the coast
Nah, we the light, I keep my demons close
Nah, pree the plot, you never see me ghost
Uh, uh, see me ghost

I get money, I, I get money, I
I get, I get, I get, I get (Ha-ha!)

[Hook: Audio Two (Eminem)]
I, I get money, money I got (Yeah!)
I, I get money, money I got (Yeah!)
I, I get money, money I got (I get it!)
Money, money I got, money, money I got (I run this rap shit!)
I, I get money, money I got (Now, guess who's back?)
I, I get money, money I got (You thought I left you!)
I, I get money, money I got (Now, why would I do that?)
Money, money I got, money, money I got (1, 2, 3! Ha!)

[Verse: Eminem]
They keep on sayin' the same rappers are the best
Jay-Z and Kanye West, maybe they're just tryna distract it
From the fact that I'm comin' back
Or maybe it's 'cause I ain't black, maybe it's because of that
Maybe it's because I'm the highest sellin' artist in rap
While I'm sittin' back in my office jackin' off to my plaques
I'm still sick, how can I be sick this long?
And I'm still alive, Magic Johnson of rhymes
I thrive on makin' my opponents think that I've died
That's when I just pop up outta nowhere, oh yeah, there we go there
Damn, I forgot how much money he got
On the beach of St. Tropez, but your man don't lay
In the sun 'cause I don't tan, I burn, blood clot
When you gonna learn how much money we've earned?
How does it feel to know I came in this game at 25
And coulda retired at 29 in my 20's still?
And Fif' hit a lick on that Coca-Cola shit
He ain't even gotta look at coke to even hold a brick
No more, oh boy, goddamn did he score!
To go from sellin' bags to bottles right out the store
And Shady hit the box office, man, he knocked the socks off us
My ex-wife is set for life, you profitless cocksuckers
So stay the fuck off us, we make pay
I'm just a super easy modest MC, okay?
'Til I hear the word "has-been", that's when I start spazzin'
Smart asses, kiss a smarter ass then
I'm the best thing that ever happened to rap, bastards
I'm a blonde Dre, now gimme Kanye's glasses!

Right now I need a weed tray where's your bible?

[Intro: Mr. Krabs, Squidward, Dylan Brady]
That sounded like hatch doors...
Do you smell it? That smell, the kind of smelly smell... the smelly smell that smells... smelly...
Anchovies...
What?
ANCHOVIES!
Ugh, huh, what's that smell?

[Chorus: Laura Les]
Damn, what's that smell?
What the fuck, what's that smell?
Turn it down, that fucking smell
Damn, what's that smell?
What the fuck, what's that smell?
Turn it down, that fucking smell

[Verse 1: Dylan Brady]
Hey, smells like shit (Gross)
Smells bad, smells like a zit (Eugh!)
When's the last time you took a shower?
I've been in the shower for an hour
It's enough to make a man sick
Hahahahahahaha

[Chorus: Laura Les]
Damn, what's that smell?
What the fuck, what's that smell?
Turn it down, that fucking smell
Damn, what's that smell?
What the fuck, what's that smell?
Turn it down, that fucking smell

[Verse 2: Laura Les]
Fuck, goddamn, I don't wanna smell it anymore
Can you please shut that smell up?
I don't wanna hear it anymore
It's piercing through my door into my room
Under my covers where I sleep
Everything, it smells like shit
Everything smells like shit
Everything smells like shit
Everything smells like shit
Everything smells like shit

[Interlude]
The sweet blood, oh, it sings to me

[Verse 3: Dylan Brady]
I'm gonna yack (Eugh!)
I'm getting sick (Bleugh!)
The smell of the air (*Sniff*)
The smell of the... shit!

[Refrain: Dylan Brady]
What's that smell? What's that shit?
Whole lot of money and a whole lot of shit
What's that smell? What's that shit?
Whole lot of money and a whole lot of shit

Whole lot of money and a whole lot of shit
What's that smell? What's that shit?

[Intro: Dylan Brady]
Eeenie meenie minie moe
Catch a tiger by its toe
If he hollers, let him go
Eeenie meenie minie moe
Eeenie meenie minie moe
Catch a tiger by it's toe
If he hollers, let him go
Eeenie meenie minie moe

[Bridge: Dylan Brady]
My mother told me to be the best one
And you are not it, and you are nothing!

[Verse: Laura Les]
I'm just a tiger
I never asked for you to come pick me up
But you just picked me up, like
Caught me by the big toe, not even a good trick
Feeling really stupid, how did I go into that?
I don't even like Ford, I just wanna go home
Woke up in my bathroom, where did all my clothes go?
Found them in the trash can, probably be my downfall
Maybe I should sneak out, maybe I don't even care
Made it to my car ok and I don't think they saw me
Look down at my phone and there's a text message, "Call me"

[Chorus: Laura Les]
I don't wanna holler, let me go now
I don't wanna holler, let me go now (1, 2, 3, 4!)
I don't wanna holler, let me go now
I don't wanna holler, let me go now
I don't wanna holler, let me go now
I don't wanna holler, let me go now

[Verse 1: Laura Les]
I took a dive in the back, hit my head
Lost my keys, broke my phone, plus I came here all alone
Now somebody's pressed against me, I'm already sweaty
Do it all again next week, I guess that means that I'm a freak

[Pre-Chorus: Laura Les]
'Cause you're the only one who sings the only songs I like
And I'm tearing up my throat to make sure you can hear my voice
And my friend says I'm pathetic, but I've never regretted
I know I'm hopeless, but I hope you feel the same about me

[Chorus: Dylan Brady]
First saw you in the back of the mosh pit
Going so crazy, listening to Toxik
I can't see the band, everybody's fucking hands
I don't know what we'll be, but sure enough I've fallen for you

[Post-Chorus: Dylan Brady]
But sure enough I've fallen for you
But sure enough I've fallen for you

[Verse 2: Dylan Brady]
I was standing there at the show
And I saw your face in the crowd
I don't know what happened
Something like magic
But sure enough I've fallen for you

[Chorus: Dylan Brady]
First saw you in the back of the mosh pit
Going so crazy, listening to Toxik
I can't see the band, everybody's fucking hands
I don't know what we'll be, but sure enough I've fallen for you

[Post-Chorus: Dylan Brady]
But sure enough I've fallen for you
But sure enough I've fallen for you

[Chorus: Dylan Brady]
I'll take you to the mall
All alone, playin' tricks in your hall
How 'bout you pick out some new clothes
I want to take you to the mall

[Verse: Laura Les]
When's the last time we went to the mall?
I hope it was sooner than later
When's the next time we'll go to the mall?
I wanna buy you some Hot Topic Invader Zim merch
We can get Auntie Anne's, I think that sounds cool

[Chorus: Dylan Brady]
I'll take you to the mall
All alone, playin' tricks in your hall
How 'bout you pick out some new clothes (out some new clothes)
I want to take you to the mall
La-la-last train to Awesometown!
Come on, everybody, won't you party with me, now?
Last train to Awesometown!
Come on, won't you party with me, me, me, me, me?
Last train to Awesometown!
The roof is on fire, gonna burn it to the ground, hey, yeah
Last train to Awesometown!
Come on, won't you party with me?

Dude, bro, this party is sick!
Dude, bro, this party is sick!
Dude, bro, this party is sick!

[Verse 1]
Come as you are, as you were
As I want you to be
As a friend, as a friend
As an old enemy
Take your time, hurry up
Choice is yours, don't be late
Take a rest as a friend
As an old memoria

[Pre-Chorus]
Memoria

[Verse 1]
My whole life I've tried to be kind
But what does kindness mean?
I've changed myself to help you
But how does that help me?
My education is built upon
Some 20th century daydream
I'm beginning to learn, despite the facade
That people are not always as pretty as they seem

[Chorus]
Little naive girl
Isn't so naive anymore
Little naive girl
Learned not to go knocking down on death's door
Little naive girl
She grew up and now she's strong as hell
Little naive girl
Now knows she should be treated well

[Verse 2]
Unconditional love
Is what I gave
No condition could ever drive me away, oh
You held me down while I clung to you
You said I'd never get out, and I trusted you
But in troubled water, you learn to sink or swim

[Chorus]
Little naive girl
Isn't so naive anymore
Little naive girl
Learned not to go knocking down on death's door
Little naive girl
She grew up and now she's strong as hell
Little naive girl
Now knows she should be treated well

[Bridge]
Oh, no more one-sided compromises
I'm shiny but I'm not one of your prizes
You think you can use me?
Give it a while, even a fool knows better than to mess with this
Naive girl

[Chorus]
A little naive girl
Isn't so naive anymore
Naive girl
Learned not to go knocking down on death's door
Little naive girl
She grew up and now she's strong as hell
Little naive girl
Now knows she should be treated well

[Outro]
I know I should be treated well, oh
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Lyrics from Snippet:

[Verse]
I'm a girl and I'm a lover, not always very smart
I'm a pessimist, a hypocrite with a telltale heart
But I work hard, and I'm kind
Got a forest fire mind on most days
I'm a little insecure, I'm a little too honest
I care way too much about getting into college
And right now I'm a mess, things don't make sense
But they will soon

[Chorus]
I am more
Than I could ever show
I am more
Than the girl you think you know
And I know

[Intro: Laura Les]
We could be put away for a long time for this
We could go away for a long time for this

[Verse: Laura Les]
Wait wait wait for the dungeon
I could already tell it was that kind of day
My God, it feels like a demon has taken me
Grabbed me by the hair
Get away, get away from me
You're releasing our favourite victim
Its not about the body
Its about how fast we can put out the pick up line

[Verse: Dylan Brady]
Why so serious?
I ask myself that every fucking morning 

[?] and staring across
House, already at a knife
Please don't ask me out but they don't feel right
So I take what I want and I can't turn back
Walk into town in a big black mask
Taking all the shit that I want
Do I ever think I'm gonna get caught?

[Intro: Trugoy the Dove & 2-D]

[Verse 1: 2-D]
City's breaking down on a camel's back
They'll just have to go, 'cause they don't know wack
So all you fill the streets, it's appealing to see
You won't get undercounted 'cause you're damned and free
You got a new horizon, it's ephemeral style
A melancholy town where we never smile
And all I wanna hear is the message beep
My dreams, they come a kissin' 'cause I don't get sleep, no

[Chorus: 2-D]
Windmill, windmill for the land
Turn forever hand in hand
Take it all there on your stride
It is aching, falling down
Love forever, love is free
Let’s turn forever, you and me
Windmill, windmill for the land
Is everybody in?

[Verse 2: Trugoy the Dove]
Laughin' gas these hazmats, fast cats
Linin' 'em up like ass cracks
Lay these ponies at the track
It's my chocolate attack
Shit, I'm steppin' in hotter this year (Yeah)
Care Bear reppin' it harder this year (Yeah)
Watch me as I gravitate, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
Yo, we gon' ghost town this Motown
With yo' sound, you in the blink
Gon' bite the dust, can't fight with us
With yo sound, you kill the Inc. 
So don't stop, get it, get it (Get it)
Until you jet ahead
And watch the way I navigate, hahahahaha
(Ha! Haha! Haha! Haha! Ha!)

[Chorus: 2-D]
Windmill, windmill for the land
Turn forever hand in hand
Take it all in on your stride
It is sinking, falling down
Love forever, love is free
Let's turn forever, you and me
Windmill, windmill for the land
Is everybody in?

Yeah

Boy toy named Troy used to live in Detroit
Bi-big dope dealer money, he was gettin' some coins
Was in shootouts with the law, but he live in a palace
Bo-bought me Alexander McQueen, he was keeping me stylish
Now that's real, real, real
Gun in my purse, bitch, I came dressed to kill
Who wanna go first? I had them pushing daffodils
I'm high as hell, I only took a half a pill
I'm on some dumb shit

[Chorus]
“Fuck these petty niggas” is a bitch motto
If I say it on wax, every bitch follow
If I'm sipping in the club, Myx Moscato

Real country-ass nigga, let me play with his rifle
Pussy put his ass to sleep, now he calling me NyQuil

He toss my salad like his name Romaine
And when we done, I make him buy me Balmain
I'm on some dumb shit

If she wanna step to me, she better go get a ladder
Cause we up in VIP, she better move like Mick Jagger

Ain't sharing bottles, we don't ever chip in
You on some dumb shit

'Cause you like your women Spanish
Dark, strong and proud
I paint the sky black
You said if you could have your way
You'd make it nighttime all today
So it'd suit the mood of your soul

Oh, what can I do?
Nothing, my sparrow blue

Oh, what can I do?
Life is beautiful, but you don't have a clue
Sun and ocean blue
Their magnificence, it don't make sense to you

Black beauty, ah-ah

It's everywhere that you go (Look around)
You try everything you can to escape
The pain of life that you know (Life that you know)

Three little birds sat on my window
And they told me I don't need to worry
Summer came like cinnamon, so sweet
Little girls double-dutch on the concrete

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Maybe sometimes we got it wrong, but it's all right
The more things seem to change, the more they stay the same
Don't you hesitate

[Chorus]
Girl, put your records on, tell me your favorite song
You go ahead, let your hair down
Sapphire and faded jeans, I hope you get your dreams
Just go ahead, let your hair down

[Post-Chorus]
You're gonna find yourself somewhere, somehow

[Verse 2]
Blue as the sky, sunburnt and lonely
Sipping tea in the bar by the roadside (Just relax, just relax)
Don't you let those other boys fool you
Gotta love that afro hairdo

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Maybe sometimes we feel afraid, but it's all right
The more you stay the same, the more that they seem to change
Don't ya think it's strange?

[Chorus]
Girl, put your records on, tell me your favorite song
You go ahead, let your hair down
Sapphire and faded jeans, I hope you get your dreams
Just go ahead, let your hair down

[Post-Chorus]
You're gonna find yourself somewhere, somehow

[Bridge]
Just more than I could take, pity for pity's sake
Some nights kept me awake, I thought that I was stronger
When you gonna realize that you don't even have to try any longer?
Do what you want to

[Outro]
Girl, put your records on, tell me your favorite song
Just go ahead, let your hair down
Sapphire and faded jeans, I hope you get your dreams

Mad trees and bitches in dungarees
The city under seas, kitchen hundred degrees
I love that summer breeze, I'll stand in it 'til it freeze
I'm from another breed, them s-s-southern Gs
I sip promethazine, I lean, I stand tall
I'm mean, I'm mad raw, I'm coming like fastball
Steee-rike, yup, so get it right
Nigga, one of my sniplets'll end your whole life
You ain't nothing but a riblet to a nigga with a knife
And a fork, I'm a pig myself, I eat pork
So be smart and play your own part
If you don't love yourself, I'll make you see your own heart
And we don't like the narcs, stay away from the cell
Hey, I'mma shoot it out if I'm facing the L
Yeah, so tell your girl to come and make me rich
Weezy Baby, nigga, nine to five, ten to six

[Hook: Juelz Santana]
All night, I can't sleep, I toss and turn
Got my hand on my pistol, when will these motherfuckers learn?
I ain't going out without a fight
I'm with whatever and I ain't going out without a fight
I'm with whatever, I ain't going out without a fight
I'm with whatever, it'd be your life before my life
At night, I can't sleep, I toss and turn
Got my hand on my pistol, when will these motherfuckers learn?

[Verse 2: Juelz Santana]
It's showdown time, throwdown time
Safety off, four pound time
Clack clack, go get yours, I'll go get mine
Check it man, I'm with whatever
Goodness gracious, the paper
Where the cash at? Where the stash at?
I'll blow that ass back for fronting on a nigga like me
You got nothing on a nigga like me, you'll see
I'm on the grind from sun up to sun down
If I'm lying, may lightning come down and strike me right now
I'll turn a dollar to a twenty to a fifty to a hundred
Keep it coming 'til I'm full on my stomach
I'm stuck in my ways, I'm stuck puffing my haze
Hand on my pistol, front of it sprays
I'm stuck living the life of a ghetto nigga
Trying to get rid of the life, alright?

[Hook: Juelz Santana]
All night, I can't sleep, I toss and turn
Got my hand on my pistol, when will these motherfuckers learn?
I ain't going out without a fight
I'm with whatever and I ain't going out without a fight
I'm with whatever, I ain't going out without a fight
I'm with whatever, it'd be your life before my life
At night, I can't sleep, I toss and turn
Got my hand on my pistol, when will these motherfuckers learn?

[Verse 3: Notorious B.I.G]
As I grab the Glock, put it to your head piece
One in the chamber, the safety is off, released
Straight at your dome, holmes, I wanna see cabbage
Biggie Smalls the savage
Doing your brain cells much damage
Teflon is the material, for the imperial
Mic gripper, girl stripper, the Henny sipper
I drop lyrics off and on like a light switch
Quick to grab the right bitch and make her drop with you
.45 Glocks and Tecs are expected when I wreck shit
Respect is collected, so check it
I got techniques dripping out my butt cheeks
Sleep on my stomach so I don't fuck up my sheets
My shit is deep, deeper than my grave, G
I'm ready to die, and nobody can save me
Fuck the world, fuck my moms and my girl
My life is played out like a Jheri curl
I'm ready to die

[Hook: Juelz Santana]
All night, I can't sleep, I toss and turn
Got my hand on my pistol, when will these motherfuckers learn?
I ain't going out without a fight
I'm with whatever and I ain't going out without a fight
I'm with whatever, I ain't going out without a fight
I'm with whatever, it'd be your life before my life
At night, I can't sleep, I toss and turn
Got my hand on my pistol, when will these motherfuckers learn?

You're sitting all alone, and you call me on the phone
And you say, "I need love, can you get to me now?"
Sitting all alone, and you call me on the phone
And you say, "I need love, can you get— now?"
You're sitting all alone, and you call me on the phone
And you say, "I need love, can you get to me now?"
Sitting all alone, and you call me on the phone
And you say, "I need love, can you get to me now?"
You're sitting all alone, and you call me on the phone
And you say, "I need love, can you get to me now?"
Sitting all alone, and you call me on the phone
And you say, "I need love, can you get—"

[Verse 1]
One baby to another says, "I'm lucky to have met you"
I don't care what you think unless it is about me
It is now my duty to completely drain you
I travel through a tube and end up in your infection

[Chorus]
Chew your meat for you
Pass it back and forth
In a passionate kiss
From my mouth to yours
I like you

[Verse 2]
With eyes so dilated, I've become your pupil
You taught me everything without a poison apple
The water is so yellow, I'm a healthy student
Indebted and so grateful, vacuum out the fluids

Chew your meat for you
Pass it back and forth
In a passionate kiss
From my mouth to yours
I like you

Truth covered insecurity
I can't let you smother me

And I've got this friend, you see who makes me feel
And I wanted more than I could steal
I'll arrest myself, I'll wear a shield
I'll go out of my way to prove I still
Smell her on you

[Verse 2]
Don't tell me what I wanna hear
Afraid of never knowing fear
Experience anything you need
I'll keep fighting jealousy
Until it's fucking gone

I've got this friend, you see who makes me feel and I
Wanted more than I could steal
I'll arrest myself, I'll wear a shield
I'll go out of my way to prove I still

And I wanted more than I could steal
I'll arrest myself, I'll wear a shield
I'll go out of my way to make you a deal
We'll make a pact to learn from who
Ever we want without new rules
And we'll share what's lost and what we grew
They'll go out of their way to prove they still
Smell her on you
They still smell her on you
Smell her on you

Said... good

[Verse 1]
I'll start this off without any words
I got so high, I scratched till I bled
I love myself better than you
I know it's wrong so what should I do?
The finest day that I've ever had
Was when I learned to cry on command
Love myself better than you
I know it's wrong so what should I do?

[Chorus]
I'm on a plain
I can't complain
I'm on a plain

[Verse 2]
My mother died every night
It's safe to say, don't quote me on that
I love myself better than you
I know it's wrong so what should I do?
The black sheep got blackmailed again
Forgot to put on the zip code
Love myself better than you
I know it's wrong so what should I do?

[Chorus]
I'm on a plain
I can't complain
I'm on a plain

[Bridge]
Somewhere I have heard this before
In a dream my memory has stored
As a defense I'm neutered and spayed
What the hell am I trying to say?

[Verse 3]
It is now time to make it unclear
To write off lines that don't make sense
I love myself better than you
I know it's wrong so what should I do?
And one more special message to go
And then I'm done and I can go home
Love myself better than you
Know it's wrong so what should I do?

[Chorus]
I'm on a plain
I can't complain
I'm on a plain
I can't complain
I'm on a plain
I can't complain
I'm on a plain
I can't complain
I'm on a plain

[Verse 1]
I am buried up to my neck in
Contradictionary flies
I take pride as the king of illiterature
I'm very ape and very nice
If you ever need anything please don't
Hesitate to ask someone else first
I'm too busy acting like I'm not naïve
I've seen it all, I was here first

[Chorus]
Out of the ground
Into the sky
Out of the sky
Into the dirt

[Verse 2]
If you ever need anything please don't
Hesitate to ask someone else first
I'm too busy acting like I'm not naïve
I've seen it all, I was here first

[Chorus]
Out of the ground
Into the sky
Out of the sky
Into the dirt
Out of the ground
Into the sky
Out of the sky
Into the dirt

[Verse 1]
When I was an alien
Cultures weren't opinions

[Chorus]
Gotta find a way, find a way, when I'm there
Gotta find a way, a better way, I'd better wait

[Verse 2]
Never met a wise man
If so it's a woman

[Chorus]
Gotta find a way, find a way, when I'm there
Gotta find a way, a better way, I'd better wait
Gotta find a way, find a way, when I'm there
Gotta find a way, a better way, I'd better wait!

[Verse 3]
Just because you're paranoid
Don't mean they're not after you

[Chorus]
Gotta find a way, find a way, when I'm there
Gotta find a way, a better way, I'd better wait
Gotta find a way, find a way, when I'm there
Gotta find a way, a better way, I'd better wait!

[Outro]
Gotta find a way, find a way, when I'm there
Gotta find a way, a better way, I'd better wait!
Gotta find a way, find a way, when I'm there!
Gotta find a way! Aah! Aah!
Yeah!

[Verse 1]
Sell the kids for food
Weather changes moods
Spring is here again
Reproductive glands

[Chorus]
He's the one who likes all our shitty songs
And he likes to sing along and he likes to shoot his gun
But he knows not what it means
Knows not what it means
And I say he's the one who likes all our shitty songs
And he likes to sing along and he likes to shoot his gun
But he knows not what it means
Knows not what it means and I say yeah

[Verse 2]
We can have some more
Nature is a whore
Bruises on the fruit
Tender age in bloom

[Chorus]
He's the one who likes all our shitty songs
And he likes to sing along and he likes to shoot his gun
But he knows not what it means
Knows not what it means
And I say he's the one who likes all our shitty songs
And he likes to sing along and he likes to shoot his gun
But he knows not what it means
Knows not what it means and I say yeah

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
He's the one who likes all our shitty songs
And he likes to sing along and he likes to shoot his gun
But he knows not what it means
Knows not what it means
And I say he's the one who likes all our shitty songs
And he likes to sing along and he likes to shoot his gun
But he knows not what it means
Knows not what it means
Knows not what it means
Knows not what it means and I say yeah

[Verse 2]
No, I won't let you stay
Thanks for the hours, thanks for the days
If I see your eyes, I turn to stone
I look away, I gotta go
Gone for the week, don't bother
'Til pigs fly, she'll keep on callin'
I been workin' for me, not sorry
Next time that we speak'll be calmly
Next time that I go in, I'm all in
Why you so close but you feel so far?
You look the moon in the mornin'
Jaded, faded, almost gone

[Pre-Chorus]
Restin' while I'm inside your presence
I don't wanna think nothin' bad
Goodnights are never really good nights, nights, nights
Feel something that's heavy inside

[Chorus]
Five A.M. when I walked in (Walked in)
Could not believe what I saw, yeah (Saw, yeah)
You were on another one's body (Body)
Ghosts of the past came to haunt me (Haunt me)

[Verse 1: Anderson .Paak]
Nothing's safe when your numbers change
Keep it low or pay the fee
Niggas talking but it's not too often that they living what they speak
Good pussy kept me entertained
Money came then it went away
Lord see over everything (Over everything?)
Am I my brother's keeper (Am I my brother's keeper)
You know everybody gotta eat, bruh
I wanna live on ahead, if not a cloud in the air
The right side of the chair
If Jesus would've had a better lawyer would he have to see the cross
I hope your niggas is true, I hope they don't do you like Judas
I pray to God
Pain wearing off, sleeping while I talk
Laid in the arms, woke up at the top
I wanna live on ahead, if not a cloud in the air
Right side of the chair

[Outro: Anderson .Paak]
(How I ever, ever let you go)
(How I ever, ever let you go)
(How I ever, ever let you go)
(How I ever, ever let you go)
I'm running through changes, is it strange
(How I ever, ever let you go)
To be baited, shit I'm grown
(How I ever, ever let you go)
But still a fade
(How I ever, ever let you go)
Shootin' off with no marks
(How I ever, ever let you go)
If I hit, there's no mistakes, yeah
(How I ever, ever let you go)
Huh, baby
(How I ever, ever let you go)
I'm running through changes, daily
(How I ever, ever let you go)
Every day, ohh, ohh now
(How I ever, ever let you go)
I'm running through changes
(How I ever, ever let you go)
Through change
(How I ever, ever let you go)
Every day
(How I ever, ever let you go)
Will it stay
(How I ever, ever let you go)
I'm running through changes
(How I ever, ever let you go)
Will it change
(How I ever, ever let you go)

[Chorus: Doja Cat]
Day to night to morning, keep with me in the moment

You got to keep me focused; you want it? Say so

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Call 'em Nestlé, they crunchy, man

Ain't talkin' medicine, but I made him more a fiend

When I run up in this spot, bitches know they place
Slide on a nigga, I'ma need my skates
Social distance, I'ma need my space (Uh)
I done did it, I won with it
I made peace with myself, at one with it
I can't let a goofy nigga come dump in it
I told boy shoot his shot, bust guns in it (Brrr)
I mean I know that you feelin' me, I can tell that you feelin' me
Acting like you was deadin' me, boy, you really be killin' me
How you diggin' me, iggin' me, boy, you gotta be shittin' me

[Chorus: Doja Cat]
Day to night to morning, keep with me in the moment

Didn't even notice, no punches left to roll with
You got to keep me focused; you want it? Say so (Yeah)

[Verse 2: Doja Cat]
Let me check my chest, my breath right quick (Ha)
He ain't ever seen it in a dress like this (Ah)
He ain't ever even been impressed like this
Prolly why I got him quiet on the set like zip
Like it, love it, need it, bad
Take it, own it, steal it, fast
Boy, stop playing, grab my ass
Why you actin' like you shy? (Hot)
Shut it, save it, keep it pushin'
Why you beating 'round the bush?
Knowin' you want all this woman

All of my niggas sayin' you mad committed
Realer than anybody you had, and pretty
All of the body-ody, the ass and titties

Lyrics from Snippet:

[Verse]
Long blonde hair, daddy's a millionaire
Nobody knows her, but everybody wants to
That's what I see
Europe trips, kissing the dream boy's lips
Successful with a smile
She's everything that I'll never be

[Chorus]
Twenty-first century girls are perfect
And I know it isn't real, it's all so stupid
But digital love, it still feels real to me
She looks like an angel, it's what they'll believe
Twenty-first century girls are flawless
And I say I didn't care, but if I am honest
It's hard not to feel like I'm never enough
Yeah, I want that twenty-first century love
We played the garden in New York City
We rocked the house down in New Orleans
We think about the ones we lost along the way
As we're rolling down the road with Mr. Breeze

I have seen a million faces
All staring back at me
And every night we hear them singing Alabama
And I feel the spirits standing next to me

Woh-woh-woh, they're still with us
Woh-woh-woh, we're never alone
Out here on '75 keepin' the dream alive
Highway brothers and midnight riders
We're the last of the street survivors

From California to Carolina
Overseas back to Tennessee
Standing here on the stage I wanna testify
They got the music never went away
Woh-woh-woh, they're still with us
Woh-woh-woh, we're never alone
Out here on '75 keepin' the dream alive
Highway brothers and midnight riders
We're the last of the street survivors

Woh-woh-woh, they're still with us
Woh-woh-woh, we're never alone
Out here on '75 keepin' the dream alive
Highway brothers and midnight riders
Yeah, highway brothers and midnight riders
We're all just street survivors
Yeah, survivors

[Verse 1]
I like the snake on your tattoo
I like the ivy and the ink blue
Yayo, yeah, you, yayo
You have to take me right now from this dark trailer park life now
Yayo, how now, yayo

[Chorus]
Put me onto your black motorcycle
'50s baby doll dress for my "I do"
It only take two hours to Nevada
I wear your sparkle, you call me your mama
Let me put on a show for you, daddy
Let me put on a show
Let me put on a show for you, tiger
Let me put on a show

[Verse 2]
I need you like a baby when I hold you
Like a druggie, like I told you
Yayo, yeah, you, yayo

[Chorus]
Put me onto your black motorcycle
Fifty baby doll dress for my "I do"
It only take two hours to Nevada
I wear your sparkle, you call me your mama
Let me put on a show for you, daddy
Let me put on a show
Let me put on a show for you, tiger
Let me put on a show

[Bridge]
Hello, heaven, you are a tunnel lined with yellow lights
On a dark night (Dark night)
Yayo, yeah, you
Yayo

[Chorus]
Put me onto your black motorcycle
Fifty baby doll dress for my "I do"
It only take two hours to Nevada
I wear your sparkle, you call me your mama
Let me put on a show for you, daddy
Let me put on a show, yeah
Let me put on a show for you, tiger
Let me put on a show
(Hmm, hmm, hmm)
Lyrics from Snippet

[Verse]
Found these versions, making me feel so 

[?]
Self-medicating, but I don't think they'll find it
Turns out I found peace in the dark but now I'm waking up on top floors
Morning 

[?], the morning and the morning
What am I doing this for? What am I doing this for?

[Chorus]
Okay, four in the morning like a ghost
Oh yeah, 

[?] the most
Okay, here we go again
Seeing it all, seemingly fall, babe
Lyrics from Snippet

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Me and my boys, we dressed like Bow Wow, keep it in my bag

Me and my boys, me and my boys, boys, boys, boys

[Post-Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Me and my boys, me and my boys
Me and my boys, me and my boys

Me and my shawty

[Intro: Kevin Abstract]
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey

[Chorus]
And if I had to do it all again
I would call you and tell you I loved you a little more
Now and then I think about you and I want to be your friend
Do you like the sound of that?

[Verse: Kevin Abstract]
Ice cold, I told you I'm ice cold
Find another way to put all these diamonds on
Lookin' through the window like, baby, I'm shinin', whoa
I know that you wish that I could come home
I almost 

[?], I wanna 

[?], yeah
I like to 

[?], you niggas is my

Fell like if time would froze, I feel like the mind and souls
It's too late and now it's time to go home

[Bridge: Kevin Abstract]
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey

[Chorus]
And if I had to do it all again
I would call you and tell you I loved you a little more
Now and then I think about you and I want to be your friend
Do you like the sound of that?

[Bridge]
Run while you can, little boy
Run while you can, little boy, it's a cruel cruel world
Run while you can, little boy
Run while you can, little boy, it's a cruel cruel world
I know, I know, I know

[Chorus]
And if I had to do it all again
I would call you and tell you I loved you a little more
Now and then I think about you and I want to be your friend
Do you like the sound of that?

[Outro: Kevin Abstract]
Mhh, I do, I do, I do like the sound of that
Lyrics from Snippet

[Ryan Beatty]
Feels like there's somethin' between us
Looks like there's somethin' I dreamed of
When I explain what I'm feelin'
Nobody, nobody understands
Nobody, nobody understands
Nobody, nobody understands
Nobody, nobody understands

[Verse: Kevin Abstract]
If you want me by your side, by your side, then I'm ridin' with you
Baby, I'm ridin', yeah-yeah, baby
If you let me spend that night then I'm down to sit in silence with you
Down to sit in silence, down to sit in silence
If you want me by your side, by your side, then I'm ridin' with you
Baby, I'm ridin', yeah-yeah, baby
If you let me spend that night then I'm down to sit in silence with you
Down to sit in silence, down to sit in silence

Lyrics from Snippet

[Verse: Kevin Abstract]
Uh, technical difficulties
Me and my niggas been thinkin' about, yeah
Gettin' up out of this house, hey
I've been thinkin' about Enrique
And Davion, man, yeah
I love this song, man, yeah
Iove the brackets, got all my niggas back together
Love to have it, love to see it
How you been? Still dreamin'
European, my daddy texts me a bunch
Am I ever text a nigga back?
Back, back, back in the day
All of a sudden, that's before, 'fore, yeah, back
Stuck in heaven, tryin' peaches just like, hey
Still young, hopin' it is
Feelin' back home, handle my business
I had the vision but hey, man, I guess you can't do the business
Think back to house, still, these are my niggas for real
This is that real, real, real
Sittin' on top of the ceilin'
This is my nigga, for real, those are my family, sure
Think I'll marry 'em, yeah
This is my nigga, for real
Those are my family, sure
Think I'll marry 'em, yeah

[Verse 2: Ryan Beatty]
Flyin' through the breezes
Only wind can touch my skin
All these roses that come, back to back in my head
But something's missing
But time still tickin'
And it's breakin' me slow, my Lord
Caught crying in the corner
But something's missing

[Interlude: August Royals]
Give me some free time. Feel like I'm stumbling again
Let me see some red lights 

[?]
It's like I'm goin' ninety-five in a school zone
Too fucked up to realize I'm speeding, impacting lives, I jeopardize everybody I run into, what?
No matter where I go tonight, Can't get away I
Just another sleepless night (just another, just another just another)
Got people crashing around me, gettin' lit up like a b-day candle. Remember when we were five and bein' lit was something that didn't involve no Grey goose handle?
Life changes, man, not for the best. Nostalgia is innocent, something you could never repossess
I still start dancing in the rain. Other times I wish I was a teardrop, though
Maybe a raindrop ain't so bad falling from the sky
Sometimes I think about fallin' from the sky myself, and it's not in the right way
Nobody asked me to be this way, I'm just inside
Lyrics from Snippet

Girl, I can't play it, I'm tryin'
Now you're beggin' me for my time
Now you want my attention
Don't know your intentions
You don't seem to get it and I don't think that you are the world
Start thinkin' 'bout life, now I'm wearin' Prada
And I'm almost dyin'
Is it even worth tryin'

We put up a fight
But I gotta say goodbye
And baby, it doesn't have to be
Baby, it doesn't have to be
Do it to my life
Can you do it to my life?
Baby, it doesn't have to be
I know when I gotta go, now

[Verse 1]
I just want you to keep it real for me
Keep this shit trill for me
Wouldn't be fuckin' me so good if you ain't still love me
Lil' mama kill for me
Lil' mama drill for me
When these niggas try to knock me, lil' mama feel for me
'Cause I can see this shit clearly from out these Cartiers
Want me to beat that pussy redder than Lil Yachty hair
Gon' see you home, don't hit your phone, I know you probably there
I'm Derek Jeter when I hit that pussy outta here, yeah

[Chorus]
Tryna show you, we just need some conversation
Good love, good sex, communication
'Cause when I'm down, girl I be goin' through these phases
'Cause when I'm down, girl I be goin' through these phases
We just need some conversation
Good sex, good love, communication, ayy
'Cause I be goin' through these phases, yeah
I be goin' through these phases
Tryna show you, we just need some conversation
Good love, good sex, communication
'Cause when I'm down, girl I be goin' through these phases
'Cause when I'm down, girl I be goin' through these phases

[Verse 2]
I be goin' through these phases
Knowin' you amazin', goin' through these stages
Feelin' like I lost my mind, goin' through these mazes
I ain't wanna change, but you told me it'd be changes
First time we fell in love, girl, we was strangers
When I got to cuffin', you started gettin' dangerous
You ain't wanna trip about no bitches in my playlist
I ain't wanna trip about no niggas on your pages
I ain't wanna trip about no dick all in your dayshift
.30 on my hip, it get the same amount of danger
You ain't tryna change me and I ain't tryna change ya
There's things we can't change, shawty I ain't tryna change 'em, ayy

[Chorus]
Tryna show you, we just need some conversation
Good love, good sex, communication
'Cause when I'm down, girl I be goin' through these phases
'Cause when I'm down, girl I be goin' through these phases
We just need some conversation
Good sex, good love, communication, ayy
'Cause I be goin' through these phases, yeah
I be goin' through these phases
Tryna show you, we just need some conversation
Good love, good sex, communication
'Cause when I'm down, girl I be goin' through these phases
'Cause when I'm down, girl I be goin' through these phases

[Outro]

[Chorus: Davo]

[Verse 1: Tory Lanez]
Do you remember?
I was stackin', tryna get my M's up
Niggas snake and I don't need no friends though
They never, ever with you when the ends low, uh
Niggas hated on a young nigga
'Cause when I walk in, we don't pay, 'bout to go and get it
'Cause why I'm wicked, all my niggas, will be gone, nigga
And ain't goin' back to sleepin' on that floor, nigga, you don't hear me
Down Miami with my young nigga
And it gotta be this way because just how I'm livin'
Can't let no nigga come up on me with the thang, nigga
And now them bitches actin' like they wasn't hatin' a nigga, hold up
Oh, now you don't remember?
All my fucked up nights in December
Don't be actin' like it's somethin' I can lend you
When you see me top down in the Bent', bro, do you remember, shawty?

[Chorus: Davo]
Do you remember? (Yeah)

Roll up on 'em, say you better have Berettas
'Cause my youngins rockin' with that heavy metal, yes
One Umbrella, that's forever, yeah
Mama told me never let up
For my niggas dead and gone, never forget you
Pourin' up some Henny, fuckin' up my section, yeah
I remember, cold as the winter
Fallin' like timber
None of you niggas really was my dawgs, just pretenders
Feel like I'm livin' in the dark
Fuck 'em all, I ain't got no feelings in my heart, not at all
And I remember we was hittin' licks
Me and my niggas, he was really with the shits
Now we takin' trips and switchin' foreign whips, throw it up
But I don't remember now I'm filthy rich, no

[Chorus: Davo]
Do you remember? (Yeah)

Uh, steps out the pad with the dufflebag, all the guns I had
Sippin' Granddad, 'bout to make his momma sad
I can't stand him and I don't know him
And he don't even know I'm 'bout to blow him, 'bout to show him
What goes around comes around, he should've thought about it
Now he got to talk to God about it
I mean this, nothing between this four-fifth and the head center
I got a scope with the infa
Boom, boom, coward niggas got to meet they fate
The faggot got "Jason" on his license plate, motherfucker
And he parkin', pass the gat, I'm 'bout to spark him
Lord forgive me, beg your pardon
Hey, playboy!

Light out wanderlust
Head across to sea
Captain says there'll be a bust
This one's not for me

Light out wanderlust
Head across to sea

Wanderlust
Well I liked to smile when I was a pup
Sailing down the Nile in a china cup
With the recipe for a lovely day
Sticking out of my back pocket

But it wasn't always such a pretty sight
'Cause we used to fight like cats and dogs
Till we made it up in the ballroom

Ballroom dancing made a man of me
One, two, three, four
I just plain adore your ballroom dancing
Seen it on TV
I got what I got from ballroom dancing
Big B.D

Well I used to fly when I was a kid
And I didn't cry if it hurt a bit
On a carpet ride to a foreign land
At the time of Davy Crockett
But it wasn't always such a pretty sight
'Cause we used to fight like cats and dogs
Till me made it up in the ballroom

Ballroom dancing made a man of me
One, two, three, four
I just plain adore your ballroom dancing
Seen it on TV
I got quite a lot from ballroom dancing

With a hundred miles to go
Sole survivor carrying the load
Switches on his radio

Take it away
Want to hear you play 'til the lights go down
Take it away
Don’t you want to stay ’til there's no one else around?
After hours late in the bar
By a darkened corner seat
Two more customers from a car
And they request one last beat

Take it away

The pound is sinking, the peso's falling
The lira's reeling and feeling quite appalling
The pound is sinking, the peso's falling
The lira's reeling and is feeling quite appalling

The market's bottom has fallen right out
And only the strong are survivors

The pound is sinking, the peso's falling
The lira's reeling and feeling quite appalling

The market's bottom has fallen right out
And only the strong are survivors

Well, I fear, my dear, that it's eminently clear
That you can't see the trees for the forest
Your father was an extraordinary man
But you don't seem to have inherited many of his mannerisms
Any of his mannerisms

The pound is sinking, the peso's falling
The lira's reeling and feeling quite appalling

Good mornin' (Mornin', mornin')

[Verse 1]
Yeah, wake up in God we trust
I pour some liquor in my coffee cup, I roll the weed and spark it up
This sober life is not for us, it's all because I got's to bust
Like havin' sex with Playmates
She wanna have some lunch tomorrow, can't afford my day rate
(Well, well, well)
No apologies, it's me, my money and astronomy
I wake up like this crazy life might kill me
I'm tryna to change the world, they busy tryna take a selfie
I'm so deep inside this hole
There's no one down enough to help me
Other than Hell, I be's the hottest
But I make it snow in August, don't proceed with caution
Loose cannon, Hulk shit, I'm Bruce Banner (Banner, Banner)
The way the music hit you like the room dancin'
Me and my dawgs, we hungry, must be a huge famine
Crib in the Hampton's, one right out in Malibu
Pays to be an artist, it all started on Penn Ave
Yeah, the volume up, the sound is drownin' you (Drownin' you, drownin' you)
I just gotta lay back and (And, and, and)

[Chorus]
I roll some weed and blow my mind away (Way, way), yeah
Find the shit I'm tryna say, yeah
I roll some weed and blow my mind away (Way, way), yeah
I pray to God he help me find my way, yeah
I roll some weed and blow my mind away (Way, way), yeah
In the whip, I almost hydroplaned, yeah
I roll some weed and blow my mind away (Way, way), yeah
I pray to God she help me find my way

[Verse 2]
Yeah, before I started, regarded as one of the hardest in the yard
No money from a job, I was distracted by these broads
She said, "You want that pussy? Then walk the plank," and
I dove into that ocean, I saw her naked in the Hall of Angels
Chasin' lion, tigers, caught a Bengal
Best finagle the bagel, ready, willin', and able
Fillin' ya cable with destructions, spontaneous combustion
Alien abductions, plus what the fucks in
Platinum plus rappers
Say "Hi" when you see me, won't be say nothing after
I'm a motherfuckin' bastard, uh
Master of disguise, word to the wise, don't fuck with me
You the rich and comfortably, we out back, dungaree
Motherfucker please don't even think to try me
My mind is somewhere else, they pumpin' "crazy" in my IV, yeah
You either with me or behind me, from up here the world look tiny, shit

[Chorus]
I roll some weed and blow my mind away
Find the shit I'm tryna say, yeah
I roll some weed and blow my mind away
I pray to God he help me find my way, yeah
I roll some weed and blow my mind away, yeah
In the whip, I almost hydroplaned, yeah
I roll some weed and blow my mind away, yeah
I pray to God she help me find my way (Way, way, way, way)
Are lilacs still your favorite flower?
Because I picked them, and I brought them in
Do you still get heart flutters and butterflies?
Because I’m watching, and I’m wondering
Do you light up?
Do you light up?
Do you light up when you see me?
Do you light up?
Do you light up?
Do you light up when you see me?
Lyrics from Snippet:

Said I hit the blunt in the whip
Tryna stunt with a bitch in the front
And a fifth, I'ma sip 'til I'm sick and I'm drunk
I ain't givin' a fuck, yeah, I been in a funk
Now I live like a pimp and abandon stuff
A magician to tricks, make a bitch disappear like her boyfriend comin' to the game
Pay up like the first of the month
Take what I want, everybody needs some, yeah
This how it supposed to be
How a muhfucka supposed to be
And a god gonna shine...
Aw hunni. I had a bright idea
Aw hunni. I took the long way here
Whatever it is that you say I should do
I’ll do
Whatever it is that you say I should do. I’ll do
I’ll do
I’ll do
Aw Jenni. I wonder if it all goes black
Aw Jenni, I like it when you talk like that
Could you put your hands tight around my neck and never let me go?
Could you put your hands tight around my neck? And never let me go?
Whatever it is that you say I should do. I’ll do
Ah whatever it is that you say I should do. I’ll do
Whatever it is that you say I should do. I’ll do
Ah whatever it is that you say I should do. I’ll do
Can we dance with the lights down?
Can I put my head by your head?
Can I push you out, then pull you in?
And when you tell me when, then I can dip you down
And pick you up
And spin you ‘round and ‘round again

Can we dance with the lights down?
Can I undo your shirt just a little bit…
I wanna see you step, I wanna see you smile
I wanna feel your breath
I wanna work you up a little bit…

And nobody has to know what we whisper about, nobody has to know

Come here…

And nobody has to know what we whisper about, nobody has to know
Nobody has to know

[Verse 1]
Given the circumstances
I won't ask you to stay
Given the circumstances
I would get it if you walked away

[Pre-Chorus]
But all my life, I've been looking for this
It seems fitting that things go to hell now that I've found it

[Chorus]
I don't think we're wasting time, but if you do, I'm sorry
I can see a life with you, but if you can't, I'm sorry
If four months mean nothing
If none of it counts for something, then I'm sorry
Oh, if spending every night in your bed
Has no meaning, then what are we?
Just a sorry excuse for love?
Love

[Verse 2]
Lately, the world is ending
So I won't ask for too much
Lately, the world is ending
And I find that I pretend to be okay with too much

[Pre-Chorus]
But all my life, I've been looking for this
Real funny that things go to hell now that I found it

[Chorus]
I don't think we're wasting time, but if you do, I'm sorry
I can see a life with you, but if you can't, I'm sorry
If four months mean nothing
If none of it counts for something, then I'm sorry
Oh, if spending every night in your bed
Has no meaning, then what are we?
Just a sorry excuse for love?
Love
A sorry excuse for love

We storm the ramparts with those waves of confidence
We storm the ramparts with those waves of confidence

Put your love in mine
Let your body sing
When your words won't
Tell me everything

[Verse 2]
When I ramble on
And I often do
Remind me
To travel home to you

[Chorus]
Whatever comes
When it calls
Whatever leaves

[Verse 3]
What we leave behind
Like cicada shells
Will be hollowed
And eaten by the hills

[Chorus]
Whatever comes (whatever comes)
When it calls (when it calls)
Whatever leaves (whatever leaves)

Whatever comes
When it calls
Whatever leaves

[Intro]
Fuck her, never knew her
Screw her, dump her body in the sewer
Our father, uh-huh

[Verse]
What you expected from his next of kin? (Yeah)
I'm loco bro, but ain't no Mexican
I got nines in the bedrooms, Glocks in the kitchen
A shotty by the shower if you wanna shoot me while I'm shittin'
Uh, the lesson from the Smith and Wessun is depressin'
Niggas keep stressin', the same motherfuckin' question
How many shots does it take (What?)
To make my heart stop and my body start to shake?
If I should die before I wake

[Outro]
All I want is dough and big booty hoes, ya know?
All I want is dough, big booty hoes, ya know? (Money hoes and clothes)
Funk flow, oh (Blunt smoke coming out the nose is all a nigga knows)
All I want is hoes, you know? Dough, flow (Money hoes and clothes)
All I want is dough and big booty hoes, ya know? (Big booty hoes)
All I want is dough, big booty hoes, ya know?
(Money hoes and clothes is all a nigga knows, uh)
Ain't no more verses! The fuck, y'all niggas?
Got shit rocking like I'm 'bout to just drop some new shit
A bastard child at the age of 16, get the game, yeah, man!

[Chorus]
Pullin' down backstreets, deep in your head
Slippin' through dreamland like a tourist
Pullin' down backstreets, deep in your head
Slippin' through dreamland like a tourist

[Verse 1]
That first friend you had, that worst thing you said
That perfect moment, that last tear you shed
All you've done in bed, all on Memorex
All 'round-'round your head, all 'round-'round your head

[Chorus]
Pullin' down backstreets, deep in your head
Slippin through dreamland like a tourist
Pullin' down backstreets, deep in your head
Slippin' through dreamland like a tourist

[Verse 2]
You've had too much of the digital love
You want everything live, you want things you can touch
Make it feel like a movie you saw in your youth
Make it feel like that song that just unopened you
You were ten years old, holdin' hands in the classroom
He had a gun on the first day of high school
You want something bizarre, old conceptual cars
You want girls dressed in drag, you want boys with guitars

[Chorus]
Pullin' down backstreets, deep in your head
Slippin' through dreamland like a tourist
Pullin' down backstreets, deep in your head
Slippin' through dreamland like a tourist

[Verse 3]
You see Kodachrome, you see pink and gold
You see Mulholland glow, you see in airplane mode
All 'round-'round your head, all 'round-'round your head
All 'round-'round your head, all 'round-'round your head

[Outro]
You float in the pool where the soundtrack is canned
You go ask your questions like, "What makes a man?"
Oh, it's 2020, so it's time to change that
So you go make an album and call it Dreamland

[Verse 1]
Go out tonight
Feel nice tonight
Stay out all night like it's 1996
Pull out that porsche tonight
Front with your
Buyout the bar tonight you deserve it baby, talk your shit
I know you never lie to me

[Pre-Chorus]
And you've always been faithful
I know there ain't any other guys like you
That's why I strive I i'll be your happiness
Oh yes, oh yes, oh yes
I, I need my man
To feel like he's a man
To feel the need to question
Where is or who he's with

[Chorus]
He's more than my man
He's my best friend
Don't feel the need to check on him
'Cause we got blind trust
Trust, trust, trust
We got blind trust
Trust, trust, trust
If we got blind trust

[Verse 1]
Albino-coloured glasses wearing knock-kneed shoes
Seventh church is on his head its on-headed glue
Sales in the morning, it's a case of the blues oh oh oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Albino-coloured glasses shooting knock-kneed shoes
Second pair of dockers sang inside of a hood
This is the morning, a case of the blues
This is the morning, it's a case of the blues
This is the morning, it's a case of the blues

[Chorus]
Albino-coloured glasses wearing knock-kneed shoes
Sammy tries to bargain with a celephant jew
Everyone knows it's a case of the blues
Everyone knows it's a case of the blues
Everyone knows it's a case of the blues
Everyone knows it's a case of the blues
Everyone knows it's a case of the blues

[Verse 2]
Albino-coloured glasses wearing knock-kneed shoes
Driving pair of lincoln sandals, sham leather shoe
Everyone knows it's a case of the blues
Everyone knows it's a case of the blues

[Bridge]
Albino-coloured glasses looking back-kneed shoes
Come together, sell a gender, it's pleasant to choose
Everyone knows it's a case of the blues
So watch it
She took off

[...]
So long

[Chorus]
Albino-coloured glasses with a knock-kneed shoe
Merry chives departed down the celephant jew
Everyone knows it's a case of the blues
Albino-coloured glasses wearing knock-kneed shoes
Alabaster primrose, i'm sad and i'm blue
And everyone knows it's a case of the blues

[Intro: Buju Banton]
Gargamel, flight again!

[Chorus; Buju Banton]
While mans been pimping, I've been up
You got pills and stock keep lining up
No more freeloading, time is up
Catch a 3 dog plane, man don't stifle us
Give me 20s and .380s and fly enough, come on
I seen the cutie, does she wine enough?
Gyal a can't keep her eyes den off your stuff
Move girl, or you gon' touch the Midas Touch

[Verse 1: Notorious B.I.G.]
Venue after venue, I've been through
Coming to the telly, so I can bend you
Send you to the store, condoms and more
Jealous females, call you sluts and whores
Could it be my hardcore metaphor
Make sweat pour on the bedroom floor
Open up the Lex door, jump on in
I'm kind of tired, I'ma roll blunts while you spin
You got your license, right? Aight, no swerving
Hair blonde out, Madonna style like a virgin
Splurging, Dom P., Ro-se
Much foreplay, that's my forte
Niggas see the ring, baguettes to death
She looking for a man, honey he just left
Violate me, he get beat to death
Goodfellas squeeze every shell they got left

[Chorus; Buju Banton]
While mans been pimping, I've been up
You got pills and stock keep lining up
No more freeloading, time is up
Catch a 3 dog plane, man don't stifle us
Give me 20s and .380s and fly enough, come on
I seen the cutie, does she wine enough?
Gyal a can't keep her eyes den off your stuff
Move girl, or you gon' touch the Midas Touch

[Verse 2: Busta Rhymes]
Yes, indeed, it's the inspector, so respect-a
Way the pinky diamond is shining, tickle your retina
The mack, call me Max Julien of this shit
To be exact, I'm only macking Brand Nubian chicks
Got her own paper, shorty never blowing her own ki
I ain't tricking, baby, ain't no one fr-freeloading off me
See, the pimp shit be kinda killin' em softly
If you violate, the price for that could be kinda costly
Baby girl, now, even though you look finger-lickin'
Always remember, I'm careful with every chicken I'm pickin', listen
You see my shorty always stay on the grind
Bitches be jealous of my shorty and hating what's mine
'Cause Biggie told my shorty, "You chickens is way out of line"
She gettin' money, focus on me, and she pay no mind, tricker
You think I'm bugging? Tell me, how do you figure?
I got a shorty that ain't trying to take a thing from a nigga

[Chorus; Buju Banton]
While mans been pimping, I've been up
You got pills and stock keep lining up
No more freeloading, time is up
Catch a 3 dog plane, man don't stifle us
Give me 20s and .380s and fly enough, come on
I seen the cutie, does she wine enough?
Gyal a can't keep her eyes den off your stuff
Move girl, or you gon' touch the Midas Touch

[Intro: Trey Songz]
Yeah
It's been a long time
Right Now Sound
Hitmaka!

[Verse 1: Trey Songz]
I should've seen it from the jump
Who would've knew what we'd become
You like to love me when it's easy
Then take my heart away and run (Run)
You must've took off with the chauffeur
You put your bags all in the trunk (Trunk)
I saw the Bentley pulling over (Oh)
I guess this is what you want (Want)

[Pre-Chorus: Trey Songz]
Ayy, I could cuss you out, hit my side bitch
You think she flewed out, I deny it
Nothing in my way, I decided
No, no
