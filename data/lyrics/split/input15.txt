s is strapped, with a toolie, in fact
He spit like a Uzi, rat-tat-tat
He just shot me in my back, somebody pick up my back
I think that boy from Iraq, I think y'all boys better know that
He got it on lock like a Low Jack
Heading straight for the top like a ball cap
Y'all better fall back, y'all better crawl back where y'all came from
Ain't one better than the one who can write like Langston Hughes from the brain off top
Like a bottle dude, get a hollow, where you swallow food
Get a model, bet she swallow, who? Me
Bet she goggle like a scuba diver eyes in the sea
Recognize who I be, K. Dot motherfucker
Dot motherfucker, hot motherfucker, drop top when ya popped with the Glock
On sight motherfucker, sight motherfucker, ride motherfucker, die motherfucker
When I go pop, pop
Open up, close shop like a retail spot
Everybody know I be where the money lie, eat where the money lie, shit where the money lie, sleep where the money lie
Bitch that's no lie, let the truth be told
K Dizzle, the Big Sizzle, turn beats to stoves, burn up

[Outro]
Rappers: I'm iller
Dig it, like it, love it a lot

[Verse 1: Jaden Smith]
Girl, it's almost a new year, and it's too clear
Me you and a root bear, float in my house
'Bout to count down 'cause we got a whole crew here
Yo, they 'bout to party hardy, looking for a hottie with a nice body
Oh, y'all have fun with that
And we don't need the mistletoe, we was under that
Like 20 minutes ago
And if you gave me all your love, better give me some more
'Cause the new year coming, you ain't trippin' no more
So I don't need music, rather listen to your h-h-h-h-h-h-heartbeat
Try to stop me if you want to but know you don't want to
So don't do it, don't ruin the moment I put me and you in

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber]
It's the start of the new year, baby, baby, yeah
And I know what to do with it, baby, baby, yeah
I'ma make your cheeks red when I kiss your neck
Girl, I'm never leaving, 'cause you are the best, babe
'Cause yeah, I wanna give you everything
Never fear, 'cause girl, you're coming home with me, yeah

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
5, 4, 3, 2, 1, kiss me, kiss me
5, 4, 3, 2, 1, kiss me, kiss me

[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
It's the new year me and you, dear
Yeah, I know this love was true, dear
I remember when you moved here
Everything was, oh, so new here
Yeah, I promise to be true, dear
And I'll give all my love to you, dear
Jaden Smith is to my right
That's the crew there and he's got a root beer (swag)

[Verse 3: Jaden Smith]
Got friends, called 'em all
'Cause 2012 is the year with the love
And we gon' start it off
We can get a plane today and get a car tomorrow, we don't do it small at all
No, girl, tell me what I gotta do
I can be the beat that you rocking to
I can do anything, nothing is impossible
Especially with you, girl
And I never need a new girl
This love is true girl
Aye, welcome to the crew girl
2012, I'm so excited
Mayans was lying, nobody's dying
Yeah, girl, but you knew that
Knocking at your door like "Who that?"
Yes, I love you, you say "True that"
Guys, they want you, I say "Too bad"

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber]
'Cause yeah, I wanna give you everything
Never fear, 'cause girl, you're coming home with me, yeah

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
5, 4, 3, 2, 1, kiss me, kiss me
5, 4, 3, 2, 1, kiss me, kiss me

[Bridge: Justin Bieber]
If you got a girl, put your hands up
Ladies, if you got a man, put your hands up
If you got a girl, put your hands up
Ladies, if you got a man, put your hands up, girl
2012 is the year to be better, stronger
And closer to the people around you
So grab someone special
And just, you know

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
5, 4, 3, 2, 1, kiss me, kiss me
5, 4, 3, 2, 1, kiss me, kiss me
5, 4, 3, 2, 1, kiss me, kiss me
5, 4, 3, 2, 1, kiss me, kiss me

[Intro]
B.o.B
Yeah! Mm

[Verse 1]
I'm from that city
Yup that's that city
Put Decatur on my back
Got the whole map with me
This kush came from Canada
Call that immigration
It's way too loud
We gonna need proper ventilation
Two ladies perfect symmetry
And I gave them both an A+ for participation
Back it up for Bobby, pop it on my camo
If I was a flat screen, she'd be on my channel
What's up with that toe girl what's up with that camel
She want back shots so I hit her with that ammo
Yes I am an animal, I will kill a poacher
Corpses all around me, all I see is vultures
That's just for the birds but I'm no ornithologist
But I got an eagle's eye view of the obvious
All the arrows pointed in the right direction
Dots, I just give the lines for you to connect them
No salary cap, no roof, no ceiling
I could do this in my sleep, every dream worth a million
I roll up on your poster, your CD is my coaster
Fool, kill yourself, take a shower with a toaster
Life like a movie, wasted like Gucci
Ain't on that white girl but she Susie
That Becky, that Bridget, that Kelly at once
Repetitive, gestures just all in a bunch
World Cup bottoms, trophies on the front
I roll up a bat, I could bunt with my blunt

[Verse 1]
It was a long and dark December
From the rooftops I remember
There was snow, white snow
Clearly I remember
From the windows they were watching
While we froze down below
When the future's architectured
By a carnival of idiots on show
You'd better lie low

[Chorus 1]
If you love me, won't you let me know?

[Verse 2]
Was a long and dark December
When the banks became cathedrals
And a fox became God
Priests clutched onto bibles
Hollowed out to fit their rifles
And a cross was held aloft
Bury me in armor
When I'm dead and hit the ground
My nerves are poles that unfroze

[Chorus 1]
And if you love me, won't you let me know?

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
I don't want to be a soldier
Who the captain of some sinking ship
Would stow, far below

[Chorus 2]
So if you love me, why'd you let me go?

[Outro]
I took my love down to Violet Hill
There we sat in snow
All that time she was silent still
So if you love me, won't you let me know?
If you love me, won't you let me know?

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Aye yo three blind mice get a peace sign nice
Boy my bars so clean need to rewind twice
Gotta board a spaceship just to reach my height
And soon these magazines will believe my hype
Your bars are clever, my R's are better
Play with constellations bring the stars together
Going hard forever
I'm never gonna stop
Have em' hold they breath every time the beat drop
Reebok pumps and a crew neck sweater
Got a chess board ready but you want to play checkers
Stella ella ola,clap clap clap
Tell that little chicka chicka bring that ass back
M-A-C-M-I-L-L
E-R that's how you spell
My name bitch don't you forget it
And Im'a go hard withe every sentence

[Hook]
You can get with this or you can get with that
Everytime I meet a chick, she wanna get with Mac
That’s just how it is, listen to my song
So if you feeling good, clap your hands and sing along
You can get with this or you can get with that
Everytime I meet a chick, she wanna get with Mac
That’s just how it is, listen to my song
So if you feeling good, clap your hands and sing along

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Hey, my name’s Mac and its nice to meet ya
I'm all about my cheese like a slice a pizza
So high that Im'a type of fever
Looking fresh with a new pair of Nike sneakers
Used to be the kid that they thought was a fool
Badass, momma never taught me the rules
I'm clean, you got some laundry to do
Not you ho, nobody was talking to you
On Pluto, see the way I walk on the moon
Gotta cool flow, loadin up my rocket to shoot
Like boom yo, it go bla-oww
So how the fuck you like me now
Cuz my style so unorthodox
This some ham an eggs shit, got some pork and chops
Got em going crazy like a half court shot
You hatin’ cuz I'm cool and perhaps your not

[Hook]
You can get with this or you can get with that
Everytime I meet a chick, she wanna get with Mac
That’s just how it is, listen to my song
So if you feeling good, clap your hands and sing along
You can get with this or you can get with that
Everytime I meet a chick, she wanna get with Mac
That’s just how it is, listen to my song
So if you feeling good, clap your hands and sing along

[Intro: Meek Mill]

'Cause I'm just gon' kill shit
Ayy

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Bottle after bottle (Bottle), model after model (Model)
Spending all this paper like I fucking hit the lotto (Woo)
All I know is YOLO (YOLO) nigga, that's the motto (Motto)
Ricky told me, "Get 'em," and I told him that I got 'em
And I got 'em every day, every day
Bad bitch and she gon fuck me every way, never stay
Once I hit it, then I'm dipping that-a-way, that-a-way
Young nigga from the bottom, and I never had a way
I really went from whipping 62's to whipping '62s
Ain't none of my niggas Crip, and we giving niggas the blues
We buying they hoes bags, getting they bitches shoes
You wondering why she ain't fucking, we win and, nigga, you lose
Haha! Yeah, I'm flexing (Flex!)
I pull up in a Ghost, hundred on my necklace (Bitch!)
And all my diamonds clear, they VVS-ing (Gleam)
I turn into a toilet on these niggas, they BS-ing
Two fingers, did it on 'em (Hahaha)
Hold up, I really shitted on 'em
I dropped Dreamchaser and I made a milli on 'em
It don't matter what city I'm in, I'm going Philly on 'em (Philly)
With my red P hat, nigga you know we back
I'm going to Houston, I heard that's where they cheap at
I done put them Percs down, think I'm 'bout to relapse
Just to give her dope dick and ask her for some feedback
Like “Shorty, do you love this dick? You know who you fucking with?”
Grab her by her weave, smack her ass like, "You fucking bitch"
Don’t I talk nasty? She don’t know my government
But she gon’ get this dick and chew me up just like some Doublemint
Check me, I be jumping out the coupe (Woo!), swagger through the roof (Woo!)
Bad bitches waving at me, real niggas salute (What up)
I ain’t gotta lie (Lie), they know I’m the truth
And I ain’t gotta say I’m fly, this G5 with the crew (Nyeeeer)
I’m in the air, bitch (Bitch), diamonds clear, bitch (Bitch)
Took off my Rollie and got on some Aude-mir shit (Nice)
I hear these haters talking, but I don’t hear shit
‘Cause we get them bricks and stack them up just like a pyramid

[Hook: Meek Mill]
Y’all niggas talk like bitches do (Bitch)
Same niggas in the district giving interviews (Snitches)
I got killers on my team that’ll get at you (Yeah)
For a brick or two, really put an end to you

[Verse 2: Wale]
(?)
Black 3 Cement, sag jean sitting—low
Effortless flow, a couple sum’n a show
Youngin is 21, we playing (?)
Probably fuck up your budget, yea, I’m playing with numbers
Put that shit on whatever, we running another summer
Liquor, lot of bottles, tab—you know I got it
Spend a night up at Diamonds, ain’t tricking if you got it
Designer shit, though I’m modest, astonishing to be honest
Obama shit on my arm, a presidential—you got it?
Get your revenue popping before you ever do talking
On niggas who work too hard to not show it off via flossing
Double-M-G harder than anything that you part of
This professional ball, the best you niggas is (?)
Yea I’m on that ball shit, boy you with that soft shit
‘Fore he hit the room, hear a “Vroom!” from the Porsche bitch
“On that Yamaha, pardon me, that’s Meek and them”
She say she is not a groupie, “I just wanna speak to them!”
You lying though, ha, you trying to go
Apply smoke and watch the motherfucking pride go
These little bitches is little bitches, we never love ‘em
To all the sisters with ambition, I see your hustle
I’m trying to go though, y’all already know though
Stepping on ‘em, they slept on us, I'm now NoDoz
Whoever want it, they better note that I’m so focused
A message to my opponent: they better off trying to clone us
Keep her in Chanel while your bitch is like an L
When she out, you (?), all she need is like an L
That’s why I never trust a ho, no, never me
I just wanna get some head, maybe ass ‘fore I leave
Fuck a beef, keep it moving, she easily influenced
You niggas keep sleeping, you gon’ need to meet Krueger
I can’t stand no motherfucking Hoover
I’ma keep the reefer, you can have the hookah
Versace, Medusa, I probably abuse it
Around me, my crew, your bitch probably throw two up
Party with bitches that throw parties too much
We skip right to fucking, they call you to do lunch
And what—deuce up! Out

It's every boy's dream.)

Yeah, just breathe baby
Gym Class Heroes
Ya'll Money
Weezy Baby Ya'll
*Laugh*

[Verse 1 - Lil Wayne]
Yipe Yo Ki Yah, Gitty up
As the white stallion bucks
And kicks me in my nose until my face bust, fuck
And they say that they can keep the pace up, but its
Clear as a mirror they don't want to race us
As I stare in this mirror and powder my face up
And I never ever been one to make up
Any allegations that alligators ate us
And from the spine I spit shots, you gonna need 8 cups
Game and money, call me Mr. Monopolist
Ms. Aphrodite what is your synopsis
You can be the goddess of my white castle
Reach me on the hotline and burn your nostrils
Professor cool, I bring class to gym
And since I am the hero I must save them
Him is I and I is Wayne
This isn't your brain on drugs; its drugs from the brain

[Verse 2 - Travie McCoy]
Let's go

The world is yours, so play the role
Blow the dust off this record and put the needle down slow
Our veins are cold, but we'll never grow old
Let's have a toast, and raise our drinks
No hearts on our sleeves, just eagles on our cuff links
It's such a rush to know you love me so much

[Bridge - Travie McCoy]
We'll do whatever you want to
Girl I'll make a movie star of you
You know that I could
If you let me be your Hollywood

[Hook - Travie McCoy]
We'll get high, and hide
We all lust to the glamorous
White girl so fine
Going up on the downtown line
We'll get high, and hide
We all lust to the glamorous
White girl so fine
Going up on the downtown line

[Verse 3 - Travie McCoy]
Take your razor, break down my line
Put your nose to the speaker
Now breathe in, breathe in

Clean up your nose, and face the crowd
Then kiss your mirror cause we're all stars now
Isn't it fun how music makes your lips numb?

[Bridge - Travie McCoy]

[Hook - Travie McCoy]

[Jim Valvano speech at the 1993 ESPY Awards]
"Time, time is very precious to me. I don't know how much I have left and I have some things I would like to say. Hopefully at the end I'll have something that will be important to other people too."

[Geologic]
Stand up, sit down, stand up again
Morse Code sent to God, are you listening?
He must have been too busy fixing other shit
No call, no response shows the opposite
We confess to the man who was faceless
I still do the same but to thousands of strangers
Went through some changes, some said I'm faithless
Cause I replaced the altar with a basement
I often fought the explanation of where people go when their bodies let go of the soul
Does it just turn cold?
Or do we get judged and told where to go?
And if so, how the fuck would you know if nobody came back and said I'm telling you, bro?
I could never get past the shit that was spit out the pastor's lips
And the rapper's started making more sense
I guess that's the reason that some people cringe when they kids get a hold of my shit
If the grip of a God is insistent on not questioning if he truly exists
No wonder that I got caught up in the music it filled my spirit to the brim, amen
Motha' fucker

[Macklemore]
This is my offering card
The only thing I have to offer is bars
The only time I felt like I was talking to God
Was in my Walkman walking with Nas
Alright see I be going to Sunday school every week
In the back trying to read, but see that something was off
Maybe it was cause I was trying to huddle in the yard
Preacher didn't connect when he would mumble the Psalms
I was in my head and I was bustin' with Pac
Takin' off my wifebeater and getting drunk in the park
After that part, I found God, it wasn't Jesus
Some psilocybin and the ink it released
I began to hold communion every time my music came out the speakers I used it
And it fuled my movement I believed in, voice of reason, just me and my Adidas
And I could achieve it, I put my hand over my heart, pledge allegiance
I solemnly swear by the faith that raised my since Kool Herc dropped that needle
The South Bronx, that's hip-hop's Egypt
The word of our God is manipulated and twisted by the same system
That is infiltrated and falsely interpreted Jesus
One life, one love, one God, It's us, treat your neighbor how you would want to be treated
The universal laws of God, don't look too far it's right here, us human beings
The spirits right here and I don't have to see it
Now every time I want to connect with God I put my headphones on
Then I nod, grab my pen, my pad, let it seep in, in
And that's my process
And God's always watching
Got God in my Walkman
Go ahead and top that

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Look nigga I can roll up some more weed
Or order 22 more bottles of Don P
My presidential Rolex shining, that's on Gs
The clothes that I got on are designers from overseas
I pulled up getting high, told the valet to hold my keys
Hopped out, walk in that motherfucker, bought everything that I seen
Niggas hating, bitches wishing they can get in position for some infiltration
Taylor Gang motherfucker, don't deal with no shape shift
Only real motherfuckers come up in my playlist
I keep it way too real to fuck with your fake shit
This the real right here, roll one up and face it

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa & Juicy J]
T-G-O-D
Getting high, rolling weed up for e'ryone who know me
T-G-O-D
In the club, popping bottles, blowing weed by the O-Z
T-G-O-D
And you know I'm getting cash cause I'm all about that paper
Give a fuck about a hater

[Verse 2: Lola Monroe]
T-G-O-D, peep the game from the floor seats
Here for my throne, put them bitches in the nosebleeds
(T-G-O-D), married to the money
Fornicating with the ballers and fuck a prenup like the Kobes
(T-G-O-D), educating hoes
On the what, where, hows of embodying a boss, see
Bitch I school sluts on the whats and the whos
And the guts and the shoes and how the body of a Porsche be
Now it's rock-a-bye bitches
Lights out when I'm rocking my vicious
Ass-to-waist ratio
Giuseppe shipped out in (?), rent on a (?)
(Oo-la-la-la) is the way that we rock when we doing our thing
(Oo-la-la-la) is the first class high that the Taylors bring
My circle, anti-square
Can't compare like a (?)
Ain't I there, sonning you hoes, I birth
None of you hoes have earned, none of you hoes have learned
Vicariously living through my shadows
Got them throwing more shade than a clouded out meadow
Living in a land called Lala, no Melo
Maserati sitting on lips all yellow
Smoked out interior like a cigarillo
Now these hoes wanna hang, leave them hanging like hello
(Ha ha ha ha) until my lifeless corpse in the depth of the Earth
Forever stay a real bitch and only fear God
When the Devil get to tempting me, I only hear God
And my struggles help build me, so endear eyes
Lauryn we'll forever love you, you'll forever fill hearts...
With Hip Hop

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Juicy J]
Paper, paper, paper, I'm so fucking Taylor'd
Burning dope, getting ashes on the calculator
Big wads in my pockets, money barely bend
I'm so sincere riding in a Belly Benz
Hit the booty club, drinking Sapphire gin
Juicy J don't fuck with ratchet hoes, only 10s

[Hook]

[Spoken Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
Nah, what you get outta, outta not writing your stuff down on paper, you get the more-you know the...expression, the feeling yourself. You know what you want to say; instead of reading a paper that sounds read, it sounds narrated. Unless you wanna do it narrated...

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
What if a dream was reality and reality was a dream?
And as complicated as it seems, if things we imagined actually happened?
And real life situations was artificial
They say we only living to die
Imagine if we're already dead, waiting to live, living in hell
Trying to cross over to heaven we're confusing ourselves
Planet earth's like Oceans 11, we're plottin' for the getaway

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
When my childhood friends get sent away to prison on their first offense
It's fucked up but listen, we study God but don't know him
Criticize people that work on Sundays, two jobs just to feed their kids
Well, momma's scratching lottery tickets knowing that it's just a fairy tale
Cus' we ain't gonna win
Every time that she's bubblin' in, it feels like the devil's holding a pen
(shit)
Don't mind me I'm just thinking again
Thinking out loud, thinking the opposite of proud
Cus' I'm disappointed at my self sometimes
Self-esteem gets lower than night strippers
Hard to motivate the right rhymes, inspired by true crimes
It's not a game, it's nothing to play with
Turn it off then come back the next day, it's here to stay
Struggle that is
I'm so infatuated with knowing something that's waiting after this life
That means what I'm thinking is right
Punch, loop the beat for a minute
Moment of silence for J. Dilla, he on his way home
Know he see me spillin' my heart, hope for it soon
Wait a minute K. Dot! you said turn it back on, bring it back
If dreams was reality
If it was cool for you to be a casualty
The only way that you can escape poverty
Say that I'm weird but obviously you didn't get it when I said it the first time
You're listening too far if you hear this part
I suggest you go back and press rewind
I fast forward to common thoughts of a human
Deep in my thoughts like Patrick Ewing in the paint
Look what I brought to my state that they can't bring - the industry need a fix
Stick heroin needles inside politics, this is crack music
O-pi-um, inside the veins of them, I don't abuse it
Capture each moment like film, photo-shooting all my enemies moving
Direct them to a casket
Give it to 'em only if they ask for it, if they want...
If they wanna see reality 

[haha]
I'm losing you again ain't I?
Ain't I, the perfect candidate to represent the fifty states?
Black President, they don't wanna see that
It's evident...pain is pain
We only love to hate each other that's striving for great-ness
I swear to God that we live in a Matrix
Take that blue pill then we start seeing spaceships
Kanye, west-coast niggas do it the best
Bring each other down, crab in a bucket effect
We learn to live with it I guess
I mean die with it, since we're already dead
Trying to cross over to heaven, that's what I said the first time
Get it? Now little boy I gotta sit you down
Teach you about the things that we live around
Materialistic things that we buyin' now means nothing later when the dream kick in
Fade me out, fade me out, fade me out, fade me out, fade me out, fade me out, fade me out, fade me out...

[Verse 2: Punch]
What if dreams was reality and money was love
What would we do for a buzz to maintain our sanity
Chasing the wind, striving after this vanity
Traveling, no direction, the aimless casualty
American dream or Scarface fantasy
Kilos of coke and the arms of black families
We use to it, our hearts draped in stone
A mother's dreams for her baby boy to come back home
Cus' he out pushin' that chrome, pursuing that cash
End another niggas dreams when the fo-fifth blast
Now another mother screams picking out his casket
Harsh reality, it seems like it's simple mathematics, it's not
It's trigonometry (trigganometry) divided by some real life
And he'll do it again just to get a mill' twice
The streets mowed him, can't make past that
It's not a dream it's reality, look where it's at 

[ugh]
What happened in Manhattan happens all the time
In the hood, conspiracy to cover up crime
No nickel and dime, one shot pettiness
I wrote it in my mind as a letter to the president
World trade happened on the world stage
Same stage look at us as some educated apes
On video stations women gyrating
Parading around, mind-raping the youth
Fade me out, fade me out, fade me out, fade me out, fade me out, fade me out, fade me out, fade me out...

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
What if a dream was reality and reality was a dream?
And as complicated as it seems, if things we imagined actually happened?
And real life situations was artificial
They say we only living to, die
Imagine if we're already dead, waiting to live, living in hell
Trying to cross over to heaven we're confusing ourselves
Planet earth's like Oceans 11, we're plottin' for the getaway

[Outro: Denzel Washington]
I'm the man up in this piece! You'll never see the light of da..
Who the fuck d'ya think you fuckin' with? I'm the police!
I run shit here, you just live here!

[Chorus]
Call it what you want, eh, eh, eh
Call it what you want, eh, eh, eh
I said, just call it what you want, eh, eh, eh
Call it what you want

[Verse 1]
Yeah, we're locked up in ideas
We like to label everything
Well, I'm just gonna do here what I gotta do here
'Cause I gotta keep myself free
You're ducking and moving just to hide your bruises
From all your enemies
And I'm in the crossfire dodging bullets
From your expectancies, yeah, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, we got nothing to lose
You better run and hide, yeah, you crossed the line
I got a knife behind my back, just sayin'
Ooh, we got nothing to prove
Your social guides give you swollen eyes
But what I got can't be bought, so you can just

[Chorus]
Call it what you want, eh, eh, eh
Call it what you want, eh, eh, eh
I said, just call it what you want, eh, eh, eh
Call it what you want

[Verse 2]
You've taken your words and you take your judgments
And stick 'em onto everything
If it don't conform to what you were born into
Then you run the other way
You say, "Now what's your style and who do you listen to?"
Who cares?
Well, that rat race ladder-climbing fake-face smile's
Got nothing on me, yeah, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, we got nothing to lose
You better run and hide, yeah, you crossed the line
I got a knife behind my back, just sayin'
Ooh, we got nothing to prove
Your social guides give you swollen eyes
But what I got can't be bought, so you can just

[Chorus]
Call it what you want, eh, eh, eh
Call it what you want, eh, eh, eh
I said, just call it what you want, eh, eh, eh
Call it what you want
Want, want, want, want

[Bridge]
What you want, want, want
Call it what you want, want, want
You can call it what you want
What you want, want, want
Call it what you, call it what you want
What you want, want, want
You can call it, you can call it what you want

[Outro]
Eh, eh, eh, call it what you want
Eh, eh, eh
I said, just call it what you want, eh, eh, eh
Call it what you want

[Verse 1]
Never want to stand upon myself
Never want to get in the way, I said it
I don't know what the plan is, but you can share with me
'Cause I'll be a listening ear
To everything you say, I won't turn away
And I'll listen, open up my heart and
I must say that I love you, so

[Chorus]
Ooh-la-love, I've fallen in love
And it's better this time than ever before
Ooh-la-love, I've fallen in love
And it's better this time than I've ever known

[Verse 2]
Every day is a battle I face
Strange life I live, but it's what you've decided
I give it all into your hands
Do what you will with me
And I'll, I'll smile when you speak
Remember all those times I was hoping for something?
And shaking my head from all I had done
But you never left me

[Chorus]
Ooh-la-love, I've fallen in love
And it's better this time than ever before
Ooh-la-love, I've fallen in love
And it's better this time than I've ever known
Ooh-la-love, I've fallen in love
And it's better this time than ever before
Ooh-la-love, I've fallen in love
And it's better this time than I've ever known

[Bridge]
Give it up for you, I would give it up for you
I would give it up for you, I'd do anything for you

[Chorus]
Ooh-la-love, I've fallen in love
And it's better this time than ever before
Ooh-la-love, I've fallen in love
And it's better this time than I've ever known
Ooh-la-love, I've fallen in love
And it's better this time than ever before
Ooh-la-love, I've fallen in love
And it's better this time than I've ever known

[Outro]
I have fallen in love
I have fallen in love

[Verse 1]
Rise above, gonna start the war
Oh, what you want? What you need? What'd you come here for?
Well, an eye for an eye and an 'F' for fight
They're taking me down as the prisoners riot
Eh, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Got shackles on, my words are tied
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Fear can make you compromise
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
With the lights turned up, it's hard to hide
Sometimes I want to disappear

[Instrumental Chorus]
Eh, oh, eh

[Verse 2]
When I feel kinda bad and don't want to stress
I just pass it off on ability
Well, you got what you want and what you never knew
Perfect gift from me to you
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Got shackles on, my words are tied
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Fear can make you compromise
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
With the lights turned up, it's hard to hide
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Sometimes I want to disappear

[Instrumental Chorus]

[Bridge]
(Raise up to your ability)
You never knew what I could find
What could come when we realize
I don't want to compromise
(Raise up to your ability)
Yeah, I'm scared but I'll disappear
Running around before it corners you
Like he's someone who lost his way
(Raise up to your ability)
I know that you want me
'Cause it's simple to see of my ability
(Raise up to your ability)
Yeah, you're undecided
Hey, it's the right feeling
Yeah, I don't wanna run away

[Outro]
You gotta focus on to your ability
Focus on to your ability
Gotta focus on to your ability
Focus on to your ability
Then they can't get what they want to steal
Can't get what they want to steal
Then they can't get what they want to steal
Can't get what they want to steal

[Verse 1]
Well, I've been judged, I've been a bug unknown
I know all about it, but my heart is strong
I've been away, been running to save my head
Yeah, the warrant's out and I'm almost dead
I won't say what I've already said

[Chorus]
Got to get away, yeah, the warrant's on my head
Got to get away, they want me alive or dead
Got to get away, yeah, the warrant's on my head
Got to get away 'cause they want me alive or dead

[Verse 2]
I've thought a lot about the way that they fight
Come through the phone lines, not man enough to face me
I can't stop or argue about what they say
Yeah, the warrant's out and I'm not gonna pay
I said what I'm gonna say

[Chorus]
Got to get away, yeah, the warrant's on my head
Got to get away, they want me alive or dead
Got to get away, yeah, the warrant's on my head
Got to get away 'cause they want me alive or dead

[Bridge]
Fear is like a fake friend
It warms you up and takes you in
You mouth the words but no sound comes out
And fear is like your best friend
Manipulates and takes you in
You mouth the words, no sound again
But you don't know better, you don't know better

[Chorus]
Got to get away, yeah, the warrant's on my head
Got to get away, they want me alive or dead
Got to get away, yeah, the warrant's on my head
Got to get away 'cause they want me alive or dead
Got to get away, yeah, the warrant's on my head
Got to get away, they want me alive or dead
Got to get away, yeah, the warrant's on my head
Got to get away 'cause they want me alive or dead

Looked at the clock and it said right now
Get a pound, break it down, blow it like trial
Panetela dutchie, wine in my tall glass
Young Money baby, big shit like a horse ass
Stacks in my backpack, shades on, hat back
Bugatti bat black, where they do that at?
South beach, Miami ho

My life is a video, and the women want that cameo
I just want them pantyhose and I'm higher than Geronimo
An I got the tools, tell 'em boys it can get mechanical

[Verse 4: Birdman]
Big money, make a pearl handle with two clips
Cash Money, Young Money fly, in new whips
All white pearl, money from the earl
Poppin' Don P, iced out my baby girl
Catch me in the club with my MAC and my strap on
Bitches high rollin', white doves, gettin' they freak on
Get my clap on, get my money on
Shinin' all the time, and watch me bring it home
S-s-so she love me, how we do this?
Maybach, lay back, baby, how we do this
Lauder jet, G4, high to the sky, bitch
Mo money than I've seen, no ceilings, bitch

[Chorus: Gucci Mane & Birdmans]

[Chorus]
Yet again, I'm hustling, hustling, hustling
Yet again, I'm hustling, hustling, hustling
Yet again, I'm hustling, hustling, hustling
But I can't seem to catch a dime
Take a little hit and I lose the time

[Verse 1]
I took the man and his horse and ran before he looked up
I said the light's gonna change but I'm calm and feeling warm
Now I'm sticking out my hands
And feeling weightless again
You got to push, got to shove
Got to eat before they eat me
Got the crown and the cup
Got to write to my family
And say, "I'm calm and feeling warm"
I'm not quite there, but I'm close
And it's a world of a difference

[Chorus]
Yet again, I'm hustling, hustling, hustling
Yet again, I'm hustling, hustling, hustling
Yet again, I'm hustling, hustling, hustling
But I can't seem to catch a dime
Take a little hit and I lose the time

[Verse 2]
Got the worst all behind me
Yeah, they'll never be able to find me
I'm the king of the city
I'm a roach and they're all primates
This is meal time, real life
I'm not gonna fight
No, I'm gonna start a war
I've been right, I've been wrong
My smokes have come and gone
I've been crazy, been fed enough to not wind up dead
And I'm lonely, my eyes have been closed to the world
'Cause the world's got nothing for me

[Chorus]
Yet again, I'm hustling, hustling, hustling
Yet again, I'm hustling, hustling, hustling
Yet again, I'm hustling, hustling, hustling
But I can't seem to catch a dime
Take a little hit and I lose the time
Yet again, I'm hustling, hustling, hustling
Yet again, I'm hustling, hustling, hustling
Yet again, I'm hustling, hustling, hustling
But I can't seem to catch a dime
Take a little hit and I lose the time

[Outro]
Yet again, I'm hustling, hustling, hustling
Yet again, I'm hustling, hustling, hustling
Yet again, I'm hustling, hustling, hustling

[Verse 1]
Forget your problems, lay it down, they start up
The innocence of what you are is what I want
I've ran my colors, dripped down and drained out
Tried a million things, but my heart's been shot
I hope you try to find me, I'm all spun and pacing
I know what you want to say here, so say it
Forget the words I'm speaking, just want to rearrange
So I'll just say it

[Chorus]
Ooh, yeah
I really miss you, miss you, I said
Smile at the chance just to see you again
I really miss you, miss you, I said
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
Heat stroke, death's like, the wrong things that I think are right
I never knew that I could go as far as this
I took a problem recently forgotten
I know who I had been before I slipped
Oh, I want to change it, I will live a life
That makes you smile when I'm done here and long gone
Feverish and peaking, just want to see your face
Oh, what you say? What you say?

[Chorus]
Ooh, yeah
I really miss you, miss you, I said
Smile at the chance just to see you again
I really miss you, miss you, I said
Just look at me now before I walk away
You just might miss me, miss me one day
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
I'll hold your hand when you are feeling mad at me
Yeah, when the monsters, they won't go, and your windows don't close
I'll pretend to see what you see
How long, I say, how long
Will you relive the things that are gone?
Oh yeah, the devil's on your back, but I know you can shake him off
Mmm

[Chorus]
And every day that you want to waste
That you want to waste, you can
And every day that you want to wake up
And you want to wake, you can
And every day that you want to change
That you want to change, yeah
I'll help you see it through
'Cause I just really want to be with you

[Verse 2]
You know it's funny how freedom can make us feel contained
Yeah, when the muscles in our legs aren't used to all the walking
Mmm
I know if you could snap both your fingers that you'd escape with me
But in the meantime, I'll just wait here and listen to you when you speak
Or scream

[Chorus]
And every day that you want to waste
That you want to waste, you can
And every day that you want to wake up
And you want to wake, you can
And every day that you want to change
That you want to change, yeah
I'll help you see it through
'Cause I just really want to be with you

[Bridge]
The truth cuts us and pulls us back up
And separates the things that look the same
You can fight it off, you can fight it off, you can

[Chorus]
And every day that you want to waste
That you want to waste, you can
And every day that you want to wake up
And you want to wake, you can
And every day that you want to change
That you want to change, yeah
I'll help you see it through
'Cause I just really want to be with you

[Verse 1]
Walk, little walk, small talk, big thoughts
Gonna tell 'em all just what I want
That street, two streets, I see you and me
Hanging on the empty swings
Count high, low, don't worry, my eyes are closed
I'm a superman and it's my show
One shoe, two, gonna kick with my new shoes
I'm gonna kick until I need new shoes

[Chorus]
Yeah, yeah
I said, don't stop, don't stop, don't stop talking to me
Stop, don't stop, don't stop giving me things

[Post-Chorus]
(These are one of those times when we're gonna have a lot of fun)

[Verse 2]
I run, they run, everybody run, run
And we're all just having fun
Sleigh ride, boat ride, piggyback ride
I'm gonna show 'em all how I can ride
One, two, three, close your eyes and count to four
I'm gonna hide behind my bedroom door
Crayons on walls, I'll color on them all
I'll draw until I've broken every law

[Chorus]
Yeah, yeah
I said, don't stop, don't stop, don't stop talking to me
Stop, don't stop, don't stop giving me things
Stop, don't stop, don't stop laughing about it
Stop, don't stop, don't stop

[Bridge]
Don't stop
Don't stop
Don't stop
Don't stop

[Chorus]
I said, don't stop, don't stop, don't stop talking to me
Stop, don't stop, don't stop giving me things
Stop, don't stop, don't stop laughing about it
Stop, don't stop, don't stop
I said, don't stop, don't stop, don't stop talking to me
I said, don't stop, don't stop, don't stop giving me things
I said, don't stop, don't stop, don't stop laughing about it
I said, don't stop, don't stop, don't stop with me
Hands in the air! (x4)

[KRS]
Good looking, word...
DJ Revolution, word up...
Let's do this, kid...
Here we go!

[Hook]
A good time, a good vibe, and a house with a court
Good life, good wife, a little food for thought
I need (I need) food, clothes, and a whip with rims
I need God in my life, I need family and friends
(I need) money, power, respect, I need love
I need world peace, homeless to eat, no drugs
I need every race and creed to be one
Every nation, every face and seed to see sun

[KRS]
You need to listen to this, you need to listen to Kris
You need to have peace at least, you need spiritual bliss
You need a lyrical twist, do you know what a miracle is?
Before we begin, you may need a kiss
I suggest either one from J to O-one from the lips
Either way what I'm saying, yo, is bound to uplift
You need checks, you need cash, you need intellect
You need to be moving fast, you need that big respect
You need to be rolling in a car, going to a bar that's far
Makin' the deal to make you a star
You need to ask yourself, now do you know who you are?
Where you goin'? How many steps you took so far?
You need patience, you need to control your mind
If you read and don't act, then you're wasting your time
We need better leaders, we need better preachers
We need a three-thousand dollar raise to all teachers

[Hook]

[KRS]
You need some meditation, you need rejuvenation
You need assistance right now with your situation
You need some contemplation, you need a combination
–A combination of will power and concentration
You need some syncopation, with regular relaxation
But you can't, cause you runnin' and racin' and chasin'
You need to slow down, maybe you should speed up
One sayin' "lay down," the other's sayin' "leap up"
You gotta keep up, I suggest you start to speak up
A lawyer, a doctor, a rapper — you wanna be what?
Whatever it is, you gotta visualize
You need to focus for real, and stop livin' them lies
The time you givin' them guys
You could be workin' upon the goal you hold
Yo, you must realize, yo, you need to be wise
Yo, you need to be alive, there could be no revenge or deceit in your eyes
Rise!

[Hook]

[KRS]
Gimme what I need, do it with speed
Change the situation around, plant new seeds
I roll with a righteous team of adults
Forget the insults, we plan to get results
You can call us a cult, you can call us a gang
But when it comes to Hiphop, no, you cats can't hang
When the Gatts go bang
And the telephone rang
Telling you to come to identify the remains
That's when you feel the pain
And my name comes as comfort, ease and all stress and strain
You need to know the game
You need to know the meaning of your own name
Reprogram your own brain, ask questions with no shame
How you think you gonna master your craft if you don't train?
Perfecting your skill, that's the aim
Perfect your skill, and you'll always have money and fame
C'mon!

[Hook]

What I, uhh, what I need
(House on the hill)
That's what I need
(Cash credit on my bill)
That's what I need
(All my dreams fulfilled)
That's what I need
(New whip that I can wheel)
What I need
(With the chromed out grill)
Uh huh, that's what I need
(And the girl that can chill)
That's what I need
(And my spirit all healed)

[Outro x6]
That's what I need
(That's what I need)

[Verse 1]
Sometimes life, it takes you by the hair
Pulls you down before you know it
It's gone and you're dead again
I've been in places and I won't pretend
That I'd make it out just to fall on my head
Wake up strange and take the walk downstairs
Hit the pawn up on the corner and pay for my rent
You know that I could not believe my own truth
Just show 'em what I choose, got nothing to lose, oh

[Chorus]
Yeah, yeah, and it's okay
I tie my hands up to a chair so I don't fall that way
Yeah, yeah, and I'm alright
I took a sip of something poison, but I'll hold on tight

[Verse 2]
You know those days when you wanna just choose
To not get out of bed, you're lost in your head again
You play the game, but you kind of cut
'Cause you're coming down hard, your joints are all stuck
I've tried to say that it's not the only way
I never knew if I could face myself to change
You were pacing, I was insecure
Slip and fall, I'm dodging calls, hug the prison I've been living in

[Chorus]
Yeah, yeah, and it's okay
I tie my hands up to a chair so I don't fall that way
Yeah, yeah, and I'm alright
I took a sip of something poison, but I'll hold on tight
Yeah, yeah, and it's okay
I tie my hands up to a chair so I don't fall that way
Yeah, yeah, and I'm alright
I took a sip of something poison
Took a sip of something poison, poison

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Yeah, yeah, and it's okay
I tie my hands up to a chair so I don't fall that way
Yeah, yeah, and I'm alright
I took a sip of something poison, but I'll hold on tight
Yeah, yeah, and it's okay
I tie my hands up to a chair so I don't fall that way
Yeah, yeah, and I'm alright
I took a sip of something poison
Took a sip of something poison, poison

[Outro]
Ooh-whoo-ooh-ooh, ooh whoo-ooh-ooh, ooh whoo-ooh-ooh
Ooh-whoo-ooh-ooh, ooh whoo-ooh-ooh, ooh whoo-ooh-ooh
Ooh-whoo-ooh-ooh, ooh whoo-ooh-ooh, ooh whoo-ooh-ooh
Ooh-whoo-ooh-ooh, ooh whoo-ooh-ooh, ooh whoo-ooh-ooh

[Intro]
Songbook, Songz for you
Yeah, come On

[Verse 1]
Every night up in the club, getting money with the thugs
Thought I'd never fall in love and then there was you
And I don't wanna be a player no more
Every night in the club, tricking with a different girl
Thought I'd never fall in love, then I met you
Girl, you changed my mind
One look and just one touch
And I knew she was the girl for me, like no other I had seen
They say that I'm tripping, but I know what I want
This girl here is different, she got something that they don't, yeah

[Hook]
She might be my lover
She makes me want no other
She don't care if I go to the strip club, she wanna go too
And I never met a girl like you that makes me want to settle down
They throwing me that booty, I'm already taken
There's a lot of girls up in this club, but baby I'm taken
Throwing that good ol' groupie love, I'm already taken
And it's hard as a man but I know I can, baby, I'm taken

[Verse 2]
She's the apple of my eye, keep that body on time
I know I'm a player, but she might be Mrs. Right
Plus, that girl told me, if I ever do wrong
I can have all the money, all the keys, from that day on she's through with me

[Hook]
She might be my lover
She makes me want no other
She don't care if I go to the strip club, she wanna go too
And I never met a girl like you that makes me want to settle down
They throwing me that booty, I'm already taken
There's a lot of girls up in this club, but baby I'm taken
Throwing that good ol' groupie love, I'm already taken
And it's hard as a man but I know I can, baby, I'm taken

[Verse 3]
Every night up in the club, getting money with the thugs
Thought I'd never fall in love then there was you
And I don't want to be a player no more
Every night in the club, tricking with a different girl
Thought I'd never fall in love, then I met you
Girl, you changed my mind

[Chorus]
So when they throwing me that booty, I'm already taken
So hard to look the other way, but baby I'm taken
I don't want to be a player, I'm already taken
No more, no more, baby, I'm taken

[Bridge]
None of these chicks can't fuck with my baby
None of these chicks can't fuck with my baby
Ain't none of these chicks can't fuck with my baby
No, fuck with my baby, no
Fuck with my baby, no
None of these chicks can't fuck with my baby
None of these chicks can't fuck with my baby, nuh uh
None of these chicks can't fuck with my baby
Fuck with my baby, fuck with my baby

[Chorus]
I'm already taken
I don't want to be a player, baby I'm taken
I just want to love my baby, I'm already taken
No more, I'm already taken girl, yeah
I'm already taken girl, yeah
I'm already taken girl, yeah
I'm already taken girl, yeah

[Verse 1]
My bars first degree, yours to the third

Or more like scott pippen, camaro, dippin
Bout to buy some louie luggage, shit, cuz I be trippin
Listen. I remember back when I was down on my dick

Couldn't even buy a dutch, had to buy a fuckin blunt
Just to roll up on some reggie thinkin how im gon get up
What! what!

Make me go to Neiman Marcus buy about a million pradas
All the real niggas dead, its like a million cowards
Runnin round. first rap check, buy a million choppers
I dun seen a nigga rat and get a nigga life
And still walkin round the street like that nigga
Club partyin, rose garglin, catch em wrong time
We puttin hollow heads all im em
Just imagine I was dead broke
Them bitches wouldn't give a fuck if I was dead, croaked
Thats why I grind hard so I can get a lambo
Clip full of ammo, more shots than rambo. damn tho
Why the D.A try to give me 5 to 10, locked me up
Had me upstate with ????? and them
Try again. I be out gettin to the paper
Tryna catch a million like, maafuck a hater
Sittin here contemplating if im gonna murder them
Niggas always talk that gangster shit but never hered of em

Cause many men was

And I ain't trying to do it big I'm trying to do it XL
Matter fact double X, 

[?] trying to re-up I ain't even bubble yet
Nor double yet
But you can smell the white fuming and all the oils burning
Laid back counting money as the world's turning
All my dawgs strapped, ya their steel's German
And I ain't talking Shepard spot you like a Leopard
If I ain't in the hood I'm in the lab like I'm Dexter
Trying to make them oils 

[?] then bring me back some extras

[Intro: Swizz Beatz]
1-2, 1-2, 1-2, burrr burrr
This is special, GUCCCI
Its Gucci, that’s what you mean huh..righht? right..
Ladies and gentleman, showtime

[Chorus: Swizz Beatz]
My pocket on swole, my rims on chrome
When I hit the club, everything goes
Bottles in the air, put your lighters in the air
But when I'm in here, I don’t really care
'Cause I ride on em, I style on em
I lean on em, yes, I flash on em
Yeah I know, that’s the way you like it, huh, yeah
That’s the way you love me, huh? It’s alive, it’s alive

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
It's alive, it's alive
Rims cut the eyes
I had to bring the bitch back like Frankenstein
I push weight, but Gucci don't exercise
I get extra from whippin' up extra pies
I’m in the hood like the mayor round election time
It's a suggestion, don't park your car next to mine
I’ma start when the light hit, I’m 'posed to shine
Your flow is garbage, they let me out just in time
They got a section, but none of the hoes are fine
They need to exit, don't let the grind pass you by
I run laps around lames with my shoes untied
I jump the line, walk in, and watch the crowd divide
Still stuck outside, that's the ugly side
Looked medusa in the eye and medusa died
This is top secret shit, classified
Don't blame me, Swizz was the mastermind
Can't breathe, can't breathe, Toni Braxton time
I got my chain moonwalkin', Michael Jackson time
I keep on buying ice like I lost my mind
This bloodline of mine is supposed to shine

[Chorus: Swizz Beatz]
My pocket on swole, my rims on chrome
When I hit the club, everything goes
Bottles in the air, put your lighters in the air
But when I'm in here, I don’t really care
'Cause I ride on em, I style on em
I lean on em, yes, I flash on em
Yeah I know, that’s the way you like it, huh, yeah
That’s the way you love me, huh? It’s alive, it’s alive

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
Hurry up, hurry up Gucci on the news, they say he walked out the jail rockin' stupid jewels
They try and find out what it do, admit it, you confused
Too much cash on me, hundreds fallin' out me, true
Big yellow wrists, bright as piss, bitch I’m the shit
Big Gucci called Swizz, let’s make a hit
2 things in this world I ain't ever seen
Are you a foreigner nigga? I need to help me get me me
Well if your stomach cannot tote it baby, let me breathe
Cuz I don’t check if no babe or bitch chasin' me
Excuse my French, bitch I’m so Gucci, I so fuckin' gutter
It don’t make no sense to switch for none these mother fuckas

[Chorus: Swizz Beatz]
My pocket on swole, my rims on chrome
When I hit the club, everything goes
Bottles in the air, put your lighters in the air
But when I'm in here, I don’t really care
'Cause I ride on em, I style on em
I lean on em, yes, I flash on em
Yeah I know, that’s the way you like it, huh, yeah
That’s the way you love me, huh? It’s alive, it’s alive

[Verse 3: Swizz Beatz]
Somebody said my life is it
I said nah dog, my wife is it
Now I'm back, back on 'em like I never, never left
Plus the boy right here, I'm fresh to death
And the Black Card in my back pocket
The Conaseg lookin' like a speeder rocket
Yeah, I'm zoomin' on the highway
And you should love me, I did it my way

[Chorus: Swizz Beatz]
My pocket on swole, my rims on chrome
When I hit the club, everything goes
Bottles in the air, put your lighters in the air
But when I'm in here, I don’t really care
'Cause I ride on em, I style on em
I lean on em, yes, I flash on em
Yeah I know, that’s the way you like it, huh, yeah
That’s the way you love me, huh? It’s alive, it’s alive

[Chorus]
I'm so fucking paid, I just bought the dollar sign
I'm so fucking paid, I just bought the dollar sign
I'm so fucking paid, I just bought the dollar sign
I just bought the dollar sign
I just bought the dollar sign

[Verse 1]
Please man call Obama I wanna buy the dollar sign
Just like first day of school my swag killed 'em like Columbine
The dollar signs my logo and Gucci's my clothing line
Put on that purple label polo and them hoes say damn he fine
Should be able to keep her so I keep her
Feed her treat her like a diva
My fetish in Costa Rica cuz she know that I'm a cheater
What up the cost of living
I feel like a trillion bucks
Got beef with a million fuck niggas I dont give a fuck
Put your money where your mouth is on south beach where my house is
Any where on earth my turf but I'm so down south aligator couches
A public service announcement
Gucci so fucking paid pay two stacks just for a fade
Bitches surfing on my waves

[Chorus]
I'm so fucking paid, I just bought the dollar sign
I'm so fucking paid, I just bought the dollar sign
I'm so fucking paid, I just bought the dollar sign
I just bought the dollar sign
I just bought the dollar sign

[Verse 2]
By the bar and I own the club
Stand on the bar 'cause I'm superstar
I'm so turned up can't turn me down
Blowing pounds that's higher than Jupiter
I'm hot turning up Lucifer
At club crucial in a stupid car
Every verse my flow gets stupider
My producer don't want to produce for ya
Don't juice me up no need for it
My bank account on steroids
My stash ain't got no room for it
New drop head paid cash for it
Ferrari 220 on the dashboard
Long rich nigga wait here his crash course
I pull up to the club in a fast porche
When I leave all the hoes give a sad voice
Got bills to pay and things to do
New hoes to screw and business moves
I'ma business man whats the business plan
Used to rip it in the band for the extra grand
I'm successful man hell yes I am
Dead fresh I am bought an extra lamb
And I don't never ask how much it cost
That's silly 'cause I don't really give a damn

[Chorus]
I'm so fucking paid, I just bought the dollar sign
I'm so fucking paid, I just bought the dollar sign
I'm so fucking paid, I just bought the dollar sign
I just bought the dollar sign
I just bought the dollar sign

[Verse 1]
All my life I was
Swinging for the fence
I was looking for the triple
Never playing good defense
Gunnin' for the glitter
Every hot and heavy hitter
She was never really there
So I couldn't really get her

I said factually I, I'm just a piece of it
Factually I, the very least of it

[Verse 2]
Piece of work
I was really quite a jerk
Keeping score is such a bore,
A busy mind could go berserk
Oh, feast on this
I was fishing for a hook
So I took a little trip
And I opened up the book

[Pre-Chorus]
I said factually I, I'm just a piece of it
Factually I, the very least of it
Factually I, it's just a medicine
Make you wanna cry, why don't they let us in?

[Chorus]
Be my wife
I think you're right that we should mate
Tell your friends I've got a factory of faith
Late last night I had a dream that it was great
Tell your friends I've got a factory of faith
I've got a factory of

[Verse 3]
Crack your whip
She's confessing from the hip
She was good at getting there
But not as much for round-trip
Oh all this time
I was searching for a dream
I was slippin' in and out
Of every other sex machine

[Pre-Chorus]
I said factually I, I'm just a piece of it
Factually I, the very least of it
Factually I, it's just a medicine
Makes you wanna cry, why don't they let us in?

[Chorus]
Be my wife
I think you're right that we should mate
Tell your friends I've got a factory of faith
Late last night I had a dream that it was great
Tell your friends I've got a factory of faith
I've got a factory of

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Be my wife
I think you're right that we should mate
Tell your friends I've got a factory of faith
Late last night I had a dream that it was great
Tell your friends I've got a factory of faith
I've got a factory of

[Outro]
Faith
And love
Lo-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 1]
Turn up the music 'cause this song just came on
Turn up the music if they try to turn us down
Turn up the music, can I hear it 'til the speakers blow?
Turn up the music, fill your cup and drink it down

[Pre-Chorus]

Put your hands up in the air, girl, put your hands up

[Verse 1]
Karma police, arrest this man
He talks in maths, he buzzes like a fridge
He's like a detuned radio

[Verse 2]
Karma police, arrest this girl
Her Hitler hairdo is making me feel ill
And we have crashed her party

[Chorus]
This is what you'll get
This is what you'll get
This is what you'll get
When you mess with us

[Verse 3]
Karma police, I've given all I can
It's not enough, I've given all I can
But we're still on the payroll

[Chorus]
This is what you'll get
This is what you'll get
This is what you'll get
When you mess with us

[Outro]
For a minute there
I lost myself, I lost myself
Phew, for a minute there
I lost myself, I lost myself
For a minute there
I lost myself, I lost myself
Phew, for a minute there
I lost myself, I lost myself

[Intro]

[Verse 1: David Gilmour & Richard Wright]
Ticking away the moments that make up a dull day
Fritter and waste the hours in an offhand way
Kicking around on a piece of ground in your hometown
Waiting for someone or something to show you the way
Tired of lying in the sunshine, staying home to watch the rain
You are young and life is long and there is time to kill today
And then one day you find ten years have got behind you
No one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2: David Gilmour & Richard Wright]
And you run, and you run to catch up with the sun, but it's sinking
Racing around to come up behind you again
The sun is the same in a relative way, but you're older
Shorter of breath, and one day closer to death
Every year is getting shorter, never seem to find the time
Plans that either come to naught or half a page of scribbled lines
Hanging on in quiet desperation is the English way
The time is gone, the song is over, thought I'd something more to say

[Outro/Breathe Reprise: David Gilmour]
Home, home again
I like to be here when I can
And when I come home cold and tired
It's good to warm my bones beside the fire
Far away across the field
The tolling of the iron bell
Calls the faithful to their knees
To hear the softly spoken magic spells

[Verse 1]
Blue jeans, white shirt
Walked into the room, you know you made my eyes burn
It was like James Dean for sure
You're so fresh to death and sick as ca-cancer
You were sorta punk rock, I grew up on hip hop
But you fit me better than my favorite sweater
And I know that love is mean (Oh-oh) and love hurts (Oh-oh)
But I still remember that day we met in December, oh, baby

[Chorus]
I will love you 'til the end of time
I would wait a million years
Promise you'll remember that you're mine
Baby, can you see through the tears?
Love you more than those bitches before
Say you'll remember (Oh, baby), say you'll remember
Oh, baby, ooh—I will love you till the end of time

[Verse 2]
Big dreams, gangsta
Said you had to leave to start your life over
I was like, "No, please—stay here
We don't need no money, we could make it all work"
But he headed out on Sunday, said he'd come home Monday
I stayed up waiting, anticipating, and pacing
But he was chasing (Oh-oh) paper (Oh-oh)
Caught up in the game, that was the last I heard

[Chorus]
I will love you 'til the end of time
I would wait a million years
Promise you'll remember that you're mine
Baby, can you see through the tears?
Love you more than those bitches before
Say you'll remember (Oh, baby), say you'll remember
Oh, baby, ooh—I will love you till the end of time

[Bridge]
You went out every night, and baby, that's alright
I told you that no matter what you did, I'd be by your side
'Cause I'ma ride or die, whether you fail or fly
Well, shit, at least you tried
But when you walked out that door, a piece of me died
Told you I wanted more; that's not what I had in mind
I just want it like before, we were dancing all night
Then they took you away, stole you out of my life
You just need to remember

[Chorus]
I will love you 'til the end of time
I would wait a million years
Promise you'll remember that you're mine
Baby, can you see through the tears?
Love you more than those bitches before
Say you'll remember (Oh, baby), say you'll remember
Oh, baby, ooh—I will love you till the end of time

Some say that I'm next to be the greatest
And jealousy comes with success, you can't escape it
Them dirty ass niggas will stress you when you caking
Bless you when I'm speaking
I chew one of you guys, yes nigga I'm feastin'
That young nigga beastin'
Body covered with tats and good wheats
And back to back he spits fire among liars
Flames upon lames
The same lil nigga, just playing with dumb change
You staying in one lane, I'm tearing through the streets
Hear you niggas beefing but I ain't saying not one name
That will be the day I give life to y'all lil' niggas
Some older than me, but you all lil' niggas
Going too hard for me to take a fall lil' nigga
Keep doing my thing, get you all a lil' sicker
Splits and big chipas, young but rich niggas
You want that real shit? Then fuck with Wiz nigga!

Okay

Young monster, chumps get slumped often
Nigga want to touch my flow? Fuck's wrong with him?
Bomb like Osama and them

Defeating me is an accomplishment
That's why a lot think they want it wet
But they don't really though
Man you lames playing, I do this here for really though
A damn shame is what I hear from you rap guys
But hey
That's motivation for the paper to stack high
Cause with the word play I'm that guy you can't find
Another nigga in the book to match mine (Nope)
You touch the waters and capsize--
I baptize!
Lil niggas and their whack rhymes get flat-lined
They not only can't fuck with me lyrically
Fuckers can't touch me literally
Believe that

[Verse 1: Anthony Kiedis with John Frusciante]
Bear paws and rascal power
Watching us in your garage
Big girl, you ate the neighbor
The nova is over
Wake up and play
Balleradio
Make room for Clara's bare feet
The love of a Martian

[Pre-Chorus: Anthony Kiedis]
Tick tock and waiting for the meteor
This clock is opening another door

[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis with John Frusciante]
Lots of love just keep it comin'
Makin' somethin' out of nothin'
These are the best that I—
I don't know how to say
Losin' what I love today
These are the best that I—
Lots of love just keep it comin' (Ah)
Makin' somethin' out of nothin'
These are the best that I—
I don't know what to say (Ah)
Look at what I've lost today
And these are the things that I—

[Verse 2: Anthony Kiedis & John Frusciante]
Blood flowers in the kitchen
Signing off and winding down
This Martian ends her mission
The nova is over
She caught the ball
By the mission bell
Chase lizards, bark at donkeys
The love of a Martian

[Pre-Chorus: Anthony Kiedis]
Let's bow our heads and let the trumpets blow
Our girl is gone, God bless her little soul

[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis, John Frusciante, Both]
Lots of love just keep it comin'
Makin' somethin' out of nothin'
These are the best that I—
I don't know how to say
Losin' what I love today
These are the best that I—
Lots of love just keep it comin' (Ah)
Makin' somethin' out of nothin'
These are the best that I—
I don't know what to say (Ah)
Look at what I've lost today
And these are the things that I—
(Ha-ah-ha-ah)

[Outro: Anthony Kiedis]
She's got sword in case, though this is not her Lord in case
The one who can't afford to face her image is restored to grace
Disappeared, no trace, musky tears, suitcase
The downturn brave little burncub
Bearcareless turnip snare rampages pitch color pages
Down and out, but not in Vegas
Disembarks and disengages, no loft
Sweet pink canary cages plummet pop
Dewskin fortitude for the sniffing black noses that snort and allude
To the dangling trinkets that mimic the dirt
Cough go, drink it's— It's for you!
Blue battered naval town slip kisses, delivered by duck muscles and bottlenosed grifters
Arrive in time to catch the late show
It's a beehive barrel race, a shehive stare and chase
Wasted feature who tried and failed to reach her
Embossed beneath a box, in the closet that's lost
The kind that you find when you mind your own business
Shiv sister to the quickness, before it blisters into the newmorning milk blanket
Your ilk is funny to the turnstile touch bunny
Whose bouquet set a course for bloom without decay
Get your broom and sweep echoes of yesternight's fallen freckles away!

[Intro: T-Pain & Kanye West]
(Shawty snappin') Yeah
(Damn, shawty snappin') Shawty
(Shawty snappin') Yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Yeah, snap your fingers, do your step
You can do it all by yourself

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Excuse me, but this verse has not been Russell Simmons approved, uh-uh
You won't see it on Run's house uh-uh
You won't see it at a nun's house
My New York niggas said he heard it at son's house
Talkin' 'bout how this ho is poor as my low is
Baby is my Lois, maybe I'm just bogus
'Cause she don't want you to buy her a drank
Swizz said, "She ain't got no money in the bank"
And she be standin' there 'cause it's cameras
Tryin' to show your legs off, you ain't Amerie
If I fall in love, a girl gon' live on Rodeo
Until that day, oh, she take the monorail
And I don't want no girl that will answer to "Ayo"
Make it more harder, make me put some work in
You get to flirtin', play her just perfect
Fuck a drink, I'ma buy the bar if you're worth it

[Verse 2: T-Pain & Kanye West]
Baby girl (Girl), what's your name? (Name, yeah, uh)
Let me talk to you (To you), let me buy you a drank (Yeezy, drank)
I'm T-Pain (Pain, T-Pain), you know me (Me, my nigga, what up?)
Konvict Music, Nappy Boy, ooh-wee (Number one)
I know the club (Club, one, one), close at three (Three)
What's the chance of you rollin' wit me?
Back to the crib (Crib), show you how I live (Live)
Lets get drunk and forget what we did

[Chorus: T-Pain]
I'ma buy you a drank
And then I'ma take you home with me
I got money in the bank
Shawty, what you think 'bout that?
I'll be in the grey Cadillac
We in the bed like, ooh, ooh, ooh, woah, woah, ooh, ooh
We in the bed like, ooh, ooh, woah, ooh, woah, woah, ooh, ooh, woah

[Verse 3: T-Pain]
Talk to me, I talk back
Lets talk money, I talk that
Crunk Juice Bombs, Oakley Shades
Shawty got class, oh behave
Lets get gone, walk it out (walk it out)
Just like that, that's what I'm talkin' 'bout
We gone have fun, you gone see
On that Patrón, you should get like me

[Chorus: T-Pain]
I'ma buy you a drank
And then I'ma take you home with me
I got money in the bank
Shawty, what you think 'bout that?
I'll be in the grey Cadillac
We in the bed like, ooh, ooh, ooh, woah, woah, ooh, ooh
We in the bed like, ooh, ooh, woah, ooh, woah, woah, ooh, ooh, woah

[Bridge: T-Pain]
Lets get gone

Now rock, rock, rock, rock
You can do it all by yo'self
Lets get gone
Walk it out
(Now walk it out think 'bout it, aaahhh snap!)
Now rock, rock, rock, rock
You can do it all by yo'self

[Chorus: T-Pain]

We in the bed like, ooh, ooh, ooh, woah, woah, ooh, ooh
We in the bed like, ooh, ooh, woah, ooh, woah, woah, ooh, ooh, woah
Ladies and gentlemen, we are gathered here today
To remember the life of many

What makes this world so cold?
People have to die before they even get old
Stories untold, hog with a ho
Tell the homies and the hoes to leave me alone
Cause I know that all I gotta do is stay focused, stay dedicated
I'm tryna get a bank with a better statement
And this is for the people said I'd never make it
And for the hoes who won't fuck me unless I'm famous
Mind educated by the world around it
Been elevated in the Himalaya mountains
So now I'm drinking from the fountain of life
They wonder "why this white boy stay sounding so nice?"
Maybe cause I was meant to speak the truth to em
Over melody, I'm in the booth flowing
With a pen and a pad and a glass of some gin
Me to music like this hat to a brim
Clean and simple, I can't be separated
You got a dream, but you scared and you yet to chase it
So you ain't going nowhere fast
Think you fresh cause your clothes got Polo tags?
I'm on a journey boy, I don't look back
Plus I'm fresher than a laundromat, now look at that
I can change the world on a Monday through a Friday
And turn around and get fly straight 5 days
Just gotta do this shit my way
You ain't an artist cause you got your own MySpace
Please don't waste my time
And if you got a lot of hobbies, don't say you grind
Cause you way behind, I'm on my way to shine
In a hurry, ain't taking my time
Cause I waited long enough, my time is now
All these bloggers online tryna find my style
"He a stoner, he don't know shit
Ain't a struggle in his life he gotta cope with"
I'm just telling you what's in my mind
Cause I'm finna be the best when I'm in my prime
Now they got the High Life playing in rewind
Say I'm something of a different kind...I guess
Homework must've slipped my mind
Where the fuck you find a young'un who can spit like I?
My button down shirt equipped with a tie
Cause boy, I'm on the business side
Young entrepreneur, no Diddy though
Who makes movies while you making home videos
I just wanna let my whole city know
That a young boy finna blow
You either with me or against me
The death of the emcee
Jello! Jello! Jello!

[Hook: Far East Movement] & (Rye Rye)
Ello, ello We downtown L.A ghetto

Girl shake that A, Jello!
Jello! Jello! Jello!

[Verse 1: Far East Movement]
Hola, Yo ma, I'm on the east side coolin' with my chola

Hey let's get closer
Turn around, spread it out, yoga
Make the kids turn rock, boulder
Bang bang we will yoda

[Interlude (2x): Rye Rye]
Pour it out, tip it up
Keep that drink up in my cup
Pour it out, tip it up
Keep that drink up in my cup

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Far East Movement]

Cherokee chick called me long fellow
Hit her with the stick, now she call me donatello

[Verse]
Girls look better in a real tight sweater
Gambino on the mic make the pussy much wetter
Try to get the girls, call the guy go getter
Tight jeans and Converse sneakers (tight sweater)
No cheddar, go home in a rogue letter
It's a college center, so my financial aid's better
You better dead her, yo that girl's going crazy
She got a twinkle in her eye like she want to have a baby
Maybe I should call her up on a Saturday
Take her to a dinner and a movie, Braves game
Maybe we can call her up again
You looking good girl, you should bring your friends
And I don't really talk shit, I'm a douche and a bad rapper
I'd act faster, but my tongue's in a black plaster
If your girl shops in sizes that are too small for her, let her
Cause girls look better in a real tight sweater

[Intro: A$AP Rocky]
Hey lady, got something for you to buy now

Come, listen, yeah I can be your E-pill

She say that my pipe is crack and you know I'm gon' get very ill
So I just penetrate and hit her with my needle
She need ill, to stay alive, keep my crack in between her thighs
When she smoke she feel her high, delicate enough to make her cry

Get it how live it when you know you need the hook up
I can get it cook up, know I got you shook up, ooh

Put me in your nose, inhale my aroma
Shit so potent, shit stronger than ammonia

She fine and she goin' crazy, I'm throwing money
Compound to the velvet, I think I'm Elvis
I always keep green around me like I'm a Celtic
Kamals to the gold room I be bottle poppin'
20 grand all in hundreds, I'm going shopping
Rain to the blue flame bitch I get it poppin'
Come ride with the Gucci man, I'll take you club hoppin'

[Verse 1]
Baby, come fuck me with girl I'm going clubbin'
Thirties above the skirties but they ain't scrubbin'
Bottles, they keep you coming cause I be thuggin'
I'm feeling all on her titties, we kissing cousins
Blaze our way to the Libra, back to the Cheetah
You know the procedure when I be smoking reefer
My money is doing push-ups, is doing chin ups
I got vanished from Club Vanquish and went to Pin Ups
My diamonds, they're shining bright when they're in the light
In life on a Saturday night with a nigga's wife
Hundred bottles are hundred blunts cause I am a smoker
Good with me, I took a fifty and went to Strokers

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Working, you know I'm working, you know I'm grindin'
Shinin', I'm throwing money, a king of diamond
Phantom, I got a Phantom, I think I'm handsome
Bad bitches on my tail, we gon' go to mansion
Cold, so I park the Rolls, and I got the Lambo
I'm ?, so I brought the ammo with me to ?
And I leave on the club ?
And Miami is my second home so I just bought a crib
Decked in cream, yeah, my whole team we about the green
I'm the man of these women's dreams, so I went to Dreams
I don't play on the club play on a Friday
Need a detox I smoking chronic like Dr. Dre

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
From the trap house to the Playhouse im in Los Angeles
From west coast all way to down south these bitches scandalous
In DC I fuck with Love and i fuck with Stadium
Money be doing flips like in a gymnasium
In New York, I'm in Perfections, I think I'm Diddy
A sinner but I’m a winner in sin city
Adrianna’s in Chi-Town, know I go to Factory
This money didn’t come quick I stacked it up gradually
Four ounces off in my soda ya..that’s the potion
Houston I’m on the drank when I’m off in Motion
Pandemonium in Pandemonium, i’m in Detroit
And I left there and took a private jet back to New York

[Hook]

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
So Icey just re'd up, about to beat the block down
Got so many pounds that it slam to the ground
Them trap chickens going for the 21 now
That's why my trap got a whole lot of pistols laying around
That's why every time I greet my door I greet it with a frown
If a nigga try to reach I'mma shoot him in the mouth
Why I muggin', why I'm muggin'
Why I thuggin', why I'm thuggin'
Why I muggin', why I'm muggin'
Why I thuggin', why I'm thuggin'

[Verse 1: OJ Da Juiceman]
425 for a brick in my hood
Trappin' out near a thousand pounds out the hood
Young Juiceman cuzz I'm posted on the Crest
50 bricks in, 10 mil jugs at best
Alligator dark meat, swordfish white meat
Benihana, Pappadeaux, Juice riding Shaq feet
Now-and-Later chain
Starburst ring
Neiman Marcus shopping, spent a rack on a brain
Breitling watch same color as the dope game
Bought a '72 donk, had to skeet it octane
Sun Valley shawty, I push them white things
'07 Crossfire, doors chicken wing

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
So Icey just re'd up, about to beat the block down

[Verse 2: DG YOLA]
I'm never gonna lose cause I'm too busy winning
I'm a gutter nigga from the Westside of the city
I ain't never falling off
Partner everything count
Even when I spit my verse bitch I make everything bounce
I'm a young gangster for sure, so these pussy niggas pout
Cause I'm steady busting moves in the middle of the drought
Hey this a power hitter, money getter in your face
And I ride with that tool, don't make me put it in your face
And I represent the bottom because that's where I got my feet
Got these niggas mad at me, why? cause of how I act
I'm a agitated killer nigga, you know what I'm 'bout
Mr. I Don't Give A Fuck, yea that's what I'm talking about

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]

East Atlanta representer, I done sold a lot of drugs
I’m the socket and the plug
I’ll wet a nigga up
I’ll call my trap girls to come set a nigga up
Keisha get the keys
I pitched a lot of p’s
Everybody fuckin’ with me, numbers kinda cheap
Shawty made a flip, Gucci took a leak
150 bands off of shows in a week
Yea you pussies heard of me
I know they scared to beef
Same boy will sell them to you, Gucci Mane the G
I bet you heard of me
You pussies scared to beef
Same boy will sell them to you, Gucci Mane the G
So Icey Nigga

[Chorus]
Life a bitch that I wanted to date, but just led me on
Now I'm goin' for another one
Put me in the friend zone, lovin' how we get along
But she wouldn't let me fuck her once
You gotta take life for what it is
But everybody just tell us that we a bunch of kids
This shit ain't nothin' big, it's just the game of life
So, motherfucker, how you playin'?

[Verse 1]
In this game of life, I'm just beginnin'
Only the first innin', but how much they payin' to get admission?
Oh, nothin'? They just listenin'?
It's all good, 'cause I’m just tryin' to make a livin'
This planet that we livin' on, streets people spittin' on
Got this cold world in my hand, I put some mittens on
They playin' dirty so my bib is on
Why they hatin' on the stars that they wish upon?
Twinkle, twinkle, a wrinkle in time
I got these motherfuckers hatin' 'cause they wish they could shine
But they can't and I can
So they stand while I dance with their bitch
With my hands on her hips and she ask me
"Can you take me to the crib?" (Haha)
Well, bitch, that wouldn't be too classy
I'm sick of all the same advice
Motherfucker, this the game of life, so how you playin'?

[Chorus]
Life a bitch that I wanted to date, but just led me on
Now I'm goin' for another one
Put me in the friend zone, lovin' how we get along
But she wouldn't let me fuck her once
You gotta take life for what it is
But everybody just tell us that we a bunch of kids
This shit ain't nothin' big, it's just the game of life
So, motherfucker, how you playin'? (Uh)

[Verse 2]
It ain't smart, I'm playin' risky in this game of life
Roll the dice, just try and get my paper right
When the heat's on, most of y'all made of ice
So you pay the price, but I'm here to save your life
You the type to never ever take advice
The world is a girl who ain't playin' right
Everybody love life 'cause it sound nice
But you can't turn a ho to a housewife
Everybody tried but they failed
Oh well, light another L
Ha, I guess the show goes on
You had her naked, now her clothes is on, what's wrong?

[Chorus]
Life a bitch that I wanted to date, but just led me on
Now I'm goin' for another one
Put me in the friend zone, lovin' how we get along
But she wouldn't let me fuck her once
You gotta take life for what it is
But everybody just tell us that we a bunch of kids
This shit ain't nothin' big, it's just the game of life
So, motherfucker, how you playin'?

Stop, the train is riding
Down to the station
Where you lived
When we were school kids

[Verse 1]
Hey, the rails are caught now
And I am falling down
Fools in a spiral
Round this town of steel

[Chorus]
My body tells me no
But I won't quit
'Cause I want more
'Cause I want more

[Chorus]
My body tells me no
But I won't quit
'Cause I want more
'Cause I want more

[Verse 2]
Stop, the train is riding
Down to the station
Where I lived
When I was a cool kid

[Verse 3]
Hey, is it my fault that
The fallen embers burn
Down in a spiral
Round your crown of thieves?

[Chorus]
My body tells me no
But I won't quit
'Cause I want more
'Cause I want more

[Chorus]
My body tells me no
But I won't quit
'Cause I want more

Oh, it's my road
It's my road, it's my road

His eyes are open
His eyes are open
Oh, 'cause I want more
I want more, want more
His eyes are open
His eyes are open
Hey, hey, hey

[Chorus]
My body tells me no
But I won't quit
'Cause I want more
'Cause I want more

My body tells me no
But I won't quit
'Cause I want more
'Cause I want more
It rides out of town

I can’t fuck with ho niggas
I can’t trust these hoes neither
Wake up early in the morning
Eat that pussy like cold pizza
Hater ass niggas be baller blocking
Acting like some goalkeepers
There’s a reason for everything
But my niggas kill for no reason
Camo shorts with a ho beater
All-black hoodie, I’m Grim Reaper
Look like its time for spring cleaning
Brand new spanking street-sweeper
Been in the game, I’m knee-deep
I like good head, I like good reefer
All my niggas strapped and ready
To set it off, Queen Latifah
Got a chopper with a drum
Split swishers with my thumb
Get money like Donald Trump
Double barrel on that pump
This Kush I got ain’t no chump
Get stupid and get stomped
Two guns I call ‘em Kriss Kross
Kriss Kross will make you jump
Gotta do what a nigga gotta do
Got goons, I ain’t even gotta shoot
Got a bunch of bad bitches by the pool
I like my bitches in two’s
Gotta go, I stick it and move
G-code, I stick to the rules
Last night I got so high
I swear to God, I went to the moon
I’m on that shit you can’t get nowhere
You pussy boy, don’t go there
If I don’t do nothing I’mma ball, no hair
Smoking on that “oh yeah”
My niggas tote that hardware
What you ’bout woadie?
My niggas about that warfare
Real nigga since day one
Cause I ain’t promised day two
Throw that pussy at me
Bitch I think I’m Babe Ruth
Drop top Maybach on the way
Yeah that’s that new Landaulet
She let me into her jungle
I’m gonna hit her with that rattlesnake
Guns clap like patty cake
Blood gang, red bandanna face
Make them pussies pop they-self
You can call that “masturbate”
I don’t front no fabricate
I get high, I gravitate
Weezy F Baby bitch, the F is for Fascinate
Louisiana, I’m from that swamp
I’mma pull this bitch out and dump
Better run like Forrest Gump
Fuck you and where you from
3, 2, I am the one, job well done
I ball 24/7, 365, 12 months
Wassup redbone? Wassup caramel?
Come to Wayne’s World, it’s a fairy tale
Yeah I’m high bitch, bitch I para-sail

[Hook]
Lite it up, cause I'm a smoker
Lite it up, cause I'm a smoker

Shots leave your body looking like you're doin' yoga, yoga

(Kevin Parker says something like "A flaccid (?) getting in my... my lens" at the end of the song)
Lean on me
And all the ladies in the hallway wanna lean on me
I'm big Snoop D O double G
And now they all wanna scene on me
So I stand tall, do it all, never ever slip
On the microphone talking big shhh
I can't cuss I'm on the radio
Holla at the lady tho
With Cosmic Kev, big Snoop Dogg off the top of the head
Need fur on my eardrums
Here he come, here he - here he come
S to the N double O P to the D to the O to the double G
Smooth with the vocal tone
I'm rockin on the microphone
Yes this is freestyle, LBC style, G style
Shout out to ? and Michael Vick
I know the Eagles will be back next year
But don't even trip, cause Snoop Dogg is packin a cold grip
I like to flip and dip
And take you on the mothership
So you can ride and roll and get control
And lemme show you how I get cold
I might get, I might get lifted
I tripped it and dropped it
Never ever flopped it
And then they try to stop it
But you can't cause I'm hard in the paint
When I bust freestyles, make the suckas faint
It's all off the dome
Big Snoop Dogg and I'm halfway home
I need to use the phone
Could you give a dogg a bone?
I'm leaning and everybody lookin at me screaming
They wanna get a picture of the D O dub
All the ladies in the hall love
Even the big boss, he wanna get a picture
Cause he know it don't cost
And that's how it go
Big Snoop Dogg, I'mma start the show
Yeah, take a picture with me
Have a seat, come and kick it with me
In the middle, I'm on the side
Wiz on the left so you know how we ride
And when we came, we both got high
And they got mad and told us put it out cause "fire"
But you know we don't quit
We just kept smoking and I took another hit
Went to the kitchen and I had me some chicken wings
And baby said "Dogg can you sing?"
For Cosmic Kev, I said "cool I got a freestyle
That I just put on the top of my head
And then I came in and dropped it for him"
Pushed record and popped it for him
Baby start filming it now
She say "Snoop Dogg breaking it down!"
She got the camera, I got the rap
I got the wraps and I got the snaps
I got the sack and he's got the Lac
And he got the dippy-dippy scratch in the back
Cosmic Kev, this is how we do it
Big Snoop Dogg coming through with the do-it fluid
My music is dope, I never ever choke
And if I wasn't rapping I'd probably be broke
No I'm lying to y'all
It's only Big Snoop and I'm the Top Dogg
That means that I'm gonna get money
No matter what I'm doing it's sunny
It could be raining, I could be banging
You could be talking, I could be singing
I could be slanging, I could be bringing
You what you need, but I stop and proceed
To give you what you want, cause I know what you need
It's big Snoop D O double to the G
Ease.. and when I'm done on the microphone, smell me
I'm just like the breeze
Power power, 99
Everything is oh so fine
You thought I was gone, but I couldn't leave yet
I gotta say something cause these suckers got me so upset
I haven't won a Grammy yet
I haven't made a call to my granny yet
She say "Snoop Dogg, don't worry about it grandson!"
Cause when it comes to rap, you the only one
You don't need a Grammy, you got a Soul Train Award
And a BET, everthing is on cue, and you know how you be
And you keep smoking reefer, and these suckas is broke
But you can't touch me, cause I'm just cold
When it comes to the freestyle off the top of my brain
And I'm 40 years old, but it sounds like I'm 17
Cause when I be rocking, I'm oh so clean
And I'm on the hip-hop scene
Been doing this since I was about 17
And niggas 16, niggas 14, it don't matter
Cause my rhyme is so clean...

[Verse 1]
I-I love the colorful clothes she wears
And the way the sunlight plays upon her hair
I hear the sound of a gentle word
On the wind that lifts her perfume through the air

[Chorus]
I'm pickin' up good vibrations
She's giving me excitations (Oom bop bop)
I'm pickin' up good vibrations (Good vibrations, bop bop)
She's giving me excitations (Excitations, bop bop)
I'm pickin' up good vibrations (Good vibrations, bop bop)
She's giving me excitations (Excitations, bop bop)
I'm pickin' up good vibrations (Good vibrations, bop bop)
She's giving me excitations (Excitations)

[Verse 2]
Close my eyes, she's somehow closer now
Softly smile, I know she must be kind
When I look in her eyes
She goes with me to a blossom world

[Chorus]
I'm pickin' up good vibrations

Ohh, I got a love for my ink, it's like tear stains all over my diary pages
We wrote it together, and it tells all the secrets baby
But if this got into the hands, of those who stood against us
They'd try to develop an alternate ending for the tale

I don’t, want ‘em with the story
It don’t, need to be published
No, don’t, put it in stores
Oh, no, whoa, I know

A best-seller, a best-seller

Sure the critics that read it won’t have a clue
It ain’t a best-seller, a best-seller
A best-seller, whoa, whoa, yeah

The publishers been tryna call us, been tryna meet us lately
And I say “It’s precious, and it’s private, sure ain’t for profit”
And if they don’t understand, baby, I ain’t givin’ a damn
I’m tryna protect this, I’m sorry, these chapters ain’t for sale

Listen up, listen up (Just listen up)
Just hear me out, hear me out (Just hear me out)
There’s too much love, too much love (Oh, no)
There’s too much love written up (Oh, no)
‘Cause all our love written up (Our love)
I got my heart written up (You got my heart)
Don’t you sell it, oh, no

[Hook: Courtnry Noelle]
Blowin' on this ray, spitting game to these hoes
Money ain't a thing cause I got paper to blow
I'm heavy in the game it ain't a thing to a pro
Baby I'm a star and you already know, that I'm getting bankroll

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
(Yeah) See me I was cheifin' on my reefer getting blowed
In my home alone that's when Sledgren hit my phone
He said Wizzle what you doing
I said we should hit the club
I could swing through and grab Motor, cuh you just hit Lonnie up
Then I jumped in the shower, took me bout an hour
Smoked a blunt of ray and put on my star power
All black Chuck Tays, some Armani frames
15 carats in my chain bitch I'm heavy in the game
In my truck I'm switching lanes, feel that beat off in my trunk
I'm smokin' Mary Wayne
I speed off to the hood and we gone roll about 10 blunts 'fore I'm ready
I'm spending all this cash up tonite, if you let me

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I tap my horn once, I tap again
This nigga must not hear me, I 'ooowop' he let me in
I meet up with my mens, then dip out to the spot
The whole Khalifa gang, 10 cars deep off in the lot
You be off in the front, we creepin' thru the back
And we gon' blow some stacks, them hoes ain't know how to act
No I.D. I'm underage but far from underpaid
I'm fresh to death, stay fly until I'm sleep off in a grave
You got them hoes you fuck with groupies that I used to know
Say you gettin' money man, now money's what I choose to blow
Finna pop some bottles, scream I'm through
Came to shut the club down
So make some room, I'm...

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Now we in the club, hear the DJ scream my name
He shout out Heavy Hustle cause the DJ know my gang
I'm standin' on the couch in V.I.P. I swing my chain
The DJ play my song, I throw my cheese and go insane
And I got what they need, they come and shake it for a boss
These hoes just out here choosin' homie take it as a lost
Sweat comin' out my pores this Patron got me heated
Security know what it is with me, I'm gettin' weeded
The hoes say I'm conceited. Niggas say I'm a fool
My chain is fuckin' freezey, this shit is kinda cool
And I'm the kind of dude to walk behind your boo, tell her fuck ya man, I'm the man what you tryna' do

[Hook]

[Yelawolf]
I got this party started, ready for the mike like a starving artist
And I’m hard to start it

[Gucci Mane]
I’m a mad man, ask yelawolf I need a straight jacket

[Yelawolf]
So I gave her just what Gucci mane tried to get you to take

[Gucci Mane]
(That white girl is a freak)
I pass that bitch to yell, he pass that back to me

[Hook]
I’m too turnt up that I’m turnt out
I’m so burnt up, my lungs burnt out
I smoke too much, my crew smoked out
I ball too much, we just balled out
I’m too turnt up that I’m turnt out
I burn too much, my crew burnt out
I smoke too much, my roof smoked out
I ball too much, we just balled out

[Gucci Mane]
Elevator kush got me leaning like the Eiffel tower
I’m dreaming of a plate of powder
These pills got me tripping, I’m tripping
I missed my prescription, I’m slippin'
I’m a mad man, ask yelawolf I need a straight jacket
But I’m balling out and you ain’t in my task bracket
7 is the key, that white girl is a freak, I pass that bitch to yela', he pass that back to me

I came in with Irene, I’m leaving with Codeine
I need to take a chill pill and retreat from the scene
But I’ma take a stand until my drugs here, you dig
I purchase them to use em so guess what Gucci mane did …

[Hook]

[Yelawolf]
Yeah, everyday I’m throwin back
I guess I'm more like my dad than I thought I was
And I need more in fact
I run to the store like I had a job moppin up
Another party popping up, drink till I drop my cup
Sink gettin all stopped up
From the blunt guts, smokers on the porch
With the bong full of bud And the kegs pumped up
Yeah that’s right, cocaine got these boys scratching they head like a head of lice
Bad luck on the floor with a bitch when I thought I had a hit, but instead it was a dike
So I gave her just what Gucci mane tried to get you to take
Soon as it set in, she came in with a twin and let off the breaks
I got this party started, ready for the mike like a starving artist
And I’m hard to start it, when its all said and done, and the confetti runs out then you can just point the party at me...
Yeah that, yeah that’s me
Yeah that's daddy's pedigree
Drop a mothafukin verse readily, ain't none of them ahead of me
Yeah catfish billy, shoulda just called me "cept fo three"
Cuse I take a thirty two pack of brew and crush em.. except for 3
Save them for the light weights, the 115’s in the skinny jeans
And I’ll be the king of the scene, the scene with the jim beam, beam

[Hook]

[Chorus]
Live fast, die young, bad girls do it well
Live fast, die young, bad girls do it well
Live fast, die young, bad girls do it well
Live fast, die young, bad girls do it well
My chain hits my chest when I'm banging on the dashboard
My chain hits my chest when I'm banging on the radio

[Refrain]
Get back, get down
Pull me closer if you think you can hang
Hands up, hands tied
Don't go screaming if I blow you with a bang

[Verse 1]
Suki suki
I'm coming in the Cherokee gasoline
There's steam on the window screen take it, take it
Wheels bouncing like a trampoline
When I get to where I'm going, gonna have you trembling

[Chorus]
Live fast, die young, bad girls do it well
Live fast, die young, bad girls do it well
Live fast, die young, bad girls do it well
Live fast, die young, bad girls do it well

My chain hits my chest when I'm banging on the radio

[Verse 2]
Oh back it, back it
Yeah pull up to the bumper game read the signal
Cover me, cause I'm changing lanes
I had a handle on it
My life, but I broke it
When I get to where I'm going
Gonna have you saying it

[Chorus]
Live fast, die young, bad girls do it well
Live fast, die young, bad girls do it well
Live fast, die young, bad girls do it well
Live fast, die young, bad girls do it well
My chain hits my chest when I'm banging on the dashboard
My chain hits my chest when I'm banging on the radio

[Refrain]
Get back, get down
Pull me closer if you think you can hang
Hands up, hands tied
Don't go screaming if I blow you with a bang

[Verse 3]
Going nought to bitch I'll see four million
Accelerating fast I can do this in a second
Lookin' in the rear view, swaggin' goin' swell
Leavin' boys behind ‘cause it’s illegal just to kill
Shift gear, automatic, damned if I do
Who's gonna stop me when I'm coming through?
What we got left is just me and you
But if I go to bed, baby, can I take you?

[Refrain]
Get back, get down
Pull me closer if you think you can hang
Hands up, hands tied
Don't go screaming if I blow you with a bang

[Chorus]
Live fast, die young, bad girls do it well
Live fast, die young, bad girls do it well
Live fast, die young, bad girls do it well
Live fast, die young, bad girls do it well
My chain hits my chest when I'm banging on the dashboard
My chain hits my chest when I'm banging on the radio

[Chorus]
Weirdo, weirdo, I'm a weirdo
Weirdo, weirdo, I'm a weirdo
Killed the pussy, killed the bitch
Turned into a weirdo
Mr. Zone 6
Half a million dollar ear lobes
Weirdo, weirdo, I'm a weirdo
Weirdo, weirdo, I'm a weirdo
Gucci Mane, Drumma Boy
This here for the weirdos
Had it like a bag a dro
Flowing like a weirdo

[Verse 1]
Shawty mad, mad for what
Man, 'cause she can't get enough
Tough luck
Digging Gucci Mane and he don't give a fuck
Throw it up, pick it up
Uh, she's a material girl
You ain't got enough
It's a weird, weird
And she asking weird questions
Why yo' engine in the rear
Switching gears then I'm outta here
Your boyfriend's so last year
Let's have breakfast on the moon
Let's have dinner on Uranus
I got Venus on my penis
And Serena wrapped 'round my fingers
Lil' mama wet as Aquafina
Send them hoes like Angelina
I like 'em black
I like 'em yellow
I like 'em red
I like to meet her
I'm wishing up something just like The Beatles
My buzz spread just like the measles
Black and white, tuck sealed I gamble like Bugsy Siegel
Gucci!

[Chorus]
Weirdo, weirdo, I'm a weirdo
Weirdo, weirdo, I'm a weirdo
Killed the pussy, killed the bitch
Turned into a weirdo
Mr. Zone 6
Half a million dollar ear lobes
Weirdo, weirdo, I'm a weirdo
Weirdo, weirdo, I'm a weirdo
Gucci Mane, Drumma Boy
This here for the weirdos
Had it like a bag a dro
Flowing like a weirdo

[Verse 2]
You cock-sucking mosquio
I own the queroseno
My girl's got on them see-through
Short skirts and Perico
I'm Gucci Tarantino
My shooters are bilingual
That's tall as Valentino
Throw bombs like Dan Marino
I'm gambling with her at the Bellagio
I'm up forty up at the Casino
I just missed Sasha from Moscow
She say she love my single
Then she bought all of my ringtones
So I said "pleasure to meet you"
And I ain't gotta talk her ear off
The freaks was willing, no need to
Women look at me and see what they don't see in you
And I see it too
Georgia Tech raw with the yellow feet
It's a photo-shoot baby so say "cheese"
Throw money high, don't care where it reach
It's offending you then it's offending me
Feeling you, you offending me
My earrings cost like half a chain
Gucci!

[Chorus]
Weirdo, weirdo, I'm a weirdo
Weirdo, weirdo, I'm a weirdo
Killed the pussy, killed the bitch
Turned into a weirdo
Mr. Zone 6
Half a million dollar ear lobes
Weirdo, weirdo, I'm a weirdo
Weirdo, weirdo, I'm a weirdo
Gucci Mane, Drumma Boy
This here for the weirdos
Had it like a bag a dro
Flowing like a weirdo

[Verse 3]
Mad at me suddenly blaming me, it wasn't me
Thinking his girl stunting me
She's not really stunting me
I ain't really slutting her
Grammar so screet Campbellton, East Atlanta
Pull up in that yellow thang
I put rims on everythang
Pull up like dranks on me
Black with the Georgie Tech yellow painted
40,000 on the feet
Gucci, Drumma Boy and we so unique
Earrring cost like a quarter a piece
That's half a mill each

[Chorus]
Weirdo, weirdo, I'm a weirdo
Weirdo, weirdo, I'm a weirdo
Killed the pussy, killed the bitch
Turned into a weirdo
Mr. Zone 6
Half a million dollar ear lobes
Weirdo, weirdo, I'm a weirdo
Weirdo, weirdo, I'm a weirdo
Gucci Mane, Drumma Boy
This here for the weirdos
Had it like a bag a dro
Flowing like a weirdo

[Video Prelude]

[Intro]
Money is the anthem of success
So before we go out, what's your address?

[Verse 1]
I'm your national anthem
God, you're so handsome
Take me to the Hamptons, Bugatti Veyron
He loves to romance 'em
Reckless abandon
Holdin' me for ransom, upper echelon
He says to be cool, but I don't know how yet
Wind in my hair, hand on the back of my neck
I said, "Can we party later on?" He said, "Yes" (Yes, yes)

[Chorus]
Tell me I'm your national anthem
(Booyah, baby, bow down, making me say wow now)
Tell me I'm your national anthem
(Sugar sugar, how now, take your body downtown)
Red, white, blue is in the sky
Summer's in the air and, baby, heaven's in your eyes
I'm your national anthem

[Post-Chorus]
Money is the reason we exist
Everybody knows it, it's a fact
Kiss, kiss

[Verse 2]
I sing the national anthem while I'm standin' over your body
Hold you like a python
And you can't keep your hands off me or your pants on
See what you've done to me, King of Chevron?
He said to be cool, but I'm already coolest
I said to get real, don't you know who you're dealing with?
Um, do you think you'll buy me lots of diamonds?
("Yes, of course I will, my darling")

[Chorus]
Tell me I'm your national anthem
(Booyah, baby, bow down, making me say wow now)
Tell me I'm your national anthem
(Sugar sugar, how now, take your body downtown)
Red, white, blue is in the sky
Summer's in the air and, baby, heaven's in your eyes
I'm your national anthem

[Bridge]
It's a love story for the new age
For the sixth page
We're on a quick, sick rampage
Wining and dining, drinking and driving
Excessive buying, overdose and dying
On our drugs and our love and our dreams and our rage
Blurring the lines between real and the fake
Dark and lonely, I need somebody to hold me
He will do very well, I can tell, I can tell
Keep me safe in his belltower hotel
Money is the anthem of success
So put on mascara and your party dress

[Verse 3]
I'm your national anthem
Boy, put your hands up
Give me a standing ovation
Boy, you have landed
Babe, in the land of
Sweetness and danger, Queen of Saigon

[Chorus]
Tell me I'm your national anthem
(Booyah, baby, bow down, making me say wow now)
Tell me I'm your national anthem
(Sugar sugar, how now, take your body downtown)
Red, white, blue is in the sky
Summer's in the air and, baby, heaven's in your eyes
I'm your national anthem

[Outro]
Money is the anthem
God, you're so handsome
Money is the anthem of success
Money is the anthem
God, you're so handsome
Money is the anthem of success
Money is the anthem
God, you're so handsome
Money is the anthem of success
Money is the anthem
God, you're so handsome
Money is the anthem of success

[Hook: Aloe Blacc]
Well I need a dollar, dollar, a dollar that's what I need
Said I need a dollar, dollar, a dollar that's what I need
And I need dollar dollar, a dollar that's what I need
And if I share with you my story would you share your dollar with me

[Verse 1]
You know what it is
Bitch it's still none other than the King
Need green just to occupy my rubberbands
Hundred grand at a time, keep it coming
When I started I was trapping
Woke up ballin like "what happened?"
It's gonna be up to the captain
Let's just smoke up in this city
Let me get 100 milli and focus on a billi
What's the muthafuckin dilly nigga? You already know
Profits at a steady flow, cheddar, paper, fetti, dough
Stay a step ahead of whatever when niggas say he go
We never should've let him go to movies, television shows
And who we foolin? He ain't stupid
His bankroll just feed his ego
No less than 7 zeroes, stimulate bitches libido
Flow crazy just like Danger Mouse and Cee-Lo
From a kilo to a yacht in Cabo
Chillin like December in Toledo
He's so hungry for the money like he's still selling dimes
Got a mil on his mind, dollar bill at a time

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Ain't no vacation, working like a Jamaican, mixed with a Hatian
Several different occupations - no exaggeration
18-20 hour days while you sleeping, my money making money
Patient I ain't chasin money, 'less the conversation money
And what you saying dunny? Why you talking to me?
Hundred bound a verse, a quarter mil a show, a mil a movie
PRPS, Gucci, Louis got my head as big as Stewie's
20 mil's the answer if you ask me how Akoo is doing
Pay me now or keep it moving, no exception, no confusion
If we racing to the top, no competition, I'm a shoe-in
And you in my way, don't ruin my date
Fore I pay 100K for them to boo you off stage
I'm way up front, stop playing, don't front
Used to want dough like JAY-Z but now I'm thinking Donald Trump
Bob Johnson, Warren Buffett, fuck it, it ain't that tough
Hundred mil stacked up, dollar bills add up..

[Verse 1]
All my friends tell me  I should move on
I'm lying in the ocean, singing your song
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
That's how you sang it
Loving you forever can't be wrong
Even though you're not here, won't move on
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
That's how we played it

[Pre-Chorus]
And there's no remedy for memory, your face is like a melody
It won't leave my head
Your soul is haunting me and telling me that everything is fine
But I wish I was dead (Dead, like you)

[Chorus]
Every time I close my eyes, it's like a dark paradise
No one compares to you
I'm scared that you won't be waiting on the other side
Every time I close my eyes, it's like a dark paradise
No one compares to you
I'm scared that you won't be waiting on the other side

[Verse 2]
All my friends ask me why I stay strong
Tell 'em when you find true love, it lives on
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
That's why I stay here

[Pre-Chorus]
And there's no remedy for memory, your face is like a melody
It won't leave my head
Your soul is haunting me and telling me that everything is fine
But I wish I was dead (Dead, like you)

[Chorus]
Every time I close my eyes, it's like a dark paradise
No one compares to you
I'm scared that you won't be waiting on the other side
Every time I close my eyes, it's like a dark paradise
No one compares to you
But there's no you, except in my dreams tonight

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh-oh, ha-ha-ha-ha
I don't wanna wake up from this tonight
Oh-oh-oh-oh, ha-ha-ha-ha
I don't wanna wake up from this tonight

[Bridge]
There's no relief, I see you in my sleep
And everybody's rushing me, but I can feel you touching me
There's no release, I feel you in my dreams
Telling me I'm fine

[Chorus]
Every time I close my eyes, it's like a dark paradise
No one compares to you
I'm scared that you won't be waiting on the other side (So tell me)
Every time I close my eyes, it's like a dark paradise
No one compares to you
But there's no you, except in my dreams tonight

[Outro]
Oh-oh-oh-oh, ha-ha-ha-ha
I don't wanna wake up from this tonight
Oh-oh-oh-oh, ha-ha-ha-ha
I don't wanna wake up from this tonight

[Verse 1]
Not even they can stop me now
Boy, I be flying overhead
Their heavy words can't bring me down
Boy, I've been raised from the dead

[Pre-Chorus]
No one even knows how hard life was
I don't even think about it now because
I finally found you
(Oh, sing it to me)

[Chorus]
Now my life is sweet like cinnamon
Like a fuckin' dream I'm livin' in
Baby, love me 'cause I'm playing on the radio
How do you like me now?
Lick me up and take me like a vitamin
'Cause my body's sweet like sugar venom, oh yeah
Baby, love me 'cause I'm playing on the radio
How do you like me now?

[Verse 2]
American dreams came true somehow
I swore I'd chase 'em 'til I was dead
I heard the streets were paved with gold
That's what my father said

[Pre-Chorus]
No one even knows what life was like
Now I'm in L.A. and it's paradise
I finally found you
(Oh, sing it to me)

[Chorus]
Now my life is sweet like cinnamon
Like a fuckin' dream I'm livin' in
Baby, love me 'cause I'm playing on the radio
How do you like me now?
Lick me up and take me like a vitamin
'Cause my body's sweet like sugar venom, oh yeah
Baby, love me 'cause I'm playing on the radio
How do you like me now?

[Bridge]
Sweet like cinnamon
Like a fuckin' dream I'm livin' in
Baby, love me 'cause I'm playing on the radio
How do you like me now?
Sweet like cinnamon
Like a fuckin' dream I'm livin' in
I finally found you
(Oh, sing it to me)

[Chorus]
Now my life is sweet like cinnamon
Like a fuckin' dream I'm livin' in
Baby, love me 'cause I'm playing on the radio
How do you like me now?
Lick me up and take me like a vitamin
'Cause my body's sweet like sugar venom, oh yeah
Baby, love me 'cause I'm playing on the radio
How do you like me now? (Oh, sing it to me)

[Chorus]
Now my life is sweet like cinnamon
Like a fuckin' dream I'm livin' in
Baby, love me 'cause I'm playing on the radio
How do you like me now?
Lick me up and take me like a vitamin
'Cause my body's sweet like sugar venom, oh yeah
Baby, love me 'cause I'm playing on the radio
How do you like me now?
Let me do me, you just do you

Su-woop to the bangers
Su-woop to the bangers, (yeah)
And I say, I be on some G shit

Check out what I done, and
Check out who I be with
I'm me bitch, I said I'm me bitch

Then it goes young, young, young, young, YOUNG

Bust that pussy open, then I tell her bring it back
Make sure you don't fall in love
Cause I don't have the time for thatt
Only thing I chase is money, if you tell me where it's at
When you rich, there is a certain type of woman you attract

I say I be on some G shit, I be on some G shit
Check some other niggas for that louis shopping spree shit
Not me bitch, I said not me bitch
And it goes young, young, young, young, YOUNG

Only gave her cab fare, I would've white-Nik'd her
Baby won't quit tho, she a fighter
I'm like "God damn, it was just a one-nighter"
Don't know what I said to her
But now, the girl I'm deadin her
Caught the vapors, Schwarzenegger never seen this Predator
Venus a competitor, my cream and my cheddar-ar
See more tennis than Venus Serena and Federer
Sergio Tacchini, Lamborghini, yea etc
Your life feels like a movie, I'll truly be your editor
Cam did it, your man live it, I ran with it
2 thousand dollar sweater (?)

[Hook: Mac Miller]
I tell 'em oh yeah, motherfucker, oh yeah
I'm getting money with my homies, yeah you know I'm gonna share
Might get hard, I don't care, I ain't goin nowhere, I ain't scared
I got my peoples and they iller than yours is
So can you dig that? Can you dig that?

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
I must admit it, I'm just iller than most
This business, I get up in it, like I'm pimpin' these hoes
All these people that you love, go head and give em a toast
Because if they ain't here tomorrow you gon miss em the most
Now I'm livin' pretty good, yeah some would say phenomenal
All about my net like it's a goalie in a soccer goal
Accomplished the impossible, my dreams they seemed illogical
They ain't about that essay paper, I'mma tell em adios
Boss of all bosses motherfucker, shouts to Vado too
Shmutty hoes been told me that they love me, that ain't nothin' new
Yeah that's nice you know my Twitter, no I ain't gone follow you
You prostitute, dirty bitch, I'll throw you down the laundry shoot
Like bada bing, bada boom, diamond rings, designer shoes
Finer things I like to do, London, France, and China too
Got a crib that got a view, above my yard that got a pool
O'reilly tryna find me shit, too bad, I tell em:

[Hook]
Cam told me to tell you that you a bitch, and you ugly
That's what Cam told me to tell you..

[Verse 1]
Swingin' in the backyard, pull up in your fast car
Whistlin' my name
Open up a beer and you say, "Get over here
And play a video game"
I'm in his favorite sundress, watching me get undressed
Take that body downtown
I say, "You the bestest," lean in for a big kiss
Put his favorite perfume on
Go play a video game

[Pre-Chorus]
It's you, it's you, it's all for you
Everything I do
I tell you all the time

[Chorus]
Heaven is a place on Earth with you
Tell me all the things you wanna do
I heard that you like the bad girls, honey
Is that true?
It's better than I ever even knew
They say that the world was built for two
Only worth living if somebody is loving you
And baby, now, you do
Hmm, mmm

[Verse 2]
Singin' in the old bars, swinging with the old stars
Livin' for the fame
Kissin' in the blue dark, playing pool and wild darts
And video games
He holds me in his big arms, drunk and I am seeing stars
This is all I think of
Watchin' all our friends fall in and out of Old Paul's
This is my idea of fun
Playing video games

[Pre-Chorus]
It's you, it's you, it's all for you
Everything I do
I tell you all the time

[Chorus]
Heaven is a place on Earth with you
Tell me all the things you wanna do
I heard that you like the bad girls, honey
Is that true?
It's better than I ever even knew
They say that the world was built for two
Only worth living if somebody is loving you
And baby, now, you do

[Post-Chorus]
(N-now, you do, now, you do, now, you do)
(N-now, you do, now, you do, now, you do)

[Pre-Chorus]
It's you, it's you, it's all for you
Everything I do
I tell you all the time

[Chorus]
Heaven is a place on Earth with you
Tell me all the things you wanna do
I heard that you like the bad girls, honey
Is that true?
It's better than I ever even knew
They say that the world was built for two
Only worth living if somebody is loving you
And baby, now, you do

[Post-Chorus]
(N-now, you do, now, you do, now, you do)
Hmm, mmm, now, you do
(N-now, you do, now, you do, now, you do)

[Intro]
You're no good for me
Baby, you're no good for me
You're no good for me
But, baby, I want you, I want—

[Chorus]
Diet Mountain Dew, baby, New York City
Never was there ever a girl so pretty
Do you think we'll be in love forever?
Do you think we'll be in love?
Diet Mountain Dew, baby, New York City
Can we hit it now, low-down and gritty?
Do you think we'll be in love forever?
Do you think we'll be in love?

[Verse 1]
Baby, put on heart-shaped sunglasses
'Cause we gonna take a ride
I'm not gonna listen to what the past says
I been waitin' up all night
Take another drag, turn me to ashes
Ready for another lie?
Says he's gonna teach me just what fast is
Say it's gonna be alright

[Chorus]
Diet Mountain Dew, baby, New York City
Never was there ever a girl so pretty
Do you think we'll be in love forever?
Do you think we'll be in love?
Diet Mountain Dew, baby, New York City
Can we hit it now, low-down and gritty?
Do you think we'll be in love forever?
Do you think we'll be in love?

[Verse 2]
Let's take Jesus off the dashboard
Got enough on his mind
We both know just what we're here for
Saved too many times
Maybe I like this roller coaster
Maybe it keeps me high
Maybe the speed, it brings me closer
I could sparkle up your eye

[Chorus]
Diet Mountain Dew, baby, New York City
Never was there ever a girl so pretty
Do you think we'll be in love forever?
Do you think we'll be in love?
Diet Mountain Dew, baby, New York City
Can we hit it now, low-down and gritty?
Do you think we'll be in love forever?
Do you think we'll be in love?

[Bridge]
You're no good for me
Baby, you're no good for me
You're no good for me
But, baby, I want you, I want you
You're no good for me
Baby, you're no good for me
You're no good for me
But, baby, I want you, I want you, I want you

[Chorus]
Diet Mountain Dew, baby, New York City
Never was there ever a girl so pretty
Do you think we'll be in love forever?
Do you think we'll be in love?
Baby stoppin' at 7-Eleven
There in his white Pontiac Heaven
Do you think we'll be in love forever?
Do you think we'll be in love?

[Chorus]
Diet Mountain Dew, baby, New York City
Never was there ever a girl so pretty
Do you think we'll be in love forever?
Do you think we'll be in love?
Diet Mountain Dew, baby, New York City (You're no good for me)
Can we hit it now, low-down and gritty? (Baby, you're no good for me)
Do you think we'll be in love forever? (You're no good for me)
Do you think we'll be in love? (But, baby, I want you, I want—)

[Outro]
You're no good for me
Baby, you're no good for me
You're no good for me
But, baby, I want you, I want—
You're no good for me
Baby, you're no good for me
You're no good for me
But, baby, I want you, I want—
You're no good for me
Baby, you're no good for me
You're no good for me
But, baby, I want you, I want—

[Verse 1]
Darlin', darlin'
Doesn't have a problem
Lyin' to herself
'Cause her liquor's top shelf
It's alarming, honestly
How charming she can be
Fooling everyone
Telling 'em she's having fun

[Pre-Chorus]
She says, "You don't want to be like me
Don't wanna see all the things I've seen
I'm dyin', I'm dyin'"
She says, "You don't want to get this way
Famous and dumb at an early age
Lyin', I'm lyin"

[Chorus]
The boys, the girls
They all like Carmen
She gives them butterflies, bats her cartoon eyes
She laughs like God
Her mind's like a diamond
Audiotune lies
She's still shinin'
Like lightning, whoa, whoa
White lightning

[Verse 2]
Carmen, Carmen
Staying up 'til morning
Only seventeen, but she walks the streets so mean
It's alarming, truly
How disarming you can be
Eatin' soft ice cream
Coney Island queen

[Pre-Chorus]
She says, "You don't want to be like me
Lookin' for fun, gettin' high for free
I'm dyin', I'm dyin'"
She says, "You don't want to get this way
Street walk at night and a star by day
It's tirin', tirin'"

[Chorus]
The boys, the girls
They all like Carmen
She gives them butterflies
Bats her cartoon eyes
She laughs like God
Her mind's like a diamond
Audiotune lies
She's still shinin'
Like lightning, whoa, whoa
White lightning

[Bridge]
Baby's all dressed up with nowhere to go
That's the little story of the girl you know
Relying on the kindness of strangers
Tying cherry knots
Smiling, doing party favors
Put your red dress on, put your lipstick on
Sing your song, song, now the camera's on
And you're alive again

[Interlude]
Mon amour, je sais que tu m'aimes aussi
Tu as besoin de moi, tu as besoin de moi dans ta vie
Tu ne peux vivre sans moi
Et je mourrais sans toi
Je tuerais pour toi

[Chorus]
The boys, the girls
They all like Carmen
She gives them butterflies
Bats her cartoon eyes
She laughs like God
Her mind's like a diamond
Audiotune lies
She's still shinin'
Like lightning, whoa, whoa
White lightning
Like lightning, whoa, whoa
White lightning

[Outro]
Darlin', darlin'
Doesn't have a problem
Lyin' to herself
'Cause her liquor's top shelf

[Verse 1]
You said I was the most exotic flower
Holding me tight in our final hour
I don't know how you convince them and get them, boy
I don't know what you do
It's unbelievable
And I don't know how you get over, get over
Someone as dangerous, tainted and flawed as you

[Chorus]
One for the money
Two for the show
I love you, honey
I'm ready, I'm ready to go
How did you get that way?
I don't know
You're screwed up and brilliant
You look like a million dollar man
So why is my heart broke?

[Verse 2]
You've got the world
But baby, at what price?
Something so strange
Hard to define
It isn't that hard, boy
To like you or love you
I'd follow you down, down, down
You're unbelievable
If you're going crazy
Just grab me and take me
I'd follow you down, down, down
Anywhere, anywhere

[Chorus]
One for the money
Two for the show
I love you, honey
I'm ready, I'm ready to go
How did you get that way?
I don't know
You're screwed up and brilliant
You look like a million dollar man
So why is my heart broke?

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
One for the money
Two for the show
I love you, honey
I'm ready, I'm ready to go
How did you get that way?
I don't know
You're screwed up and brilliant
You look like a million dollar man
So why is my heart broke?

[Outro]
I don't know
You're screwed up and brilliant
You look like a million dollar man
So why is my heart broke?

[Chorus]
Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
I just wanted you to know
That, baby, you the best

[Verse 1]
I got my red dress on tonight
Dancin' in the dark in the pale moonlight
Done my hair up real big, beauty queen style
High heels off, I'm feelin' alive

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, my God, I feel it in the air
Telephone wires above are sizzlin' like a snare
Honey, I'm on fire, I feel it everywhere
Nothin' scares me anymore
(One, two, three, four)

[Chorus]
Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
I just wanted you to know
That, baby, you the best

[Post-Chorus]
I got that summertime, summertime sadness
Su-su-summertime, summertime sadness
Got that summertime, summertime sadness
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 2]
I'm feelin' electric tonight
Cruisin' down the coast goin' 'bout 99
Got my bad baby by my heavenly side
I know if I go, I'll die happy tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, my God, I feel it in the air
Telephone wires above are sizzlin' like a snare
Honey, I'm on fire, I feel it everywhere
Nothin' scares me anymore
(One, two, three, four)

[Chorus]
Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
I just wanted you to know
That baby, you the best

[Post-Chorus]
I got that summertime, summertime sadness
Su-su-summertime, summertime sadness
Got that summertime, summertime sadness
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh

[Bridge]
Think I'll miss you forever
Like the stars miss the sun in the mornin' sky
Later's better than never
Even if you're gone, I'm gonna drive (drive), drive

[Post-Chorus]
I got that summertime, summertime sadness
Su-su-summertime, summertime sadness
Got that summertime, summertime sadness
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh

[Chorus]
Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
I just wanted you to know
That, baby, you the best

[Post-Chorus]
I got that summertime, summertime sadness
Su-su-summertime, summertime sadness
Got that summertime, summertime sadness
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 1]
Remember how we used to party up all night?
Sneakin' out, lookin' for a taste of real life
Drinkin' in the small town firelight
(Pabst Blue Ribbon on ice)
Sweet sixteen and we had arrived
Walkin' down the streets as they whistle, "Hi, hi"
Stealin' police cars with the senior guys
Teachers said we'd never make it out alive

[Pre-Chorus]
There she was, my new best friend
High heels in her hand, swayin' in the wind
Oh, she starts to cry, mascara runnin' down her little Bambi eyes
"Lana, how I hate those guys"

[Chorus]
This is what makes us girls
We all look for heaven and we put love first
Something that we'd die for, it's a curse
Don't cry about it, don't cry about it
This is what makes us girls
We don't stick together 'cause we put love first
Don't cry about him, don't cry about him
It's all gonna happen (Happen, happen)

[Verse 2]
And that's where the beginning of the end begun
Everybody knew that we had too much fun
We were skippin' school and drinkin' on the job
With the boss
Sweet sixteen and we had arrived
Baby's table dancin' at the local dive
Cheerin' our names in the pink spotlight
Drinkin' cherry schnapps in the velvet night

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, we used to go break into the hotel
Glimmering, we'd swim
Running from the cops in our black bikini tops
Screamin', "Get us while we're hot, get us while we're hot"
(C'mon, take a shot)

[Chorus]
This is what makes us girls
We all look for heaven and we put love first
Something that we'd die for, it's a curse
Don't cry about it, don't cry about it
This is what makes us girls
We don't stick together 'cause we put love first
Don't cry about him, don't cry about him
It's all gonna happen (Happen, happen)

[Bridge]
The prettiest in-crowd that you had ever seen
Ribbons in our hair and our eyes gleamed mean
A freshmen generation of degenerate beauty queens
And you know something?
They were the only friends I ever had
We got into trouble and when stuff got bad
I got sent away, I was wavin' on the train platform
Cryin' 'cause I know I'm never comin' back

[Chorus]
This is what makes us girls
We all look for heaven and we put love first
Something that we'd die for, it's a curse
Don't cry about it, don't cry about it
This is what makes us girls
We don't stick together 'cause we put love first
Don't cry about him, don't cry about him
It's all gonna happen, oh

[Verse 1]
Everything I want, I have
Money, notoriety, and rivieras
I even think I found God
In the flashbulbs of the pretty cameras
Pretty cameras, pretty cameras
Am I glamorous? Tell me, am I glamorous?

[Chorus]
Hello? Hello?
Ca-can you hear me?
I can be your china doll if you wanna see me fall
Boy, you're so dope, your love is deadly
Tell me life is beautiful, they all think I have it all
I've nothing without you
All my dreams and all the lights mean
Nothing without you

[Verse 2]
Summertime is nice and hot
And my life is sweet like vanilla is
Gold and silver-lined, my heart
But burned into my brain, all these stolen images
Stolen images, baby, stolen images
Can you picture it? Babe, that life we could've lived

[Chorus]
Hello? Hello?
Ca-can you hear me?
I can be your china doll if you like to see me fall
Boy, you're so dope, your love is deadly
Tell me life is beautiful, they all think I have it all
I've nothing without you
All my dreams and all the lights mean
Nothing without you

[Bridge]
We were two kids just tryin' to get out
Lived on the dark side of the American dream
We would dance all night, play our music loud
When we grew up, nothing was what it seemed

[Chorus]
Hello? Hello?
Ca-can you hear me?
I can be your china doll if you like to see me fall
Boy, you're so dope, your love is deadly
Tell me life is beautiful, they think that I have it all
I've nothing without you
All my dreams and all the lights mean
Nothing without you

[Chorus]
Hello? Hello?
Ca-can you hear me?
I can be your china doll if you like to see me fall
Boy, you're so dope, your love is deadly
Tell me life is beautiful, they think that I have it all
I've nothing without you
All my dreams and all the lights mean
Nothing without you
All my dreams and all the lights mean
Nothing if I can't have you

[Verse 1]
Would you be mine?
Would you be my baby tonight?
Could be kissing my fruit punch lips in the bright sunshine
'Cause I like you quite a lot, everything you got
Don't you know?
It's you that I adore
Though I make the boys fall like dominoes

[Pre-Chorus]
Kiss me in the D-A-R-K, dark tonight
(D-A-R-K, do it my way)
Kiss me in the P-A-R-K, park tonight
(P-A-R-K, let them all say)

[Chorus]
Hey Lolita, hey! Hey Lolita, hey!
I know what the boys want, I'm not gonna play
Hey Lolita, hey! Hey Lolita, hey!
Whistle all you want, but I'm not gonna stay
No more skippin' rope, skippin' heartbeats with the boys downtown
Just you and me feelin' the heat even when the sun goes down

[Verse 2]
I could be yours, I could be your baby tonight
Topple you down from your sky forty stories high
Shining like a God, can't believe I caught you and so
Look at what I bought, not a second thought, oh, Romeo

[Pre-Chorus]
Kiss me in the D-A-R-K, dark tonight
(D-A-R-K, do it my way)
Kiss me in the P-A-R-K, park tonight
(P-A-R-K, let them all say)

[Chorus]
Hey Lolita, hey! Hey Lolita, hey!
I know what the boys want, I'm not gonna play
Hey Lolita, hey! Hey Lolita, hey!
Whistle all you want, but I'm not gonna stay
No more skippin' rope, skippin' heartbeats with the boys downtown
Just you and me feelin' the heat even when the sun goes down

[Bridge]
I want my cake and I wanna eat it too
I want to have fun and be in love with you
I know that I'm a mess with my long hair
And my suntan, short dress, bare feet, I don't care
What they say about me, what they say about me
Because I know that it's L-O-V-E
You make me happy, you make me happy
And I never listen to anyone
(Let them all say!)

[Chorus]
Hey Lolita, hey! Hey Lolita, hey!
I know what the boys want, I'm not gonna play
Hey Lolita, hey! Hey Lolita, hey!
Whistle all you want, but I'm not gonna stay
No more skippin' rope, skippin' heartbeats with the boys downtown
Just you and me feelin' the heat even when the sun goes down

[Verse 1]
Let's get out of this town, baby, we're on fire
Everyone around here seems to be going down, down, down
If you stick with me, I can take you higher and higher
It feels like all of our friends are lost
Nobody's found, found, found

[Pre-Chorus]
I got so scared, I thought no one could save me
You came along, scooped me up like a baby

[Chorus]
Every now and then, the stars align
Boy and girl meet by the great design
Could it be that you and me are the lucky ones?
Everybody told me love was blind
Then I saw your face and you blew my mind
Finally, you and me are the lucky ones this time

[Verse 2]
Boy, get into my car, got a bad desire
You know that we'll never leave if we don't get out now, now, now
You're a careless con and you're a crazy liar, but baby
Nobody can compare to the way you get down, down, down

[Pre-Chorus]
I tried so hard to act nice like a lady
You taught me that it was good to be crazy

[Chorus]
Every now and then, the stars align
Boy and girl meet by the great design
Could it be that you and me are the lucky ones?
Everybody told me love was blind
Then I saw your face and you blew my mind
Finally, you and me are the lucky ones this time

[Bridge]
Feels like, feels like, you know it feels like
Falling in love for the first time
Feels like, you know it feels like
Falling in love

[Chorus]
Every now and then, the stars align
Boy and girl meet by the great design
Could it be that you and me are the lucky ones?
Everybody told me love was blind
Then I saw your face and you blew my mind
Finally, you and me are the lucky ones this time

[Hook: Tyga]
All day long

Kick her out my condo
Real G's, Last King, Young Money ballin'

Methaphorically I'm a toilet

2 girls 1 cup
Yup

[Verse 2: Gudda Gudda]

Straight to my partner room and let him beat it like a keyboard
All I do is dick em'

Man I gotta' ton of chicks under my belt
Like a zipper
Yeah
Walk up in the club
Pick em' out and then I pick em' off
Pick em' up and knock em' down
And then I drop em' off
I'mma dog
Keep you girl from around my type
Or she'll be milkbox material
And missin' for the night
Man this shit is just that easy
When yo' pockets sittin' right
I turn my bed into a stage
And let yo' bitch rock on my mic

[Hook: Tyga]

[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]
First I check my Rolley
Then say "watch me do it"
Watch me do it, show you how to cook like Martha Stewart
I want some cheesecake I have you walkin' to it
Plus I stack my money tall don't you walk in to it
Just do it all I do is smoke jet fluid
Fuck her with my chain on so my charm can hit her booty
Outrageous with the Louis I'm a fashionaire
Ever since 16 I been a fuckin' thousandaire
They know me by my nickname in the dealership
And all my shows are funeral homes I keep killin' shit
You used to get money so you reminisce
And if yo' bitch get with this she'll get benefits

[Hook: Tyga]
We can conquer the world
Just you and me no one else
Tell me if thats cool
What chu wanna do
Ahh Ohhh

Guns drawn in an all black car
Bustin at all the lames
Who got something to say about us
We can rob this world blind
And maybe next time
They'll think twice
Before they try fuckin with us

Just imagine what it be like be like
If you and me ruled everything
Would it be (Cool)
Or Would it be cool

Can you imagine what it be like be like
If you and me ruled everything
Would it be (Cool)
Or Would it be cool
If we would conquer the world
Would you be down to roll with me
Like partners in crime
Til the end of time

Guns drawn in an all black car
Bustin at all the lames
Who got something to say about us
We can rob this world blind
And maybe next time
They'll think twice
Before they try fuckin with us

Just imagine what it be like be like
If you and me ruled everything
Would it be (Cool)
Or would it be cool

Can you imagine what it be like be like
If you and me ruled everything
Would it be (Cool)
Or Would it be cool

Don't really care if the press likes me
Just speak my conscience, speak my mind

Queens up front, Brooklyn's in the back
Flack from flak guns, riot squads smokin' crack
The odds are stacked, for those who lack
Been a lucky motherfucker when it comes to that

I slow roast, I'm steady tappin’
Oh yes, I guess, I'm the toast of Manhattan
In Miami, I'm sleazy with John Salley
Shout to André Leon Talley

Get ready, get set (get set)
Place your bet (your bet)
What you get (you get)
Is not done yet (done yet)
Get ready, get set (get set)
Place your bet (your bet)
What you get (you get)
Here's a little something for ya

The shit is crazy
The shit is crazzzeee
Dr. Carlton Brassiere, a.k.a. Joyce
Dr. Bombay is the ladies choice
Step on stage to the smoke from dry ice
Every time I bring it twice as noice

Now ease up brethren, take an Excedrin
Only name check to rhyme is Tippi Hedren
I'm undefined, I'm gettin' much finer
Steady loungin' in my La-Z-Boy recliner

Losing it in traffic, amped up on coffee
Like kids going wild after school for Mr. Softee
Like a slice around the corner, uh, it's sneaking up on ya
Breathing down your neck, uh, it's creeping up on ya

Get ready, get set (get set)
Place your bet (your bet)
What you get (you get)
Is not done yet (done yet)
Get ready, get set (get set)
Place your bet (your bet)
What you get (you get)
Here's a little something for ya

[Intro]
"To really to be a creator, you must ask yourself, 'In the stillest moment of your night, if it were truly denied you to create, would you die?' And if your answer is yes, you have no choice. That is your choice, because there is no euphoria in a different place for an artist. That's where you are; that's what you do. That's it and it's not an easy life, but it's your life."

[Hook]
As soon as I wake up
I'm gonna change my ways
'Cause the music's my savior
And no one can take my pain
Except for this paper
The page, it flows like rain
As soon as I wake up
I'm gonna change my ways

[Verse 1: Xperience]
Instead of staying the same
'Cause I see better days ahead of me
I paint them on the page
Then I save them for the rainy ones
When anger and the anguish want to hang around
I say 'em outloud and complain to them
I figure I'm made to live and haven't gone that far
But I made it here, so if there is a God I give thanks to him
Then I take the pen and make amends again
The only way I know to repent
I know somebody's listenin'

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
Dear God, I'm so thankful for you keeping my plate full
The struggles, heartache, pain, the progress and the breakthrough
Every single track has made who I am to this day
Through this page is the only way to paint you
But lately it's like my soul feels counterfeit
Scared to pick up the pen to see what the hell might come out of it
So God, grant me the serenity without giving me the christening
Because all I ever needed was a beat and people listening
Step Cousins

[Hook]
As soon as I wake up
I'm gonna change my ways
'Cause the music's my savior
And no one can take my pain
Except for this paper
The page, it flows like rain
As soon as I wake up (Good Morning)
I'm gonna change my ways

[Verse 3: Xperience]
Instead of rotting away and plotting my grave, hiding in a bottomless shame
I found a way to fight my way out and see the light of day
And proud to say I took the safe route, but there's a price to pay
They like to keep my name in they mouth and tell lies on me
What you see is what you get, truth in the flesh, homie
You can do the rest, I'm through with trying to prove myself to you
I'll see you when you wake up, hope the feeling is mutual

[Verse 4: Macklemore]
Now for artists and musicians, you see the target's to listen
To the heart and then script it, with no margin, no limits
To make to pain, strengths, sun rays a part of the picture
And convey it in every shade and take it farther and vivid
They're gonna say what they say, to barge in the vision
And whatever the DJ plays, they market the gimmick
But I've got a path to follow and the longer the distance
I realize I'm already awake
I'm just starting to live it
My language

[Hook]
As soon as I wake up
I'm gonna change my ways
'Cause the music's my savior
And no one can take my pain
Except for this paper
The page, it flows like rain
As soon as I wake up
I'm gonna change my ways

When you see me in the streets
You better duck quick
Hell naw I ain't the one you wanna fuck wit
Hell naw I ain't the one you wanna fuck wit
Hell naw I ain't the one you wanna fuck wit

[Verse 1: Luda]

I'm in the streets
With my street clothes
All up in the club lookin for the freak hoes
With them dope boys
Who make the best bucks
Moving packages, like UPS trucks
Paraphernalia in my stash box
I hit a button and the Bentley makes his ass drop
Yo rims too small
Gone shoo fly
These 24's that's Ronald McDonald's shoe size
Fresh pair of J's
I brought the Mike's out
And some ammo that'll knock a nigga lights out
Choppas everywhere
Call me the butcher
I got an AK and I ain't talking Ashton Kutcher

[Hook]

When you see me in the streets
You better duck quick
Hell naw I ain't the one you wanna fuck wit
Hell naw I ain't the one you wanna fuck wit

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]

2 Chainz!
3 Cell phones
I don't never answer (never)
4 girlfriends, 3 of em dancers
I'm doin shows
Yours is gettin cancelled
I'm the type that mix cough syrup with a Fanta
A-T-L-A-N-T-A that my resident
Jury on same color as the president (black)
2 Chainz I ain't ringing like a ringtone
Mink hat, mink coat
I'm feeling like King Kong
I ain't the one
Bitch this my theme song
Throwing blunts back and forth like ping-pong
I'm getting to the money's apostrophe
I fucked her on a pile of clothes
She a closet freak

[Hook]

When you see me in the streets
You better duck quick
Hell naw I ain't the one you wanna fuck wit
Hell naw I ain't the one you wanna fuck wit
Hell naw I ain't the one you wanna fuck wit

When you see me in the streets
You better duck quick
Hell naw I ain't the one you wanna fuck wit
Hell naw I ain't the one you wanna fuck wit
Hell naw I ain't the one you wanna fuck wit

[Verse 3: Luda]

I got some head from this chick
She like my baritone
Her name was Tara
She said welcome to the taradome
Phantom driver head
I'm the worst
All blue body lose the top I'm papa smurf Ayee
Hit the strip club
Bring the bucks out
Same way every day like a bus route
Lone ranger, no tonto
So my nine got my back
Like Rajon Rondo
The gat is out
Pulling night duty
Always exposed
Like Ice T wife booty
Pull a double shift
I'm on my grind
Watch 80 grand swag workin overtime

[Hook]

When you see me in the streets
You better duck quick
Hell naw I ain't the one you wanna fuck wit
Hell naw I ain't the one you wanna fuck wit
Hell naw I ain't the one you wanna fuck wit

When you see me in the streets
You better duck quick
Hell naw I ain't the one you wanna fuck wit
Hell naw I ain't the one you wanna fuck wit
Hell naw I ain't the one you wanna fuck wit

[Verse 1: Sia]
You shout it out, but I can't hear a word you say
I'm talking loud, not saying much
I'm criticized, but all your bullets ricochet
You shoot me down, but I get up

[Pre-Chorus: Sia]
I'm bulletproof, nothing to lose
Fire away, fire away
Ricochet, you take your aim
Fire away, fire away

[Chorus: Sia]
You shoot me down, but I won't fall
I am titanium
You shoot me down, but I won't fall
I am titanium

[Verse 2: Sia]
Cut me down, but it's you who'll have further to fall
Ghost town and haunted love
Raise your voice, sticks and stones may break my bones
Talking loud, not saying much

[Pre-Chorus: Sia]
I'm bulletproof, nothing to lose
Fire away, fire away
Ricochet, you take your aim
Fire away, fire away

[Chorus: Sia]
You shoot me down, but I won't fall
I am titanium
You shoot me down, but I won't fall
I am titanium

[Post-Chorus: Sia]
I am titanium
I am titanium

[Bridge: Sia]
Stone heart, machine gun
Fired at the ones who run
Stone heart, as bulletproof glass

[Chorus: Sia]
You shoot me down, but I won't fall
I am titanium
You shoot me down, but I won't fall
I am titanium
You shoot me down, but I won't fall
I am titanium
You shoot me down, but I won't fall
I am titanium

[Outro: Sia]
I am titanium

[Verse 1]
The other day, me 'n XP opened for Souls of Mischief
I'm like "Yo, let's get on some angry MC showmanship and hit 'em"
Rocked all the cocky songs and not too many soulful lyrics
Even a couple dissin' women callin' 'em "groupies," "hoes," and "bitches."
Got off stage, and I'm like "Yo, I know that we killed it,"
Ran into a familiar face, a female who comes in and supports us
I said "Peace!" She said "Wait! Let me talk to you for a minute
I know it's none of my business, but I wasn't impressed by your performance."
I said "Word? Shit, I love feedback and criticism."
She said "I miss the passionate spirit, your political vision
Quite honestly I wasn't offended by those references to women
But you're only continuing society's conditioning."
It hit the heart of me
I told her that this was part of me
I stand up for human rights, and treat others how I would wanna be treated
But every song can't be seepin' with freedom
'Cuz the other side of me is sexist then people will feel that I'm preachin'
"Everything's peace and love?" uhh, that's somewhat misleading
Because this world is fucked-up and I'm a pro-duct to what I'm seeing
Not to justify, but just to touch on my being
I learn from these verses and my purpose gets surfaced with demons
Now I am sexist, I'm prejudice, I put that in my music
She said she heard that perspective, but before she turned around
She said "We have a flame, your fire's ignited with sound
Are you building the empire up, or using your fire to burn it down?"

[Hook x2]
Consumption, contradiction. I'm conflicted with being a hypocrite
And through these songs you can witness it
The differences, I admit this shit, because I'm just like you;
Walking a fine line between saying and living it

[Overvoice]
Light it up to burn it down, light it up to burn it down
Light it up to burn it down, down, down
Light it up to burn it down, light it up to burn it down
Light it up to burn it down, down, down, down, down, down, down

[Verse 2]
Now one thing that I've always struggled on
Is how to incorporate drugs and alcohol into my music outside of sober songs
'Cuz on that perspective, that's all over my records
But the other side isn't represented unless it sessions with XP
How can I admit that I love to smoke weed
Knowing the kids are listening and many of them look up to me?
Not to say that I'm a role model, but I know that words are power
And if I condone bottles and chronic, I am sending out the
Message "It's okay," hey I believe that it is
Chronic can be medicine, but it's all about your relationship with it
See I'm either off in the wagon riding and everyday with the spliff
Constantly looking for a balance but habit turns to addiction
And hip-hop music and weed: they're inseparable
So MCs that don't smoke or drink, talking about it, to me, seems questionable
It proves how much people just want to be accepted
And not seem straight-edge to their audience, so keeping it real is neglected
'Cuz when I'm smoking, I wouldn't wanna bump a song like this
Put on some Dev and break out the Swishers, and a bong and some licks
See that's a part of me too
And I know that I would make more money if I wasn't as true
To all the struggles of the blunted consumption I'm going through
Make music for the party, and the people support you
I burn Brother Ali and buy 50, what does that say to you?
Bring it back around
Am I building the empire up or using my fire to burn it down?

[Hook x2]
Consumption, contradiction. I'm conflicted with being a hypocrite
And through these songs you can witness it
The differences, I admit this shit, because I'm just like you;
Walking a fine line between saying and living it

Consumption, contradiction. I'm conflicted with being a hypocrite
And through these songs you can witness it
The differences, I admit this shit, because I'm just like you;
Walking a fine line between saying and living it

[Overvoice]
Light it up to burn it down, light it up to burn it down
Light it up to burn it down, down, down
Light it up to burn it down, light it up to burn it down
Light it up to burn it down, down, down, down, down, down, down

[Verse 1]
I gave you all the love I got
I gave you more than I could give
I gave you love
I gave you all that I have inside
And you took my love
You took my love

[Pre-Chorus]
Didn't I tell you
What I believe?
Did somebody say that
A love like that won't last?
Didn't I give you
All that I've got to give, baby?

[Verse 1]
I gave you all the love I got
I gave you more than I could give
I gave you love
I gave you all that I have inside
And you took my love
You took my love

[Hook]
I keep crying
I keep trying for you
There's nothing like you and I baby

[Chorus]
This is no ordinary love
No ordinary love
This is no ordinary love
No ordinary love

[Verse 2]
When you came my way
You brightened every day
With your sweet smile

[Pre-Chorus]
Didn't I tell you
What I believe?
Did somebody say that
A love like that won't last?
Didn't I give you
All that I've got to give, baby?

[Chorus]
This is no ordinary love
No ordinary love
This is no ordinary love
No ordinary love

[Hook]
I keep crying
I keep trying for you
There's nothing like you and I baby

[Chorus]
This is no ordinary love
No ordinary love
This is no ordinary love
No ordinary love

[Outro]
Keep trying for you
Keep crying for you
Keep flying for you
Keep flying, I'm falling

Keep trying for you
Keep crying for you
Keep flying for you
Keep flying, I'm falling
And I'm falling

[Intro: Nicki Minaj & M.I.A.]
L-U-V, Madonna
Y-O-U, you wanna?

[Verse 1: Madonna, Nicki Minaj & M.I.A.]
I see you coming and I don’t wanna know your name
(L-U-V, Madonna)
I see you coming and you’re gonna have to change the game
(Y-O-U, you wanna?)
Would you like to try? Give me a reason why
Give me all that you got
Maybe you’ll do fine as long as you don’t lie to me
And pretend to be what you’re not

[Pre-Chorus: Madonna]
Don’t play the stupid game
'Cause I’m a different kind of girl
Every record sounds the same
You’ve got to step into my world

[Chorus: Madonna]
Gimme all your lovin', give me your love
Give me all your love today
Gimme all your lovin', give me your love
Let’s forget about time, and dance our lives away

[Post-Chorus: Nicki Minaj & M.I.A.]
L-U-V, Madonna
Y-O-U, you wanna?

[Verse 2: Madonna, Nicki Minaj & M.I.A.]
Keep trying, don’t give up, that’s if you want it bad enough
(L-U-V, Madonna)
It’s right in front of you, now tell me what you're thinking of
(Y-O-U, you wanna?)
In another place, at a different time
You can be my lucky star
We can drink some wine, Burgundy is fine
Let’s drink the bottle every drop

[Pre-Chorus: Madonna]
Don’t play the stupid game
'Cause I’m a different kind of girl
Every record sounds the same
You’ve got to step into my world

[Chorus: Madonna]
Gimme all your lovin', give me your love
Give me all your love today
Gimme all your lovin', give me your love
Let’s forget about time, and dance our lives away

[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj & Madonna]
(Gimme all your love)
Give me all your love, boy
You can be my boy, you can be my boy toy
In the nick of time, I can say a sicker rhyme
'Cause it's time for change, like a nickel or a dime
(Gimme all your love)
Ugh, I'm Roman, I'm a barbarian, I'm Conan
You was sleeping on me, you were dozin'
Now move, I'm goin' in

[Bridge: Madonna & Nicki Minaj]
You have all the L-U-V
I gave you everything you need (Now move!)
Now it’s up to Y-O-U
Are you the one? Shall we proceed?

[Verse 4: M.I.A.]
Move, it! Licks
I’m some swag shit, no one gives you this
It’s supersonic, bionic, uranium hit
So I break ‘em off tricks, let’s pray that it sticks
I'mma say this once, yeah, I don't give a shit

[Pre-Chorus: Madonna]
Don’t play the stupid game
'Cause I’m a different kind of girl
Every record sounds the same
You’ve got to step into my world

[Chorus: Madonna, Nicki Minaj & M.I.A.]
Gimme all your lovin', give me your love
(L-U-V, Madonna)
Gimme all your lovin', give me your love
(Y-O-U, you wanna?)
Gimme all your lovin', give me your love
Gimme all your love today
Gimme all your lovin', give me your love
Let’s forget about time, and dance our lives away

[Verse 1: XP]
Still trying to figure out what I find comfortin'
And who's gonna take account for all this sufferin'?
It's not always gloomy, I'm assuming if you sing too
It might give me the power to wake up a-gain
Let's be honest, it's kind of hard to find beauty here
And a cobweb of a long leg, solace it would appear
Solid, Mr. blockhead with a wooden spirit
Tell the doctor we're all dead and it's looking serious
I've been at shows where the acted like they couldn't hear it
So I substituted my saliva for truth serum
This crooked look is piercing, it could burn a hole through you
I see through your two-faced ways despite the both of you
Askin' for a penny in a mechanical city
Black phantom of the back alleys, poet of the square smokers
Rappin' filthy where the animals with guilty pasts
Ration out their fat yellow bellies or the share holders

[Hook]
Damn it's cold here
Will the people start dancing when the smoke clears?
I need a reason to keep walkin'
Day dreamin' of the evil in my walkman
Say a prayer for the people in the audience
Say a prayer for the people in their coffins
And keep walkin'

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
Vanish through the alleyways (ghosts)
Past the green room
And have drink tickets to the point where I can't perceive truth
If God is in the building then I can't see you
Even if they put their hands up in the air that won't redeem you (shows)
It's the place where they start fables
They spend money on jack and coke but are flat broke when they hit the merch table
Now we hand out for the wolves and the people that are hungry
And won't sacrifice records to get some cheddar with their lunch meat
I just pray for that some day, but around here we get more rain then we ever get a sun break
It's never enough to get something and I wish I could say that I was humble enough to be blessed at some king
But it feels like hip hop's dead, I don't know who killed it
The poison in the pen or in the heads of who built it
If I don't know the ledge how can I expect that the children won't jump to their death when they question what real is?

[Hook]
The air is cold here
Will the people start dancing when the smoke clears?
I promise that I'll leap first
Just a starving artist surviving off eating my words
Say a prayer for the people in their coffins
Say a prayer for the people in the audience
Keep walkin'

[Outro Talking]

[Intro]
Ladies and gentlemen, Sekken Thaughtz on the beat
(And you know how I feel) Big up to Lace Cadence
Good lookin' out for this one, man

[Verse 1]
I love hip-hop music, I just hate the ego
The politics that follow it, getting caught in it can be lethal
See I love the community, 'cause a community will embrace you
But you turn it back the community is the people that will hate you
See everybody's striving for that same shit
To get paid and make it, and I'ma be honest, I'm tryna become famous
When someone makes a move watch that person next to you
Cause I'll warn ya
I love Hova but jealousy's The Takeover
Here come the mean mugs
"I can't do what he does"
And where does that lead us?
To the ego that feeds us
I wish that I could just do what I do
But when a door opens for him I'm afraid there won't be enough room
Comparison's a mother fucker
Like MLK said
"We all want that band leader syndrome and it won't stop"
This concept makes me wonder, is it the commodity
Of the music or the ego that is killing hip-hop?
(And you know how I feel)

[Chorus]
It's the ego that makes me not give respect in dap
It's the ego that makes me talk shit behind people's back
You know that it's the ego that's constantly polluting my consciousness
So ingrained in my brain that I can barely even acknowledge it
It's the ego that makes the present moment jet lagged
I said it's the ego that has me trippin' about the next man
You know that it's the ego that makes me not go to the front
Of the show cause the performers have exactly what I want

[Verse 2]
"I'm so cool"
For real?
You know dude, I'm serious spit it different and if you just flow too
I'll listen lookin' for glitches and rip 'em to shove improve
That my rhythm's a little bit more intricate, just to boost
My ego, it's so evil
Threatened by so many different kinds of people
It seems that if you're going through somethin' and life is feeling uncomfortable
The immediate place you go is to your ego to comfort you
When Boom Bap got signed I hated on him
When Grayskul got signed I hated Onry
And that's hard to admit, but since I'm really being honest
I wanted to be one of the first to make it as a Northwest rap artist
Instead of taking it as a plus for my region
I took it as a cut to my dreams of makin' it out of this political scene of
Northwest haters to be next, I guess I'm just like them
Jealous of who's taking that step

[Chorus]
It's the ego that makes me not give respect in dap
It's the ego that makes me talk shit behind people's back
You know that it's the ego that's constantly polluting my consciousness
So ingrained in my brain that I can barely even acknowledge it
It's the ego that makes the present moment jet lagged
I said it's the ego that has me trippin' about the next man
You know that it's the ego that makes me not go to the front
Of the show cause the performers have exactly what I want

[Verse 3]
Now everybody got one but people trying to front
Claiming that they on the humble but cocky
Now it comes up when we judge
Or are threatened by someone
But everyone still be like "man that's not me"
Now let me break it down son
It's only a lack of love for ourselves
Cause we're submerged in "I gotta be"
The best or number one
But it's just that we don't trust
In our heart and that's what stops me
It's the ego

[Intro: Kobe & Slim the Mobster]
Hold up, wait a minute (Uh-huh, I see)
Let me put some kush up in it (Breathe with me now)
Hold up, wait a minute (I see)
Let me put some kush up in it (Breathe with me now)
Hold up, wait a minute (I see)
Let me put some kush up in it (Breathe with me now)
Hold up, wait a minute (Yeah)
Let me put some kush up in it (Yeah, yeah)

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
Now, this that "puff, puff, pass" shit, Cheech and Chong glass shit
Blunts to the head, kush pillows, no mattress
Speedboat traffic, bitches automatic
Cross that line, fuck around and get your ass kicked
We roll shit that burn slow as fucking molasses
Probably won't pass it, smoke it 'til the last hit
Down to the ashes, Mary J. a bad bitch
Andre, 3001, another classic (One, one, one)
Go ahead, ask 'em— bitches 'bout how I be smoking out
(Party all night) Oh, yeah, it's goin' down
Order rounds, we smoke a quarter pound of that good stuff
Oh yeah, we smokin' all night
Yeah, puff puff pass that shit right here
Nigga, better than my last batch
Caramel complexion and her ass fat

[Bridge: Sly Pyper]
Inhale, exhale
Inhale, exhale, whoa

[Hook: Akon & Sly Pyper]
I know you tryna get high
Type of shit that have you leanin' sideways (Whoa, oh)
Take a whiff of this, suicide
Holla at me, ‘cause I got it all day (Yeah, ayy)
No need to fly to Jamaica
For the ganja, we can get the same thing
You want the bomb-bomb-diggy?
Holla at my niggy right here in L.A.
Inhale (L.A.), exhale (L.A.)
Inhale (L.A.), exhale

[Bridge: Sly "Pyper" Jordan]
Hold up, wait a minute
Let me put some kush up in it
Hold up, wait a minute
Let me put some kush up in it

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
Hmm! Still, I am
Tighter than the pants on will.i.am
Black throwback Steeler hat, pound in my backpack
Next to where the Swishers at, smoking presidential
Got some bubba, I'll give you that, need it for my cataracts
Four hoes and I'm the pimp in my Cadillac (Where my money, bitch?)
You can tell them Cali back; matter-fact, they'll know
This ain't 'dro, get a whiff of that
No, it ain't no seeds in my sack, you ain't never gotta ask, dog
"What he smokin' on?" Shit, kush 'til my mind gone
What you think I'm on? Eyes low, I'm blown
High as a motherfucker, yeah, ain't no questions 'bout it
Niggas say, "Smoke me out," yeah, I really doubt it
I'm Bob Marley reincarnated, so faded
So if you want it, you know your nigga, homie
You can put it in a Zag or a blunt and get blunted

[Bridge: Sly Pyper]
Inhale, exhale
Inhale, exhale, whoa (Yessir)

[Hook: Akon & Sly Pyper]
I know you tryna get high
Type of shit that have you leanin' sideways (Whoa, oh)
Take a whiff of this, suicide
Holla at me, ‘cause I got it all day (Yeah, ayy)
No need to fly to Jamaica
For the ganja, we can get the same thing
You want the bomb-bomb-diggy?
Holla at my niggy right here in L.A.
Inhale (L.A.), exhale (L.A.)
Inhale (L.A.), exhale

[Verse 3: Game]
Niggas put my face on the milk carton, take the shit off
Cause I’ve been home with the kids instead of breaking shit off
I’m asthmatic, aftermath-matic, Dre want me in the booth
The room better be padded cause I’m Loko
Psychotic, six hundred wide body
Lost a couple mill last year, but why cry about it
Westside got a nigga back so I throw my dubs up
Never leave without my strap, it’s like that
Got palm tree’s, we comin’ through on three’s
The A-F-T-E-R-M-A-T-H nigga we got a army
Aftermath general, one love to fifty
Ain't seen him in a minute though, used to be my nigga yo
Money changed niggas, but we the same niggas
Add fuel to the fire, that makes the flame bigger
But sometimes ego’s clash with desert eagles
And I stayed loyal to the city where the weed grow (Compton)

[Bridge: Sly Pyper]
Inhale, exhale
Inhale, exhale, whoa (Yessir)

[Hook: Akon & Sly Pyper]
I know you tryna get high
Type of shit that have you leanin' sideways (Whoa, oh)
Take a whiff of this, suicide
Holla at me, ‘cause I got it all day (Yeah, ayy)
No need to fly to Jamaica
For the ganja, we can get the same thing
You want the bomb-bomb-diggy?
Holla at my niggy right here in L.A.
Inhale (L.A.), exhale (L.A.)
Inhale (L.A.), exhale

[Outro: Blaqthoven & Kobe]
Need that kush, we blow on the best smoke
Inhale slow, no joke, make your ass choke
Hold up, wait a minute, you can go put it back
‘Cause what you got in your sack, boy, it ain't that
Need that kush, we blow on the best smoke
Inhale slow, no joke, make your ass choke
Inhale, exhale
Inhale, exhale

[Intro: Telly & Mac Miller]
When you're young, not much matters
When you find something that you care about, then that's all you got
When you go to sleep at night, you dream of music
When you wake up, it's the same thing
It's there in your face, you can't escape it
Sometimes when you're young
The only place to go is inside, that's just it
Music is what I love
Take that away from me and I really got nothing
Hah-hah
This shit right here, this feel like a million bucks
Jerm, make sure I'm coming through clear here
Most Dope, what it is?
Ladies and gentlemen, you are now in tune to K.I.D.S., uh

[Verse]
Motherfucker, I feel like the hardest working kid in America
Playing with the pros, I remember being amateur
But now I'm rocking shows, see the lights from the camera phones
See my people and they hands is up
Yeah, the game a girl, trying to tease, but don't plan to fuck
My older brother told me that I'm finally manning up, 'cause
I've been a fuckup, if you ask me
But I'm still praying that my teachers gon' pass me
Letters from my soul, scriptures from the Torah
Only give you what you like, I'm a station on Pandora
Rock a sag, my girl tell me pull my shorts up
Rock solid, homie, I'm built Ford tough
Sip a little lean, smoke a little weed
We just trying to keep it cool, so we blast the AC
Some people hate, we tell 'em it's all gravy
Yeah, you got your team, but I'm fighting with the navy
Battle to the top
We in it to win it, we won't stop
No more going to stores, but don't cop shit
Never go another day with empty pockets
Houston, you there? We balling like the Rockets
And now these eyeballs dropping out they sockets
High honor roll, but not thinking 'bout a college
Love with these rhymes, want the cover of Time
Man of the Year, got my image stuck in your mind
Hold up one second
Girl, this my last L, I'ma roll it up with you
Cop some brand new shoes, put me in a good mood
I'ma bring a couple homies, you can call a couple friends
Is there a type of alcohol that you would recommend?
Being young so fun, I don't ever want to age
Haven't came down in the past five days
Just trying to tell it like it is, we the shit
You now dealing with some motherfuckin' kids

[Outro]
What?
Rostrum Records in this bitch (Hah-hah)
Thank y'all for tuning in (What up, E?)
Let me do what I do
Most Dope, thumbs up, Pittsburgh

[Verse 1]
High heels on, hair did
Can't no other woman rock a dress like this
Body bangs, doing her thang
She the only reason for the song I sing
And I wish I could be there when she get ready to go
Dancing in the mirror and talking on the phone
Telling all the home girls what she putting on
They already know she putting on

[Chorus]
'Cause when she hit the club, heads turn around
She living it up, drinks up in the club
I'm in love from afar
Baby girl, I wanna be where you are
Be where you are
Where you are, where you are
Baby girl, I wanna be where you are
Be where you are
Where you are, where you are
Girl, I wanna be where you are

[Verse 2]
Should I make a move or should I fall back
Let you do what you do
See in you in the song, I ain't tryna kill the groove
Know you turning down all them other dudes
But I ain't nothing like them, no can't fight the feeling
Girl, I wanna know about you, yeah
Baby, don't you get me wrong, no
But I've been watching you so long

[Chorus]
'Cause when she hit the club, heads turn around
She living it up, drinks up in the club
I'm in love from afar
Baby girl, I wanna be where you are
Be where you are
Where you are, where you are
Baby girl, I wanna be where you are
Be where you are
Where you are, where you are
Girl, I wanna be where you are

[Bridge]
Are you here from one of my dreams?
'Cause I don't want to ruin this fantasy
To take the chance
And you don't wanna be mine
But you gotta be in my heart
Girl, I'm coming over to you
I'll put my pride to the side
But I wanna leave with all your love

[Chorus]
Be where you are
I just wanna be here
Be where you are
Where you are, where you are
Baby girl, I wanna be where you are
Be where you are
Where you are, where you are
Please don't deny me
Baby girl, I wanna be where you are
Be where you are
Where you are, where you are
Baby girl, I wanna be where you are
Be where you are
Where you are, where you are
Girl, I wanna be where you are
Be where you are
Where you are, where you are
Baby girl, I wanna be
'Cause when she hit the club, heads turn around
She living it up, drinks up in the club
I'm in love from afar
Baby girl, I wanna be where you are
Be where you are
Where you are, where you are
Baby girl, I wanna be where you are
Be where you are
Where you are, where you are
Girl, I wanna be where you are

[Outro]
Oh, oh, I'll go where you go

[Intro]
I'm Childish Gambino
INES and Foxy Show
Shia, you suck bad!

[Verse 1]
As the world's turning, feel like I'm a worse person
My tongue's hurting, from all of its work cursing
And I'm not certain, I think my father's LeVar Burton
Till I'm walking in circles and I'm talking in third person
In the eighth grade I got high off paper mache
I put it in my desk and I let it ferment a day
Because ain't nothing changed, I'm still known as a rude student
That'll walk inside your class and make fun of your school shooting
I can prove it, I'm too cool as a matter of fact
I been writing these verses while I'm having a heart attack
I'm in your bedroom cranking on out and staring black
Stereo blaring, Gwen Steffani can holla back
I'm not black, I'm a white boy with dark skin
At a Klan rally wondering why they won't let me in
Shia, I'm coming straight for ya, I hope you know that I'm on ya
D to the O's got a flow like menstrual cycles
Change my face every year like Michael... Jackson
Cause I'm packing heat
I got the fucking beat and a fucking lead
Dripping on you motherfuckers all the time
I bust guts like I bust a rhyme
I bust nuts like I'm Busta Rhymes
And I ain't even gotta do it, I ain't have the time
On Community
What you do to me?
Fly girls wanna get inside my booty
Or is it the other way around
Cause I'm skating on a skateboard, driving downtown
At Peachtree, Atlanta, Stone Mountain till I die
E-40 got nothing on this
Horny motherfucker from the Stone Mountain Georgia
Got something for ya
Yeah that freestyle was torture

[Outro]
I'm done!

[Intro: Raj Smoove]

And these niggas hustlin backwards
Like Pig Latin
Dear Captain
I'm too fast for these fucks
Man, the only time I see 'em
Is when I'm passin 'em up
That's right
I run laps around the block
For the guap
All I need is a gunshot
And a watch
I see the finish line
I've seen it plenty times
Them niggas been behind
Them niggas spittin rhymes
For me it's business time
Yea, love and hate
I walk the thinnest line
And I point a AK
Right at the witness line
I'm on the paper chase
Fuck what they say
The only date marked on my calendar is payday
And you could never get it free like AJ
But I could get you more keys than Dre Day
All I do is call Capito Bergante
I just gotta call Capito Bergante

[Hook]

Uhuh, I won't quit
Say blood, you talkin money?

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
I never stop grindin
Even if Simon
Said it
I'm tryna clean up like an edit
And if anything comes in town we let it
If not we get it and put your life on credit
Jetted
Up the block
Did the cop
After the kid
With the rock
In his sock
Fuck the neighborhood watch
As soon as enough money is in my knot
I'm yellin "Who got them keys"
Like the game's on lock
My aims on, I'm locked
Like I spot
But my eyeballs are gunshots, they pop
Outta my head
When you show me the bread
And I bet I could get a chicken
If you sold me an egg
Have ho's walk the strip
Like they owed me a leg
And it's money over bitches
No Al and Peg
Bundy
And on Monday
I ain't thinkin bout Tuesday
Cause anyday could be my doomsday
I'm a hustla

[Hook]
Nonstop
Youngun all around the clock
Watch you need? Get it fresh off the docks
It don't stop

[Outro: Raj Smoove]

[Verse 1]
I can be selfish
Yeah, so impatient
Sometimes, I feel like Marilyn Monroe
I’m insecure
Yeah, I make mistakes
Sometimes, I feel like I’m at the end of the road

[Pre-Chorus]
I can get low, I can get low
Don’t know which way is up
Yeah, I can get high, I can get high
Like I could never come down

[Chorus]
Call it a curse
Or just call me blessed
If you can’t handle my worst
You ain’t getting my best
Is this how Marilyn Monroe felt, felt, felt, felt?
Must be how Marilyn Monroe felt, felt, felt, felt

[Verse 2]
It's like all the good things
They fall apart, like
Li-li-li-like Ma-Marilyn Monroe
Truth is, we mess up 'til we get it right
I don’t wanna end up lo-lo-losing my soul

[Pre-Chorus]
I can get low, I can get low
Don’t know which way is up
Yeah, I can get high, I can get high
Like I could never come down

[Chorus]
Call it a curse
Or just call me blessed
If you can’t handle my worst
You ain’t getting my best
Is this how Marilyn Monroe felt, felt, felt, felt?
Must be how Marilyn Monroe felt, felt, felt, felt

[Bridge]
Take me or leave me
I’ll never be perfect
Believe me, I’m worth it
So, take me or leave me (Take me or leave me)
So, take me or leave me (T-t-take me or leave me)

[Chorus]
Call it a curse
Or just call me blessed
If you can’t handle my worst
You ain’t getting my best
Is this how Marilyn Monroe felt, felt, felt, felt?
Must be how Marilyn Monroe felt, felt, felt, felt
Is this how Marilyn Monroe felt, felt, felt, felt?
Must be how Marilyn Monroe felt, felt, felt, felt

[Hook: x4]
Face card, face card

[Verse 1]
Club owners remember my face
Parked my car in front of the place
No one interrupting my space
And I ball hard cause I got racks in my safe
Eat so good I got to say Grace
Girls wanna fuck me on the first date
What I'm gon' do with all these big faces

Smoking on purp that smell just like grapes

Buy my ace of spades by the case and I don't have to pay I just use my face

[Hook: x4]
Face card, face card

[Verse 2]
Grass cut, so I see the snakes

And I keep a big pistol right on my waist
Sipping on lean then drunk me two Ace

And they just let me out, murder was the case
Had a shiny suit on like Puffy and Ma$e

[Hook: x4]
Face card, face card

Got a G-4 but I do not have no one to fly it

Hundred racks of hundreds in the stash house
And I be saying somethin' when I mash out (SKRRRT)
In the Lambo looking like a fly
I shine like something in the sky
These haters hope I hurry up and die
Cause my bitch look like she said hurry up and bye

[Verse 6: T.I.]
Me and three females in the CL
Pink toenails tail like a beached whale
Tell em all better keep it on the DL
No phone, no Twitter, no email
Diamonds in the chain, none in the rear
Following the king of diamonds, bitch you went ape shit
Pocket racked up all big faces
After party crib full of broads all naked
Rose cases, we pop daily
We stay faded, need no occasion
Latin and Asians, Black, Caucasian
All go crazy for days in amazement

[Hook]
Rack city bitch, rack rack city bitch
Rack city bitch, rack rack city bitch
Rack city bitch, rack rack city bitch
Ten, ten, ten, twenties and them fifties bitch
Rack city bitch, rack rack city bitch
Rack city bitch, rack rack city bitch
Rack city bitch, rack rack city bitch
Ten, ten, ten, twenties and them fifties bitch

[Gucci]
I know God can't be mad at me
Because all the blessing he gave me!
Riding around with my top down I’m looking up at the galaxy (stars)
A lot of girls can’t stand me, They don’t really understand me
Can’t get half of my Phantom, Can’t get half of my mansion
Lost my homie to gunfire, Nigga part of my empire
Ever since that day I’ve been riding late like a vampire
People say I’m a addict, got a lot of bad habits (true)
I love smoking that broccoli, and I love stacking that cabbage
Shout out to my jeweler, Damn it’s such a good jeweler
Shout out to my shooter, Damn he’s such a good shooter
Every car that I ride, Clean from bumper to bumper
Every time that I slide, Throw my top in the dumpster
I’m OG, yous a youngster, Got more guns then contra
More chains than Busta, and more hoes then Usher
It’s Gucci Mane and Drumma, So that means more commas
I’m hands on like a laptop, Get your cap popped this summer (Gucci)

[Verse]
Sometimes I, I feel good
I be in the hood, I just ride by
Sometimes I, I feel bad
I be in the hood, Might do a drive-by
Sometimes I, I feel good
I be in the hood, I just ride by
Sometimes I, I be in the hood
And I’m feeling bad, Might do a drive-by

[Future]
Future got it bad, I’m a drug addict
Woke up seen a UFO, I’m a street fanatic
Money out the roof, I had it in the attic
Flyest nigga on Earth, Astronaut status
Astronomical I’m phenomenal
Money doing flips, I’m talking summersaults
I catch it for a summer, Aggravated assault
Winter time niggas come out with 20 dimes
Feel like I’m on a shroom, All this money in this room
Friday night lights, Chain still swinging
I’m a rock star, and I’m gang banging
Skulls everywhere, Spikes everywhere
Bloodhound for that money, Catch me anywhere
I went to space and left some niggas
I don’t fucking care
I should have went to Yale, The way I move a bail
Death before dishonor, I’ll never tell

[Verse]
Sometimes I, I feel good
I be in the hood, I just ride by
Sometimes I, I feel bad
I be in the hood, Might do a drive-by
Sometimes I, I feel good
I be in the hood, I just ride by
Sometimes I, I be in the hood
And I’m feeling bad, Might do a drive-by

Thank you all for coming out
God bless
Good night

[Intro]
Just a, just a, just a dream
Just a, just a, just a dream
Just a, just a dream

[Verse 1]
From my Lou's I'm seeing colors
Turquoise, ocean green, hurricane silver, yeah
I'm falling, down a well
Wish you were the water there
Just like a sun without a flame
Fell asleep without a dream
I saw the light fade
I let it drift away
I'm in that air and it's hard to breathe
Gravity won't hold my feet
(How'd I let my love breathe?)

[Pre-Hook]
I saw my life flash by the very minute
Saw my lightning, click, click, click
In a little glass bottle
Said I saw my life flash by that very instant
Saw my lighting, click, click, click
In a little glass bottle

[Hook]
Got to save, save me
I know you see me fall
I know you've come to die
Save, save me
My love is in the glass
My life is in that bottle
Wake up (just tell me that's it's all in my head)
Wake up (remind me that you're still in my bed)
Wake up (the thought of sleeping in my arms again)
Wake up
Wake up
Wake up

[Verse 2]
I'm in Emerald City, looking for Wizard Oz
Maybe he could tell me the way
To your heart again
I click my J's three times wishing she would've stayed
And then I thought I put her on a plane
Found a diamond for your ring
The crows on Saturn, then I'm back in L.A
I woke up, she ain't there
Levitating off the mattress
Baby where you at?
I said, oh, baby where you at?

[Pre-Hook]
I saw my life flash by the very minute
Saw my lightning, click, click, click
In a little glass bottle
Said I saw my life flash by that very instant
Saw my lighting, click, click, click
In a little glass bottle

[Hook]
Got to save, save me
I know you see me fall
I know you've come to die
Save, save me
My love is in the glass
My life is in that bottle
Wake up (just tell me that's it's all in my head)
Wake up (remind me that you're still in my bed)
Wake up (the thought of sleeping in my arms again)
Wake up
Wake up
Wake up
Wake up

[Outro]
It’s just a dream, that’s all our love is
It's just a dream
(It's just a dream)
(My love is in that bottle)
(Save, save me)

[Chorus]
If you in the ride, turn the volume real high
If you tryna feel the vibes, throw your hands up in the sky
Motherfucker, get 'em up, up, up, up, up, up
Get 'em up, up, up, up, up, up
If you in the ride, turn the volume real high
If you tryna feel the vibes, throw your hands up in the sky
Motherfucker, get 'em up, up, up, up, up, up
Get 'em up, up, up, up, up, up

[Verse 1]
The wheels stay spinnin' on the Civic, boy, I'm always on the move
When you grindin' all the time, there's a lot of shit to do
That's why I got Q, 'cause he keep me on the routine
I be too skeed, trying to kick it like Bruce Lee
Clean shoes, boy, new feet
And I'm never in the car with only two seats
I got a whip full of people, all fresh, call 'em 10 Deep
Motherfucker, we the future like next week
Young people don't see you as an equal
They just see you as deceitful, tryna send you back to preschool
You only gettin' one shot, no redo
Tell them haters keep they mouth shut, eat glue
Bitch, who the fuck you think you playing with?
I'm Justin Bieber meets Jadakiss
Here to take what's theirs, treat 'em all like Taylor Swift
Leave 'em in a daze, all like, "What day is it?"
Yeah, the boy got class, no Cambridge
Fresher than your man, girl, but whiter than a plate of grits
They keep wantin' more, I'm their favorite dish
This me, motherfucker, I ain't changing shit

[Chorus]
If you in the ride, turn the volume real high
If you tryna feel the vibes, throw your hands up in the sky
Motherfucker, get 'em up, up, up, up, up, up
Get 'em up, up, up, up, up, up
If you in the ride, turn the volume real high
If you tryna feel the vibes, throw your hands up in the sky
Motherfucker, get 'em up, up, up, up, up, up
Get 'em up, up, up, up, up, up (Hey)

[Verse 2]
I got a brand new phone, rocking brand new clothes
Leaving every single party with a brand new ho
Yeah, I've done a little travelin', circlin' the globe
Always keep it movin', inertia on these hoes
Boy, I'm an asshole, girls call him a douchebag
This some old-school shit, but no boom bap
This ain't new swag, it's the same old me
The youngin get respect from the game's OGs
Cameras flashin' when we passin', so we stay low-key
Go to Mexico to party where the pesos be
On the turnpike, bitch, and your tank on E
With my head out the window screaming, "Get like me"
Ho, you should know the way I roll
Take a couple shots all to Superman these hoes
You ain't nothin' with your wack rap
Used to be the class clown, but now I get the last laugh

[Chorus]
If you in the ride, turn the volume real high
If you tryna feel the vibes, throw your hands up in the sky
Motherfucker, get 'em up, up, up, up, up, up
Get 'em up, up, up, up, up, up
If you in the ride, turn the volume real high
If you tryna feel the vibes, throw your hands up in the sky
Motherfucker, get 'em up, up, up, up, up, up
Get 'em up, up, up, up, up, up

[Intro: DJ Holiday]
Quiet? No I can't be quiet
Shit, every time I talk that's Brick Fam. Holiday!
That's 185 right there
Yo Gucc! I know you got like ten birds when we walk in the club nigga
You know what it is, Trap Back baby! The streets is hungry

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Eighty grand in my Robin jeans
It's hot outside, but I'm coolin' it
Top on down but I'm losing it
Mind gone with a foreign chick
With a Tech-9 with a cooling kit
Got the black jeans with the wings on 'em
Gucci shoes, no shoe-strings
Shit, every word means two things
So the white girl is my boo thang
And I'll come in due time, in the drop head at the blue flame
And I don't like to see no new faces
Cause I don't like to learn no new names
I go to sleep in foreign places
Wake up, count big faces
Stuff cash in suitcases, pillowcases, I'm two-faced

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
I'm a walking lick, I'm a talking brick, talking shit
(W-walking lick, I'm a talking brick, t-talking shit)
I-I'm a walking lick, I'm a talking brick, talking shit
(W-walking lick, I'm a talking brick, t-talking shit)
I-I'm a walking lick, I'm a talking brick, talking shit
(W-walking lick, I'm a talking brick, t-talking shit)
I-I'm a walking lick, I'm a talking brick, talking shit
(W-walking lick, I'm a talking brick, t-talking shit)

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
Millionaire with Trues on in a stash house with shoes on
Put a million dollars in my new home
And a quarter million in my trap house
Put a half a mil' in your bank account
Nigga, serve dope in my zone
Cooking the work with no gloves on
So the junkies can get they grub on
I'm a OG with capital letters
On Capital Ave. with white leathers
In a '68 Camaro, no top on, I'm put together
I got salt and pepper, no Spindarella
Stupid cheese, that's Mozerella
Bust 'em open, put 'em back together
Then sell them to you, ahead of schedule

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
I'm a walking lick, I'm a talking brick, talking shit
(W-walking lick, I'm a talking brick, t-talking shit)
I-I'm a walking lick, I'm a talking brick, talking shit
(W-walking lick, I'm a talking brick, t-talking shit)
I-I'm a walking lick, I'm a talking brick, talking shit
(W-walking lick, I'm a talking brick, t-talking shit)
I-I'm a walking lick, I'm a talking brick, talking shit
(W-walking lick, I'm a talking brick, t-talking shit)

[Verse 3: Waka Flocka Flame]
I heard a price tag on my head! (Flocka!)
I'm a walking lick!
Nigga, come and try, you gon end up dead bitch
I'm out here roadkill, my niggas they so for real
Twenty minutes from my hood, I don't need no house on the hill!
Reachin for my tech, your mama better write your will
Shit gon' get ugly, my youngins pop about two pills
Where them niggas before and with this record deal
Me and Gucci Mane, bitch, we hard to kill

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
I'm a walking lick, I'm a talking brick, talking shit
(W-walking lick, I'm a talking brick, t-talking shit)
I-I'm a walking lick, I'm a talking brick, talking shit
(W-walking lick, I'm a talking brick, t-talking shit)
I-I'm a walking lick, I'm a talking brick, talking shit
(W-walking lick, I'm a talking brick, t-talking shit)
I-I'm a walking lick, I'm a talking brick, talking shit
(W-walking lick, I'm a talking brick, t-talking shit)

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Ever since I got a brick fair
I never look back there
If you ain't from the Zone 6
Shawty don't go there
I'mma die a bachelor
Girlfriend I don't want none
I already smashed her
So don't even go there

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Bitch I got a brick fair
Say them boys don't play fair
I'm from the East Atlanta Zone 6
And the kid got rich there
Hell yeah we got bales there
And you know we got bricks there
If the police pull me over
I'll probably get the damn chair
First one off the bench nigga
You can call me the 6 man
Lot of squares in my living room
AKA I'm the brickman
And I hope that you a snitch player
So we can throw you in a ditch player
The way I wrestle with the work nigga
People call me Rick Flair

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Ever since I got a brick fair
I never look back there
If you ain't from the Zone 6
Shawty don't go there
I'mma die a bachelor
Girlfriend I don't want none
I already smashed her
So don't even go there

[Verse 2: Future]
Dirty ass folk, dirty ass pistols
My lil goon in the hood & he just wait for me to hit him
Do you got a body for me beggin' on the line
And when I do, what would you do or not?
Hit em in the head, I had an extra five
Pushin weight like I'm doing exercise
Moving up the interstate
And I got them pills and pies
I go Pauly Costellano, I'm a mafia santano
I got accepted to the MOB now I think I'm Tony Soprano
Without the t.v, you wanna be if you see me
Just A-1 FBG, we hit onyx on our PT
Keep water on like FiJi
I make real movies in HD
Imma astronaut my real life
I promise you can't see me

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Ever since I got a brick fair
I never look back there
If you ain't from the Zone 6
Shawty don't go there
I'mma die a bachelor
Girlfriend I don't want none
I already smashed her
So don't even go there

[Hook]
I'm living life fast
Some tell me slow down but I continue speeding
The New York nights, Miami beaches, and Hollywood hoes
I'm fresh out the air so you won't see me there
Unless I'm weeded
That's all I know
Oh, oh, oh
I'm living life fast
Some tell me slow down but I continue speeding
The New York nights, Miami beaches, and Hollywood hoes
I'm fresh out the air so you won't see me there
Unless I'm weeded
That's all I know
Oh, oh, oh

[Verse 1]
I work hard, niggas hardly work
Smoke good Swishers, y'all hit dirt
Talk bad 'bout that Taylor Gang swag
Now we hit the club in a small T-shirt
Hoping that somebody will notice him
I'm chavo chasing, that money keep rolling in
I step on stage and they say he's going in
Four hoes tryna leave with me and the motorman
I'm blunt roasting
On a cloud just coasting
Shift once, and I'm speeding
On my way, outer space
A couple niggas in this race
But it's one that I'm leading
Hoes see me, think they dreaming
I'm a star
Drive a space ship sweetie, not a car
Come on dog, we ain't gotta wait for the weekend
I'll hit the West Coast and be back for the weekend
Swag

[Hook]
I'm living life fast
Some tell me slow down but I continue speeding
The New York nights, Miami beaches, and Hollywood hoes
I'm fresh out the air so you won't see me there
Unless I'm weeded
That's all I know
Oh, oh, oh
I'm living life fast
Some tell me slow down but I continue speeding
The New York nights, Miami beaches, and Hollywood hoes
I'm fresh out the air so you won't see me there
Unless I'm weeded
That's all I know
Oh, oh, oh
Holiday Season, bitch!

[Hook]
Don't play with me, bad bitches they stay with me
Wanna pop bottles all night with me, all day with me
Okay with me!
That's okay with me, yeah that's okay with me..

Bring that shit back!

[Hook]

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
White boys, dope boys, ballplayers, peons
Pull up in Europeans, back-to-back like it's a re-run
My pull up game is disgusting
You pussy niggas disgust me
Smoking on loud and it's musty
Like Hammer: can't touch me
Like desert loud got bricks in Memphis
They think I'm BMF cause I designed myself
Like a nigga in a casket I'm fresh to death
Intercept a whole shipment
Man Tity Boi on that pimp shit!
I like fast food, I eat quick
I told y'all, I got free bricks
I'm ready, like Pastor disaster
Eenie Minie Moe, which car could go faster
My trap house I'm king of this castle
Yellow bitch fine and her ass a little fatter
Gucci Mane ain't nothing changed, champagne in my campaign
We flyer than two private planes
It's 2 Chainz and Gucci Mane

[Hook]

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
Okay with me, yeah that's okay with me
Shawty got them crab legs I got that Old Bay with me
And I got that K with me, I wish they would try bitch!
Some niggas selling wolf tickets and I won't even buy them shits!
I go hard competing, my bankroll conceited
Take you home complete her
Then I skeet her and delete her
Do it with no compassion
Do it without her asking
Yeah I'm from Atlanta
But my jewelry from Alaska!
I was born to be what I was gonna be
Forgiato’s up under me
Concrete up on the deck
Gave the rear-view mirror a heart attack - BOOM!
Bottom. Name a nigga out here hotter
Playing basketball in my Pradas
Living like it's no tomorrow

[Verse 1]
Ayo, you ready? Yeah, I'm ready right, the fast life
Getting twisted almost every night, my mind is deeper
Than the voice featured on Barry White, I'm not the marry type
I make her sit in vinegar to get the candy tight
I’m flattered at all the chatter and comparisons
To the great, soon to see me right on Madison
Bally sneakers trying to stay up out the vat of sins
I tout the tacky shit I'm like a wild Iraqi
Outdoors with my sport vest, leather on the shoulder
Hold the rifle in place, knife in your face
I’m out the world just like a lightning in space
The ice sculptures on the table going nice with the plates of grapes

[Hook]
This is madness, certified madness
Rapping like a bandit, serving my advantage
Singlehandedly slam you to the canvas
Marijuana leaves are getting wrapped just like a bandage

[Verse 2]
Fuck the love, I want the money and the pussy
Brazilian bitches, names tatted on their tushie
You're a man dressed as a woman, call him Tootsie
I'm in the corner with a hooker playing footsie
Phone in my hands at all times like I'm a pimp, fuck shrimp
We eat steak, wine and cheese plate
Bronsonline the name is ringing out in each state
Play it cool or taste the weapon, time to meet fate
My feet slide just like a hockey player
Eating yakitori, getting hammered in the sake lair
Sucky sucky, happy ending shower
Wifey making dinner, I’ll be home about an hour
Crush the sour, dutches from the Netherlands
My rolling skills is undefeated yo you’ll never win
I bring the devil in, Bronson known for his benevolence
Polo fitted with a leather grip

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I wash my dick in the sink right when I wake up
Twisted from the night before raw inside a frightening whore
Hop in the whip and go for breakfast
Fried eggs and prime steak that's straight from out of Texas
Damn I’m living reckless, smoking all day just like the brisket
My beard is golden brown just like a biscuit
Everyday I’m thinking should I risk it, add another number to statistics
Or use the breast milk to eat my Crispix
I’ll feed her coke for a dick suck
Put a fucking roman candle up in this bitch butt
Now it’s on the computer, got the pussy moister than Bermuda
Pop a hole right through her throat, that’s no joke cause I’mma shoot her

[Interlude]
Yeah, damn, yo, fuck
Yo, three verses ain't enough anymore these days man? Fuck

[Verse 4]
This shit is rawer than a tuna on a plate for eighty dollars
Or the sex that I be having though I hate my baby momma
It’s always drama, she got too much time on her hands
Watching Tyra steady planning a plot on your man
My eyes are open like an owl though
Animosity, trying to get the paper, sour dough
But if I die before the hour go
Just place the Ballys on my feet and smoke my body like a pharaoh ho
Egyptian fixtures, patties by the colliseum
Guns from Russia, I turn 'em to a ballerina
Cop the work then they bagging coke
Transporting interstate, Carolina to Tobacco Road
To the knee or to the ankle where the jacket go
Master flow work now so I got cash to blow
When I’m older, leather on a rugby shoulder
I’m top dogging if I’m lying may they slump me over
Red Falcons hat, all red hoodie
Santa Claus of the city, bag full of goodies
50 pints of purple drank came with the seal
I wish these faggot-ass cops would let a nigga live
I'm trynna come down the chimney with a hundred mil(lion)
So many hundred dollar bills that it give you chills
A bad bitch from Brazil, got her on the pill
You wake up, see her cookin' cookies in your crib
I'm the Brick Squad boss, I'm like Santa Claus
Mrs. Claus on the pole with her panties off
And I know when you're sleeping' and know when you awake
No eggnog, but some bottles of that Ace Of Spades
Black Versace shades, so it's hard to see them
Where's Rudolph Red-Nose when I really need him
A bunch of elves on the team and I've gotta feed them
They carry sawed-off pumps, so it's hard to beat them
I gift wrap a pipe-bomb, bring it to your door
Ring the bell, sit back, and watch the fucker blow
So how you build a snowman with all this melted snow
Santa Claus bringing blocks in from Mexico
I made a hundred-thousand dollars at the Texaco
They lock me up, and let me out; I feel like Plaxico
I'm goin' in on these suckers, call me Santa Claus
And it's a bunch of bad bitches in Santa's house
A igloo full of snow and a white stove
I'm in the kitchen, cookin' dope in a white robe
House full of naked hoes snortin' blow
I'm in Zone 6, AKA the North Pole
It's so lonely at the top, plus it's real cold
My ears, neck, wrist, fist is real cold
A house full of hoes and they cookin' blow
I'm in Zone 6, AKA the North Pole

[Intro]
Awww yeah! We in the motherfuckin' place tonight!
Show's about to start guys, everybody get to your seats
Bronsolinio's comin' to the stage
Mmm, knew about the local things what they all talkin' about

[Verse 1]
Step in the door, Bronsolini, the mayor
The kush replayer, 80's bushy pussy gushy slayer
I'm a star and I'mma prove it
Saw me in the foreign car, shorty had a movement
Comin to your town, lockin' it down, rockin' it out
I'm on fire there's no stoppin' it now, it's tournament edition
Shorty on the arm an ornament for fishin'
Brussels eatin' breakfast in the Orient for chicken, listen
Know my mother wanna see me win
Slide the crack inside the slot you put your CD in
Give a couple bucks, let me live, puff a dutch
Cause ain't no motherfucker playin' me in Suckerpunch
It's my time, no more standin' in line
Now it's time to eat, paired up with the rarest of wine
Hair red just like the meat, never careless with mine
Play your part and stay sharp daddy, cherish your crime

[Verse 2]
Aiyyo, you couldn't wait to hear this fly shit
Shorty open up your thighs quick, smoke the pussy like a Thai stick
My style is lovin' in the island by Dubai dick
I leave my socks right on the floor cause this is my shit
Intoxicatin' aroma, drugs rolled in a diploma
Beautiful wine, we in Sonoma yo
The cheese plate, fish a pike out the lake
Take a dyke on a date, she let me pipe cause I'm an ape
White limey, maneuver at night, fuck assumption
Bronsolin' bring the truth to the light, that we the best
And ain't no motherfucker tellin' me different
Most talent and I practice, ain't no shock that I'm winnin'
Double-layered linens
Known for sinnin' in cinnamon women in tinted renteds
Cinderella pendants, the Lord flow tremendous
All I got is myself so fuck a co-defendant
Struck ass stripper, she tried to play me yo the whore's demented

[Outro]
Bronsolinio, Amuse Bouche
Just a little fuckin' taste of that mouth bitch

[Intro]
White girl, white girl, shy girl, shy girl
White girl, white girl, night girl, night girl

[Verse 1 : Gucci Mane]
I’m from East Atlanta where they cutting off fangas
Got a white girlfriend she be acting a anus
She can get you knocked out with a point of a finger
And she don’t talk to strangers, she got red tangas
Got coke in the strainer and a lawyer retainer
So you hard so you soft, she got all kinds of angles
And this California kush it got me talking like I'm Tony (Montana)
Playing with my money then I’m calling my attorney
And them people can’t believe that Gucci man got jungle fever
And I think I love this girl because her price is hella cheaper
And like lu said it’s better to loose a love than love a leaver
Running around town with them choppers about the same size as Justin Bieber

[Hook]

[Verse 2 : Yo Gotti]
Mexican, Jose, Virgina? You don’t say
Chopper bullets, rotate
Hundred round AK
Young nigga thug b!tching on color back
Pocket full of money and all I stack is dollar signs
White girl crazy, wrist done got lazy
Never been a racist, a white girl pay me
My credit card black new b!tch brown skin
Duffle bag full of that green shit
Ain’t nothing like my white friend
White benz, white on white
Rolling on my grown man
30 corners in that b!tch narrow with them thangs
I love that white girl, and I beat her like a mushay
Ridgecrest Apartment got you screaming like the OG

[Hook]
I fell in love with that white girl (white girl)

[Verse 3 : Gucci Mane]
Creep out through the day, creature of the night
Let her sit on your face, she’ll get you high as a kite
She knows just what you like, I know just what you need
If them white girls you like, bet I got one of your type
Have a blunt for the day, brunette for the night
She got my pockets eight I bring her out in the light
I got the crowd I got them
I got them vans (its Gucci)
I got her ticked off in my van
She fuck with me cause I’m the man
I’m passing kush out to my fans
And I don’t think you understand
She got me folding other brands

[Verse 1]
Way sick, no antidote
Earring same size as cantaloupes
They glow with my homeboy and low
Goddamn, little shorty got a camel toe
Hands on like a iPhone or a laptop or a iPad
So I make money like a ballplayer
So my pockets look like thigh pads
I'm the man, got the car with the trunk in the rear
Five mil a year, that's Gucci
Smoke a blunt, pop a pill
Snort a line, who cares
Get the popcorn out, it's a movie
Sir Mix-a-Lot, serve bricks a lot
Got a big old watch on my time clock
Push the button and my top drop
And I ain't even have to go to no chop shop

[Hook]
You niggas think the same, I think the opposite
Put my trunk in the front, that's the opposite
All red guts, but the paint is chocolate
Steering wheel on the side, that's the opposite
Gucci Mane, Southside, thinking opposite
Love stacking cabbage, but I'm smoking broccoli
You gonna pay her, eat the box, I'm the opposite
I'mma break her, cut her off, that's the opposite

[Verse 2]
Money don't make me, I make money
You niggas funny, I'm too real
Smoke big stank, got big bank
I'm heart-stopping, I'm hard to kill
Make a hundred million, God willing
Leave a hundred million to my little children
Got no ceiling and no feelings
I'm the truth, nigga, that's what it is
Got two million on my ice bill
Rolling cause I'm on two pills
I'm throwing money like a windmill
I'm so cold, lowering the wind chill
In a Maserati on Candler Road
Me and Mojo, and I'm blowing dro
Is you filthy rich? I might be
Is you best at it? I think so

[Hook]
You niggas think the same, I think the opposite
Put my trunk in the front, that's the opposite
All red guts, but the paint is chocolate
Steering wheel on the side, that's the opposite
Gucci Mane, Southside, thinking opposite
Love stacking cabbage, but I'm smoking broccoli
You gonna pay her, eat the box, I'm the opposite
I'mma break her, cut her off, that's the opposite

[Verse 3]
I was locked up, no sunshine
Now I'm out and I'm balling too hard
Got two scrubs, no b-girl
My jewelry game is retard
Like a six-shot, I'm fully loaded
At Magic City, I'm getting loaded
Smoked so many blunts with your girlfriend
I thought that her head exploded
It's ooh-wop in that new drop
Got four o's in my soda pop
I'm so faded, I'm so wasted
I thought that I had dreadlocks
Make money at a fast pace
Don't come out here cause it ain't safe
Roll orange and I drink grape
I can't feel my damn face
It's Gucci!

[Hook]
You niggas think the same, I think the opposite
Put my trunk in the front, that's the opposite
All red guts, but the paint is chocolate
Steering wheel on the side, that's the opposite
Gucci Mane, Southside, thinking opposite
Love stacking cabbage, but I'm smoking broccoli
You gonna pay her, eat the box, I'm the opposite
I'mma break her, cut her off, that's the opposite

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
Get it back, get it back
Bitch, I know I get it back
Give a fuck bout that little paper
Cause I know I get it back

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
I got cash, cash on fire
Cash on hand, cash on deck
Give me everything 3 X
And all 12's up off that rack
Wash my stash with Ajax
Me and Tit, back to back
And we ridin' around, smoking Kush by the pound
Like how it ride but we love how it sound
Drop-top Lam so low to the ground
Just like a snail, I'm close to the earth
Waves on my temp, so a ho gotta surf
Hollering rock -- when you're scared, go to church
Me and Slim Dunk in the club throwing racks
Go into the trap and I get it right back
Want 10 bricks? You can get it right now
Pull to the trap house, come to the back
Riding domestic with the trunk in the back
Riding in a foreign, so the trunk in the front
Sixty thousand cash just for me to roll blunts
Standing in front, blowing kush through her dress
Five grand just to see her dance
Ten grand just to see her tats
Jump in the corner and he smoking on her clit
Waiting on you, so he get it right back

[Hook]

[Hook 2: Gucci Mane]
In the club, throwin' money
I done run through me some racks
Give a fuck bout that little paper
I know I get it back
Get it back, get it back
Bitch, I know I get it back
Give a fuck bout that little paper
Cause I know I get it back

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
Get it back, get it back
Yeah, you know I get it back
Shorty say she want my name
So I bought that bitch a tat
I walk in this bitch with racks
Tell them, come and get this paper
Yeah, my bitch is made in Asia
And I'm icy like a glacier
Get your baby momma
Take her then make her
You date her, then fuck her
I fuck her, then date her
Everything is on the up
Like a elevator
Gucci Mane and Tity Boi
College Park and Decatur
Now I do it for the haters
Started with a Buick LeSabre
Ended with that Ferrari
Tell me, meet me up out in Vegas
Got so many acres
I don't ever see my neighbors
Niggas say they want a mil
I put money on the table

[Hook]

[Hook 2]

[Intro]
If you had a choice then what would you choose to do?

[Chorus]
I could live without money, I could live without the fame
And if every day was sunny, I could live without the rain
And if I ever went up to Heaven, I would fall right back down
That life wouldn't be living 'cause you're the one I couldn't live without

[Verse 1]
If I couldn't blink would I still be able to see you?
I couldn't imagine, oh
Without arms could I reach?
No way could I ever hold you, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
I need these things like I need you
If you had a choice, what would you choose?

[Chorus]
I could live without money, I could live without the fame
And if every day was sunny, I could live without the rain
And if I ever went up to Heaven, I would fall right back down
That life wouldn't be living 'cause you're the one I couldn't live without

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, oh-oh-oh
Woah, oh

[Verse 2]
If I couldn't dream would I believe that there could be a you and me?
And if I couldn't sing, would you be able to hear my melody?
I know that something's wrong and I'm afraid that you're moving on
How can I fly when you're my wings?

[Pre-Chorus]
I need these things like I need you
If you had a choice, what would you choose?

[Chorus]
I could live without money, I could live without the fame
And if every day was sunny, I could live without the rain
And if I ever went up to Heaven, I would fall right back down
That life wouldn't be living 'cause you're the one I couldn't live without

[Bridge]
You can take it all from me and it wouldn't mean anything
Turn the whole world against me as long as you don't leave
It's getting hard for me to sleep, even harder for me to breathe
I'm used to life with you, tell me what I need to do

[Chorus]
I could live without money (Oh), I could live without the fame (Ooh, ooh)
And if every day was sunny (Oh), I could live without the rain (Ooh, ooh)
And if I ever went up to Heaven (Oh), I would fall right back down (Ooh, ooh)
That life wouldn't be living (Oh) 'cause you're the one I couldn't live without (Woah, oh)
I could live without money (Oh), I could live without the fame (Ooh, ooh)
And if every day was sunny (Oh), I could live without the rain (Ooh, ooh)
And if I ever went up to Heaven (Oh), I would fall right back down (Hey, hey)
That life wouldn't be living 'cause you're the one I couldn't live without (Woah)

[Verse]
Self-loathing narcissist
Spittin' crowbars out the back window of cars and shit
And acting like a Klonopin binge, hardening
And switching up the moniker of artists into arsonists
Knock-knock, it's that prodigal pen-throttle, bitch
Popping like the top of a bottle of hot JavaScript
Rhyme harder than nine joggers with
Shin splints dodging an ornery rhinoceros
Order me my waffles and bother me not, blogger
The option of being modest just walked to where my father went
Ponder how we can holler then spit darker
Than Gotham at six bars in the genre then lick shots
At imposters and miss nada, volatile pig brawler
Is hotter than lit parliament singeing your fucking arm
In the parking lot of a Target, I'm targeted, piss-harboring
Heart dark as that thick parka I slip markers in
Holla if you've never been a starter
Spartan kicking jocks and tossing salt at their Ed Hardy shit
Burning chops, talking shit, rocking 28's on a rocket ship
So I could give a fuck about the car you in, nigga
Drool and chew aluminum
Blue 'Preme overalls, jump when the Goombas come
From where you should run, from where the shooters come
Out for cheese with a studio, it's like a gouda run, it glues to us
Shouts to pigeons that I flew amongst
Mouth deliver poop, it's spouting mucus from its stupid tongue
Alpha male, got the chickens looser than his cruising trucks
Losers get a Kuma Punch, keep it moving like a puma's lunch (Thanks James)
And I'm... back
Bye

[Intro]
Drum Squad and Gucci
Gucci Mane and Drumma
Bankrolls got dumber
Cause we ain't getting no younger
Comma after comma
Comma after comma
Comma after comma
It's Gucci Mane and Drumma

[Hook]
Fell in love with bricks
Damn, I love my plug
My girlfriend broke up with me
Cause she said she tired of them drugs
Hang around with thugs
Make a move with g's
I'mma stack my cheese
And I'mma sell my p's
Yeah, I'm from the A
A lot of B's and C's
That's Bloods and Crips
Can't forget GD's
Pause the track for a second
I just wanna say thank you
All this money I made
I don't wanna be ungrateful

[Verse 1]
My earrings ten kilos
I'm going crazy like Cee-Lo
Stack a whole bunch of zeros
But don't go tell my P.O
My dope got a vertical
It jump from the free-throw
My kush got a real loud smell
You could smell the shit from Rio
Count a hundred in serial
Peanut butter interior
My jewelry game on Frigidaire
My watch cold as Siberia
Gucci Mane, is you serious?
Hell yeah, I'm serious
Red watch with the red chain
My diamonds on they period
I'm thugged out and I'm plugged in
You sucka niggas is suspect
Don't know who let all these scrubs in
My top down but I'm upset
All hundreds, got no change
He wanna change the subject
Millionaire with a mansion
But I came up in the projects

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
All the money I made
I don't wanna be ungrateful
Shout out to my plug
I wanna tell him thank you
Thank you for them drugs
Thank you for them bails
Thank you for them bricks
Got to use my scale
Got to check my pack
Got to run up my sacks
Got ballplayer money, nigga, check my stats
That's a well-known fact
I'mma cook it up like this
Work my wrist like that
Got a old-school in this black
Rapper and trapper, wear two hats
I got dirty money like Diddy
Need to wash them stacks with Ajax
Call me Gucci Mane, it's my city
Close the curtains in my Maybach
Diamonds dancing with the stars
Got 'em glancing at the ice
Pockets fat as Kelly Price
And I love selling white
Gucci!

[Hook]

(Headbanger)

[Verse 1]
Movin' wit out movin', Pure crush groovin'
Right on track, right on and I'm back
Rap Ex-Lax yeah, I be pooin' on ‘em
Damn right, Mr. Cudi he be dippin' on ‘em
Say it loud, y’all want the new-new
Explorer like Dora, that’s how I got a clue too
So fucking underground, barely on Youtube
'Till Day N Night, now they all got a clue who
Took me a minute man, took me a while
Hard headed nigga ever since I was wild, a child
But my ambitions made bitches beg for attention
DJ’s un-mixin' their mixes, just to toss in some Cudder
And I tried to tell my mother
But she ain't underdig, figure me on some other
But see my mommy 'ain't a fronter
So nowadays she calls me a bad motherfucker

[Hook]
And, just when it seemed that the game is hopeless
We arranged some thing for a dose of dopeness
I, I do, what I do
And, I, I do, what I do
And, just when it seems that the game is hopeless
Rearrange some things for a dose of dopeness
I, I do, what I do
And, I, I do, what I do

[Bridge]
Do my little dance, sippin' out a cup
All my people in the back, my people in the front
I, I do, what I do
And I, I do, what I do, do
Do my little dance, sippin' out a cup
Pullin' up my pants, she come walkin' up, and I'm like...
I, I do, what I do
And I, I do, what I do, do

[Interlude]
Whoah, Nigga!
Y'all motherfuckers need to understand the fuckin' game
Shit ain't gon' change unless a motherfucker come in this shit, switch it up
Niggas need to open they fuckin' minds, Nigga!
'Cause this is some shit, that y'all niggas ain't ready for
Ya underdig, ya understand me?

[Verse 2]
Movin' wit out movin', pure crush froovin'
Right on track, right on and I'm back
You make songs about some new dances
I make songs 'bout the black man advancements
I'm talkin' classic homie, I'm talkin' monumental
And I don't need much but Dot instrumentals
That's how I lay the stencil, me smilin' up out the window
I'm in the leaner dome, that's my crib on the moon
And I'm livin' in hotel rooms
In the mirror, laughing at my crooked tooth
How a nigga eat, is how a nigga speak
And how a nigga live, is sacrifice was big
And I'mma say it right before the hook
Maybe in due time, Pimpin', I'mma write a book
But now I'mma play my Andre 3000
And dream about an island wit model girls eyein'

[Outro]
Um... hello
Hey baby
Um... yeah
Some people call me Cudi, some people call me Scott
It don't matter what you wanna call me, as long as you call me something
As long as you call me, baby
But um...
You know...
You seem real pretty
And I ain't talkin' bout how you look
I'm talkin' 'bout your, your vibe
Your vibe is pretty
I'm pretty hungry, you want to go get something to eat?
Sip on something?
Where we going?
The moon...

[Hook]
When I first started back in 1995
I wasn't moving keys, I was buying 1.5's
I started coming up, junkies recognized my face
Paid a quarter million dollars just to beat a murder case
They used to run up on me be like, "Gucci, what you know?"
I tell them, "Get this glass, and get the fuck away from me ho!"
And everywhere I go, it became an instant cut
Cause they knew had them 20's and them big fat monkey nuts

[Verse 1]
Can't be scared of the dark when you come from Mountain Park
Shooting dice and playing cards, selling blow all at the park
Had a crush on your sister, but I used to serve your mama
Breaking 50s down to dimes was my job for the summer
And my job for the winter cooking bricks all in the kitchen
Junkies dead at the car wash cause I heard that they was snitching
Dope jumping out the gym, man it helped me buy my Timbs
Dope fiend Willie used to finger fuck my rims
Smokers didn't know my name so they used to call me Black
If you beep me for a 20, bet ya I'mma call you back
She on the dope man dick cause I'm a nigga with a sack
I'm the hustler of the year, and I know that for a fact

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Price so low that they call me thrift store
Standing at the store and I'm selling yayo
Bought a brick yesterday, got a 4-way to go
On the 5-way, everything gotta go
50 on the table, 100 on the floor
Middle of the summer, bruh I'mma make it snow
Like a Chia Pet, my money gon' grow
Still serving niggas through my burglar bars door
Jordace Jeans and a little afro
8-Ball jacket and a pair of Stan Smiths
I don't deal credit, that's how niggas get killed
And if you gotta tip, then your car getting peeled
17 going to the 5-5-9
Like a blind man, I don't see no lying
13 when a nigga did his first crime
18 when a nigga bought his first 9
If I'm lying, I'm flying, and I show ain't flying
Cooking up dope cause the J's keep buying
Robbers do lurk and I know they trying
Try Gucci Mane and you gon' be dying
Let me take you back in time
Let Gucci Mane refresh your mind
I'm a dope boy, stay on my grind
A good plug is so hard to find

[Hook]

[Verse 1]
Purple haze all in my brain
Lately things, they don't seem the same
Acting funny, but I don't know why
'Scuse me while I kiss the sky

[Verse 2]
Purple haze all around
Don't know if I'm coming up or down
Am I happy or in misery?
Whatever it is, that girl put a spell on me
Help me! Help me!
Ah no, no

[Instrumental - Guitar solo]

[Verse 3]
Yeah! Purple haze all in my eyes
Don't know if it's day or night
You got me blowing, blowing my mind
Is it tomorrow, or just the end of time?

[Outro]
No, help me
No, yeah purple haze
Oh no, no
Oh, help me
Tell me, tell me
Can't go on like this
You make me blow my mind
No, no, no
No, no, purple haze

[Verse 1]
Jojo was a man who thought he was a loner
But he knew it couldn't last
Jojo left his home in Tucson, Arizona
For some California grass

[Chorus]
Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, Jojo

[​​Interlude]​​
Go home

[Chorus]
Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, Jo

[Electric Piano Solo: Billy Preston]

[Verse 2]
Sweet Loretta Martin thought she was a woman
But she was another man
All the girls around her say she's got it coming
But she gets it while she can

[Chorus]
Oh, get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, Loretta

[Guitar solo: John Lennon]
Hoo
Go home

[Chorus]
Oh, get back, yeah, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Yeah, get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged

Ooo

[Verse 3]
(Ooo, ow)
Get back, Loretta
Your mommy's waiting for you
Wearing her high-heel shoes
And her low-neck sweater
Get back home, Loretta

[Chorus]
Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Oh, get back, get back

[Outro]
Get back, oh yeah
Jojo
Loretta

[Intro]
Who y'all talking to man?
It's Big Sean, aye check it out, check it out, aye
This song is dedicated to all my niggas, who be hittin' mad hoes
Thinkin' everything's sweet, nigga
Better watch out, before something creep up on yo' ass.You know?
D-Town what up?

[Verse 1]
B.I.G is, se is on this beat-is
Why is they in my shit?
I guess they used to being nosey like Kleenex
Cleanest, as the cleanest
Head, toe, to penis, that's why she on my dick
Petiteness but that ass fat
So I grabbed that, and we would kick it like hacky sack
And yup and she was all mine, I had the ass cat
Made her my girl and my world, might I add that?
And it's sad that
After a few years and a few tears it all ended, and that's that (So sad)
The love was real, that's what my hearts feelin'
And even though we split, was no hard feelings
I ran into her though a few months after
At the, corner of Main St. and Fifth Ave
Asked her, how she was, how's mama and papa?
She said, "Aw boy, you know that you all that they aska' 'bout
And I'm proud you doin' good as a rapper
It's nice to see you off the ground like NASA"
And then we started kickin', and reminescin' bout' times past when I smashed
She said, "Remember in the rain I giggled when it splashed?"
She came twice, I came last on the grass
And all that talkin' got me in the mood (The mood)
I wanna get that ass in the nude, (The nude)
So I invited her back to my condo
Pronto to continue this convo, 'cause I know
If I hit that ass then, shit I could probably hit it again
So, then we back at my place
And it was no time wasted, she was in my face
But when I reached for that magnum
Shit, that's when she got mad and said
"Sean I wanna feel you like I used to baby and not this plastic"
I said, "Bitch, it ain't like how it had been
I don't know where you had been, I won't end up like Magic"
I promised Mama I would never end up like Magic
And I don't care how good that ass is
And since I wanted to dick her out
It just hurt much more after I kicked her out, damn
I need a model chick, where's Tyra?
Or maybe Eva, she fina'
But then my nigga Tone hit me on the phone
Like "Dawg, pray to God you didn't bone yo' bro
I was talking to that chick I hit, You know Symone
Well anyway her and your old girl like sisters (For real?)
But I guess she ain't know you was my nigga
To make a long story short
Last week on the 4th, they both got tested
Got the results, she tested positive for genital warts
And, for all them times you made her life depressin'
She wanted to pay you bick witha' infection (What the fuck?)
Grab the weed, grab the cell
Call up my niggas, got a story to tell

[Outro]
Yeah. So the other day fam, I was on Main St. and 5th Avenue gettin' my shop on and shit. (Right, right, word) Gettin' them shoes and shit. So I ran into my old chick dawg and I was like "Damn, she was lookin' right." She had that ass out you know what I'm sayin', I was lookin' at it. So anyway dawg, I invited her back to my condo and shit. You know how we do. (Right, right, right.)

So anyway, I reach for the Magnum dawg -- I put on my helmet G, it's halfway on and she gettin' mad cause' I put the magnum on. She like "Sean Baby, Sean you can't do it like how you used to, Sean?"

Goddamn

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
I know my body took a lot of ink
Lungs smoke a lot of stink
Bladder piss a lot of pink
Because that lean I like to drink
My face got a lot of tats
My grill got a lot of gold
My mouth talk a lot of shit
My dick fuck a lot of hoes
My stomach be filled with shrimp, legs limping like a pimp
Gazelles on my fucking frame, waves all in my temp
My mind it be on the prize, hands on with the nine
My traphouse it keep a line, because I'm selling Duncan Hines
Gucci Mane a millionaire, my house I be seldom there
I always be on the road, bank account got several 0's
My britches be True Religion, in the kitchen cooking chickens
Smoking Swishers, busting Phillies, bought two Raris, spent a milli

[Hook]
This watch right here cost ninety thousand plain jane
But I'mma put some rocks off in it anyway
These haters they gon' hate on you like anyway (anyway)
So I'm gon' put some rims on my shit anyway

One plain jane, one iced-out
Nigga tried me, knocked his lights out
Got goonies but I'm hands-on
Run the check up for my man's 'nem
That's A-1 FBG
Free Boosie, Free B.G. (You know that's anyway)

Last of a dying breed

[Rocko, young dinosaur
Old school, still wear Tretorns
Where that money at? I want me some
With your main bitch and your little sis
Know what time it is nigga, threesome

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Gucci Mane]
I drop the top like, "Fuck it"
I'm not in no lil' Cutlass
I pull up in a "What the...fuck I don't know was it"
I know it cost my budget
I know the bitches love it
I got haters disgusted
I'm smoking on that musty
I'm east Atlanta and I say it loud
Got a black Ferrari because I'm black and proud
I got a yellow one, it's like salt and pepper
When I put 'em together they stand out
I'm a biker, hitchhiker- That's what you are with your thumb out
Got a Spyker with some rims on it, and the back tires they poke out
Got a lighter? Let me borrow that so I can smoke me on this ganja!
Versace shades- Stevie Wonder. Can't see these niggas they under
Your label's a sandcastle: it's about to crumble
Like Barry Sanders don't fumble
It's Gucci Mane knockin numbers (Gucci!)

[Hook]

[Intro]
We choose the right format
We leak the information to the public
And we defend ourselves against inevitable legal and political attacks
Vicki Leekx, leak me

(The world, the-the-the world)
I-I-I-It's the music

[Verse 1: M.I.A.]
M.I.A. state to state
I got people on my case
I got words from my speakers
And my speakers on some crates
I know too much real for me to be fake
You can fuck with this, fuckers, but you can never take

Imitators, stay away!
While I sleep, they try to take
Yeah, they like what I'm eating and they want my piece of cake (x2)
(Ooh, we can load this! Ooh, we can load that!)

[Outro]
The world, the people, you and me, may not do

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]

Ughh
Yeah
Kendrick Lamar
Ha ha haha HA

This feels like, right in front of the freeway
And when I'm done this should be in front of a DJ
I watch whack rappers put their soul on Ebay
Then expect excellence knowing their effortless
I don't have a preference, I dislike all
Say you run the globe? Well more like a disco ball
I spread love as well
Little nigga, big dreams, can bear-hug a whale into a lobster's tail
Ugh
Evacuate premises, rap's sinister suspicious
The pastor stand back, the bible is open, the words have been spoken
The moon and the stars align with the bars
The broads are snapping their bras in broad day
Cops meeting their quota running for arcades
The three initial's on the pistols printed all K's
The end is almost near, inferior of nothing
Superior is an option and my synopsis is that I'm Frank Sinatra
On the roster, top running
Running races with my own shadow
Look in the mirror then I start to battle
Now a pyru is a crip, nor a pyru's just a value that is sure to be heard
Like a fuckin sheep's cattle, niggas got some nerve
Talkin bout they move birds
Only thing I move now is a noun and a verb
I am now on the verge of telling the real story
Of a Compton native in the city "that kill for me"
Cus you fabricated the realness
The county building and the county children on food stamps
Glorifying street cred, talkin' about "whoop whamp"
But that's never the case
Just a good lawyer who can sever the case
Recording live from the city where the skinny niggas die and the semi bullets fly
Drinking Remy out bottle till the pain run dry
Like a desert
Once the Desert Eagle ride by, what you reppin?
What you reppin my nigga, you got a weapon?
Well I got a profession my nigga
It's called hip-hop since Pac was on gridlock
Me against the world every hour, every second my nigga
You want something, get something
I could start a career AND I can end one, I'm H1N1
UGH
Straight-A student who flow stupid
Real raps get permanent income, UGH

[Outro]
Beats and bars
Kendrick Lamar
Maestro whattup?

Ha ha haha

[Verse 1]
Shirts, tops, tees, I'm always in tight jeans
I know Billie Jean, I know Bruce Springsteen
I know Palestine and Mujahideen
Playin' Tekken on the weekend, eating mangosteen

[Verse 2]
'Lean-mean-machine' kinda stream with my team
I'm from England, from Mitcham near Cheam
Have you heard my dream? Even Martin Luther's keen
So I put it down on my track, explain what it means

[Outro]
I'm not talking about getting it for free
I'm talking about making it free-er

[Intto]
Got my shit down super tight
Got my shit down super tight
Got my shit down super tight
Got my shit down super tight

[Hook]
Boy you better be good tonight
Cause I'm out there struttin' my shit tonight
You better be big boy kryptonite

Got my shit down super tight

Boy you better be good tonight
Cause I'm out there struttin' my shit tonight
Got my shit down super tight
Got my shit down super tight

[Bridge]
Step by step, make you lose your mind
Step by step, make you lose your mind
Step by step, make you lose your mind
Step by step, make you lose your mind

[Chorus]
Boy you better be good tonight
Cause I'm out there struttin' my shit tonight
You better be big boy kryptonite
Cause I got my shit down super tight
Packin' them boots and working them nights
Bootleg lover, do you right
Cause I keep it super hype
Cause I keep it super hype
Cause I keep it super hype
Cause I keep it super hype

[Outro]
Vicki Leekx, leak me

[Intro]
Everything Taylor, dumb fuck
I ain't gonna say it again nigga TGOD, huh
It ain't the size of the man, its the size of the motherfuckin plan
You doin?

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
My flow so disgusting, hold on
My flow so disgusting, nigga's talking shit
Topic of discussion, at the boy that's on top
But they wish I wasn't, then they see me ballin in the two times,three feet fallin
Kiss they cousin, ewww

But the real niggas love it, and they keep that hammer
You lil niggas can't touch this
And I'm too legit to quit, Uh
Too much grip to trip, the weed I'm smoking on be like six a zip
The car I'm driving cause me a tick
To whip all these diamonds and be on me being ridiculous
And it's all this grinding got me on the millions list
It's all this time and I be in the trillions
You're on your iphone taking pictures
I'm on the island swimming with the fishes
I'll take your money, you can keep your bitches
Fake friends, I have those
If my niggas up in your vip
Feel that thing with some bad hoes
Some bombay and some champagne
And some ashtrays for them airplanes
I'm throwing up my damn game
Cause it's taylor gang over erythang

[Outro]
Ah, taylor ho, taylor, taylor ho, taylor
Taylor ho, taylor, taylor ho, taylor

To the end I'll be your start

You can bring change so you can move in

If you act like you're too fast
Stop walking through the broken glass
So just try and have a blast
Try to act like you got class
Walk it, walk it to your car
Ride it to the other bar
Work it, work it on that ass
Take it, take it to the house

[Hook: Blaqstarr]
Baby all you gotta do is

[Intro]
And I'mma bang it like this
Mister

[Hook]
With my hands in my pockets
And I'm moving forward forward forward forward
You put a bad taste in my mouth, mister
(Keep outta my way, mister)
With my hands in my pockets
And I'm moving forward forward forward forward
You put a bad taste in my mouth, mister
(Keep outta my way, mister)

[Verse 1]
Who said all the rules are made with rulers
We break 'em and break in the computers
I ain't buying no more from them looters
Who tried to out-school us, so we jump on our scooters
I hope you understood us, when we say
We don't make that money on the violence
That's why we don't do the silence
We don't make that money on the violence
That's why we don't do the silence

[Bridge]
Do you know me, punk?
I do you punk!
Do you know me, punk?
I do you punk!

[Hook]
With my hands in my pockets
And I'm moving forward forward forward forward
You put a bad taste in my mouth, mister
(Keep outta my way, mister)
With my hands in my pockets
And I'm moving forward forward forward forward
You put a bad taste in my mouth, mister
(Keep outta my way, mister)

[Verse 2]
They say I pick big battles with the government
Immigration departments
For the people who live in the tenements
Our voices carry our sentiments
We sprinkle your coffee with the cinnamon
We're made of ladies and gentlemen
From the street to the spidermans
We could take on all your nations

[Verse 1: Domo Genesis]
I could never be a facade, that's just living in disguise
I'm only speaking what I'm envisioning in my eyes
Even Stevie seen the ribbon in the sky
So I'm focused on the prize
The real on the rise, I'm getting high
And these niggas say they fly, but I got a piece of mind
Fuck the lies - I'm still the fucking man behind the pride
I'm just happy I'm alive - crack a bottle to that
Young nigga, big picture with the models to match
Young ladies that we slay and we don't follow them back
And long flights, so excited, I won't bother to nap
Yea I made it huh, yea I guess to the average man
Not a stroke of luck, fuck the game cause I had a plan
Can't be a king if you got a castle made of sand
I take it bit by bit - I'mma make it stand
These niggas never had a chance
Snowball effect, keep it rolling, make it avalanche

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
Don't know why they hating on me
To fall, it's like they waiting on me
They told me that's they way it's gon' be
Everything you see, I did it on my own
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
And homie I ain't ever gon' change
No matter how much money I make
And n'an nigga put me in the game
Everything you see, I did it on my own
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Hold up, know that I'm fly if I'mma show up
Don't gotta roll, the joint already rolled up
The Bombay and Simply already po'ed up
They let us all in simply cause they know us
And count so much Benjies, them shits can't fold up
'Member niggas used to just want a Motorola
Now we order motors from overseas with manuals we can't even read
You claiming you this high, I fly where you can't even see
The wintertime get cold, couple hours I change the degrees
Hater please, leather jacket, gator sleeves
Blowing all of mine, you taking all your time and saving trees
All the realest 'round me down to rep the gang with me
Heard I'm on my grind, it's going down, they taking knees
I'm still blazing weed, going places, making cheese
And tryna keep these critics out my hair
Well not really cause I hear them talk, but really I don't care
All buds inclusive, all my cars exclusive
Runways and high grade pot music

[Hook]

[Chorus]
Hold your head up, there's a light in the sky
I know you're fed up, but you must try to survive
Each moment's precious, don't let life pass you by
Keep focused, keep your eyes on the prize
Hold your head up, there's a light in the sky
I know you're fed up, but you must try to survive
Each moment's precious, don't let life pass you by
Keep focused, keep your eyes on the prize

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
A friend of mine once told me, "We have many paths in this journey"
They act in different directions, so when you question don't be worried
It's not a wrong one, beauty can be found in all of them
You'll meet people whose paths intersect, but you don't know how long you'll walk with them
Cause the truth is, and it's so hard, but you'll never know
How long we'll continue with our loved ones down this rugged road
The path veers and it's clear that we must steer alone
I've learned if you can't hold on to that moment that exists- let it go
Cause freedom is God
Freedom is acknowledging the mask you have on and possessing the strength to take it off
Freedom is accepting every step of the path
And when it's hard having faith in the ability to embrace it, that's where you are
And this is it
The same shit that we work towards, but go against in the same sense
My friend hit me to some game and truth unraveled, she said, "The brighter the light, the darker the shadow"
And since I'm on cliche terms, knowing is half the battle
But I don't know, so I just go with what was destined
Life can be a burden or a blessing
The choice is yours to be connected
It's there if you want it, you got it, now let it

[Chorus]
Hold your head up, there's a light in the sky
I know you're fed up, but you must try to survive
Each moment's precious, don't let life pass you by
Keep focused, keep your eyes on the prize
Hold your head up, there's a light in the sky
I know you're fed up, but you must try to survive
Each moment's precious, don't let life pass you by
Keep focused, keep your eyes on the prize

[Verse 2]
I feel like I have nothing to give right now
This is my trial, tribulations, and it must go down
But where's the up? I'm stuck with the broken smile
No joking now, wanting to grab a swish and smoke this out
The moment of a man choosing what path I will go down
Do I give in, give up, or get up and live right now?
With a split gut pick myself up and spit my style
This is the only thing that can hold my ground
You're born into this world alone, and alone you'll go out
All I have is myself and everyone else I doubt
You can only trust yourself and depend on the help of the pound
Inside of the chest that beats with the breath of the now
No sunshine when she's gone, I can only see clouds
No homies can hold me down, the spirit's testing me now
But I can withstand this world, but it seems so foul
Flood of emotions, it's like I'm being held down to drown
Hell's right around the corner, but I can turn it around
You always have a choice, no matter the situation you're not bound
To nothing, no one, you're chosen for this job
This is your life, you can't escape this bitch when it's hard
Just know that it passes, but you'll collect scars
They never go away, but they will make you who you are
This is a beautiful struggle, I share it in song cause
I can't control this, remember: the moment's beyond us

[Chorus]
Hold your head up, there's a light in the sky
I know you're fed up, but you must try to survive
Each moment's precious, don't let life pass you by
Keep focused, keep your eyes on the prize
Hold your head up, there's a light in the sky
I know you're fed up, but you must try to survive
Each moment's precious, don't let life pass you by
Keep focused, keep your eyes on the prize

[Bridge]
And all my people say whoa, whoa, yeah
And all my people say whoa, whoa
And all my people say whoa, whoa, yeah
And all my people say whoa, whoa
C'mon

[Chorus]
Hold your head up, there's a light in the sky
I know you're fed up, but you must try to survive
Each moment's precious, don't let life pass you by
Keep focused, keep your eyes on the prize
Hold your head up, there's a light in the sky
I know you're fed up, but you must try to survive
Each moment's precious, don't let life pass you by
Keep focused, keep your eyes on the prize

[Verse 1]
Lipstick junkie, debunk the all in one she
Came back wearing a smile
Looking like someone drugged me that wanted to unplug me
No one in here is on trial, it's just a turn-around

[Interlude]
And we go, oh
Well and we go, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 2]
Tic-toc, I want to rock you like the '80s
Cock-blocking isn’t allowed
Tugboat Shiela is into memorabilia
Who said three is a crowd? We better get it on the go

[Chorus 1]
Hey, now
We’ve got to make it rain somehow
She told me to and showed me what to do
Our Maggie makes it in a cloud

[Chorus 2]
I said hey, now
We’ve got to make it rain somehow
She told me to and showed me what to do
She knows how to make it loud

[Verse 3]
Rain dance Maggie advances to the final
Who knew that she had the goods?
Little did I know her body was warm delicious vinyl
To your neck of the woods, I want to lick a little bit

[Chorus 1]
Hey, now
We’ve got to make it rain somehow
She told me to and showed me what to do
Our Maggie makes it in a cloud

[Bridge]
You got the wrong girl
But not for long, girl
It's in the song, girl
'Cause I’ll be gone, girl

[Chorus 1]
Hey, now
We’ve got to make it rain somehow
She told me to and showed me what to do
Our Maggie makes it in a cloud

[Chorus 3]
I said hey, now
I want to rock this rowdy crowd
She told me to and showed me what to do
She knows how to make it loud

[Outro]
But not for long, girl
It's in the song, girl
'Cause I’ll be gone, bye, bye, bye, yeah
Bye bye, bye, girl
Bye bye, girl
Bye bye, girl
Bye bye
(Uh)
Please put away the cameras
Cause we just in the club getting MC hammered
And God forbid we ever trade our wisdom for the glamor
And I know that I'm just a boy that a woman can make a man of
So make me one, I know that you can make me one
I just want a woman that looks 30 when she's 81
Please don't give it all away
I hope that you can save me some
The more they pass they heart around the more jaded that they become
But this one's special
So I make sure that my suit'll fit
The one my daddy wore in June of 85
I'm too legit
I'm just trying to get her in the mood
And have her doing all the things she'd only do when she get married
So let's do this shit
Tell the reverend all we're missing is his blessing
Because before she pop the pussy she need me to pop the question
So we exchange vows
They clap, we take a bow
And she'll be doing tricks for daddy
When we take it to the house

[Intro]
Uh
And all day, haha
Better hide your girl for this one (Crushin', crushin', crushin' round the clock)

We be crushin' round the clock, crushin', crushin' round the clock
We be crushin' round the clock, crushin', crushin' round the clock (Look)

[Verse 1]
She got a little bit of beauty, little bit of class
Little bit of lips and a little bit of ass
Little bit of style, dressed to kill
Little bit of freak with a sex appeal
I'm so down for whatever, baby
Always dressed fresh and wavy
Wanna make love, ah yeah, that's gravy
Late night sex get extra crazy (Extra crazy)
Ain't gonna leave, I'm stayin'
Sick of all the games you playin'
Eye gazin', sex amazin', got you squintin', eyes look Asian
I know I'm just a kid, baby, tell me what this is
'Cause I seen you shake, I seen you moan every time I touch your lips (Aha)
You grab my hand, run your fingers through my hair
Everywhere we go the scent of sex all through the air
Yeah, I know you think I'm playin', right? (Playin' right)
How 'bout you just take a chance, stay the night? (Aha)
You my baby, right? Love it when I call you that
But I follow cash, I'ma have to call you back (Call you back)
Just know that, you be in my mind (My mind)
I say the same thing every single time

[Chorus]
It's all right, It's okay, seein' you all night and all day (Ayy)
We be crushin' round the clock, crushin', crushin' round the clock
We be crushin' round the clock, crushin', crushin' round the clock
It's all right, It's okay, seein' you all night and all day (Ayy)
We be crushin' round the clock, crushin', crushin' round the clock
We be crushin' round the clock, crushin', crushin' round the clock

[Verse 2]
Yeah
I'm amazed, actin' like there ain't no time to waste (Waste)
She a freak, lemme get her right behind the stage (Aha)
My true shorty though (Uh-huh)
I've had all sorts of hoes (Sorts of hoes)
Take my time when I'm with her, drink my forty slow
Any given second, you can find us on the bed (Bed)
Wild sex, with her legs behind her head
Turn her over on her stomach, get it from the back (Back)
She always leave a scratch, but I like that
She the type that (Type that) you wanna wife that (Wife that)
And she like me 'cause all I do is pipe that (Aha)
Buzzin' like a bumblebee that's chillin' by the hive
Love her with no limits, 'cause my ceilin' is the sky
Feelin' up ya thighs, tongue ticklin' ya twine
When I get it from behind, you say it's twistin' up your spine (Aha)
Baby, I'm (I'm) one of a kind that finds that spot that have you climax
I'm that boy

[Chorus]
It's all right, It's okay, seein' you all night and all day (Ayy)

We be crushin' round the clock, crushin', crushin' round the clock
We be crushin' round the clock, crushin', crushin' round the clock
Whoa, Oh
Same ol’ me, but everything around me new
Made it to the roof and still stuck to my roots
Livin’ out the dream
Well, it might be a dream to you
But I do everything I dream, so to me it’s déjà vu
See everybody wanna go to big deal from no deal
To make it to the top you still gotta go uphill
Rollin' up J's, to rollin' up here with J
Crazy how my life just went from surreal to so real
Back when rapping, school was a main contemplation
‘Ye took me to the Grammy’s, we had that conversation
Say, “You don’t make it this far doing no kind of waiting”
And a few years later it’ll lead me to my nomination
And that, that, that's worth more than a diploma
Sometimes being your own boss is worth more than promotions
Chillin’ in a spot niggas kill to get inside
Spilt so much liquor on the ground, you’da thought my niggas died
But we inside!
Hello, it's the fly guy
Money to the sky guy
I could let the 9 color you like some tie-dye
Bars like my wifi
Cars like a drive-by
Even when you tweetin still ain't even on my timeline

I'm gettin lost in the money still like find time
For the brain like I'm Einstein

Funny that them same hoes is always at my crib to talk
If you came here just to talk

And take my head and lose my mind

See I make you feel the blinds like you don't lose your blinds
Baby give me brain and let my dick porous your mind
Get money like social banking

Yo chick is on my pipe

Wow, bitch I bling like wow

I let your bitch suck on my dick until her throat famous
Yo man is so nameless
And me, I'm so famous
She gettin no money from you
Fuck what your whole game is
Bad bitches only
Cause I ain't on my dick
Give me brain, shawty
Put your mind on my stick
I got thugs with me, that'll grind for the brick
Time is money, I ain't spending time on your chick
Ill, still like pitched to a mil
I'm pulling hoes like fish to a reel
My watchs swimming like my wrist full of (?)
Cold dick, leave a bitch full of chills
For real

Yup, my bitch sweet like some (?)

Hundred, shows I'm selling dope

Hook it up, I cook it up

Beamer truck, I rim it up
Spent 80 thou', 400 stones
She suck a dick while rollin' blunt

Me and her both can't get enough
We in the goat, I'm in the ghost
I'm tryna beat that pussy up

[Intro]
Yeah, oh no, I'm ready
Yeah, let's go
Your girlfriend at my next show, OVOXO nigga
Haha, yeah

[Verse]
Uh, wassup?
Real nigga doing real stuff
Get alot of money you could never get enough
And you know the new shit sound so tough
So and so just walked in... so what?
I don't really vibe with alot of these niggas
I ain't really into giving more than one chance girl
I already tried with alot of these niggas, fuck that
That team don't know real, what's that? That can't be from here
That can't be what they believing is the best shit of the year
That's that fake shit, that's that fake shit
That's that top row of veneers
Just when they getting impatient is when I make a world premiere
Uh, damn, word?
Award shows coming? Make sure you spell that shit right
Make sure to give me all the credit I deserve
Make sure the good stuff still in that Sprite
They watch us make the shit into the song
You ain't livin' that boy, stop stealin' that life
Anything can happen when I do see ya
Guess it all depend how I feel on that night
Live my life in hotels, bitch better have my room right
If they kill me, bury me a legend, bitch better have my tomb right
Ah, this is perfect for the women that I loved before
I love em all, I just love me more

[Intro: Tyga]
We all dream one day we kings and queens
We all dream one day we kings and queens
My nigga made it, we just young, living the dream
My nigga made it, we just young, living the dream

[Verse 1: Tyga]
Uh, chandelier ceiling, my couch, don’t sit with denim
My marble floors are killing, gold cars are so relentless
Five girls in the kitchen, they cooking something like chemists
Monumental shit is, statues like Egyptians
God cover my soul, need it, can’t let it go
I know you get lonely when I ain’t home, on the road
I know I ain’t perfect, I’m out here working for the throne
I would take you along but then that college loan you’ll owe
Young girls in cheap dresses, tryna impress us
Saying they all different but I don’t show them no effort
Underestimated that R8 then I tested
Had to make investments, honey colored dressed it
I’m blessed-ed, cross-sign baptism, West shit
Shit on anybody with opinions, you dead wrong
Go against a bull nigga head on
I'm too strong, eight arms, ticking to a bomb
Army stance, ready for war
We used a Andy Warhol to paint the decor
Apologizing for my actions, sometimes I get bored
They say my music knocks so I hope it open every door

[Chorus: Tyga]
We all dream one day we kings and queens
We all dream one day we be kings and queens
My nigga made it, we just young, living the dream
My nigga made it, we just young, living the dream
We all dream one day we kings and queens
We all dream one day we be kings and queens
My nigga made it, we just young, living the dream
My nigga made it, we just young, young...

[Verse 2: Wale]
Uhh, never take this shit to heart, I take indo to chest
And now a nigga chasing dreams without losing his breath
Though my credits are slept, my ambition the best
Though I do this to be heard, I'ma do it to death
We ain't cool with all of these niggas, I'm through with all of these niggas
You fool with all of these niggas, you lose like all of these (niggas)
Honest, sincere, they seersuckers, lying in suits
Anybody riding with young'un will probably recoup
Heavenly Father, Martin, Malcolm mixed with them lyrics
Finna be king but I’m way too proud to offer as minion
I just offer a guillotine to my vehicle, nigga
And don’t offer least of shit to these people’s opinions
I’m a king to these niggas, love a queen, fuck the bitches
Double MG, YMCMB cause we run this, you dig?
We all kings, give anything to my soft queens
I’m lost without them, when they around, I am Charles Sheen
Ralph...

[Chorus: Tyga]
We all dream one day we kings and queens
We all dream one day we be kings and queens
My nigga made it, we just young, living the dream
My nigga made it, we just young, living the dream
We all dream one day we kings and queens
We all dream one day we be kings and queens
My nigga made it, we just young, living the dream
My nigga made it, we just young, living the dream

[Verse 3: Nas]
Uhh.. yeah, yeah
You're in the presence of a majestic, esoteric
Message from the most ghettoest king, worldwide respected
I can say ghettoest cause I come from where metal spit
Praying to God I can slide and slip out the Devil’s grip
Won't pop another pill, can't drink another sip
Tryna slow down with this pussy, I can't, I love this shit
I seem to love these whips
A white Maserati's my birthright car, pass it, I need another hit
At night, where they murdered Herbie Drawz
That's the same block Metta World Peace learned to play ball
See I'm born alone, die alone, from the hoods to the private home
College to prison, understand it, knowledge and wisdom
Shout out to baby mothers of niggas who gang bang
Cause he could die any day and you still the same thing
So that make you a queen, surviving anything
Escobar season begins so let the semis ring
Pimp of the year, I could smack your father
Not only with my hand but with a black revolver
I been in pressed silk since breast milk
Mets cap on tilt, we some kings, nigga

[Intro]

[Verse 1: Roger Waters]
Hello? (Hello, hello, hello)
Is there anybody in there?
Just nod if you can hear me
Is there anyone home?
Come on (Come on, come on), now
I hear you're feeling down
Well, I can ease your pain
And get you on your feet again
Relax (Relax, relax, relax)
I'll need some information first
Just the basic facts
Can you show me where it hurts?

[Pre-Chorus 1: David Gilmour]
There is no pain, you are receding
A distant ship, smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move, but I can't hear what you're saying
When I was a child, I had a fever
My hands felt just like two balloons
Now I've got that feeling once again
I can't explain, you would not understand
This is not how I am

[Chorus: David Gilmour]
I have become comfortably numb

[Guitar Solo 1]

[Chorus: David Gilmour]
I have become comfortably numb

[Verse 2: Roger Waters]
Okay (Okay, okay, okay)
Just a little pinprick
There'll be no more
But you may feel a little sick
Can you stand up? (Stand up, stand up)
I do believe it's working, good
That'll keep you going through the show
Come on, it's time to go

[Pre-Chorus 2: David Gilmour]
There is no pain, you are receding
A distant ship, smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move, but I can't hear what you're saying
When I was a child, I caught a fleeting glimpse
Out of the corner of my eye
I turned to look, but it was gone
I cannot put my finger on it now
The child is grown, the dream is gone

[Chorus: David Gilmour]
I have become comfortably numb

[Guitar Solo 2]

[Intro]
Oh, yeah

I'm Miss American Dream, since I was 17
Don't matter if I step on the scene, or sneak away to the Philippines
They're still gon' put pictures of my derriere in the magazines
You want a piece of me? (You want a piece of me?)

Hoping I'll resort to some havoc, end up settling in court
Now, are you sure you want a piece of me?
(You want a piece of me?)
I'm Mrs. 'Most Likely to Get on the TV For Strippin' on the Streets When Gettin' the Groceries'
Now, for real, are you kiddin' me?
No wonder there's panic in the industry, I mean, please
Do you want a piece of me?

[Intro: Lil Wayne]
Yeah
What's up, baby?
I ain't tryna do nothing but get my grown man on
I ain't tryna hurt you
Only if you want me to
Haha
Yeah, something like that

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Yeah, what's happenin', baby? I'm Lil Wayne from New Orleans
Fresh out the navy, now the captain of my own team
Hop in this machine, vanish from the scene
Goddamnit, I'm so mannish, handle it like a standard
So put your panties and your pants by the trash can
Romance on the floor plans, yeah
We hold hands while we rollin'
Just tryna keep up with the program
Just tryna sneak up on ya like, "How you doin', ma'am?"
I'm a old soul and a young man, we got to it and
We didn't stop 'til the birds hit the block
And she ain't never had it like that, haha

[Chorus: Lil Wayne & Curren$y]
Girl, you are so fine
I wish that I could get you over here, girl
Tonight, so I
Could get my grown man on with you
You don't know about it, I'm on my grown man
You don't know about it, I'm on my grown man
You don't know about it, I'm on my grown man
You don't know about it, I'm on my grown man

[Verse 2: Curren$y]
Now I don't really hit the club, but tonight I'll make an exception
For some reason, I can't seem to keep my eyes out your direction
I'm lookin' at you so hard, I could probably catch a charge
Feelin' the way you walk, when you move, your booty applauds
Damn, I gotta keep my composure
Gotta attack my mission, handle business like a soldier
Young man, Young Money, but the money long
Curren$y the Hot Spitta so grown (So grown)
And your perception of me is so wrong
Don't worry 'bout what you heard 'bout me and them other birds
Might have done a little dirt and left a few of 'em hurt
But whatever has occurred, they all got what they deserved, huh
And you don't rock like them, I can see it in your eyes
If you ain't good for me, then you wearin' a disguise
'Cause tonight, you lookin' like Miss Right
And I swore to be a player for life, but I'll change for you

[Chorus: Lil Wayne & Curren$y]
Girl, you are so fine
I wish that I could get you over here, girl
Tonight, so I
Could get my grown man on with you
You don't know about it, I'm on my grown man
You don't know about it, I'm on my grown man
You don't know about it, I'm on my grown man
You don't know about it, I'm on my grown man

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Yeah, you ain't a woman, you a baby girl living in a ladies' world
And I'm a grown man, the women understand
See, what I go through is what I owe you
So you should throw that ass back to me right now, yeah
Fly boy, baby, sit back, relax, and
Cruise with a nigga, destination satisfaction
Now whose is it, baby? She say, "Weezy Fuckin' Baby"
I say, "Yes in-fuckin'-deed," she say, "Don't you ever leave"
I say, I say, "But I got money on my mind"
Then I tell her never mind and we do it one more time, yeah
For a large amount of time
Long and won't stop 'til daytime come home, yeah

[Chorus: Lil Wayne & Curren$y]
Girl, you are so fine
I wish that I could get you over here, girl
Tonight, so I
Could get my grown man on with you
You don't know about it, I'm on my grown man
You don't know about it, I'm on my grown man
You don't know about it, I'm on my grown man
You don't know about it, I'm on my grown man

[Bridge: Lil Wayne]
Damn, look, haha
That, oh, that right there?
That's the sunset, girl
Get your visor
Where's those Chanel shades I get you?
You always losin' things
And I'm always buyin' new things, haha
I come a long way, huh? Remember, remember that block?
Look at you, you think you all grown, haha

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
You ain't a woman, you a baby girl living in a ladies' world
And I'm a grown man, the women understand
See, what I go through is what I owe you
And you should throw that ass back to me right now

[Hook]
It's boring
There's no comp; wake me up, I'm snoring
Six rings on, you can call me Robert Horry
Still busting bricks down, Zone Six quarry
Whipping up a brick, yeah I'm working with the fork-y
Iced-out dog, same size as a Yorkie
Whipping up a brick, yeah I'm working with the fork-y
Iced-out dog, same size as a Yorkie

[Verse 1]
Coke game breezy, but the rap game easy
If I'm not trapping, God stop my breathing
Somebody girl getting fucked this evening
Six rings on and my iced-out brights on
Grill look right today, chest look right today
Air 15's so we're not fighting it
Brand new Porsche-y, working my fork-y
White and black chain, same color your Jordans
So Icey boys, we get high like Martians
Probably can't pull 'em, but I bet my car can
Tall, rich black man
Nineteen stacks, man
Add two tax, man
Twenty one racks, man

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I hopped out the truck, rolled up cause I'm iced-out
Money blewed up, save scratch like a tour bus
Hoes adore us, they show for us
We sho' nuff tough
I'm so kushed up
I'm so iced up, damn I'm freezing
Red diamonds on me, so my chest just bleeding
Tats everywhere, baby boo -- I'm sleeving
With one gat, one shot, one reason
Gucci change cars every time it change seasons
I think I'm getting the bird flu, damn I'm sneezing
Ha-choo, Gesundheit, I'm cheesing
My jewelry real pretty like my little niece is

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Iced-out hard, man, red diamonds gorgeous
The bezel on my watch got me thinking I'm important
Shorty hating on us cause he know he can't afford it
Rings and chains and Zaytoven recording
'74 restored, rolling down Moreland
Headed up Custer, I'm finna pick juice up
Yeah, you heard the old shit; this the new shit
Still in the Libra doing the same old two-step
Gucci frames, Gucci belt, rappers need Gucci help
Hopping out my gut, looking oh so debonair
Ten stacks, twenty stacks, sell em by the twenty pack
Gucci took the rap game from me, he won't give it back
It's Gucci!

[Hook]

[Verse 1]
I used to think that we’d run away
One lovely pretty summer day
I remember when you would say
We'd be okay, come what may
I never knew you would lie to me
Took everything from inside of me
Your silhouette in the doorway
But before you walk away

[Chorus]
Don't say goodbye, look in my eyes
So that I always will remember
Frozen in time, always be mine
Baby boy, you’ll be young forever
I’ll be over here, you’ll be over there
I’ma shed a tear, but I really don’t care
Frozen in time, always be mine
Baby boy, you’ll be young forever

[Verse 2]
I used to think that we’d reunite
I’d be your wife in the real life
I thought that you’d come back for me
And you would take me away
I never knew only as a teen
You’d reappear only in my dream
Your silhouette in the doorway
But before you walk away

[Chorus]
Don't say goodbye, look in my eyes
So that I always will remember
Frozen in time, always be mine
Baby boy, you’ll be young forever
I’ll be over here, you’ll be over there
I’ma shed a tear, but I really don’t care
Frozen in time, always be mine
Baby boy, you’ll be young forever

[Bridge]
This is my last cry
Is this the only way?
This is my own prison
I’m frozen in time, in time, in time

[Chorus]
Don't say goodbye, look in my eyes
So that I always will remember
Frozen in time, always be mine
Baby boy, you’ll be young forever
I’ll be over here, you’ll be over there
I’ma shed a tear, but I really don’t care
Frozen in time, always be mine
Baby boy, you’ll be young forever

[Outro]
You’ll always be mine (Yeah, baby)
Frozen in time
Young forever (Young forever)

If you leave I'll be right there
Waitin', I'm impatient

[Verse 1]
I've been walking in the same way as I did
Missing out the cracks in the pavement
And tutting my heel and strutting my feet
"Is there anything I can do for you dear?"
"Is there anyone I could call?"
"No and thank you, please madame
I ain't lost, just wandering"

[Chorus]
'Round my hometown
Memories are fresh
'Round my hometown
Ooh, the people I've met
Are the wonders of my world
Are the wonders of my world
Are the wonders of this world
Are the wonders now

[Verse 2]
I like it in the city
When the air is so thick and opaque
I love it to see everybody in short skirts, shorts and shades
I like it in the city when two worlds collide
You get the people and the government
Everybody taking different sides

[Refrain]
Shows that we ain't gonna stand shit
Shows that we are united
Shows that we ain't gonna take it
Shows that we ain't gonna stand shit
Shows that we are united

[Chorus]
'Round my hometown
Memories are fresh
'Round my hometown
Ooh, the people I've met, yeah

[Outro]
Doo-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-dah, yeah
Doo-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-dah, yeah
Doo-doo-doo-doo ooh-ooh yeah
Yeah, yeah-ey
Are the wonders of my world
Are the wonders of my world
Are the wonders of this world
Are the wonders of my world
Of my world
Yeah, of my world
Of my world, yeah

[Chorus]
Take your medication, Roman
Take a short vacation, Roman, you'll be okay
You need to know your station, Roman
Some alterations on your clothes and your brain
Take a little break, little break from your silencing
There's so much you can take, you can take
I know how bad you need a Roman holiday
Roman holiday, a Roman holiday

[Verse 1]
You done, you tight? You suck at life?
You don't want a round three? You done suffered twice
Worship the queen and you might could pass
Keep it real, these bitches couldn't wipe my ass
Anyway, stylist, go get Bvlgari

You, you bitches can't even spell that
You, you hoes bugging, repel that

'Cause my flow's so sick, and I'm a lunatic
And this can't be cured with no Elixir
'Cause y'all know who the fuck, what the fuck I do
I done put the pressure to every thug I knew
Quack, quack to a duck and a chicken too
Put the hyena in a freakin' zoo

[Chorus]
Take your medication, Roman
Take a short vacation, Roman, you'll be okay
You need to know your station, Roman
Some alterations on your clothes and your brain

And this right here is gonna make a bitch cry
And if we being honest, I am such a great guy
And this what I do when a bitch breaks flock

[stuttering]
I'mma put her in a dungeon under, under
No them bitches ain't eating, they dying of hunger
Motherfucker, I me, who the fuck is this hoe?
And yes, maybe just a touch of Tourette's
Get my wigs, Terrence, go and get my beret

[Chorus]
Take your medication, Roman
Take a short vacation, Roman, you'll be okay

Some alterations on your clothes and your brain
Take a little break, little break from your silencing
There's so much you can take, you can take

Roman holiday, a Roman holiday

[Bridge]
Come all ye faithful

[Verse 3]

They want the outline, I give them a goatee
Goddamn, motherfucker, you talking about me?

That bitch must be smokin' a couple of OZ's
A-buh-buh-buh now give then a goatee

[Chorus]

Bad bitches, like me, is hard to come by

[Chorus]
Starships, were meant to fly
Hands up, and touch the sky
Can't stop 'cause we're so high
Let's do this one more time
Starships, were meant to fly
Hands up, and touch the sky
Let's do this one last time
Can't stop...

[Post-Chorus]
We're higher than a motherfucka
We're higher than a motherfucka
We're higher than a motherfucka

[Verse 2]
Jump in my hoopty-hoopty-hoop

And I ain't payin' my rent this month
I owe that
But fuck who you want, and fuck who you like
Dancehall life, there's no end in sight
Twinkle, twinkle little star
Now everybody let me hear you say ray, ray, ray
Now spend all your money, 'cause today payday
And if you a G, you a G-G-G
My name is Onika, you can call me Nicki

[Pre-Chorus]
Get on the floor, floor
Like it's your last chance
If you want more, more
Then here I am

[Chorus]
Starships, were meant to fly
Hands up, and touch the sky
Can't stop 'cause we're so high
Let's do this one more time
Starships, were meant to fly
Hands up, and touch the sky
Let's do this one last time
Can't stop...

[Post-Chorus]
We're higher than a motherfucka
We're higher than a motherfucka
We're higher than a motherfucka

[Chorus]
Starships, were meant to fly

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Yeah, the early bird get the worm first
Sixteen, we was out there on that curb first
With a quarter trying to see who get a bird first
Like fuck a undercover cop who getting served first
Yeah we was dead wrong but we had to learn first
We ain't give a fuck whoever fronted us got burnt first (Yeah)
We like we gone get this paper
My shooters was trying to kill, I'm like we gone get 'em later
Trying to turn a dollar bill into a pretty situation
Just thinking bout them benjis got a nigga in the matrix
Waiting, losing patience my mind racing
Plus my seed growing so you know I need dough and...

Staying on my grind and stack it straight up

Yo, I used to smoke my lil L
Thinking bout my master plan
Trying to get a million fucking dollars out of half a man
Cause being broke got a nigga feeling like a half a man
We gone get this money though
We just in a traffic jam
And I want to live the fast life
Fast cars, fast bitches, fast money, fast bike
I was in the dark, shit that money was like a flashlight
Cause I started shining same day I got my stash right (uh)
This money ain't a joke
Homies looking like snakes
They was cool when I was broke
But now I'm gettin money
They looking at me funny
That's why I keep my heater
Cause I never been a sleeper

[Chorus: All Star]
When I wake up, first thing on my mind is get this cake up
Staying on my grind and stack it straight up

[Verse 3: Meek Mill]
Look, I'm a get rich or die tryin'
If gettin money was sinnin', fuck it I'm fryin'
If I'm lying I'm flyin',I'm bucking my iron
If a nigga try to take, I'll knock somethin out his face
I go in and out of state, up and down 95
Just to get it for my niggas put my life on the line
They want what I got, they'll never get it from me (never)
But we gone get this money

[Chorus: All Star]

[Intro]
I wanna hit line drives…
Wanna lose weight and keep eating…
For you…
Hey, whats up doc?

[Bridge: Kendrick Lamar & Anna Wise]
Now I was raised in a sandbox, next to you and her
You was holding the handgun, she was giving birth
To a baby boy to be just like you, I-I wonder what's that worth
I-I wonder if you ever knew that you was a role model to me first
The next day I-I woke up in the morning, seen you on the news
Looked in the mirror, then realized that I-I-I had something to prove
You told me, "Don't be like me, just finish watching cartoons"
Which is funny now cause all I see is Wile E. Coyotes in the room

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar & Gunplay]
And I run it (Blow! Blow! Blow! Blow!)
And I run it (Blow! Blow! Blow! Blow!)
And I run it (Yeah! Blow!)
And I run it (Yeah! Blow!)
That's ironic (Blow! Blow! Blow! Blow!)
Ironic (Blow! Blow! Blow! Blow!)
That's ironic (Y-Yeah!  Blow!)
Ironic (Yeah! Blow! Yeah!)
Salt all in my wounds
Hear my tears all in my tunes
Let my life loose in this booth
Just for you, mothafucka, hope y'all amused
And I run it (Blow! Blow! Blow! Blow!)
And I run it (Blow! Blow! Blow! Blow!)
And I run it (Y-Yeah! Blow!)
And I run it (Yeah! Blow!)
That's ironic

[Interlude]
Liberation… Leader…
Popular pie plant pictured here…
Wile E. Coyote! Wile E. Coyote!

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
This shit make a nigga just wanna write
Reminisce when I had the morning appetite
Apple Jacks and after that I hit the TV Guide
Animaniac the only thing that gave me peace of mind
I’m a maniac when aiming at the enemy that lied
Tell a story that I'll never grow to 25
Not to worry, every warrior will come and see euphoria
And that's a covenant I put on every tribe
Ain't nobody gon' tie your shoe
Nobody gon' abide by your rule
Nobody holding your gun
How come your tongue say, "killa" then kill my mood
Light speed living in the world you know
Little old me, feeling like a live wire
Bet I put some new tires on a lightning bolt
'Til I wreck into a pole, like a right to vote
I'm from the bottom of the jungle
Living in the bottom of the food chain
When you get a new chain, nigga take it from you
A new name, want stripes, and you a zebra look-alike
Hope another homicide don't numb you a nun do
Things we will never learn soon
In the era where we wanna earn soon
That's a error, you can smell it in the air
And everybody really doomed
That's why I'm backdooring you motherfuckas
All y'all can suck my dick
All them days at the county building
I'm 'bout to make my mama rich
Cartoons and (Cereal!) I ain't felt this (Good since!)
Scrooge McDuck (Here we go!), elementary hood shit

[Bridge: Kendrick Lamar]
Now I was raised in a sandbox, next to you and her
You was holding the handgun, she was giving birth
To a baby boy to be just like you, I wonder what's that worth

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
This shit make a nigga just wanna shit on everybody
Even with a pot to piss in
I'ma aim sloppy at a loud mouth, discharge
Dismiss any business of yours
Discounts never did amount to a check
That ya ass couldn't cash when the shit bounce
Everything dismounts, niggas gon' flip that car
AKs for the whole hood
House lick went down perfect
Two shots to the head he deserved it
I overheard it hit my bed with a bowl and remote control
Dark Wing Duck lost service
Mama said I'd better duck, she's nervous
Drama all up in the cut, hit the curtains
I mean don't intervene with no gun machine
This block stay jerking, the feds stay lurkin'
Emerging on everbody corner (Dash for it)
Get a toe tag when you play tag
With a task of a new (Task force)
Everybody wanna know my life
How did I make it (Past yours)
Well let me tell you like this
I've been running this shit since I (Asked for)
Cartoons and cereal

[Bridge: Kendrick Lamar]
Now I was raised in a sandbox, next to you and her
You was holding the handgun, she was giving birth
To a baby boy to be just like you, I wonder what's that worth
I-I wonder if you ever knew that you was a role model to me first

[Verse 3: Gunplay]
Salt all in my wounds
Hear my tears all in my tunes
Let my life loose in this booth, just for you
Muhfucka, hope y'all amused!
I did wrong, karma came
Crackers gave me ball and chain
Friends, enemies all the same
State, fed, both can hang
Nobody can't mute me
But I never said nobody can't shoot me
Just another stat to the white folks
Still whip work to the white yolk, absolutely!
Everyday feel like the one before
Hunt the money, don't hunt the ho
If you do what you always done
Then you get what you always got
You dumb buffoons!
I ain't seen the back of my eyelids
For about the past 72 hours
Hand on my heart, face to the hood
I pledge every word you ever heard was honest
Yeah, this me, no mic
No cameras, no lights, just pain
Mama, how much trauma can I sustain?
Dirty money come with lots of stains
Road to riches come with lots of lanes
Just another player with lots of game
Never had shit, got lots to gain…

[Outro: Gunplay]
Just another player with lots of game
Never had shit, got lots to gain
(To be continued)

[Intro: Nicki Minaj (Sean Kingston)]
Ah!
Well this ah di big bod Nicki Minaj (Kingston!)
And dem should know! (JR! We back.)

[Verse 1: Sean Kingston]
I was just a player in the game of love
'Til she came and turned mi tables around
Stacking up mi chips lining up all mi cars
Still they all came tumbling down

[Pre-Hook]
Man I think I might, think I might make her the one
Take them stealin' me up on the run
She hits me like a shot gun, I’m done
If love is the beat she’s the stead of my drum
Fly me away, the kingdom come
She got me going, daram-dam-daram-dam

[Hook]
Hey-o, hey-o, I was born to be wild
Oh no, oh no, 'til love shot me down
I’d rather die a thousand times, than live without your love
I'm sayin, hey-o, hey-o, I was born to be wild
Oh no, oh no 'til you came around
I’d rather die a thousand times, than live without your love
Hey-o, hey-o, I was born to be wild
Oooohh I’m blown away, uh whoa, I’m blown away 

[x2]

[Verse 2]
Love was just a word 'til I bought me a ballah
Oh you everything for holding me down
I'm tellin all my homies that mi find mi a queen
In the jungle so you facing the crowd

[Pre-Hook]
Man I think I might, think I might make her the one
Take them stealin' me up on the run
She hits me like a shot gun, I’m done
If love is the beat she’s the stead of my drum
Fly me away, the kingdom come
She got me going, daram-dam-daram-dam

[Hook]
Hey-o, hey-o, I was born to be wild
Oh no, oh no, 'til love shot me down
I’d rather die a thousand times, than live without your love
I'm sayin, hey-o, hey-o, I was born to be wild
Oh no, oh no 'til you came around
I’d rather die a thousand times, than live without your love
Hey-o, hey-o, I was born to be wild

[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj]
If you would die, then why would you try
And if you reply, a suit and a tie
Is what I would buy, then you will be mine
Because you and I, we're born to be wild
I am Martha; you King Arthur, who knew you would land me?
I've been known to eat these rappers, cook 'em like chef Ramsey
Mission accomplished, you're my accomplice
Cover of Vogue, yeah, I'mma go topless
I'mma go bonkers I'mma go crazy
I'mma get reckless and have a baby
Then hang the baby off of the balcony
Teachin him to moon walk, tell him he's Japanese

[Hook: Sean Kingston]
Hey-o, hey-o, I was born to be wild
Oh no, oh no, 'til love shot me down
I’d rather die a thousand times, than live without your love
I'm sayin, hey-o, hey-o, I was born to be wild
Oh no, oh no 'til you came around
I’d rather die a thousand times, than live without your love
Hey-o, hey-o, I was born to be wild

[Verse 1]
Right under my feet is air made of bricks
That pulls me down and turns me weak for you
I find myself repeating like a broken tune
And I'm forever excusing your intentions
Then, I give in to my pretendings
Which forgive you each time
Without me knowing
They melt my heart to stone

[Chorus 1]
And I hear your words that I made up
You say my name like there could be an us
I best tidy up my head, I'm the only one in love
I'm the only one in love

[Verse 2]
Each and every time I turn around to leave
I feel my heart begin to burst and bleed
So, desperately, I try to link it with my head
But instead, I fall back to my knees
As you tear your way right through me
I forgive you once again
Without me knowing
You've burnt my heart to stone

[Chorus 1]
And I hear your words that I made up
You say my name like there could be an us
I best tidy up my head, I'm the only one in love
I'm the only one in love

[Bridge]
Why do you steal my hand
Whenever I'm standing my own ground?
You build me up and leave me there

[Chorus 2]
Well, I hear your words you made up
I say your name like there should be an us
I best tidy up my head, I'm the only one
In love, I'm the only one in love

[Chorus 1: Kendrick Lamar]
The homies say I'm the truest
The bitches think I'm the cutest
The definition what cool is
Boy, I thought you knew this
Bitch, I do this

[Verse 1: Y-O]
Now I prefer women with some sexy toes
With no corns but enjoys eating vegetables
Seem like everybody love the role of assholes
But I'm feeling better being crowned with some bad hoes
Mr. Michael of Amish yo speaking
Fedora on the top, the black Abraham Lincoln
I hear they fell in love with my penis
Only concerned with my balls like Venus

[Verse 2: Thurz]
Huh, they say I'm rolling like a big shot
Kama Sutra missionary, fuck shit up on top
Say, I'm big time, Flavor Flav on a wristwatch
And all these chickens want that rooster, call it Big Cock
Co-co-co-cock that, aim and shoot that sure shot
U-N-I, T.D.E. be doing it so go head and hop
On that bandwagon of my genitals, not new to me
I’m still serving, broads on my TIP for gratuities

[Chorus 2: Kendrick Lamar]
The homies say I'm the truest
The bitches think I'm the cutest
The definition what cool is
Boy, I thought you knew this
Bitch, I do this
Bitch, I do this
Bitch, I do this
The definition what cool is
Boy, I thought you knew this
Bitch, I do this

[Verse 3: Skeme]
Oh Lord, here he come, there they go again
Kendrick got my cover fire, bitch I'm going in
Burn a swisher up, then I roll again
Ee-Jay and Weezy, just make sure that dough keep rolling in, hah!
Got the world going crazy
Big chrome .380 if a nigga try and play me
Nigga's swag wavy, chauffeur got me car-pooling
So when it come to stunting, bitch I do it

[Verse 4: Brown]
Never been like you or wanted to be, I do me
She found out that I'm in a group, now she's a groupie
Don't need a watch that's full of diamonds to know that it's perfect timing
We be shining blue and brown and got that golden Gucci
Yeah, keep it simple stupid, all I see is trendy all around me
T.D.E. the movement, we Sore Losers out of Dallas County
Country accent, city fashion, lights are flashing on the cameras
Hoes are choosing, niggas' hating, we ain’t tripping, keep our balance

[Chorus 2: Kendrick Lamar]
The homies say I'm the truest
The bitches think I'm the cutest
The definition what cool is
Boy, I thought you knew this

[Verse 5: Kendrick Lamar]
These hoes want to love me, man
So I'm like, what up? Uh what up?
Uh, bitch I do this remix stupid, fire burning, people looting
That's the chaos, comes from K. Dot swinging swords and hanging nooses
Chucking deuces, then drop one, dropping music and I won
Call me hot or call me Pac, every eye on me and it's obviously
I'm close as next to kingdom come, I just run my city dude
You just make your city run, they hate to be next to you
Tables turn, say you earn rights to be the God MC
I'm 'bout to make that halo burn, now goddamn that's some irony
I am the messiah of society
Beside a Halle Berry, feed me berries in Paris, oui-oui
I carry on a great endeavor, ambition leave all men grief
Like beliefs of Mason Betha, reporting from C-P-T motherfucker

[Outro: Kendrick Lamar]
Bitch, I do this
Bitch, I do this
The definition what cool is
Boy, I thought you knew this
Bitch, I do this
Yo, why these bitches in the game gettin' serious for?
I was just playin' when I said you looked liked Curious George
I mean, I was in the SL, ice on the bezel
I ain't mad at you lil' mama, you a sketel
I'm a winner, you that thing that start with a "S.L."
Rhyme with a cruiser, end with a r-ra
Yup, you're a loser, I am a super star-ah
F.A.B.O., I do it, like Toccara
Cause ya'll some dylon hoes
Tryna fuck up my band, I fuck with Nylon holes
I got the pumps and the bumps,the pumps in the trunk
In case I gotta spazz, and blast you mudda cunt
I had to laugh at that one
Bitch get outta line, I'mma slap the fat one
I'm such a maniac
Where Wayne at? I'm tryna get some, brainiac
I gets down, like when niggas is shootin'
Mami, I style wild, like when niggas is lootin'
Hoes is mad, cause these hoes is losin'
They do a lot of walkin', I do alot of cruisin'
Put the top in the back of trunk
Take off a shoe, slap a bitch with the back of the pump
I ain't never had a problem giving bitches the business
Pop bitches in the eye, like I finished my spinach
I'm a New York broad, spend chips in the village
Hopped out the yellow cab, oops, the yellow Jaguar
Girls don't like me, guess it's the swagger
Don't talk to me 'bout, chicks got skills
She's alright, but she's not real
Listen big homie, I'm that deal
I say I body bitches, mean that bitch got killed
Riding the baseline, like I'm 'Quil O'Neal

[Hook] (x2)
Now how many bitches do it take to knock me down
You know bitches gon' hate
But I don't give a fuck who you bodied on tape
I'm into movin' weight mami in and out of state
Let's get it now

[Chorus]
Going nowhere fast
We've reached the climax
We're together, now we're undone
Won't commit, so we choose to run away
Do we separate?
Oh, don't wanna give in, so we both gave up
Can't take it back, it's too late, we've reached the climax
Climax

[Verse 1]
I've fallen somehow
Feet off the ground
Love is the cloud
That keeps raining down
Where are you now
When I need you around?
I'm on my knees
But it seems we're

[Chorus]
Going nowhere fast
We've reached the climax
We're together, now we're undone
Won't commit, so we choose to run away
Do we separate?
Oh, don't wanna give in, so we both gave up
Can't take it back, it's too late, we've reached the climax
Climax

[Verse 2]
I gave my best, it wasn't enough
You get upset, we argue too much
We made a mess of what used to be love
So why do I care, I care at all
At all
At all, at all

[Chorus]
Going nowhere fast
We've reached the climax
We're together, now we're undone
Won't commit, so we choose to run away
Do we separate?
Oh, don't wanna give in, so we both gave up
Can't take it back, it's too late, we've reached the climax
Climax

[Bridge]
You say it's better if we
Love each other separately
I just need you one more time
I can't get what we had out my mind
Where are you now
When I need you around?
I'm on my knees
But it seems we're going

[Chorus]
Nowhere fast
We've reached the climax
We're together, now we're undone
Won't commit, so we choose to run away
Do we separate?
Oh, don't wanna give in, so we both gave up
Can't take it back, it's too late, we've reached the climax
Climax
I am swimmin' in money
And pullin' yo' chick and I dip it in honey
I'm baggin' them bitches
You niggas is bummy
I know what it is, holdin' it in
Niggas wan' play like "Oh what it is"
Talkin' like "That nigga know what it is"
But when 44 come, that shit don't come
That nigga gon' run
BANG
Get the whole drum
Civic flock yo' lambo
Rock my roca pants low
No, my name ain't Lindsay
But yo' girl gimme low hand (Lohan) though
I got swave like ta-ta
You in the daze like la la
I'm from the T Dot city
Where the city ain't pretty
The niggas gotta deal with the matas like rah-rah
Stand by watch 'em gaze in amazement
I said I'm sick like AIDS in a patient
Ya talk shit get grazed in the basement
It's time for the lave and the swave shit
But no time for the fakes and lame shit
Don't see the whole team go ape shit
Go mad, go dumb, go crazy
So bad, so good, so swavey
Oh baby, I swear I could spit this shit about a million times
I got a billion rhymes, I got a trillion dimes
And I don't even mean women
I mean coins
If we winnin'
Then she joins
But we pass
And she points and says "These boys .. Damn them niggas they be comin' 'round doin' thiiiiisssss"
G5 gon' fly straight to the crib
Boy you know I'm tryna fuck me a stewardess
Baby, you don't need no shots, just take 2 of this
Since I don't make-out, the stuff I do ain't allowed
I'm giving you too much heat
I'm gon' take Bosh, Lebron and Wade out
The fuck ya' niggas talkin'
Ya' still corny with your braids out
I heard yo chick's a killa
Tell her to come and blow my brains out
Oh hold up, I heard snakes in the grass
So I gotta cut the lawn low
And I'm sippin' on a Merlot
And them niggas gon' chat till the 9 on they back like Rondo
Your girls, my girls, my girl, my girls
Oh girl, hi girl, by girl
Lookin' for a white girl
But I'm not Tyga
But you know a Tiger would (Wood) if a tiger could
This a wood shop class, come climb my wood
I got a new whip with designed out hood
And you ain't never in it
The whip like penny
You niggas Pooh, you something like Winnie
And the beat keeps going
And the freaks keep blowin'
And the freaks keep goin'
Till the skeet skeet goin'
In her cheeks she's holdin' it
Ew, I'm sorry ya'll
Had to stop on that line
Almost got in that rhyme
On the top of that line
Huh, use somethin' from the top of my mind
Ah damn, ah shit, goin' outta my mind
And ya not on my time
I'mma shoot her 9 times
With the luger 99
Make the swave go threw her her 9 times
If a man wanna talk that shit like he a big cat, betta have 9 lives
See I said "I don't talk, please let the judge speak"
I'm so ahead of ya'll, I wrote this next week
You said your love strong, but your chest weak
I said you are now flockin' with the best T .. O-R-Y
You ain't never seen no car fly
9 times outta 10
Niggas say you last year
Last year it was your time
This year it's Tory time
Next year is Tory time
Call me father, Maury time
Ya niggas need some more time
Mutha flock ya'll I'm on more grind
So if you don't like me, then mutha fuck you too
Cause I don't give a shit 'bout the fuck you do, nigga

Meek ain't countin' money no more

Ugh!

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
I got these niggas hatin' on me
But I don't give a fuck, because they bitches waiting on me
I'm just counting all this money, and buying all these hammers
So when these niggas play, I let my shooters go bananas

Madre and cabanas, that's where they probably find us
Jumpin' off the jet, like sayonara to ya honor

I spoil them bitches, I employ them niggas
Wipe my ass with the riches like it's some toilet tissue
Fuck with a winner, minks in the winter

They say "How you been?" I say "Doing fine"
Bitch I ball hard like 2 LeBrons, I hit the booth, no suit and tie

I make a hater wanna kill hisself, suicide
A nigga play with me? He know it's do or die
Cause I got a big Mac, and that bitch be super sized
Rollin' with a hundred goons, boy I got a hundred jewels
'Bout to fuck a hundred hoes, all them bitches coming soon
Tell 'em that I'm comin' now, tell 'em I'mma common coon

[Chorus: Rick Ross]
I spoil them bitches, I employ them niggas
Wipe my ass with the riches like it's some toilet tissue

Yo niggas hatin', my niggas ballin'
Poppin' bands, countin' dollars, buyin' the Magnum bottles
My bitch is patient, yo bitch is boring
Fucked her that Friday night
We both woke up that Sunday morning

[Verse 3: Meek Mill]
Bugatti with Rozay, 'bout to meet Jose
He said that that workin', I was like "okay"

[Outro: Chris Brown]
I just wanna get you all night

[Intro]
Yeah buddy
I got a cold and all that shit
Show you how hard I work
I really, I really go in man
This is from the heart, this is from the soul
Hahaha
We still having fun too though man
It's going to be a real big year
You watch
Haha
I'm telling you

[Hook]
They say the game done changed
There's just some new players in it
And they don't wanna see my team get up there and win it
Try to keep me still but look where I'm at now
I made it too far to look back down
But I ain’t never ever going forget what I been told
And I ain’t never ever going back to being broke
‘Cause FYI
I stay on my grind
Tryna stop my shine
That day'll be never ever

[Verse 1]
I started out just a fan, writing like every other kid
Grew up to be the man, paying bills at my mother's crib
Everyday I'm hustling to get us out this situation
Got to deal with phony shows, goofy hoes and niggas hating
Mostly ya’ll embrace the small percentage of my city, racist
Instead of doing good, they'd rather see me catching cases
The fans love me but I struggle trying to impress the label
And all this got me feeling like it's way too much put on the table
I'm still smoking out of O
Some speculations cause I'm hardly ever home
Easy to say 'bout how we supposed to move on
When we going through depression and our brother O's gone
Was told you gotta go through hell to get the big thing
And when you feel it can't get worse, that's when shit change
Obama's president, The Steelers won the 6th ring
So I ain’t through trying, I feel like I can do anything

[Hook]

[Bridge 1]
Started small town
Now we major
We done made it to the top floor
From the basement
We done made it to the top floor
From the basement
We done made it to the top floor
From the basement

[Verse 2]
Big city, small town
Cause when your money's up, that's when they all 'round
But the minute that you slip, they dip
And it's no one to depend on when the chips fall down
Me, I never cut a corner short, I follow protocol
Got my focus on
Took my notes and all
This hard work gon' pay off
The second that I'm rich, I'll take the day off

[Hook]

[Bridge 2]
If you out there on your grind
Put your hand up in the sky
Say “We grinding”
If you got it but you trying to get some more
Tell them boys “Yeah, we climbing”
This for my people
Who know about struggling
Trying to get something
Cause we came up for nothing
What you in a rush for?
It's all about timing
As soon as you're on
You know the limit's the sky

[Hook]

[Outro]
This your principal, Mr. Easy Rider
Reminding ya'll to get your tickets to the '09 prom, ya'll
That's right, it's gonna be a big event
Guys, grab a girl
And girls, grab on to that nigga's wallet
It's gonna be a special performance by my man Wiz Khalifa, ya'll
So lock your doors and hide your hoes
Cause it's gonna go down
I remember them days
Rolling up, 'bout 25 of them J's
White boys, we ain't smoke blunts back then
I was so high
But enough reminiscing
We gon' get back to the scheduled program
Right here on W.E.E.D
Where every eye is dry
On campus radio
Flight School

[Verse 1: Tyga]

See my dick like butter churn
Baby churn and ya girl with me fo’shure
That ain't your concern
She forgot about her man, she will never learn
On a mic 'til I die, RIP Chick Hearn
Yessir, colder than the Pittsburgh winter
Fresher than a Will Smith T-Shirt
Disperse coming through Last King and a hearse
Ask later, shoot first, got shooters like Dirk
When it hurts leave you losers bruised up
Bruce Lee nunchucks
Toe from the floor up though
Duck, rubber duck now you like oh shucks
Tell the neighbours I don’t give a fuck

[Hook]

[Intro: Wiz Khalifa]
Gone, gone, gone
I'm ballin too my nigga

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
When this song come on, I'm spending money
Play something I can spend some money to
When this song come on, I'm spending money
Play something I can spend some money to

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Highly faded, but I'm highly paid so I just live my life
That shit you niggas tryna do, I guarantee I did it twice
They say life's a gamble, hit my joint and roll the dice
When you living this high, you can't be afraid of heights
Book my flight to Vegas, Will, 20 thou- to stay the night
Another 10 on champagne, my money long, I pay the price
Tired of niggas saying they in my gang cause dog, we ain't alike
I'm throwing money, when I walk up in this bitch, they know it's money
Money in my arms, other table full of money
Pocket full of joints I rolled, dropping ashes on my clothes
Balling super hard, smoking 'til I overdose
Hardly ever sober, bitch we party 'til it's over

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
When this song come on, I'm spending money
Play something I can spend some money to
When this song come on, I'm spending money
Play something I can spend some money to

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Niggas always hating on me, talking 'bout I'm balling too
Get your money up and quit your hating's what you oughta do
I been going hard since I was young when I was in my teens
I knew when I got older I'd be on, so now I do my thing
Spending money, popping hella bottles, making niggas mad
Going places, rolling Js, I live the life you wish you had
Throwing out dollars bills, putting shit on my tab
Got a joint full of that OG, got a clique full of them OGs

[Verse 3: Juicy J (and Wiz Khalifa)]
Trippy nigga hit the club, you know I be fucked up
Chasing after model chicks, tryna get my fucks up
Niggas handcuffing hoes, but them niggas know what's up
Y'all came to the club together, but that ho gon' leave with us
Break out the blue dream, e'rybody rolling up
Where the lean? Where the cups? Ho, it's time to po' it up
Tell the owner we ain't leavin', we gon' buy the whole club
(Now my dollars to the ceiling, and my card ain't got no limit)

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
When this song come on, I'm spending money
Play something I can spend some money to
When this song come on, I'm spending money
Play something I can spend some money to

[Outro: Wiz Khalifa]
We be in the clubs with all those motherfuckers
And we spend more money than all of them niggas
Them niggas who be thinkin' they hard
And they think they're motherfuckin' this and that
Yeah, 30 racks bitch. On champagne motherfucker
Keep them sparklers coming, what you doin?
And them niggas be over there and they be quiet
That's why Juicy's with us nigga
Cause we spend 30 racks in the club

[Chorus]
How come I end up where I started?
How come I end up where I went wrong?
Won't take my eyes off the ball again
You reel me out, then you cut the string
How come I end up where I started?
How come I end up where I went wrong?
Won't take my eyes off the ball again
First you reel me out and then you cut the string

[Verse 1]
You used to be alright
What happened?
Did the cat get your tongue?
Did your string come undone?
One by one
One by one
It comes to us all
It's as soft as your pillow

[Verse 2]
You used to be alright
What happened?
Et cetera, et cetera
Fads for whatever
Fifteen steps, then a sheer drop

[Chorus]
How come I end up where I started?
How come I end up where I went wrong?
Won't take my eyes off the ball again
You reel me out, then you cut the string

[Verse 1]
I do not understand
What it is I've done wrong
Full of holes, check for pulse
Blink your eyes
One for yes, two for no

[Chorus 1]
I've no idea what I am talking about
I'm trapped in this body and can't get out

[Verse 2]
You killed the sound, removed backbone
A pale imitation with the edges all sawn off

[Chorus 2]
I have no idea what you are talking about
Your mouth moves only with someone's hand up your arse

[Bridge]
Has the light gone out for you?
Because the light's gone out for me
It is the twenty-first century
It is the twenty-first century
It can follow you like a dog
It brought me to my knees
They got a skin and they put me in
They got a skin and they put me in
All the lines wrapped 'round my face
All the lines wrapped 'round my face
And for anyone else to see
And for anyone else to see
I'm a lie

[Outro]
I've seen it coming
They've seen it coming
They've seen it coming
They've seen it coming

[Verse 1]
Just as you take my hand
Just as you write my number down
Just as the drinks arrive
Just as they play your favourite song
As your bad day disappears
No longer wound up like a spring
Before you had too much
Come back in focus again
The walls abandon shape
They've got a Cheshire cat grin
All blurring into one
This place is on a mission
Before the night owl
Before the animal noises
Closed circuit cameras
Before you're comatose

[Verse 2]
Before you run away from me
Before you're lost between the notes
The beat goes 'round and 'round
The beat goes 'round and 'round
I never really got there
I just pretended that I had
Words are blunt instruments
Words are sawn-off shotguns
Come on and let it out
Come on and let it out
Come on and let it out
Come on and let it out
Before you run away from me
Before you're lost between the notes
Just as you take the mic
Just as you dance, dance, dance

[Chorus]
Jigsaw falling into place
So there is nothing to explain
You eye each other as you pass
She looks back, you look back
Not just once, not just twice
Wish away the nightmare
Wish away the nightmare
You've got the light, you can feel it on your back
A light, you can feel it on your back
Your jigsaw falling into place

[Verse 1]
When I'm at the pearly gates
This'll be on my videotape, my videotape
When Mephistopheles is just beneath
And he's reaching up to grab me
This is one for the good days
And I have it all here in red, blue, green, in red, blue, green
And you are my centre when I spin away
Out of control on videotape
On videotape, on videotape, on videotape
On videotape, on videotape, on videotape...

[Verse 2]
This is my way of saying goodbye
Because I can't do it face to face
So I'm talking to you before-
No matter what happens now
You shouldn't be afraid
Because I know today has been
The most perfect day I've ever seen
Bottle after bottle, Model after model
Spendin’ all this paper like I fucking won the lotto
All I know is YOLO, nigga thats the motto
Ricky told me get ‘em and I told ‘em that I got ‘em
And I got ‘em erryday, erryday
Bad bitches gon fuck me everyway, never stay
Once I get it, than I’m dippin’ thata way thata way
Young, came up from the bottom and I never had a way
I really went from wooping 62′s, to whippin 62′s
Ain't none of the homies crippin’
We giving niggas the blues
We buying they hoes bags, gettin they bitches shoes
You wonder why she ain't fucking you
Winning nigga, you lose
Yeah, I’m flexing, I pull up on the Ghost
Hundred on my necklace
And my diamonds clear they VVS’ing
I turn into a toilet on these? they BS’ing
Two fingers, did it on ‘em
Hold up, I really shitted on ‘em
I dropped Dreamchaser and I made a milly on ‘em
It don’t matter what city I’m in, I’m going Philly on ‘em
With my red P hat, you don’t know, we back
‘Bout to go to Houston, heard thats where the chief at
Hiding with the ? down
I could’nt get it man, get ready for that
Me and Wale finna drop to that real soon man
I was just playing around
Shout out to the homie Drizzy, all YMCMB
It’s double MG we in the building

[Intro: Robin Thicke]
All white linen
Riding till the sun comes down
See that we living like woah-oh-oh

[Hook x2: Robin Thicke]
This is like riding through the city
With the ocean in the background
This is like flying in Paris
What your girl say now
Party down

[Verse 1: Tyga]
B-side baby, parler
Waterfront top back, coupe with a fade
Tonight is ours, paper city, red ruby
You looking fine, as beautiful as one could ever be
Tires spinning, fast cars, fast women
And I just wanna get a night with a happy ending
The yacht life, hear the splash, so much class
Lift your glass, make a toast, we around the map
His and hers, Hermès bags, leather tag
All real love, she ain't fucking with a scrub
Chillin on top, get away, just a flight
Living life, this is what it's like..

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Tyga]
She's so relentless, body of a goddess
Gotta take her higher
Rain through my window pane, she the fire to my flame
Good aim, put your heart where the sky is
It's cold down there but it's lonely up here
The world's so cold you gon' need a moncler
Don't mind stare, when I look at you it's all clear
Tryna keep it together and ball like Ross Dean
4-Seas, car clean, Harleys
I'm from the gold-era, my jewels is Gili
A party ain't a party if it ain't all night
Living life, this is what it’s like

[Hook x2: Robin Thicke]

[Bridge: Robin Thicke]
Like dolphin like you’ve never seen before
Yea this is like a penthouse, served at the top floor
This is like love, that you can never get
And nobody can, woah-oh-oh
This is like woah…
This is like woah…
This is like woah…
This is like…

[Verse 3: Tyga]
All John Blaze, collar shirts, school days
On stage, a hundred thou, two days
Looking down on top from where the stars stay
Reservoir and back guards in the entry way
I’m young and wild and I charm our old mother
Invited your young daughter, I’m known across waters
Horses in the stable, Ferrari ‘cause I’m able
Whole life I’ve been waiting

[Hook x2: Robin Thicke]

[Outro: Robin Thicke]
This is like riding…
This is like flying…
This is like love…

[Intro: Tyga]
When my emotion grows, I still won't let it show
I still won't let it show
Even if I'm broke, I still won't let it show
I still won't let it show, I won't let it show

[Verse 1: Tyga]
Uh, nigga, welcome to my life
Life feels like I'm running through a red light
Don't believe what the blogs write
Motherfuckers wanna know me so they call me Mike
I'm just chilling, watching the fight
Few friends, fake girls, pour me some ice
Table glass, slippers on, lower the blinds
Never been shy, I just ignore lies
Take a look into Tyga's eyes
I breathe love but inhale the hate bomb
So numb my face gone
I need my space and I don't do Facebook
Uh, serious, look how my face look
How could a man cry while the crowd looks?
Could you walk with me if I give you my foot?
Didn't think you could

[Chorus: Tyga]
When my emotion grows, I still won't let it show
I still won't let it show
Even if I'm broke, I still won't let it show
I still won't let it show
My mind overload, I still won’t let it show
I still won’t let it show
People I love the most, I still won’t let it show
I still won’t let it show, I won't let it show

[Verse 2: Tyga]
Uh, I don't wanna feel like most rappers feel when they get a deal
Like, "Yeah, I'm bigger than him, he's still local"
Gotta keep it real cause they will go loco
Like, "He ain't ever go through shit we go through"
So I guess now I owe you
No, now I hold you, watch them niggas close to you
But don't compare careers, his and his fools
Acting like I knew you back in middle school
Dropped out, mama said I was a fool
I brought the drop out now me and mama cool
Told her I won't lose, showed her a Jimmy Choo
She call me son now, tell me she real proud
Smiles, uh-huh
Oh what a feeling to be loved
Oh what a feeling to be loved
I wish I could fly like a dove

[Chorus: Tyga]
When my emotion grows, I still won't let it show
I still won't let it show
Even if I'm broke, I still won't let it show
I still won't let it show
My mind overload, I still won’t let it show
I still won’t let it show
People I love the most, I still won’t let it show
I still won’t let it show, I won't let it show

[Interlude: Tyga]
I've learned that people will forget what you say (I won't let it show)
People will forget what you did or done (I won't let it show)
But people will never forget how you made them feel (baby)
Don't cry because it's over, smile because it happened (I won't let it show)

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
Cole World, niggas praying for that heat
As the globe twirl, gotta stay up on your feet
'Fore I say it to my girl, I say it to the beat
Then I play it for the world and they say that shit is, deep
Hm, my life changing as we speak
They acting like they never seen a nigga on the beach
I say "Peace," hope it ain't no sharks in my water
Then holla at my mama, man she love to see Obama
Do his, thing, now look how far niggas done came
They had us on the chains now we copping bigger chains
I ain't saying that it's smart, old nigga don't trip
But they had with the whips now we copping bigger whips
Oh shit, wonder how bad will it get 'fore he rise
I'm out here trying to get rich, I survived
And a nigga got God to thank
And I'm still throwing five in the tank, nigga
Cole!

[Chorus: Tyga]
When my emotion grows, I still won't let it show
I still won't let it show
Even if I'm broke, I still won't let it show
I still won't let it show
My mind overload, I still won’t let it show
I still won’t let it show
People I love the most, I still won’t let it show
I still won’t let it show, I won't let it show

[Verse 1]
Trudging through the morning
The tramp with the trampoline under his arm
Shifts past your whiskers, so stark is the charm
But the barking alarm waits coiled 'til the corner is turned
And the bicycle wheels all struggle to move 'round
In your muddy mind, blatantly caked and
Unwilling to wind uncooperative time
So he sits on the springs 'til the muck goes dry

[Chorus]
All the pretty visitors came and waved their arms
And cast the shadow of a snake pit on the wall
All the pretty visitors came and waved their arms
And cast the shadow of a snake pit on the

[Verse 2]
What came first, the chicken or the dickhead?
Split sleep reaps rewards from ill fitting thoughts
And twilight forced you to go on a walk
Your legs start running and your head gets caught
Canopy 19 is perfectly placed
For the reasonably frightening fall from the aftertaste
You'll have to slip away, I am unhappy to say
Behold as the crook in the hammock plays

[Chorus]
All the pretty visitors came and waved their arms
And cast the shadow of a snake pit on the wall
All the pretty visitors came and waved their arms
And cast the shadow of a snake pit on the wall

[Bridge]
Behold as a crook in the hammock plays
Cruelly with the base and the scales
And fiddles with her feet on a balancing act
Gagged, bound and crafting a tale
Trailing wrapped in a gasp
Cruelly with the base and the scales
And fucking fiddles with her feet on a balancing act
She was gagged, bound and crafting a tale
Trailing wrapped in a gasp

[Chorus]
All the pretty visitors came and waved their arms
And cast the shadow of a snake pit on the wall
All the pretty visitors came and waved their arms
And cast the shadow of a snake pit on the wall

[Verse 1: Tyga]
Uh, looking around glass, my future is in the past
I'm re-arranging my life, I'm single and now I laugh
All of the moments we had, beginning and just the end
At the end, still ain't friends, heard I was on your hit list
Damn, now I'm driving Ferrarris, fucking random bitches
People saying I made it but I don't feel too different
Wayne told me, "Close your eyes, they'll never see your vision"
So I stay ready to die behind these Biggie lenses
Reinventing, Audemars/Breguet shit
Just left the hood, word to the 5th Dist
Bout to cop a G, tear the roof like Diddy
And my city color purple nigga, no Celie
It takes time when you plotting on the beat
I kill it, I bet I kill it, producer witness to see
Bitches stand on their feet, handicapped, get out your seat
Got that buzz, Lil B, sting a bitch, Ali
Hah! Comparing tighter rappers, but my songs greater
Just compare me to dope dealers and ballplayers
Cause I'm a dope ass nigga and I ball, player
Never save a ho, can't even get a life saver
She gon fuck our way to the top and fall later
So I'mma fuck her, never call her later, uh
Skinny nigga got my weight up
Middle finger to my haters, why you chasing?
We ain't racing muh'fucker, I'm gone!

[Chorus: Tyga]
Middle finger to my haters
Muh'fucker why you hating? I'm gone
I ain't really wanna do it
But I did it to 'em, nigga I'm gone
Leave the beat shit alone
Leave the bullshit at home, I'm gone
Even though I'm out of here
Nigga gotta keep it real, I'm gone

[Verse 2: Tyga]
She fuckin' with me, these niggas ain't fuckin' with me
Got my mind on my money
My money piling up hundreds
You say you did it, I done it, you old nigga, I'm younger
You fold up under pressure
I'm good straight in the stretches
Uh, bitches pecking my wood: wood chucka chucka
Never gave two fucks: double rubbers
Now your color turn your face to a red gusher
And your girl stick it to me like a car bumper
Never depended on anyone co-dependent
Kept my thoughts to myself, I don't need opinions
No middle mans, in the middle of my sands
Niggas think they sweet, they can't even pay their incidentals
I'm detrimental, on any instrumental
I ain't pulling teeth, nigga better hide your pillow
Chew these rappers to the fucking gristle
Bad to the bone, red zippers, Mike Jizzle, nigga gone

[Chorus: Tyga] X2
Middle finger to my haters
Muh'fucker why you hating? I'm gone
I ain't really wanna do it
But I did it to 'em, nigga I'm gone
Leave the beat shit alone
Leave the bullshit at home, I'm gone
Even though I'm out of here
Nigga gotta keep it real, I'm gone

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
B-I-G, Finally Famous in this...
I say, fuck sleep, stayed up, fuck you, pay up
Always got the paycheck, never took a pay cut
Payday will be worth all the broke nights I stayed up
So in my cup, I'm mixing up whatever dreams are made of
Not too many young G's made it where I am
So I was waiting on a doctor man, patient as I am
I guess a young D-boy made it into a man
With girls half-naked around like we finna land in the sand
Red-eyes to Rome and they connecting to France
With some bomb-ass pussy, that bitch came straight from Iran
My jewelry made in Japan, I'm off California drugs
And where I made my money, huh? Nigga, all of the above
I could count my inner circle on my hands and my feet
Passing joints long as a branch cause it's family tree
Doing kush-ups man cause the weed too strong
I'm a G + 1
What's that motherfucker? That's gone
Said I'm a G + 1
What's that motherfucker? That's gone, bitch

[Part 1]

[Intro]
I awoke from a dream
Filled of a world full of greed and hate
The world was my thoughts, and surroundings
I realized I needed to rise, and become king
My own destiny

[Hook]
Take a look around, tears from they eyes
Knees on the ground, money in the sky
Take a look around, ain't shit nice?
Praying for my life, hope I make it through the night
Take a look around

[Verse 1]
The city on fire
It's all taking place in the middle of my mind
I stand in the middle, cause death right beside
Murdering is simple, get your life simplified
Where the bones lie, rebuild another life
America's pie, put my hand in the pot
I can't get caught in the streets I was taught
Raised off anger but it wasn't my fault
Nigga, take a look around, it's needles on the ground
Never gave three fucks, and I still don't now
I'm fucking in the house, babysitter on the couch
13 like, "When this shit coming out?"
Pass me a jimmy, I ain't ready for a child
I hope nobody hears, "Bitch, why you so loud?"
Turn on the tube, put my head on the cloud
Breathe, inhale, the angels can't help
Tyga, take a look around
Careless world
Take a look around
Careless world

[Hook]
Take a look around, tears from they eyes
Knees on the ground, money in the sky
Take a look around, ain't shit nice?
Praying for my life, hope I make it through the night
Take a look around

[Part 2]

[Bridge]
Take a look around
Take a look around

[Hook]
All night, fighting em for my life
Praying that everything gon be right (Take a look around)
Ain't it nice, truth over the lies
Young knight, we kings in disguise (Take a look around)
I'm ridin around in my city, bitches pictures up in they titties
Man, you fake, all of us know it, I'm original and I show it

[Verse 2]
Roll one time for everyone down and
T-two times for the nigga that bounce
Then why you sitting round on some couch shit?
My-my money building like houses, hah!
Feeling like you wise, truth be told, it's all lies
These the days of out lives, why you wasting all of your time?
Voices from the skies said that evil fall in yo rise
They judge me low to the dirt then they celebrate to of my highs
Ha, why you, why you wanna be fake? I fucking hate you
Why you made cause I ain't take you?
Last day alive, I wouldn't date you
I'll replace you with somebody better that you only make up
We just make up, wake up king and queen
And rule the world a little later
Later on in that day, tears all in her face
I said I’m going away, she begging me to stay
Took a look in her eyes, then she put my hands on her waist
Said, “Don’t leave, we’ve got a baby on the way”
Take a look around

[Hook]
All night, fighting em for my life
Praying that everything gon be right (Take a look around)
Ain't it nice, truth over the lies?
Young knights, we kings in disguise (Take a look around)
I'm ridin around in my city, bitches pictures up in they titties
Man, you fake, all of us know it, I'm original and I show it (Take a look around)
I'm ridin around in my city, bitches pictures up in they titties
Man, you fake, all of us know it, I'm original and I show it (Take a look around)
Round, round, round, round, round, round, round
Man, you fake, all of us know it (Take a look around)
Round, round, round, round, round, round, round
Man, you fake, all of us know it

[Outro: Martin Luther King Jr.]
I want you to know tonight
That we, as a people, will get to the promised land
And I’m not worried about anything, I’m not fearing ANY man
My EYES have seen the glory, of the coming of the Lord

[Hook: Pharrell & Tyga]
Lil homie, yeah (Uh, what's up, big dawg?)
Everybody tryna get with you (Get with you)
Come on (Uh, but I ain't for that, that, nah)
Yeah, lil homie (Uh, what's up, big dawg?)
Stay focused, got shit to do (Shit to do)
Yeah, a-come on

[Verse 1: Tyga]
Ah, they say what don't break a nigga make a nigga
I woke up out my dream, said I gotta get it
This whole city full of thieves, gotta watch my pivot
Cause on the block, niggas never seen good living
Only lived in, jail cells or prison
Drive-bys, little homies hit the store for liquor
I gotta steer my life different, where to begin with?
Mama told me go back to school, I said I'm finished
There's only one way a nigga gon' learn, mayne
You gotta take risks and do things the hard way
Stole the hall pass now I'm running through the hallways
Only thing in my memory from those days
You couldn't save a nigga, even on a Sunday
Monday, new day, shit still the same
Gotta switch the rhythm up like Kwame, when things change
Watch people do the same as I hear a voice sing

[Hook: Pharrell & Tyga]
Lil homie, yeah (Uh, what's up, big dawg?)
Everybody tryna get with you (Get with you)
Come on (Uh, but I ain't for that, that, nah)
Yeah, lil homie (Uh, what's up, big dawg?)
Stay focused, got shit to do (Shit to do)
Yeah, a-come on

[Verse 2: Tyga]
Uh, big boy grown, can't leave the streets alone
Wanna be a king but you're too young for the throne
Why you riding in the car that you can't afford?
Can't move forward in the four-door chrome
All that cheap talk I never did
My walk is Billie Jean, my shoes'll never slip
Notice how close he is, gold his goals that approachin' him
They can't stop a win, losing's not an option
First place locked in, get my trophy ready bitch
Turn your back on me only gon' leave you bent
Fuck that bullshit, I got common sense
I'm ready for my limelight, put my mic in hand
They'll dissolve when the money's gone
So motherfucker don't appear when the money's home
Lil' homie done grew into a big dog
If you barking in my way, you gettin' chewed on

[Hook: Pharrell & Tyga]
Lil homie, yeah (Uh, what's up, big dawg?)
Everybody tryna get with you (Get with you)
Come on (Uh, but I ain't for that, that, nah)
Yeah, lil homie (Uh, what's up, big dawg?)
Stay focused, got shit to do (Shit to do)
Yeah, a-come on

[Verse 3: Pharrell & Tyga]
See your friends walking up and down your block (Uh)
Ain't got a penny-nenny-nenny-nenny (Ain't got a penny)
Just picture yourself sittin' there on top (Uh)
A nigga straight winnin-in-in-in-in-in-in
Nigga straight winnin', you see how I did it
Bottom to the top, take 'em back to the beginnin'
All my niggas winnin', you see how we did it
Dreamt it now we live it, now we all winnin'
Me and my

[Hook: Pharrell & Tyga]
Lil homie, yeah (Uh, what's up, big dawg?)
Everybody tryna get with you (Get with you)
Come on (Uh, but I ain't for that, that, nah)
Yeah, lil homie (Uh, what's up, big dawg?)
Stay focused, got shit to do (Shit to do)
Yeah, a-come on

[Chorus: Chris Brown & (Wynter Gordon)]
She ain't in it for the fame (For the fame)
For the fame (For the fame), for the fame (For the fame)
She ain't in it for the fame
For the fame, for the fame
She said that she ain't in it for the fame (For the fame)
For the fame (For the fame)
For the fame (For the fame)
She said that she ain't in it for the fame

[Verse 1: Tyga & (Chris Brown)]
Uh, please no intro, Tyga she already know (no, no)
Come and spend the night with me
And tell me what you into, uh (into)
Can I take you home? Wake up in the morn' (yeah)
My side of the bed (yeah), next minute I'm gone (Ha ah!)
You smile too, I'll probably smile if I was you
Always keep it real with me and I'ma keep it real with you (with you)
Her friends like "How you gon' handle him?"
Always hiding from the camera (always hiding from the camera)

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Wynter Gordon]

[Verse 1]
Looking at the ceiling, thinking why I treat you bad
Ain't no worser feeling than knowing I did it for the laughs
Arguing all I was doing, accusing you -- my bad
Said let's take some time, never mind, rewind..
Looking at the ceiling, thinking why I treat you bad
Ain't no worser feeling than knowing I did it for the laughs
Arguing all I was doing, accusing you -- my bad
Said let's take some time, never mind, just playing with your mind
I always thought, play dumb and let the other one love
Why get caught up in a web of trust?
Only love for fun, I'm too young, I thought
All I wanted was a thanks, them Louboutins I bought
But it ain't your fault
Heaven knows you deserve it all
You sent letters to my heart, but I burnt them all
The Bible says before you run, gotta learn to crawl
But I don't wanna waste time if we ain't involved

[Hook]
Aw Aww
We been through it all
I know I broke your heart once before
But I'm done
Aw aww awww
Tell me what's wrong
I know I never listen, but just listen to this song
Aww man
I promise we gon do it til the sun come down
I swear it's going down
I promise we gon do it til the sun come out
Fuck if they don't do it, we gon do it all

[Verse 2]
Now the ceiling fan spinning -- getting dizzy, man
Wondering who she with, maybe should I call?
Don't be desperate, man
This ain't no tag-you're-it, hide-and-seek shit
Reality just kicked in, I lost one and now she's winning
Found another nigga she did
Says he treat her like a queen, but she probably control him
Fuck that, I gotta get her back to where we started
Start over again, this time her heart's in
Honestly, leave us, leave us, let's just talk about it
I know before I wasn't much of a man about it
But this time I realize I can't live without you
Believe when I say it's true
I love you

[Hook]
Aw Aww
We been through it all
I know I broke your heart once before
But I'm done
Aw aww awww
Tell me what's wrong
I know I never listen, but just listen to this song
Aww man
I promise we gon do it til the sun come down
I swear it's going down
I promise we gon do it til the sun come out
Fuck if they don't do it, we gon do it all

[Verse 3]
Love make you do it all
Going up and down like a see-saw
Can't be a player forever, dog
It feels so good, but I know it's wrong
Motherfucker, drink what I'm sipping on
Motherfucker, drink what I'm sipping on
Motherfucker, drink what I'm sipping on
A bottle of love, tell me if it's too strong

[Hook]
Aw Aww
We been through it all
I know I broke your heart once before
But I'm done
Aw aww awww
Tell me what's wrong
I know I never listen, but just listen to this song
Aww man
I promise we gon do it til the sun come down
I swear it's going down
I promise we gon do it til the sun come out
Fuck if they don't do it, we gon do it all

[Verse 1: Tyga]
Ah! Uh, one shot, bomboclat
Bitches jumping on my dick, hopping like it's hopscotch
Booty pop, my bitch don't wear that, she prolly ass shots
I don't give a fuck, I fuck 'em all 'til they pussy ouch
Potty mouth, oochie wally, bang, bang, then I'm out
Once u-fucking-pon a time, had your bitch inside my house
Cooking grits and riding dick, swear she the best chef around
Pop, that pussy, now let me see you Doo Doo Brown

Tell these bitch niggas it's they time of the month
Time of the month, niggas want beef but I eat that shit
Eat, eat, everything well done (Well done)
Hah, I'm so far in the clouds I can barely hear
All that shit you rocking boy, that was last year
GOAT's here, niggas steer my style like a stopped deer
Pump fear to you bitches heart, Suge without the beard
Haha, man, all these new niggas weird
They all lining up to come and see the last king

[Hook: Tyga]
Oh, I get money, I, I make money
I, I take money, them bitches want it from me
Cause I'm, I'm 'bout whatever, I'm, I'm 'bout whatever
I'm, I'm with whatever, man I do it, do it better
Two-two more shots then I'm out
I'm a muh'fucker and I got a potty mouth, ah
I'm 'bout whatever, man, I'm 'bout whatever
Man, I'm with whatever, man I do it, do it better

[Verse 2: Tyga]
Uh, man, I fucked your dime and now she's mine
2 Live Crew, put the pussy in my palm
She put on a nigga and make a grown man cry
Selling bullshit, I don't pay you no mind
But what's your sign? Gemini?
Scorpio, let me fuck from behind
However you want it, baby
Light the blunts, blunts and close your eyes
Real nigga though, real nigga though
Got a freak bitch in the DBI, put me on though
Came in the door, kicked in the door
Waiving the .44, put one, one in your blowhole
(Whew!) Man, your paper thin
You need to take some notes
Niggas steal my lines and say they don't
There go another new quote
I'm fresh off the boat, nigga, let's toast
Young Money real, y'all shit just a hoax
Made a fairy tale, busy on a float
Why would I lie? Forever under oath
I'm, so fucking frustrated with your lady
Get a flight, I send her home, man, my love is oh so tainted
If you fine, you might get diamonds
If you a five, you might get nothing
I'm on my monsters, they from a moshpit
R-r-r-rock you like Nirvana
Uh, man, I be off Patron like it's a holiday
Fucking with them finer things
Pull up on your bitch and say

[Hook: Tyga]
Oh, I get money, I, I make money
I, I take money, them bitches want it from me
Cause I'm, I'm 'bout whatever, I'm, I'm 'bout whatever
I'm, I'm with whatever, man I do it, do it better
Two-two more shots then I'm out-out
I'm a muh'fucker and I got a potty mouth-mouth
I'm 'bout whatever, man, I'm 'bout whatever
Man, I'm with whatever, man I do it, do it better

[Verse 3: Tyga]
Ah, man, I fucked your dime, still in my prime
Young D, I'm freshest nigga on the line
Better man up, it's about to go do-down
Leave you with jaw-dropped, face on the gr-ground
Let the rain fill the moats round my kingdom, carved in the cement
Star, pledge allegiance, I'ma let you leave em screaming
Screaming, screaming, dr-dreaming just to get by-by
Girl you so fly-fly, why you so high-high?
Two-two more shots then I'm out
I'm a m-muh'fuckin p-potty mouth
Hah, I'm 'bout whatever, uh, I'm 'bout whatever
Uh, I'm 'bout whatever, man, I do it, do it better
Hah, a-all bad bitches in my house
I'm a motherfucker, fuck her then I kick her out-out
I'm 'bout whatever, uh, I'm 'bout whatever
Uh, I'm 'bout whatever, man, I do it, do it better, hah!

[Verse 4: Busta Rhymes]
Cannibal, I eat you raw meat, I'm raw with beats
So scavenger with it, nigga look like Jaws with feet
You don't want it, bitch!
Y'all niggas know I get gully, what you want?
Listen close, y'all don't hear how the beat get ugly
When a motherfucker come through?
Excuse me, bitch! Please let me kill it just a little bit
And let a nigga do what he do
That movie shit, that Tec make a niggas wanna vomit spit
You niggas already knew (hoo hoo hoo)
See keep on fronting niggas then I'm lighting up another city
Got 'em fighting 'til they get to biting then we getting gritty
See the time and now a nigga climbing up another milli
Then we shining 'til a nigga blind them up until it kills me
Forth and back
I'ma digest a nigga 'til I throw up on the track
Then I'ma dissect a nigga 'til I pop off
Like we in the Wild West when I finished giving you the crack
(What?!) If you ain't knew I'm in route
To the crib just to park the Bugatti at the house
Sitting big, one of my bitches done really turn her out now
Still everyone know I got a potty mouth now
Shit, they got me doing it again
Back to bodying the things and lots of screwing other women
You can never stop the shit that I be doing and the way we moving
Get it popping, never stopping, kill em in the end now
Then I'ma get 'em to the point
When I got 'em all open, handling my business with em, ha!
Trust me, you don't wanna start cause you know it's torture!
Every single minute 'til I finish with 'em
And I knock shit down
Every time I come and then I lock shit down
'Til I come up, place niggas better drop that crown
Ever here, 'fore I gotta pop you clowns and I go erase niggas!

[Instrumental]

[Chorus: Etta James]
Oh, sometimes I get a good feeling, yeah

[Intro]
Uh
The High Life
You know I stay on the move

[Chorus]
Memories don't live like people do (Uh-huh)
They always remember you (Yeah)
Whether things are good or bad (Uh-huh)
It's just the memories (This the motherfucking The High Life)
Memories don't live like people do (I'm your host)
Baby, don't forget me (Mac Miller)
I'm a traveling man, moving through places (What?)
Space and time, got a lot of things I got to do (The always grindin')
But lord willing I'm coming back to you (Aha)
Baby boo, I'm a traveling man, moving through places
Space and time, got a lot of things I got to do (Check 

[?] right here)
But God willing I'm coming back to you (Let's do it)
Baby boo

[Verse 1]
Uh, uh, uh
Look, look, yeah
Yeah, I keep my bags packed, always back on the road
Headed back to baby girl right after the show
But now I got clothes, hoes, piff and kicks
Always twist a couple spiffs while I'm in the whip
First thing, you need to gas, hit the pump, fill the tank up (What?)
Tell my homie at the register to stay up (Yo)
I'm on the parkway, feeling like a straight month
Going through the tunnel 'bout to break up (What?)
Phone gets hanged up, tunes turned way up to the max (Max)
Hit the L twice then pass it to the back—breath (Yep)
My medication comin' in for recreation
Ain't no pause or hesitation, tryna catch my respiration
I ain't never had no patience, so I'm hardly ever waitin'
Just creatin' money makin' with creative preparation (Uh-huh)
Sick of all these cats with false representation
Too bigger words? Maybe need some translation
Intellectual boy, figurative with language
And that there (That there,) that ain't shit (Uh-uh)
You feel me?
The High Life, and I'm gone (What?)

[Chorus]
Memories don't live like people do (Uh-uh)
They always remember you (Yep)
Whether things are good or bad
It's just the memories
Memories don't live like people do
Baby, don't forget me
I'm a traveling man, moving through places
Space and time, got a lot of things I got to do (What?)
But lord willing I'm coming back to you (What?)
Baby boo, I'm a traveling man, moving through places
Space and time, got a lot of things I got to do (Uh)
But God willing I'm coming back to you (Back home)
Baby boo (

[?])

[Verse 2]
Look, look
My plane coming down and I'm happy to land
Every time I gotta go my girl grabbin' my hand
Tryna pull me back to her, and as mad as I am (What?)
I gotta make this money, I'm a travelin' man (Uh-huh)
So through airplane, boat, or packed in a van
Baby, I'ma hurry back to you as fast as I can
It don't matter what I gotta do (What?,) dreams: I gotta follow you (What?)
Love is what I fall into and ever do it follow through
So I'ma put it all on you (Yep,) just know that I ain't got a clue
But, baby, I be watchin' you coppin' you some Prada shoes (Haha)
Hurt me when I watch the news, the doctors in the hospitals
Tryna heal the sick, but all their chances is impossible (Uh-uh)
Givin' the word like literature
Spittin' the verse for all of those who live in the 'Berg
I travel the world, the land and the sea
Just here to open up your mind, just hand me the key (Aha)

[Chorus]
Memories don't live like people do
They always remember you
Whether things are good or bad
It's just the memories
Memories don't live like people do
Baby, don't forget me
I'm a traveling man, moving through places
Space and time, got a lot of things I got to do
But lord willing I'm coming back to you
Baby boo, I'm a traveling man, moving through places
Space and time, got a lot of things I got to do
But God willing I'm coming back to you
Baby boo

[Outro]
I'm leavin' on a jet plane
And don't know when I'll be back again
Kiss me and smile for me
Tell me that you'll wait for me
Hold me like you'll never let me
Go (Uh, uh)

Mind on money but the money on me

With the hoes on full, we ain’t runnin' on E
Nigga, you know what it is, nigga, you know what it ain't
Do I love her, do I love her? Nigga, you know what I think
Pourin' purple in the Sprite, nigga, you know what I drink
Nah I’m playin' but despite what a stupid nigga think
Homie, I be gettin' cash all night
Let a nigga hit, let me smash all night

She a 5 in the face but her ass alright
So the hat's on tight
I rub it, I get it, I touch it, I hit it
I’m fuckin', you fuckin'? Well fuck it, I'm with it
Let’s get it, let me get to business
And that’s when she did it like she wasn't kiddin'
Admitted it she love me, I told her, "It's stupid"
Then asked that bitch "Why?" and she told me, "It’s Cupid"
I said, "What the fuck, like that's what your excuse is?"
And then she said, "Yes" and I threw up the deuces
I’m sippin' on liquor, she smokin' on weed
I’m stuck in her throat, she chokin' on me
So shout out to yo niggas, acting like hoe niggas
Ridin' our dick 'cause we about to blow niggas, pause

[Chorus]

I need a bitch that’s famous and a girl that’s right
And a hoe that’s all in, pussy the bomb, Bin Laden

But I’m high, I’m drunk, I’m Mr. Puff-the-Lye
But I’m fly as fuck, these hoes they love the guy
Why do I do this shit to a woman?
Love me when I'm givin' straight dick to a woman
If she pull that shit out, try to that shit south
Like a broad on fire, I’ll put that bitch out
Because I don’t need no bad bitch tryna lie to me
I live on a plane and I promise this shit nigga
Ain’t no chick gon' fly for free, why? I'm me
Eyes can see, a mad guy nigga on that shit like a mad fly nigga
Money ass long as a flat line nigga
And I’m in a bitch back like that spine, nigga, oh

[Verse 1: T.I.]
(Go) Bricks stacked up in a high pile
G-4 flying, No Sky-miles
Get it, whip it, give it to whoever in the city
Hard, soft, girl, boy, decisions, decisions
All I can do is envision all this dough I been gettin'
And just to think back a quarter key was the mission
And now I'm weighing fish scale on a big scale
Hopin' I can evade the law and stay outta jail
My relative gave me work, I made it disappear
Like Harry Potter got that choppe in the window seal
My cousin wanna a brick
I tell him "Listen here you better bring my money back quick"
And he replied like this

[Hook: Yung Booke & T.I.]
Man, I can't even fit this money in a rubberband
Right hand get tied I just whip it wit my other hand
If I can't make that brick jump back, I bet my brother can
Off in my trap junkies bitin' like piranha man
And if they ask we got the whip game proper
If the brick game droppa
Make 'em disappear we just call it Harry Potter
Got the whip game proper
My clique aim choppers
Make 'em disappear we just call it Harry Potter, man

[Verse 2: Yung Booke]
(Flya) Straight drop, got Jays playing Sideline Telvin
Young boys got them racks in the sideline clutchin'
Cheese on ya head now you a fan of the packers
We be stiffer than a statue, We soprano style wackin'
Phone ringing, Its about to have a ticket calling
Get off of work, we all gone be Jordan and Pippin ballin'
Yeah, cause I'mma whip it til it lock
Set it out until you dry'em and distribute to the block
I'm motivated by big faces, I need guack
My only fear is God Almighty and snake cops
Some of my niggas hustlin' and some of 'em knocked
How many quit the game and the other was in the box FLYA

[Hook: Yung Booke & T.I.]
Man, I can't even fit this money in a rubberband
Right hand get tied I just whip it wit my other hand
If I can't make that brick jump back, I bet my brother can
Off in my trap junkies bitin' like piranha man
And if they ask we got the whip game proper
If the brick game droppa
Make 'em disappear we just call it Harry Potter
Got the whip game proper
My clique aim choppers
Make 'em disappear we just call it Harry Potter, man

[Bridge: Yung Booke]
And we just call it Harry Potter, man
And we just call it Harry Potter, man
And we just call it Harry Potter, man
And we just call it Harry Potter, man

[Verse 3: Spodee]
UGH! You try me you disappear, we call it Harry Potter
Just gotta ho, I tell her come sit on this Terry Carter
I get my bitches from the birds I'm from the swamp though
And I be fresh everyday, Bitch I'm young Spode
I mix the coke with the water like I'm chemist
I'm smoking until I'm finished
I'm focused and independent
You locals is my apprentice
Ugh, A lot of haters want my campaign to end
I fucked a nigga bitch and I champagned her friend
And I just acquired another a Phan, I'm truly swag
If yo boyfriend get wrong, I'mma shoot his ass
I'mma young boss playa, make a thick game holla
If this rap shit fall, I got my whip game proper, Spodee

[Hook: Yung Booke & T.I.]
Man, I can't even fit this money in a rubberband
Right hand get tied I just whip it wit my other hand
If I can't make that brick jump back, I bet my brother can
Off in my trap junkies bitin' like piranha man
And if they ask we got the whip game proper
If the brick game droppa
Make 'em disappear we just call it Harry Potter
Got the whip game proper
My clique aim choppers
Make 'em disappear we just call it Harry Potter, man

[Verse 4: Rich Kidd Shawty]
You gotta whip it with ya shoulda if you tryna get that rover
But that photo panamera probably be a lil' cooler, yeah
The trap hop, skip, jumpin'
Gas, no air, I got my ma fuckers pumpin'
Bricks, no rocks that's the ma fucking function
And if you try to rob I make ya head do the pumpkin
Finger licking delicious, check it homie got brickes
Sixes like Fannamy, y'all know what niggas thinkin'
I rock the leather coat like a ma fucking Italian
Dookie Gold Rope like the ma fucking medallion
Bird flappin' It's the home of the falcons
They got me in the middle of the trap like Malcolm
Whip transforming like the yellow camaro
Blockin' the skellos smokin the rellos

[Hook: Yung Booke & T.I.]
Man, I can't even fit this money in a rubberband
Right hand get tied I just whip it wit my other hand
If I can't make that brick jump back, I bet my brother can
Off in my trap junkies bitin' like piranha man
And if they ask we got the whip game proper
If the brick game droppa
Make 'em disappear we just call it Harry Potter
Got the whip game proper
My clique aim choppers
Make 'em disappear we just call it Harry Potter, man

Make you disappear like Harry Potter

Got up in the club, posted in the back

Rocking this skirt, rocking this club
Got my middle finger up, I don't really give a fuck
Rocking these diamonds, I'm rocking this chain
Make sure you get a picture, I'm rocking my fame

[Pre-Chorus]
To be what you is you gotta be what you are
The only thing I'm missing is a black guitar

Six-inch walker, big shit talker
I never play the victim, I'd rather be a stalker
So baby take me in, I'll disobey the law
Make sure you frisk me good
Check my panties and my bra
Wild'n out, a crazy house
With my white jacket on
Won't you come and sign me out?

[Pre-Chorus]
To be what you is you gotta be what you are
The only thing I'm missing is a black guitar

[Intro:]
Turn me up a little bit more
Yeeaaah
It's Young Khalifa man
Star Power
Taylor Gang or Die
It's star year, get used to it

[Verse 1:]
Uh, feel like the sky is the limit
And nothing come easy you gotta grind till you get it
They say the star life is addictive
And me I'm so high, I'm flying defying physics
I'm wearing hundred dollar draws no flaws
Wizzle on the hands free call, young boss
Blackberry ringing, Sidekick buzzin'
Got my money right, can't tell me nothin'
If I said I wasn't all in
I'd be lying like a lady who's fallen
Chain sick and the watch face swollen
See me now wish I'd go back to the old him
But Wizzle won't change for the world
I live life fast any day could be your last
Blow ten stacks, then go and get it back in a hour
Thats what the fuck I call Star Power, lets go

[Hook: x2]
They say you get out what you put in to it
So my all's what I give
And now I'm just talking about the life of a star
Homie that's what I live
And the niggas that I'm with, hustle heavy
In your city, every state, with my Taylor Gang family

[Verse 2:]
Yup, this good living got me open
Make you feel like you took a hit of what I'm smoking
The high life, yeah that's my life
And it's possible to die twice
But you only live once, so I'mma live it up
Pop bottle after bottle, rolling kush filled blunts
I feel like I've been chosen
And I dont fix it if its broken, I buy a new one
The way I blow hundreds
Make people say they should of never gave niggas money
If you was me, I guarantee you'd do the same thing
Cop anything when you want it
They say fame's the most dangerous drug
I played with it, now I can't get enough
And came up - a customer
But now I'm the supplier
And that's what I call Star Power, lets go

[Hook: x2]

[Refrain: Jess Jackson & Tyga]
The ceiling's falling in
Every time I don't know where you've been
Out on love
At this point, I realize love is not an emotion I can neglect
Seventeen to lifetime, I thought, I knew
My queen thought I wasn't ready for love, she was right
The seasons change when we all stay the same
What did love mean to me? It didn't mean anything
The pain (compassion, affection)
I felt back then won't ever go away
I just knew I wanted her back
Echoes call me back to the feeling again
Can't be a king without love
Echoes call me back to the feeling again (love)
Echoes call me back to the feeling again

[Birdman]
The young king... The lil homie Tyga
It's yo turn, nigga... It's yo turn, playboy
West Coast stand up to this Careless World, people
Global flying on this journey...
Tropical islands, popping bottles with supermodels...
Blowing up the pounds (sunup to sundown)...
Flying at higher heights... Grinding hard...
Money by the abundance...
Yeah, YMCMB flashy life...
What it do, young king... It's yo turn, boy...

[Tyga]
Being king took me on a journey... All across the world...
Sidetracked from the love of my queen...
Realize I have to make an effort... To show a king's life...
But this is like
You gonna love me
You gonna love me, man! is wiz khlaifa!
Uh, black out, yes!
Cd in the building
Pitsburg stand up real quick for your prince right now
I'm about to show you niggers
And why wiz khalifa is the prince of the city
Listen, listen, listen!

Young dude, you get off in
Niggas often handy
Respect you fools you soft as panties
And no other rapper fame like mine
Disagree, I remove your top, help you change your minde
Cock sucker what your life about
We're on that add with our pipes out
City seen nigga life's out!
That's the definition that is black thing
We being black out thing and slaying hurts for these ladies
And in the I wanna step up, get it a lot of things that will make a mess of you
And I don't sell weed
I don't sell, dope
I roll with the gang, of fools that leave a smile on your throat
To see games, soon as we stump in a place
Not notheing on my waist but don't think, no want to mistake
Leave anyone you met in your life, as you if you're running my space
Dog, that could get you punched in your face
Or you could run butt naked, have you runnin the place
No jewels, no shoes, I'm nigga with no rules
Dudes, don't understand what I'm getting at?
The whole concept is pitiful, so when I'm done
..these twins no longer be identical
I do got respect for anyone thats real
But all hail the true price of the city is still and thats (Meeeeeee)
Listen man, it's still the song she's singing to you
Yow niggers gonna love me, man!
You might not want to, but it's hard, I'm the prince of the city and still!
And thats (meee), listen!
Shuts start to my nigga, let's collapse on my nigga listen, uh!(meeeee)
I speak to you, dough
I'm the true prince of the city
Do the artist formerly none
Now keep that thing, gotta keep that
Reaching for the lord, dog, release that bling
When I step in the place. stole grands on me
Downs, with their hands on me
You're sick of searching and niggas with punch lines
Well known to heart pride
All mouth doing like a buck fifty on a strip
It's no way you gonna hold me
I rap sick, and I put the
Ok, get a cracking for the war
I'm sixteen, the eighteen, when it's back for the war!
I'm way big, no I'm better than him
Keep suffering on me with a .. I call 'em double mint twins
This are all streets, and trespass, and you get bust back
You can for everything down to your bus pass
And when I buck fast, niggers dunk fast
And if you get hit ain't notheing left but your mustache
And niggers imitate the team we are
But I roast you burn niggers like cdr
I do got respect for anyone real, but all hail the true prince of the city is stilland thats (meeee)
And that's me!
No doubt about it man
And niggas can run that back
It's o question, the prince of the city is still, nigga and thats (Meeeeee)

I'm feeling ,invincible man
And niggers let us sing the side of this one!
Black out! black!(meeee)
(Your gonna love me yes you are you better you better.....)
Why we gotta grow up in the world so cold?
Got girls getting raped, only nine years old
Police attacking us, that's why we defensive
Got a cure for AIDS, but it's too expensive
I look into my father's eyes, and see the resemblance
Both black, being positive and all about business
I get back everyday, thank God as my witness
Everyday my body grow stronger, and my mind get tougher
We got a black president, but everyone still suffers (Why everyone still suffer?)
'Cause the world so cold (So cold)
Because The World So Cold (So cold)

[Intro: Jess Jackson]
Last king

[Chorus: Jess Jackson]
All I see is black crowns
King me cause this is my time now
So all you other niggas bow down
Cause all I see on me is black crowns, black crowns

[Verse 1: Tyga]
Uhh, Heavenly Father, appoint me to the coronation
I deserve it, brought music for clarification
Envision my past, Egypt reincarnated
Negativity hill, over the hump, camels waiting
Never gave up, most of my peers forsaken
One make it, we all make it but I was never that patient
King chronicles, never write it too logical
Fake niggas saying, "What up, fam?" but we ain’t biological
Hands down to my mother, she the greatest ever
Since I was the only child, wasn’t too much to stress her
Waking up before work, leaving allowance on the dresser
Raising the prince under pressure, no king, no refuge
It’s all good, got homies like "Boyz n the Hood"
We all good, I mean no matter what circumstances was
Champagne, weed, pills, it do the same
These niggas gassed up, too much butane
Working hard like one day, I’ll afford the four-door Porsche
Approaching every corner cautious
Too much shopping, niggas calling you a target
Too much flossing, niggas gossiping that blog shit
I rather put one in the air, congratulate careers
Death defying moments, people that I ain’t seen in years
What you running from when you you’re your only fear?
Guess my time is here now all I see is

[Chorus: Jess Jackson]
All I see is black crowns
King me cause this is my time now
So all you other niggas bow down
Cause all I see on me is black crowns, black crowns
All I see is black crowns
King me cause this is my time now
So all you other niggas bow down
Cause all I see on me is black crowns, black crowns

[Verse 2: Tyga]
Uhh, fatigue, I’m feeling jaded
She gave me the number but I ain’t never saved it
Shit is solid, why these niggas played it?
Dealt the right cards, but I have yet to play it
Determined payrolls, living the lifestyle
You couldn’t be in if you was to see it right now
I think I see it right now
They judge me every day, life on trial
Take your money, niggas betting on my downfall
Many all real hoes, bitches gon' call
Five fingers, pledge allegiance to my one God
We’d have been through hell, so heaven ain’t far
Two cars sedans, tearing it on the way to the Grammys
Guess we nominated, guess they appreciate us
These niggas often imitate us
We just stay creative now all I see is

[Chorus: Jess Jackson & Tyga]
All I see is black crowns
King me cause this is my time now
So all you other niggas bow down
Cause all I see on me is black crowns, black crowns
All I see is black crowns
(One time in the, one time, it's my) Time now
(Two, times in the, two times in the air for the) Bow down
Both hands in the air if you feel me, yeah
Black crowns, black crowns

[Bridge: Tyga]
One time in the, one time in the air for the
Two, two, two times in the, two times in the air for the
Both hands, both hands, both hands in the air for the
One time, two times, times

[Outro: Tyga’s Mother]
Just wanted to call to let you know how proud I am of you sweetie
Uh, this album is amazing
I have never imagined that God would bless you so much
As he is going to continue to bless you
He’s already made you the king that you are
Only one to wear the black crown
Well, I just wanted you to know how much I love you
And how awesome you are
And how I am so, so honored to have a son as yourself
I could never have asked for more, you’re just amazing
And I am just so excited for this album
I think this album is definitely your baby
And it’s definitely gonna be heard by a lot of people
And a lot of people are gonna love it
They’re gonna love it, love it, love it
And God’s gonna continue to bless you with all the talents that you
Ah, I’m just so proud, I just wanna shed a tear right now
OK mommy loves you, and you the best thing ever
You are my heart, I love you sweetie, bye bye

[Hook]
The days go by, we argue all the time
I want to make it right, ‘cause that was last night
Baby we gon be alright, baby we gon be alright
Yea yea love was the mark, bullets to your heart
I want to move on but my feelings too strong
I don’t wanna waste time, I don’t wanna waste time

[Verse 1 – Tyga]
Man I know we ain’t finished when it’s barely beginning
All the time I done put in, I put in but time was ending
So silly chasing a feeling, figured you felt different
But so many, so many girls but I just stay with ya
See love wasn’t my intention
Rather play Dominoes
Count money with my niggas, shoot dice
Give me seven, rolling out the gate, I hit it twice
Black Eyed Peas, money baby, it’s gon be a good night
And when I said I love you, yeah I fuckin’ meant it
And we ain’t gotta bring your moms and your sister in it
House too big, they all trying to spend the night
You always inviting them and I don’t even be liking it
At all, and I don’t even say shit
‘Cause I just like to see you happy even when you faking it
So flagrant you foul ass bitch, man I hate you
I hope we can make up in the A.M

[Hook]
‘Cause the days go by, we argue all the time
I want to make it right, ‘cause that was last night
Baby we gon be alright, baby we gon be alright
Yea yea love was the mark, bullets to your heart
I want to move on but my feelings too strong
I don’t wanna waste time, I don’t wanna waste time
It’s like we’re in a love game, love game
Love game, love game
Yea, yea, yea, yea
It’s like we’re in a love game, love game
Love game, love game
Yea, yea, yea, yea

[Verse 2 – Tyga]
Uhh, for every last king need a queen
If you love me now then forever hold this ring
Hold me down, defend it; hold me down, no witness
You always got so much pride but once you look in my eyes
It’s over, you even told me about you when you was younger
How your father abused you, I let you cry on my shoulder
No tissue, just short sleeve, tears see-through
Our lives equal, thinking what you been through
Uhh, yo Genie here
Yea I grant you every wish
Put you in environments, good company success
Already set, you going with the best
I know I lied before but trust me I ain’t like your ex
Sex so good, break up then break a sweat
We should stay together, then we fight again
Same old shit, different location
Feeling like my time wasted

[Hook]
‘Cause the days go by, we argue all the time
I want to make it right, ‘cause that was last night
Baby we gon be alright, baby we gon be alright
Yea yea love was the mark, bullets to your heart
I want to move on but my feelings too strong
I don’t wanna waste time, I don’t wanna waste time
It’s like we’re in a love game, love game
Love game, love game
Yea, yea, yea, yea
It’s like we’re in a love game, love game
Love game, love game
Yea, yea, yea, yea

[Verse 3 – Tyga]
Trying to forget someone that you love
Like trying to remember someone that you never knew
Think about it, I dream about it
My nightmares haunting me, I can’t sleep about it
Anxiety, can’t breathe, can’t live without you
The revival, all these verses is my survival
Standing at the podium, waiting on your arrival
One day but no return
Like Usher say, gotta let it burn

[Outro – Tyga]
The hardest part of dreaming about someone you love
Is waking up to see that person gone
You know it, it it takes seconds to say hello
But forever to say goodbye
Moving on is easy, but what you leave behind
Is what makes it hard…
(One of these days and it won't be long)
Atone ,what up
(One of these days and it won't be long)
Its Big Sean Detroit baby

[Big Sean]
I’m sunning niggas like daytime, damn
I guess it cuz I’m dope like bass lines, pause
Cuz they catching on late like dateline
I’m tired of playtime its time to take mine
Ain’t no coincidence that every bitch wanna date Sean
If she told different little nigga then they lying
Only difference is I do this shit and they straight trying
If that ain’t the truth bitch then the pigs is straight flying
(woo) I gotta breathe started with a dream but now its all in reach
Sheesh I hear them haters they keep talking
Im on top now, F all them
Cuz they falling, like Autumn
And wish that they was close to Sean like Marlon (damn)
And you can ask Atone while y’all stayed home
This what we stayed on to make it out
One of these days and it won't be long
One of these days and it won't be long
One of these days and it won't be long
One of these days and it won't be long

[Atone]
Its ya mans Atone, listen up...
What I'm manifestin is  destined to be interestin'
Devastating like a C section
Hard body like a erection
You see him dawg he flexing
Perpetrating wack verbalation
Percolating like he ice skating
And he wonder why we hating
The fake work he making
Like he really put in work to make it
His chain hanging I should take it
But I ain’t like that
Just introduce me to the right track
And say fuck it like we naked
I don’t ever feel disrespected
Cuz I know I’m on the right track
Doing what I can to make it
From the heart I can never fake it
From the soul and I hold it sacred
Intellectual vocation
Unite the whole nation
While i'm on an international vacation
Holy carnations
One of these days and it won't be long
One of these days and it won't be long
One of these days and it won't be long
One of these days and it won't be long
One of these days and it won't be long

[Verse 1]
When I first saw you
I said to myself, "Girl, who you looking good for?
Who you talking to?
Who that fella is standing right next to you?"
Ooh, ooh
Look at me, silly me
Got me thinking 'bout changing the game

And I can't let you get away

[Verse 2]
The time is right now
You ain't gotta look at me with a frown
Sucking your lips
All you gotta do is say no or yeah, yo
And we can go all the way to the top
Ain't nothing wrong with that

[Refrain]
Can't let you get away
So I said, "Hello, hello, girl, what's your name?"

The teacher asked me what I wanna be, a money getta
When I was broke I did a joke, I was a funny nigga
Now I don't really play around, I'm gettin money nigga
Started on the stoop, turn a quarter to a coup
Say the profit and regroup
Shitted on them haters, OOOPS!
Buy my bitties ever bags so they can ball like jill swoops
All I do is get the money and spend it like the world do
This old head told me money it don't mean nothin
I was thinkin in my head like he ain't seen nothin
Cops at me by the car I ain't seen nothin
If u won't fall for anything you ain't mean nothin

[Hook]
I gotta lotta dough
Cause getting money all a nigga know
Ima professional money getta
Ima professional money getta

They ask me what I do
I keep they mouths froze
Cause gettin money all a nigga know
Ima proffessional money getta
Ima professional money getta

[Verse 2]
I say I'm tryna turn a dolla to a million
I was knockin at the door they wouldn't let me in the buildin
So I took it to the streets sold my mixtapes and I killed em
Same ho dat fronted on that nigga now they feel em, steel him
Broke bitches on my back, now u want my autograph
Told em in miami, I'm gonna fan em all up on that ass
They was chasin random chicks and I was chasin around that cash
Dawg I ain't find my swag until the day I found my stage
Money make the world go round and all them pretty girls go down
Blizzy on deck cause in the day it can still go down
That money don't make u real u a dildo clown, u fake!
If they ain't gettin money now a days they hate
It ain't my birthday but I'm eatin my cake
But I ain't gotta eat cause I already ate
Yeah I'm already straight!

[Hook]
I gotta lotta dough
Cause getting money all a nigga know
Ima professional money getta
Ima professional money getta

They ask me what I do
I keep they mouths froze
Cause gettin money all a nigga know
Ima professional money getta
Ima professional money getta

You know ima money getta

[Hook]

Cause getting money all a nigga know

Ima professional money getta
They ask me what I do
I keep they mouths froze
Cause gettin money all a nigga know
Ima professional money getta
Ima professional money getta

[Intro: Hodgy Beats]
I fucked this flow

[Verse 1: Hodgy Beats]
This is my electronic press kit, I hot as some fresh shit
Nigga, recollect, bitch, grow grey hairs, don't stress it
I text message, messages to fuckin' estrogen
She lets me in, I sex her, then, she sexier than my leather Vans
'Cause I never am, purchasin', reimbursing your courtesy
Put your body on the curb to work the street, I hearse the streets
Heard she sweet, she Hershey's sweet, but me, I'm extravagant
Hop on the bandwagon kid, I'm about to tell you some tragic shit
The love is lost and the drugs they cost, in the studio, mixing raw
Bitches shit in my drawers, like you piss in my drawers
Nigga, my dick's in her jaw
I'm Wes Snipes with lead pipes, don't dabble with the apple
'Cause a swagga like mine turn them apples into Snapple
Fuck the pick of the raffle, king of the castle
Nigga, Genghis Khan mansion, we the Marilyn Manson
Making money in the present, it be safe for my grandsons
African drums for when the champ come, bitch!

[Verse 2: Domo Genesis]
Suicide, watch, nigga, kill yourself
Opposition who? Nigga, reveal yourself
How you steal our swag and figure you still yourself?
Splinter Cell creepin' in this bitch, you couldn't feel the stealth
Wolves are prowlin', hunger at its fucking best
I'm a beast, like the gorilla head that is on my chest
Please, let me flex, I'm going off, I need some fuckin' bread
Drugs are green, my bitches white and tonight I need fuckin' head
Excuse our swag, I'm tryna tone it down like Jenny Craig
Fresh to death then I guess we looking like the living dead
Oh, shit, yo' bitch, look at how I'm doing you
Bitches on my dick, but look at me, I'm fucking beautiful
Niggas tryna figure out, but all I hear in my interviews
Is why this so cool? You niggas are so unusual
Wolf Gang, point me to a nigga I should prove it to
Under pressure, we just stand in the middle like hula hoops

[Bridge: Hodgy Beats]
The fortress is fortified (Bitch)
Money in my pockets like I'm 45, Hodgy Beats recording live
Bitch, I be surely high, and I don't need wings to fly
I'm in the air with the pigs, Left Brain, Domo Genesis

[Verse 3: Tyler, The Creator]
Knock-knock, who's there? It's me
Your girlfriend had a really nice meeting with my dick (What?)
I killed that pussy, and grabbed that knife
Now, I got real authentic cheetah print shit (Nigga, you're a liar!)
Nigga, don't believe me (What?), kiss your lady
And boy, you're gonna get them heebiejeebies? (Uh)
Nigga, my dick stay way disease-y, I make it look easy
51-50, I'm off the Heezy, and you ain't got no fuckin' Yeezy?
(5 albums, 100 songs, and you ain't got no fuckin' Yeezy?
I bet you got some J-Kwon, you ain't got no fuckin Yeezy?)
Came in the game like Speedy Gonzalez, I'm fuckin' Looney
See these girls talkin' all that shit (What?)
I'm just tryna see some tits (What?)
Let's get it poppin' like, MC Lyte, around some dykes
I'm, out this bitch, like, "Hocus pocus"
And me and Lucas got a couple of pickles
And met up with some bitches, gave 'em cum on their dimples
Then, my dick went limp, so, took about three pills of Extenzo
Now, my dick longer than a five-door limo
Harder than a soft right hook from Kimbo on PCP and cilantro
When I'm with your bitch I'm like, "Where my dick go?"
Now, she think I'm 'bout to eat her whole
Enchilada, I gotta lotta that 'Preme and I'm paying nada
It seems that I'm product placement, but I'm not, I'm just fuckin' awesome
Yo' mama look like a ugly (Fuck you!) loser

[Verse 1: Alicia Keys]
He broke my heart
And now it's raining
Just to rub it in
I'm at your door
I feel so crazy 'bout it
You'll say I told you so
You saw it long ago
You knew he had to go
I finally came around
I'm back on solid ground
Can't let it get me down, no

[Pre-Chorus: John Mayer & (Alicia Keys)]
It's alright
It's alright
It's alright (It's alright)
It's alright (Yeah)
It's alright (Yeah)
It's alright

[Chorus: Alicia Keys]
Yes, I was burned, but I called it a lesson learned
Mistake overturned
So I call it a lesson learned
My soul has returned
So I call it a lesson learned
Another lesson learned

[Verse 2: Alicia Keys]
Sometimes
Some lies can take a minute
To fully realize his tears, your eyes
Thirty seconds to apologize
You give it one more chance
Just like the time before
But he already know you'd give a hundred more
Until that night in bed
You wake up in a sweat
You're racin' to the door
Can't take it anymore

[Chorus: Alicia Keys]
I was burned, but I called it a lesson learned
Mistake overturned
So I call it a lesson learned
My soul has returned
So I call it a lesson learned
Another lesson learned

[Bridge: Alicia Keys]
Life perfect
Ain't perfect
If you don't know what the struggle's for
Falling down ain't falling down
If you don't cry when you hit the floor
It's called the past 'cause I'm getting past
And I ain't nothing like I was before
You oughta see me now

[Chorus: Alicia Keys]
Yes, I was burned, but I called it a lesson learned
Mistake overturned
So I call it a lesson learned
My soul has returned
So I call it a lesson learned
Another lesson learned
Whoa
Said yes, I was burned, but I called it a lesson learned
Said, mistakes overturned
So I call it a lesson learned
My soul has returned
So I call it a lesson learned, oh, lesson learned
Oh, another lesson learned

[Outro: John Mayer]
It's alright
It's alright
It's alright
It's alright
A lesson learned
It's alright
It's alright
It's alright

[Chorus]
Lord have mercy, Jesus Christ
He’s just nice, he just slice like a ginsu
Look at the life that I been through
We the last real niggas alive, that’s official

[Kendrick Lamar]
Let me tell you when it all started
Game dropped Documentary and made plenty enemies
It was a classic album, but prior to that
Guerilla Black debuted and put the city on wax
A lot of Biggie comparisons, we all was aware of them
But that wasn't my M.O., I just thought he was dope
Can't understand why Game would say his name in that manner
Many years went by, still no legitimate answer
Anyway, I put out a mixtape in 12th grade
Hub City threat, minor of the year, DJ Dave
And his brother designed, put together the music
Put it out to the people, the people said I was stupid
With the flow, went to the barbershop to show off my skills
Mike and Himey and some other cat said I was real
Himey was Games barber, the other cat made a statement
Saying that Game was his partner, so I gave him my tape
Said he'd play it for him, hoping that I'd get my big break
But never got a response.. anyway
This nigga named Pop Gates came to my school with a camera
I freestyled on his DVD for a minute then after
It hit the streets, I was known as K. Dot from Compton
Man Hootie probably was the youngest out that was poppin'
But I didn't have a home yet, Hootie had ? in me
Until I met Top Dawg, told Dave that he'd like to meet
Me at the studio, made me freestyle for an hour
Told me come back tomorrow, but I came back in a hour
Jay Rock was in the booth, recording his first mixtape
Was skeptical homie at first because he knew where I stayed
But we got over that, heard the beat, wrote a rap
Did our first collaboration on the Nephew track
He got signed months later, Warner Brothers
We started on his album, he wrote his rhymes on paper
Before Sidekicks became a modern day phone
Same time our buzz was generated from G Malone
He had a song called 200, White Lightnin, the streets loved it
Said that Sony had gave him an unbelievable budget
Now that's a smart nigga, I'm tryna make my raps bigger than life
But not knowing how to market it right
Turned on the radio
Only cat new from the West Coast was playin' was Bishop
And by then this nigga' buzz was tremendous
In the lab, me and Rock tryna perfect our craft
What the fuck? Next thing you know, we came across Lift Me Up
It was a hit
When I heard it
But all we had was the instrumental and the hook
But when
Rock jump on it for certain, it was to smash
Gave it to Julio, just to get his opinion
Next thing you know, the record was
Spinning
That was a good look, it set the coast on fire
Niggas in Garden projects presents Watts Riot
Then these rappers start hating, callin' up to the station
Ask why they record ain't playin', what you niggas complaining, about?
Shit was funny to us tho
Niggas hate to see a nigga from the bottom come up, yo
In the midst of the single poppin' and niggas tryna seek and destroy
I had a situation with Def Jam, premature
Shit went sour after Jay-Z left but they didn't care
I was glad Jay-Z gave me respect
See I was young, fast forward, hot dollah had the streets on lock
Far as radio play, obvious, he got a lot
Beefing’ with Daz Dilinger, Jay Rock spoke on it
Which in my opinion, I didn’t think the shit was impo’tant
But that’s a whole ‘nother story, we hit the lab with Game
And a few other names like Juice and Young, ya boy
Did the cypher freestyle and everybody’s like, "Wow"
These Top Dawg niggas ‘bout to make noise"
Surely after Game took us on tour, I love you for that
But right after that, we didn’t see him no more
G Malone came with a smash hit with Akon
Mistah FAB battled Royce Nickel with napalm
Then everybody start to scream out the new West
And claim that West Coast legends don’t want to see him at best
I think that’s just an excuse, because their music ain't tight
Tell ‘em that Ab-soul said it, they can quote him twice
Then Crooked I came with Hip-Hop Weekly, killin’ the internet
But he been a threat since Deathrow, then Roccett came about
And all I thought about was Ab-Soul 2Eleven too
It finally started to look like the West was makin’ moves
Western Union had the whole block boomin’ because of Snoop
Matter fact, Bad Lucc was my favorite about the group
Then ?Problem? took off, another Compton native
We both Compton niggas, but Compton still ain't made it
By this time, Jay Rock and All My Life hit the airwaves
We almost got into some major beef over Lil’ Wayne
That part I'mma leave out
Theres certain things that the streets only should know about
Shout out to Nipsey
Bishop win that game, then had a fight with X.O
That’s when I dropped C4 and had the critics mad at me
Because they didn’t see my views, grab the hottest album out and re-do it
That’s a goddamn power move stupid
You foolish, don’t know shit about this war shit
Theres mo’ shit to wanting to be the king of the coast shit

[Chorus]
Lord have mercy, Jesus Christ
He’s just nice, he just slice like a ginsu
Look at the life that I been through
We the last real niggas alive, that’s official
Lord have mercy, Jesus Christ
He’s just nice, he just slice like a ginsu
Look at the life that I been through
We the last real niggas alive, that’s official

[Outro: Kendrick Lamar]
So two weeks ago I finally run into the nigga I gave my mixtape too
And said he was partners with Game
The nigga finally told me what he said
He said he didn’t like it
But the niggas like
“See, see, look at you, look at you now, I tried to tell him you was tight”
Nigga probably never even gave it to him and shit

[Ended with shout outs]

[Verse 1]
Drinking a German beer, with a Cuban cigar
In the middle of Paris with a Dominican broad
Great head on her shoulders, she probably studied abroad
She transferred to Harvard from King's College in March
She says that I'm her favorite 'cause she admires the art
Michelangelo with the flow, Picasso with the bars
She's well put together like a piece by Gershwin
Renaissance style, tonight is picture perfect, so smile
And pack your bags real good, baby
'Cause you'll be gone for a while, while, while

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, tell me how you feel, what's your fantasy oh
I see us on a beach down in Mexico
You can put your feet up, be my señorita
We ain't gotta rush, just take it slow
You'll be in the high life, soaking up the sunlight
Anything you want is yours
I'll have you living life like you should
You'll say you never had it so good

[Chorus]
La, la la, la la, la la, la, la la
You never had it so good
La, la la, la la, la la, la, la la

[Verse 2]
Suffering from first class cabin fever
Five hour layovers from Norway to Egypt
I'm to the point like the pyramids of Giza
Still I'm to the left like the tower out in Pisa
I'm feeling single baby, I could use a feature
Swagger like Caesar, I'll get you a visa
We can go to Italy and maybe see the Colosseum
I'll be Da Vinci if you'll be my Mona Lisa, now smile
So pack your bags real good, baby
'Cause you'll be gone for a while, while, while

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, tell me how you feel, what's your fantasy oh
I see us on a beach down in Mexico
You can put your feet up, be my señorita
We ain't gotta rush, just take it slow
You'll be in the high life, soaking up the sunlight
Anything you want is yours
I'll have you living life like you should
You'll say you never had it so good

[Chorus]
La, la la, la la, la la, la, la la
You never had it so good
La, la la, la la, la la, la, la la
You never had it so good

[Verse 3]
Well I been feeling singular, how 'bout let's make it plural
Spin the globe, wherever it lands that's where we'll go
We'll hit up Europe, yep, and spend some Euros
And maybe visit Berlin, the walls with the murals
This is your month baby, sign of the Virgo
Private reservations, glasses full of Merlot
A Rosé, a Burgundy, traveling like turbo
Brush up on your Español, we're Barcelona-bound, so smile
So pack your bags real good, baby
'Cause you'll be gone for a while, while, while

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, tell me how you feel, what's your fantasy oh
I see us on a beach down in Mexico
You can put your feet up, be my señorita
We ain't gotta rush, just take it slow
You'll be in the high life, soaking up the sunlight
Anything you want is yours
I'll have you living life like you should
You'll say you never had it so good

[Chorus]
La, la la, la la, la la, la, la la
You never had it so good
La, la la, la la, la la, la, la la
You never had it so good
La, la la, la la, la la, la, la la
You never had it so good
La, la la, la la, la la, la, la la
You never had it so good

[Verse 1]
Some say I'll be better without you
But they don't know you like I do
Or at least the sides I thought I knew
I can't bear this time
It drags on as I lose my mind
Reminded by things I find
Like notes and clothes you left behind
Wake me up, wake me up when all is done
I won't rise until this battle's won
My dignity's become undone

[Chorus]
But I won't go
I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk
I won't go
I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk

[Verse 2]
So petrified, I'm so scared to step into this ride
What if I lose my heart and fail the climb?
I won't forgive me if I give up trying
I heard his voice today
I didn't know a single word he said
Not one resemblance to the man I met
Just a vague and broken boy instead

[Chorus]
But I won't go
I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk
I won't go
I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love, then what is?
I, I'm willing to take the risk

[Bridge]
There will be times we'll try and give it up
Bursting at the seams, no doubt
We'll almost fall apart then burn the pieces
To watch them turn to dust
But nothing will ever taint us

[Chorus]
I won't go
I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk
I won't go
I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love, then what is?
I, I'm willing to take the risk

[Verse 3]
Will he, will he still remember me?
Will he still love me even when he's free?
Or will he go back to the place where he
Will choose the poison over me?
When we spoke yesterday
He said to hold my breath and sit and wait
"I'll be home so soon, I won't be late"

[Chorus]
He won't go
He can't do it on his own
If this ain't love, then what is?
He's willing to take the risk
So I won't go
He can't do it on his own
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk
'Cause he won't go
He can't do it on his own
If this ain't love, then what is?
We're willing to take the risk
I won't go
I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk
Chorus:
Is you rollin'? Yeah I roll kush daily, Fuck you pay me, Fuck you fuck you
Fuck the CEO, Fuck the artist and the goon's too
Smell's like pussy over there, nigga fuck you

Verse 1:
Money keep coming in so I ain't even worried
I'm richer than your Daddy baby and I ain't even thirty
A nigga made a diss song and I ain't even heard it
Never mention homie's name cause he ain't worth it
Thought about a charm cause I felt like splurging
Showed my jeweler love then he made the chain perfect
Man, I'm one take perfect, VVS diamond chains, don't they look pretty
And I don't leave with the ones, Nigga thats petty
This pretty red girl said fuck it I'm quitting
Dance till your white big toe start splitting
I'm hood rich, stupid rich, and I ain't bullshitting
A thousand carats on baby I ain't bullshitting
Eight grand gone I ain't been ten minutes
Baby gimme two minutes, twenty more coming
Later do eighty-four hundred I'm throwing
Dually truck, Hummer truck, my truck game stupid
Just like Lo I pull up in something foolish
Red diamond chain but it sure ain't cupid
I came along way from that '84 Buick
ITS GUCCI
Chorus:
Is you rollin?? Yea I roll kush daily, fuck you pay me, fuck you fuck you
Fuck the CEO, fuck the artist and his goons too
Smell like pussy over there, nigga fuck you

Verse 2:
My car game foolish boy, I'll show you how to do things
Dirty shoes shawty first you need to change your shoestrings
All on my dick like a bitch with a g-string
Sucker ass nigga like a nigga with a tongue ring
Gucci got a pump and I bought that thing for one thing
Smoked nine joints now the nigga think he John Wayne
Yea I think I'm bad cuz I got a stupid fight game
One punch shawty I will make you see the light mayne
Stomp-out shawty I will make you read my Jordans
Try Gucci Mane boy you must be retarded
Glock forty-five but I still got the forty
Have your ma-ma screaming oh lord

So Icy trap boss, try me I will kill you
Shawty dirty whoadie pimp juice
So Icy CEO, pussy I will kill you

Chorus:
Is you rollin? Yea I roll kush daily, fuck you pay me, fuck you fuck you
Fuck the CEO, fuck the artist and his goons too
Smell like pussy over there, nigga fuck you
Verse 3 (partial):
Drama boy on my mixtape how'd you do that?
Gucci what it cost cuz I know he charge a whole lot
Cash out shawty man I think I want the whole lot
If it ain't pimped out then I got a whole lot
30 minutes gone and I think I smoked a whole ounce
Not by myself man I smoked it wit the whole house
Drop top Chevy when I pull up to my ol' house
Damn it feel good ridin round my hood iced out

[Verse 1: David Gilmour]
You got to be crazy, you gotta have a real need
You gotta sleep on your toes and when you're on the street
You got to be able to pick out the easy meat with your eyes closed
And then moving in silently, down wind and out of sight
You got to strike when the moment is right without thinking
And after a while, you can work on points for style
Like the club tie, and the firm handshake
A certain look in the eye and an easy smile
You have to be trusted by the people that you lie to
So that when they turn their backs on you
You'll get the chance to put the knife in

[Verse 2: David Gilmour]
You gotta keep one eye looking over your shoulder
You know, it's going to get harder, and harder, and harder
As you get older
Yeah, and in the end you'll pack up and fly down south
Hide your head in the sand
Just another sad old man
All alone and dying of cancer

[Instrumental: 03:05 - 06:46]

[Verse 3: David Gilmour]
And when you lose control, you'll reap the harvest you have sown
And as the fear grows, the bad blood slows and turns to stone
And it's too late to lose the weight you used to need to throw around
So have a good drown, as you go down all alone
Dragged down by the stone

[Interlude: 08:03 - 12:15]
(Stone, stone, stone...)

[Verse 4: Roger Waters]
Got to admit that I'm a little bit confused
Sometimes it seems to me as if I'm just being used
Gotta stay awake, gotta try and shake off this creeping malaise
If I don't stand my own ground, how can I find my way out of this maze
Deaf, dumb and blind, you just keep on pretending
That everyone's expendable, and no one has a real friend
And it seems to you the thing to do would be to isolate the winner
Everything's done under the sun
But you believe at heart everyone's a killer

[Instrumental: 13:26 - 15:19]

[Verse 5: Roger Waters]
Who was born in a house full of pain
Who was trained not to spit in the fan
Who was told what to do by the man
Who was broken by trained personnel
Who was fitted with collar and chain
Who was given a pat on the back
Who was breaking away from the pack
Who was only a stranger at home
Who was ground down in the end
Who was found dead on the phone
Who was dragged down by the stone
Who was dragged down by the stone

[Afroman singing]
Memories, of the ghetto
Getting drunk, getting high, getting faded (ghetto memories)
Memories, of the ghetto
Getting paid, getting laid and incarcerated (ghetto memories)

[Afroman rapping]
I hop out my car and stroll brother
Afroman, young soul brother
Late night crack house deep off in the hood
We kick it outside cause the weather feel good
Stereo bumping in the living room
Classic soul music with the peaceful boom (boom)
Colt 45 got your boy on buzz
But I ain't going home, I'm post in cuz (post in cuz)
Take another swig, take another hit
Talk to my man about some real deep shit
Cluck heads walking up and down the block (ba-kaa!)
Pulling to the side and selling the rock
The block get slow about a quarter to four
Spotlight po-po gets searched once more
They searched me from the east, west, north and south
I relaxed cause I got the cocaine in my mouth
They take the handcuffs off and we get released
Hop in the Cadillac and tell my homeboys 'peace'
Nineteen ninety-two Fleetwood Grove
Daytons gold in chrome on my way back home (memories)

[Afroman singing]
Memories, of the ghetto
Getting drunk, getting high, getting faded (ghetto memories)
Memories, of the ghetto
Getting paid, getting laid and incarcerated (ghetto memories)

[Afroman rapping]
My system be good off in my Fleetwood
Beating in my Caddy like cops in Cincinnati
At the red light, I stop and stall
Look at the liquor store and see my name on the wall
Hookers on the corner trying to make a sale
Brothers in handcuffs going to jail
The light turn green and I starts to bail
Dosing off cause I' drunk, high, sleepy as hell
And as I ride, I just can't hide
My sense of pride, for where I reside
I' proud of the ghetto, proud to survive the ghetto
You know, stay alive in the ghetto
Drink Colt 45 in the ghetto
Struggle and strive to get out the ghetto
I' out the ghetto
But the ghetto is inside me
Ghetto memories

[Afroman singing]
Memories (baby), of the ghetto
Getting drunk, getting high, getting faded (ghetto memories)
Memories, of the ghetto
Getting paid, getting laid and incarcerated (ghetto memories)
Memories, of the ghetto
Getting drunk, getting high, getting faded (ghetto memories)
Memories, of the ghetto
Getting paid, getting laid and incarcerated (ghetto memories)

[Intro: David Ruffin]
Sometimes I think about it
And my poor heart wants to die about it
Woooooo about the sweet sweet love I lost
And the way I got double, double crossed
By a guy who was my friend, I see him now and then
But I pretend I'm doing fine, when I'm about to lose my mind

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Nigga I grew up fast, then blew up fast
Money fallin out my pockets I got too much cash
Can't fit nothin in her pockets she got too much ass like goddamn
Well if you must ask
We from the school of hard knocks but your crew cut class
Half white but don't think I got a Klu Klux pass
When I'm up in the V, police be fuckin with me
No sir no license all I got here is this fuckin degree
Move along cocksucker ain't nothin to see
Unless you talkin blockbusters, you niggas is not Russell
You more Diggy - me I'm more Biggie
No diss to the young boy im just rappin get bored quickly
Just to make up for that line invite him on tour with me
Show him the game let him finagle these whores with me
Run through they doors with me, hit the Ritz-Carlton for the night
Leave him there with two dykes probably change a nigga life right
What up Vanessa, I loved you that one semester
Thanks to my profession I balled like Uncle Fester
Thinkin about the board I use to have above the dresser
Half the shit I wrote down I did it, its old now got
New goals, plus my money on Manute Bol
Funny how my old highs is suddenly my new lows
Tired of every chick sayin she models before she swallow
So I only fuck with hat tricks, bitches with a few goals

[Bridge]
Niggas keep askin me how I feel how ya feel
It's Coleee

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Not even slightly interested in what ya opinion is
I gotta greater purpose then a hater purpose
I'mma stack paper, hustle just to relax later
Serve niggas and bring change that's a waiter's purpose
Look how I made em nervous, niggas is shakin, I know they fakin'
Okay you a killer right, and Miss Cleo is Jamaican
And Bob Marley is Haitian and me and Beyonce datin'
And Jesus Christ be hatin, got mad love from Satan
For fuckin Sanaa Lathan while Meagan Good is waitin'
I'm the deadbeat father of your little brother
In other words goddamnit I'm a bad motherfucker
It's Cole, it's only right I brought back the soul
Y'all got way too electro, damn near techno
Halfway homo, way too metro
Hennesy XO, Cole flow special
Style like Tribe Called Quest meets Death Row
Learn somethin boy, grow yo ass up
Cheap nigga if you was liquor I'd probably throw yo ass up
Matter a fact if you was grass I'd probably mow yo ass up
Last call for you old niggas go and pour yo last cup

[Outro: J. Cole]
Yea, yea, yea yea, Cole World
This nigga Ib is fuckin'...he's a bitch
He told me to talk shit to y'all niggas, so I'mma talk my shit
Dreamville in the building
I know what y'all want me to talk about, what y'all want to me to discuss
But we'll get to that later; them bitch ass niggas...
My nigga Big Sean in the building
My nigga Canei on the beat
Abazaba

You know we get in the studio and do what we do best
You know
Beautiful shit
But this time around I wanna do something different homeboy
You feel me my nig
Hop on them keys real quick my nig

(Hook)
Play some shit that my girlfriend'll like
I ain't tryna entertain these other hoes tonight
Play some shit that my girlfriend'll like
Yea hahaha yea
This shit my girlfriend'll like
I ain't tryna entertain these other hoes tonight
I'm playing shit that my girlfriend'll like

(Verse 1: Kendrick)
Check me out
She say she love it when it sounds like this
She tell me Kendrick put it down like this
When I listen I wanna close my eyes
And feel your lips
Let your lyrics wrap around me and grab my hips
So enticing
On point like the helmet of a Viking
Kicking up dust like I'm hiking
I ain't calling a woman a bitch on this one
I be calling my woman so I could get some
She fresh off work and Lord knows it was hard
She take off her shirt and Lord knows that I'm hard
Composing myself, tryna remain content
She had a long day and plus I know she wanna vent
Now she could talk about her boss and I can give advice
Or she could take the panties off and I could eat the (PIE PIE)
Fuck that, option number deuce
On the kitchen table while I play this tune
You know why?
This shit my girlfriend'll like
I ain't tryna entertain these other hoes tonight
I'm Playing shit my girlfriend'll like
Hahaha yea
This shit my girlfriend'll like
I ain't tryna entertain these other hoes tonight
Aba, this shit my girlfriend'll like my nigga

Look

(Verse 2: Kendrick)
We be in the car, bumpin' my latest jam
I recorded at the studio around 10 p.m
It's a club banger
Catchy hooks and 808's
I even threw a bridge on it just to play it safe
The first 8 bars, she's lovin' the track
Even rewinding it back
Soon as the beat drop
The way she react she like "That's Hot"
'Til I start talkin' bout how many hoes I got
How many I fucked
How many I've misled just to get a nut
Like a squirrel, in pursuit of lunch
Uh
Though I'm on some cliché rapper shit
I know she thinking are my lyrics that accurate
She's so cool doe
Don't downplay her just to fuck up the mood yo
She'll still play it even though I sound rude yo
And disregards to the provocative records
One thing that I do know
This something my girlfriend'll like
I ain't tryna entertain them other hoes tonight
I'm playing something that my girlfriend'll like
Told you that my girlfriend'll like
Other hoes tonight
Soul

(Verse 3: Ab-Soul)
This something my girlfriend'll like too
Kendrick I got you

This a great idea
This'll be my girlfriend's joint right here
So I'mma kick the shit she like
It seem right
Like a pair of jeans that fit tight
Around her cute booty
I like to hold her from behind in line
At the movies
Her body language gets read
Like a ruby
Cause she a work-a-art
No help from Julie
I'mma beast and she such a beauty
I love her, she know that, I place no one above her
Far from an arc, but best undercover
Kodak moment every time we in sync
Like a iPod plugged to a USB
It's just you and me
I mean me and her
I mean her and I
It's plain to see, affirmative
So if you ever need me
You know where Herbert is
On her mind
Like she on mine
Uh
Play some shit my girlfriend'll like
Cause I ain't tryna entertain them other hoes tonight
She do music too, this shit my girlfriend'll write
If she was me talking bout her
DJ
Play some shit that my girlfriend'll like
I ain't tryna entertain them other hoes tonight
I wrote some shit that my girlfriend'll like
Now I'm sho' to get some cuddy

[Verse 1: 2D]
I'm a pale imitator of a boy in the sky
With a cap in his head and a knot in his tie
I'm the light in the mall when the power is gone
A shadow in a corner, just playing along
I'm only laying in my bed, I'm rolling aside
But if a get a car, I'm hoping to ride
Because I know if I ever say, "I'm leaving" to you
You've gotta volunteer, and you don't know what to do
You'd sigh

[Chorus: James Murphy]
You wanna do it, but you don't know what you're doing, baby (A-a-a-a-aah)
You wanna feel it but you don't know what you're feeling tonight (Alright, how are we doing?)
And if you're thinking that I don't know what you're thinking, baby (A-a-a-a-aah)
You do more thinking and I'll go out and make it alright (Alright, how do you do?)

[Verse 2: 2D]
I'm impregnable, incredible, and set in the quo
I’m a late in my rider, not a heart and soul
I got a Saturday night, and nothing is dead
And if I ever had to do it, well, you know I wouldn’t care
I just get down, I love when I’m seen
And if I wanna talk back, the message is free
Then there’s a fire, a ray, a knot in sight
And if you get my tip, you get 'em a lot
You get a heart, ache

[Chorus: James Murphy]
You wanna do it, but you don't know what you're doing, baby (A-a-a-a-aah)
You wanna feel it but you don't know what you're feeling tonight (Alright, how are we doing?)
And if you're thinking that I don't know what you're thinking, baby (A-a-a-a-aah)
You do more thinking and I'll go out and make it alright (Alright, how do you do?)

[Post-Chorus: Andre 3000]
Every time we try, we get nowhere
Wouldn't it be nice if we were just normal people? Yeah
Trying so hard to act like we don't care
But it's true you do, nothing is left so I guess I'm right

[Verse 3: André 3000]
New word - onomatopoeia
Boom! Quit acting like you don't wanna be here
Fuck around and get jumped like leap year
Glock in the glove make you really wanna leave me alone
Get the fuck on, gone
Okay, okay, okay, back to the happy song
Rap ain't nothing but the art of talking shit
My girl look pretty up there riding dick
My plaid past, my solid future
Asinine ass and a gorgeous coochie
I'm an outcast but you're into me
Summer got mad 'cause winter blew me
That juicy fruit, that splooshy sploosh
Generation X on bloopty-bloop
Get doop, gotta get doopty doop
Everybody hit the floor, we through the roof
Like a chimney, I commend me
How come it be some lame ass nigga talking about, "Ah, he don't rap enough?"
But y'all rap a lot, and I'm like wrap it up, ho
You ain't Scarface, you ain't Willie D
You ain't Bushwick, you ain't killin' me
Better play with your motherfucking mama
Bet you still stay with your motherfucking mama
Keep sleeping on me, I'mma rock my pajamas
In the daytime, I swear, I promise
Dare a nigga say something, tear a nigga face off
How come blacks don't play baseball?
Y'all white, know y'all can taste all
This fly shit, I stay finna take off

[Refrain: André 3000]
Do ya damn thang, do ya thang-a-thang
Do ya damn thang, do ya thang-a-thang
Do ya damn thang, do ya thang-a-thang
You ain't fresh squeezed juice, nigga you that Tang
Do ya damn thang, do ya thang-a-thang
Do ya damn thang, do ya thang-a-thang
Do ya damn thang, do ya thang-a-thang
Is you really Slick Rick? Nope, you Dana Dane

[Verse 4: André 3000]
Let it up, head erupts
A lava language and the vocal volcanic (Yeah)
If it ain't fixed, don't broke it, don't panic (Yeah)
If it ain't hits, it ain't shit, goddamnit (Yeah)
If it ain't this, it ain't dope, it don't flush
And if it ain't hip or don't hop, well then hush
"Man they sound like-"
"Man they stole your-"
"Man they look like-"
Nope, it ain't us

[Refrain: André 3000]
Do ya damn thang, do ya thang-a-thang
Do ya damn thang, do ya thang-a-thang
Do ya damn thang, do ya thang-a-thang
Is you really Slick Rick? Nope, you Dana Dane
Do ya damn thang, do ya thang-a-thang
Do ya damn thang, do ya thang-a-thang
Do ya damn thang, do ya thang-a-thang
Yee ain't fresh squeezed juice, nigga you that Tang

[Bridge: André 3000]
Every time we try, we get nowhere
Wouldn't it be nice if we were just normal people? Yeah
Trying so hard to act like we don't care, I don't care
But it's true you do, nothing is left, so I guess I'm right
Flip the page, our days are revelations, hide!
Space is strange, doctor, I've got no patience!
Oh, it's all a part of the process (Okay, okay)
Nothin's new, it's true, cool, I admit, shit, I guess you're right!

[Outro 1: André 3000]
I even mumble I'm the shit

Yeah, yeah! I'm the shit!
Ah, I'm the shit!
Mumble cause I'm the shit
Yeah, I can mumble cause I'm the shit, I can mumble

And you know it!

Say it wit' me!

Sometimes I feel like the shit
Sometimes I feel like the shit, sometimes I feel like I'm shit
Sometimes I wanna stand for somethin', then sometimes wanna sit
I didn't really plan on cussin', but sometime it just slip
Ah! I'm the shit!

Yeah, I'm the shit!
Ah! I'm the shit!
Yeah! I'm the shit!
Ahh, yeah! I'm the shit!

Ohhh! It's all about me! I'm the shit!
I'm crawling back to the mic! I'm the shit!

Fuck! I'm the shit!

I get smart on it, I'm the shit!

I make her crumb on it, I'm the shit!
The sum of it; I'm the shit!
The sun love me, I'm the shit!
The moon is jealous of me!

The rain is jealous of me!
EVERYTHING IS JEALOUS OF ME!
I'm THE SHIT!

Cause I'm the shit
Yeahhh, I'm the shit
When I stand up, everybody sit, I'm the shit
Asshole

[Break]

[Outro 2: André 3000]
Sometime I feel like the shit, sometime I feel like I'm shit
Sometime I wanna stand for somethin', then sometime wanna sit
Didn't really plan on cussin', but sometime it just slip
When you the mayonnaise and the mustard, you can't relish in it
And when them panties turn to custard, who the hell do they miss?
And when the nanny fucks the husband, what does she tell the kids?
That's a whole 'nother discussion, we can't fit in our kicks
That's a whole 'nother discussion, you can't fit in these kicks
Yeah
The way I feel tonight, I think I'll wear these shades for the rest of my life
Yeah
Yeah
The way I feel tonight, I think I'll wear these shades for the rest of my life
The way I feel tonight, I think I'm-a wear these shades for the rest of my life
That way, you won't be able to see the disappointment in my eyes
Cause they don't lie (don't lie), not to my eyes (not to my eyes, not to my eyes)
Nah, they don't lie (don't lie), not to my eyes, (not to my eyes…) un-un
(They don't lie, they don't lie)
(Not to my eyes, not to my eyes)
(Not to my eyes, not to my eyes)
(Not to my eyes, not to my eyes)

[Intro]
Okay, this is very simple
I come in, you take your clothes off
And I take pictures, m'kay?

[Verse 1]
She gets up and takes a shower
Now she's in the mirror for hours
By the way, she's a model of course
Here all made-up in make-up powder
Walking on the runway
But she don't know where she going
She just hoping that she keep rolling
Childhood broken, 10 years later now she's a ho
And everybody wonder, why does she act so cold
Cause all that attitude ain't natural
Leave that drama on that there door
Cause I ain't really into all that therefore

[Interlude 1]
Yes, yes, darling
You look absolutely magnificent on this wonderful and spectacular evening
But um, would you mind showing some more cleavage, would you then?

[Hook]
Watch her take off her bra
Posing like a star
Smiling for the camera, camera
Ah, she's a movie star
With that runway walk
Just smiling for the camera, camera, camera

[Verse 2]
She from a town far away
Then she moved from the A to go to Georgia State
And then she got turned out, then she dropped out
Now she's an actress who wants to sing
But ain't that pretty
She's just trying to mimic the life in the city
Trying to keep up with that limelight living
Just wishing for one audition and video position
But it ain't how she used to be
At 2 or 3, now she's a hoochie freak so
Now they wonder if you will see
Just a little old cutie with a booty, booty

[Interlude 2]
Darling, darling
Why the long face, why the long face?
Everybody loves you, girl
Everyone loves you!
You know, you're going to be legendary one day

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
She dropped out of school at 16
Anti-abortion, her dad is missing
Then she got her a job at Wendy's
Two years later, she's into stripping
Twerkin' that bunny
Just to make her some daycare money
And to pay for the rent bill monthly
Her son saying that ain't my mummy
But, but, fifteen years down the line
She ain't the same as she passed her prime
Now it's all gone down the drain
Say goodbye to all the fame

[Interlude 3]
On behalf of Worldwide Incorporated
I'm sorry to inform you that we will no longer need your modeling services, darling
That's the way the cookie crumbles
Stiff up the upper lip, hmm?

[Hook X2]

[Intro]
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh

[Verse 1]
Oh, I don't know, I don't know, oh, where to begin
We are North Americans
And for those of you who still think we're from England
We're not, no
We’ve been on planes and on trains 'til we think we might die
Far from North America
Where the buildings are old and you might have lots of mimes
Uh-huh, oh, oh
I hate the feelin' when you're lookin' at me that way
'Cause we're North Americans
But if we act all shy, it'll make it okay
Makes it go away
Oh, I don't know, I don't know, oh, where to begin
When we're North American
But in the end, make the same mistakes all over again
Come on, North Americans

[Chorus]
(Ah-ah) Oh, oh, oh, oh
We are North American scum
(Ah-ah) Oh, oh, oh
We're from North America

[Verse 2]
And all the kids, all the kids don’t wanna make a scene
Here in North America
When all your kids get to read it in your magazines
We don't have those
So where's the love? Where's the love? Where's the love?
Where's the love? Where's the love, tonight?
But there's no love, man, there's no love when the kids are uptight
Uh, uh
So throw a party ‘til the cops come in and bust it up
Let's go, North Americans
Oh, you were planning it? I didn't mean to interrupt
Sorry
I did it once and my parents got pretty upset
Freaked out in North America
But then I said, "The more I do it, the better it gets"
That's my North America

[Chorus]
(Ah-ah) Oh, oh, oh, oh
We are North American scum
(Ah-ah) Oh, oh, oh
We're from North America
(Ah-ah) Oh, oh, oh, oh
We are North American scum
(Ah-ah) Oh, oh, oh
We are North American

[Verse 3]
New York's the greatest if you get someone to pay the rent
Wahoo, North America
And it's the furthest you can live from the government
Uh-huh, huh
Some fat American Christians might disagree
Here in North America
But New York's the only place we keep them off the street
Ooh, ooh
Now, we can't have parties like in Spain where they go all night
Shut down in North America
Or like Berlin where they go another night, alright
Uh-huh, uh-huh
You see, I love this place that I have grown to know
Alright, North America
And yeah, I know you wouldn't touch us with a ten-foot pole
'Cause we're North Americans

[Chorus]
(Ah-ah) Oh, oh, oh, oh
We are North American scum
(Ah-ah) Oh, oh, oh
We are North Americans
(Ah-ah) Oh, oh, oh, oh
We are North American scum
(Ah-ah) Oh, oh, oh
We love North America

[Outro]
(Ah-ah) Take me back to the states, man
North American scum
(Ah-ah) Where we can be in any one of a million new bands
North America
(Ah-ah) Where the DJ gigs aren't as fun
Here in North American scum
(Ah-ah) But don't blame the Canadians
Look out, North America

[Intro]
Is it recording?
Somebody grab me a lighter
Desert swag
You think anything you want
More

They say they want
You gonna live your life
Maybe, (maybe)
They wish they could be living for you
Say that thing, (say that thing)
I’m happy that you made it
But really, they wish it was them

Damn, damn 

[x5]

Don’t come down
Keep your head above the water
And when they doubt
Keep showing them that you’re stronger
I smoke too much
I think I got a drinking problem
But if you were me, had all of this on your plate
Fuck would you do
I’ma be the same, I probably never change
Niggas think i’m new but I got years up in this game
Been doin' my thing, I’ve been here carving my own lane
I Been had all them cars, been had them diamonds in my chain
You say you want a rock star, super star
A big shot, well take a little time, a little patience, live a life
Plus I give all I got

[Verse 1]
I wish that we could talk about it
But there, that's the problem
With someone new, I couldn't start it
Too late for beginnings
The little things that made me nervous
Are gone in a moment
I miss the way we used to argue
Locked in your basement

[Verse 2]
I wake up and the phone is ringing
Surprised, as it's early
And that should be a perfect warning
That something's a problem
To tell the truth, I saw it coming
The way you were breathing
But nothing can prepare you for it
The voice on the other end

[Verse 3]
The worst is all the lovely weather
I'm stunned it's not raining
The coffee isn't even bitter
Because, what's the difference?
There's all the work that needs to be done
It's late for revision
There's all the time and all the planning
And songs to be finished

[Bridge]
And it keeps coming and it keeps coming
And it keeps coming 'til the day it stops
And it keeps coming and it keeps coming
And it keeps coming 'til the day it stops
And it keeps coming and it keeps coming
And it keeps coming and it keeps coming
And it keeps coming and it keeps coming
And it keeps coming 'til the day it stops

[Verse 4]
I wish that we could talk about it
But there, that's the problem
With someone new, I couldn't start it
Too late for beginnings
You're smaller than my wife imagined
Surprised you were human
There shouldn't be this radio silence
But what are the options?

[Chorus]
When someone great is gone, when someone great is gone
When someone great is gone, when someone great is gone
When someone great is gone, when someone great is gone
When someone great is gone, when someone great is gone

[Outro]
We're safe for the moment
Saved for the moment

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
Bang, my shit bang, it bang-bang
Bang, my shit bang, it bang-bang

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Yo, I guess I went commercial, just shot a commercial
When I flew to the set, though, I ain’t fly commercial
And the ad is global; your ad was local
When we shot it was a lot of different agriculturals
So I laugh at hopefuls; "Nicki pop!"
Only thing that’s pop is my endorsement, akh
Fuck around and I'll have to go and reinforce the Glock

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
Bang, my shit bang, it bang-bang
Bang, my shit bang, it bang-bang

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Yo, is it me, or did I put these rap bitches on the map again?
You mad ’cause I’m at the Grammys with the Vatican
You in the booth, but I'm who you be channelin’
Why they never bring your name up at the panel, then?
Hottest MCs, top five
You need money? I got mine
More knots than Eric on Basketball Wives
(Ya dig?)

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
Bang, my shit bang, it bang-bang
Bang, my shit bang, it bang-bang

[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj]
Ugh, I couldn’t do your TV show, I needed ten more mil'
Not ten on the back, I need ten on signin'
Give that shit to a wash-up, bitch, I’m winnin’
If I had a label I would never sign you, hoes
Take bitches to school, then I Columbine these hoes
I hear the slick shit, bitch, you washed
All you hoes cryin’—Christopher Bosh

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
Bang, my shit bang, it bang-bang
Bang, my shit bang, it bang-bang

[Verse 4: Nicki Minaj]
Ayo, now when I tell ‘em that it’s Barbie, bitch
Yes, I really do mean that it’s Barbie, bitch
Ask Mattel, they auctioned my Barbie, bitch
Raggedy Ann, could never be a Barbie, bitch
You at the bottom of the barrel, scrapin’
I’m out in LA at the Ice Age tapin’
I’m chillin’ at the top, I got ample time
Bite me—Apple sign, ha-ha

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
Bang, my shit bang, it bang-bang
Bang, my shit bang, it bang-bang (Ha-ha-ha, yeah)

[Verse 5: Lil Wayne]
Kush on my breath, cocaine on my tongue
Eat that pussy, make it numb, she can't feel herself cum
Got a body on my gun, fuck the world with my thumb
Pop a molly, smoke a blunt, that mean I'm a high roller
My ex wanna work it out, bitch, try yoga
Two hoes in the bed, tell them hoes, slide over
Excuse my French, two bitches and moi
That's a Nicki-Ménage à trois, ha!
Tunechi

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
Bang, my shit bang, it bang-bang
Bang, my shit bang, it bang-bang

[Verse 6: Lil Wayne]
Um, my shit so cold, man, it don't even stank-o
Destructive-ass nigga, watch me break the bank
Weezy F and the 'F' is for "Fill in the blank"
I say, shout out Mack Maine, backyard bully
And the weed purple like a black girl pussy
Word, middle finger on the trigger
Unh, so you know that mean "Fuck a nigga"

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
Bang, my shit bang, it bang-bang
Bang, my shit bang, it bang-bang

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
Bang-bang, my bitch bang, she bang bang
Well that's 'cause my bitch is Nina Ross
A-and she bang, b-b-bang, bang bang
She go bang, bang-bang, bang-bang
Bang, bang-bang, bang-bang
We bang, bang-bang
Bang, b-b-b-bang, bang, bang, Blood gang!

You see my closet, that's a ton of money

Word around town my niggas steady of flipping work
For what you heard, I grind hard
So every time you see me bitch I shine hard
Rolex, that's fifteen
Whole block, about ten beans
Infrared on the silencer
Disrespect young low I might silence ya
It's Soulja Boy in from the ocean
Gold on deck wiping Bentley slow motion
Middle finger to the fucking sky
I'm getting money, counting bread while I'm stupid high

[Chrous]
Fifty nigga, thirteen
Everybody smoking, more green
I mix that purp with them Beans nigga
I mix that purp with them Beans nigga
Fifty nigga, thirteen
Everybody smoking, more green

Fifty, thirteen, bitch
Purp with beans

[Verse 1: 2D]
I'm a pale imitator of a boy in the sky
With a cap in his head and a knot in his tie
I'm the light in the mall when the power is gone
A shadow in the corner, just playing along
I'm only laying in my bed, I'm rolling aside
But if I get a car, I'm hoping to ride
Because I know if I ever say "I'm leaving" to you
You've gotta volunteer, and you don't know what to do
You'd sigh

[Chorus: James Murphy]
You wanna do it, but you don't know what you're doing, baby (A-a-a-a-aah)
You wanna feel it but you don't know what you're feeling tonight (Alright, how are we doing?)
And if you're thinking that I don't know what you're thinking, baby (A-a-a-a-aah)
You do more thinking and I'll go out and make it alright (Alright, how do you do?)

[Verse 2: 2D]
I’m impregnable, incredible, and set in the quo
I’m a late in my rider, not a heart and soul
I got a Saturday night, and nothing is dead
And if I ever had to do it, well, you know I wouldn’t care
I just get down, I love when I’m seen
And if I wanna talk back, the message is free
Then there’s a fire, a ray, a knot in sight
And if you get my tip, you get 'em a lot
You get a heart, ache

[Chorus: James Murphy]
You wanna do it, but you don't know what you're doing, baby (A-a-a-a-aah)
You wanna feel it but you don't know what you're feeling tonight (Alright, how are we doing?)
And if you're thinking that I don't know what you're thinking, baby (A-a-a-a-aah)
You do more thinking and I'll go out and make it alright (Alright, how do you do?)

[Post-Chorus: André 3000]
Every time we try, we get nowhere
Wouldn't it be nice if we were just normal people? Yeah
Trying so hard to act like we don't care
But it's true, you do, nothing is left
So I guess I'm right

[Verse 3 : André 3000]
New word, onomatopoeia (Boom)
Quit acting like you don't wanna be here
Fuck around and get jumped like leap year
Glock in the glove make you really wanna leave me, alone
Get the fuck on, gone
Okay, okay, okay, back to the happy song
Rap ain't nothing but the art of talkin' shit
My girl look pretty up there riding dick
My plaid past, my solid future
Asinine ass and a gorgeous coochie
I'm an OutKast but you're into me
Summer got mad 'cause winter blew me
That Juicy Fruit, that splooshy sploosh
Generation X on bloopty bloop
Get duped, gotta get doopy-dupe
Everybody hit the floor, we through the roof
Like a chimney, I commend me
How come it be, some lame ass nigga talking about
"Ah, he don't rap enough"
But y'all rap a lot and I'm like "Wrap it up, hoe"
You ain't Scarface, you ain't Willie D
You ain't Bushwick, you ain't killin' me
Better play with your motherfucking momma
Bet you still stay with your motherfucking momma
Keep sleeping on me, I'mma rock my pajamas
In the daytime, I swear, I promise
Dare a nigga say something, tear a nigga face off
How come blacks don't play baseball?
Y'all white, know y'all can taste all
This fly shit, I stay finna take off

[Refrain: André 3000]
Do Ya damn Thing, Do Ya Thing-a-Thing
Do Ya damn Thing, Do Ya Thing-a-Thing
Do Ya damn Thing, Do Ya Thing-a-Thing
You ain't fresh squeezed juice, nigga, you that Tang
Do Ya damn Thing, Do Ya Thing-a-Thing
Do Ya damn Thing, Do Ya Thing-a-Thing
Do Ya damn Thing, Do Ya Thing-a-Thing
Wait, is you really Slick Rick? Nope, you Dana Dane

[Verse 4: André 3000]
Bet it up, head erupts
A lava language in a vocal volcanic
If it ain't fixed, don't broke it, don't panic
If it ain't this, it ain't shit, goddamn it
If it ain't this, it ain't dope, it don't flush
And if it ain't hip, it don't hop, well then hush
"Man they sound like-"
"Man they stole your-"
"Man they look like-"
Nope, it ain't us

[Refrain: André 3000]
Do Ya damn Thing, Do Ya Thing-a-Thing
Do Ya damn Thing, Do Ya Thing-a-Thing
Do Ya damn Thing, Do Ya Thing-a-Thing
Wait, is you really Slick Rick? Nope, you Dana Dane
Do Ya damn Thing, Do Ya Thing-a-Thing
Do Ya damn Thing, Do Ya Thing-a-Thing
Do Ya damn Thing, Do Ya Thing-a-Thing
You ain't fresh squeezed juice, nigga, you that Tang

[Post-Chorus: André 3000]
Every time we try, we get nowhere
Wouldn't it be nice if we were just normal people? Yeah
Trying so hard to act like we don't care (I don't care)
But it's true, you do, nothing is left
So I guess I'm right

[Outro: André 3000]
Flip the page, our days are revelations
Space is strange, doctor, I've got no patience
Oh, it's all a part of the process (Okay, okay)
Nothing's new, it's true, cool, I admit
Shit, I guess you're right

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Nigga like me be smokin' while I'm drivin'
Gettin' higher than the Bee Gee's, sayin' we both just stayin' alive and
Watchin' the time go by, climbin'
Told you I’d get enough hash, to make a mountain
And you could sit right on your ass, doubtin'
While I'm somewhere rollin' up grass, going up where the clouds is
Some niggas say they get so high that I ain't fuckin' wit' em'
I say if them niggas got that high man I ain't fuckin' wit' em'
Doing nothin' wit' em, rollin' up or puffin wit em'
Goin' on the road, doin' shows or gettin' ducats wit' em'
I been smokin' in my pictures since Myspace
You niggas extra-curricular, bitch I fly straight

[Bridge]
Some niggas try that shit for nothing, but I just tell em' to do what they do
(Do what they do)
So many niggas went down the wrong road, so homie you can too (you can too)
Just give me weed in my joint and I ain't need it for nothing
Homie I'm straight (homie I'm straight)
The same way I came into the game, If I'm ever going out I'm goin' the same way

[Hook]
All I need is Mary Mary Mary I ain't fuckin' with no other drug
All I need is Mary Mary Mary I ain't fuckin' with no other drug
All I need is Mary Mary Mary I ain't fuckin' with no other drug
All I need is Mary Mary Mary I ain't fuckin' with no other drug

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Nigga like me be smokin' while I'm rappin'
And my homies smoke like I smoke so we both just make it happen
Niggas sayin' they be smokin', they be actin'
Cause you ain't yet really smoked unless you smoked one with the captain
High as fuck, choked up in my cabin
Got some OG from a fan and it was rolled up in a napkin
So we Taylored, all my niggas smoke papers
Never smokin' that bullshit with them fucked up names and them flavors
I remember puttin' weed in my videos, niggas thought I was insane
Now every time I turn on a video, I see the exact same thing
Cause niggas ain't original, niggas ain't cool
You niggas ain't got it naw, you niggas just ain't you
That shit is a problem for a nigga who can't lose
Lil homie I gotta ball, its something you can't do
So suckas hate

[Bridge]
Some niggas try that shit for nothing, but I just tell em' to do what they do
(Do what they do)
So many niggas went down the wrong road, so homie you can too (you can too)
Just give me weed in my joint and I ain't need it for nothing
Homie I'm straight (homie I'm straight)
The same way I came into the game, If I'm ever going out I'm goin' the same way

[Hook]
All I need is Mary Mary Mary I ain't fuckin' with no other drug
All I need is Mary Mary Mary I ain't fuckin' with no other drug
All I need is Mary Mary Mary I ain't fuckin' with no other drug
All I need is Mary Mary Mary I ain't fuckin' with no other drug

[Interview: Rob Markman & Wiz Khalifa]
I think Kush & OJ obviously is the one that broke you
To the consciousness. So people expect that from you
So it feels like, almost, homage to that but next level
Like the beat by Spaceghostpurrp takes it next level
The way the Seldgren's changing the sound a little bit
Takes it next level production-wise
And then you take it, next level

I'm glad you fuck with it
And that's what it's all about
Taking it to the next level
Elaborating on what we've done
Because a lot of people
They've elaborated on what we've done

[Verse 1]
It's time the tale were told
Of how you took a child
And you made him old
It's time the tale were told
Of how you took a child
And you made him old
You made him old

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Reel around the fountain
Slap me on the patio
I'll take it now
Oh

[Chorus 1]
Fifteen minutes with you
Well, I wouldn't say no
Oh, people said that you were virtually dead
And they were so wrong
Fifteen minutes with you
Oh, well, I wouldn't say no
Oh, people said that you were easily led
And they were half-right
Oh, they, oh, they were half-right, oh

[Verse 2]
It's time the tale were told
Of how you took a child
And you made him old
It's time that the tale were told
Of how you took a child
And you made him old
You made him old

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Oh, reel around the fountain
Slap me on the patio
I'll take it now
Ah, oh

[Chorus 2]
Fifteen minutes with you
Oh, I wouldn't say no
Oh, people see no worth in you
Oh, but I do
Fifteen minutes with you
Oh, I wouldn't say no
Oh, people see no worth in you
I do
Oh, I, oh, I do
Oh

[Verse 3]
I dreamt about you last night
And I fell out of bed twice
You can pin and mount me like a butterfly
But, "Take me to the haven of your bed"
Was something that you never said
Two lumps, please
You're the bee's knees but so am I

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Oh, meet me at the fountain
Shove me on the patio
I'll take it slowly
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Chorus 3]
Fifteen minutes with you
Oh, I wouldn't say no
Oh, people see no worth in you
Oh, but I do
Fifteen minutes with you
Oh, no, I wouldn't say no
Oh, people see no worth in you
I do

[Outro]
Oh, I, I do
Oh, I do
Oh, I do
Oh, I do

[Verse 1]
I remember when rock was young
Me and Susie had so much fun
Holding hands and skimming stones
Had an old gold Chevy and a place of my own
But the biggest kick I ever got
Was doing a thing called the Crocodile Rock
While the other kids were rocking 'round the clock
We were hopping and bopping to the Crocodile Rock

[Chorus]
Well, Crocodile Rocking is something shocking
When your feet just can't keep still
I never knew me a better time, and I guess I never will
Oh, lawdy mama, those Friday nights
When Susie wore her dresses tight
And the Crocodile Rocking was out of sight

[Post-Chorus]
Laa, la-la-la-la-laa
La-la-la-la-laa
La-la-la-la-laa

[Verse 2]
But the years went by and the rock just died
Susie went and left us for some foreign guy
Long nights crying by the record machine
Dreaming of my Chevy and my old blue jeans
But they'll never kill the thrills we've got
Burning up to the Crocodile Rock
Learning fast as the weeks went past
We really thought the Crocodile Rock would last

[Chorus]
Well, Crocodile Rocking is something shocking
When your feet just can't keep still
I never knew me a better time, and I guess I never will
Oh, lawdy mama, those Friday nights
When Susie wore her dresses tight
And the Crocodile Rocking was out of sight

[Post-Chorus]
Laa, la-la-la-la-laa
La-la-la-la-laa
La-la-la-la-laa

[Verse 1]
I remember when rock was young

[Verse 1: DMX]
Y'all lookin' for names, I'm lookin' for beats
Y'all lookin' for fame, I live in the streets
Y'all talk the talk, but I walk the walk
School street, home of the brave, New York
Y'all make movies, but I make moves
Straight up, y'all got somethin' to prove
Y'all niggas duck, but I swing back
Y'all niggas run, but I bring gats
Y'all niggas whisper, "X is a crackhead"
Aight fuck it, I'mma just crack heads
I bang niggas that cross the line
Y'all niggas talk shit from way behind
I stand my ground, but y'all niggas don't
Shit I go to jail, but y'all niggas won't
Y'all niggas walk around and get scared
But I don't give a fuck, I don't care

[Chorus]
I ain't a dancing nigga, I just move to the beat
Sit there and nod my head but won't move my feet
Gangsta, so I'm holdin' up the wall
That dancing shit up to the rest of y'all
I ain't a dancing nigga, I just move to the beat
Sit there and nod my head but won't move my feet
Gangsta, so I'm holdin' up the wall
That dancing shit up to the rest of y'all

[Verse 2: Machine Gun Kelly]
Kells get it crackin', y'all play chess
Kells gets to scrappin' and y'all just flex
Why is y'all rappin, when I got next
You roll with them and I'll rock with X
Eastside motherfucka, Cleveland Brown
Burning leaves in the gutta, make it Cleveland loud
All I know is when the beefs on, the beast comes out
EST is in the buildin, we run this town
Ruff Ryders, you got a problem come find us
Hop up like the sand man right behind ya
Like where the cheese bitch fuck lasagna
Pair of shoes size bags, loot stuffed inside 'em
Grimey, bare hand, no tool beside me
I don't talk online, hater come here find me
Me against the world, underdogs new Rocky
Givin a fuck if anyone co-sign me likes that uh!

[Chorus]
I ain't a dancing nigga, I just move to the beat
Sit there and nod my head but won't move my feet
Gangsta, so I'm holdin' up the wall
That dancing shit up to the rest of y'allI ain't a dancing nigga, I just move to the beat
Sit there and nod my head but won't move my feet
Gangsta, so I'm holdin' up the wall
That dancing shit up to the rest of y'all

[Verse 3: DMX]
Y'all niggas is pussy, straight up ass
I keep that thing, and I'll blast
Letcha man know, he don't wanna push me
Remember, it's you not me that's pussy
Y'all niggas walk light on your toes
I come through hard, kickin' down doors
I spit a mean 16 without a pause
Then let 16 go just because
You in it for the dough, I'm in it for life
You in jail beatin' your dick
I'm fuckin' your wife
I bring the drama, I bring the noise
Kidnap yo mama, bring her to the boys
I make shit happen with one word
You take shit laughin' nigga, you's a bird
I take niggas for everything they got
That's why I'm the dog, and you not

[Chorus]
I ain't a dancing nigga, I just move to the beat
Sit there and nod my head but won't move my feet
Gangsta, so I'm holdin' up the wall
That dancing shit up to the rest of y'all
I ain't a dancing nigga, I just move to the beat
Sit there and nod my head but won't move my feet
Gangsta, so I'm holdin' up the wall
That dancing shit up to the rest of y'all

[Outro: DMX]
I ain't a dancing nigga, I just move to the beat
Sit there and nod my head but won't move my feet
Gangsta, so I'm holdin' up the wall
That dancing shit up to the rest of y'all

[Verse 1: MC Geologic]
Now we live from the side of the last of the four corners
Just short of the northern international border
Was born a town upon the pond that all the people call The Sound
It’s time to call ‘em out, you standin’ up or fallin’ down?
Saba dug inside a crate and Jake responded, he was on it
We interpreted the sample, canceled
The opportunist on the corner acting stupid
We plotting to take it back
The crying and dedication on Gentrification Ave
No imitation of way back, preservationist rap
We honor the past maybe to move it toward the future
From fresh tracks to Emerald Street, its foundation
And Mr. Anthony Grey paved the way and now we chase him
But they didn’t have the patience to place it as a priority
Herbs and haters never have served the greater majority
Words will never capture the glory of our story
Performing but never forgetting who came before me
In the Northwest, Northwest, Northwest, Northwest

[Verse 2: DJ Sabzi]
I’m from the city where it rains at
Where we bring the pain at
Put you lame cats where the lames at
We fly, we fresh, we hood
And in the Northwest, Seattle …
I’m good with that nonsense
See I’m on everything constant
So you better ask him who I’m is
The lost city is the last one standing
We came through the forks so the crown we demand it

[Verse 3: Kiwi]
The town is enhancing at the current date and time
And in the state of refinement definitive way to climb
When its sink or swim
You want to test us? Better think again
Going hard ‘til we reach the end
One day at a time I just move faster, I just move forward, I just move past ya
This is a new chapter from here on after
206, North by Northwest, we 

[?]

[Verse 4: Thig Natural]
I’m from the city of rain and we came to spit flame
But come equipt with many mix that could solicit your dame
I’m kind of sick with it mane
I’m from the city where you probably find ‘em twisted in chain
I keep it natural that’s the name
I love my town so damn much I never change
But I will speak to you through rhythms and over melodies
Travel the Emerald City with visions that you’ll never see
And clowns that front ain’t worth my energy
So here’s the remedy
Northwest, northwest, northwest, northwest

[Verse 5: Macklemore]
I was that kid on 23rd and Alder
With the ghettoblaster, got jacked, ran and told my mama
Came back, quarterback, playing Steve Largent
With lines and stay on your mind like Brian Bosworth
Aw heck no, this the best coast
Since Vita was ridin’ rays on the metro
One radio station they're really not playing it
We need Kube like we need to build another stadium
From Chop to Showbox to the spots that we playin’ at
We rock it like this rock, rock turn it hella quickly
There really isn’t anything that you could tell my city
The crowds gonna be like, “Oh wow, that was hella filthy”
("That was hella filthy, though")
I brought my shelltoes with me, long-ass march, but the clientele’s listening
Now while I’m at it I’ll throw in a backpack
Put the Northwest on the map, then go out and sell fifty

[Hook x2]
Anybody contest, North by Northwest
And it's still no rest cause we're not finished yet
We're broke, but not broken
Cold, but not frozen
Lost but not forgotten, we're kickin' the doors open

[Intro: T-Pain]

T-Pain, Justin Timberlake

Standing out across the bay of Massachusetts
And when I ask you for the time
Your eyes adjust to the way I shined your wrist, frio
Or I can see ya smiling, standing on your own island
Girl it ain't nothing to our man
To give u all the things in life that u miss, priceless

[Verse 3: Justin Timberlake & T-Pain]
Now I could put you in a town house
I could put you in my house
Yeah, knew she was a ringer
Had to ice up her finger and make her my spouse
I'm talking bout Timberlake here, you know
We’ll have the wedding in Jamaica
But for now, put your frame upon my frame
And if ya want to say my name
Ya know I'll make ya, say it
Cause you do it so good you make me wanna do it all over
Cuz baby your love is built like a drug
And I don’t wanna be sober, naw
Now I brought you in the back cause you need a little persuasion
Plus you need a little ventilation

[Intro]
What is this!
(mic check)
I can't feel my fucking face!
(I can't feel my face, bitch)
Ohhhhhhh!

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Louisiana live wire, New Orleans nightmare
Got these niggas scared, they growin' white hair
I'm from the swamp lil mud on my Nike airs
Stomp in your face lil blood on my Nike airs
Stomp in your face till your face says Nike air
I'm with my pack and we attack like bears
And we can go anywhere like air
Motherfuckin' temper shiftin like bike gears
Head high, I got the world on my back they told me I can turn around, but never look down
They told me if I shoot the AK I better aim down
They say even a train collision produces the same sound
I said, wow!
And I went and got two too
So you better be listenin' for that choo choo
Soowoo!

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
I ain't really the nigga you gon really wanna front on
I put your whole life on your front lawn, come on
Stunt on some shit that none on, gun on

[I can drive the whip and work the tooly whop with one arm](x5)

[Verse 2: Juelz Santana]
Big city terrorizers, you can bet some dollars (boy)
My guns touch kids like pedafilers
I stretch your mouth I'm the excersizor
Gun in his mouth like a breathalizer
Swallow lead saliva, you ain't straight I'mma 12 o'clock ya
Niggas pour cement on your body and cinder block ya
But I really think they shocked at how clear my rocks are
Why my neck look like shots of vodka (damn)
Them boys don't want it with me,(nope)
I'm on that rah rah, uh huh, they sweet like peach, cobla
My bills gotta be paid, my kid gotta get fed
So if a nigga gotta lay down I'm making his bed
So I hope he like his sheets red,(red)
Medium rare I hope he like his meat red, braaap!
You see my homies dressed in deep red(red)
They scramble niggas hope you eat eggs
Onefiftyfirst bitch!

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
I ain't really the nigga you gon really wanna front on
I put your whole life on your front lawn, come on
Stunt on some shit that none on, gun on

[I can drive the whip and work the tooly whop with one arm](x5)

[Verse 3: Juelz Santana]
They say God protect fools and babies
I'm a G, so I depend on my tool for safety
I roll on niggas like skate key
Skate broads, Tony Hawk on a skateboard
Who fucking with me?
With arm on the wheel, with arm on the steel
Could it be I'm crazy, Gnarls Barkley forreal
You play dumb and you lay numb
Face 

[flung?] like when 

[them bad?] demo tapes come

[Verse 4: Lil Wayne]
The world is so happy and my gun is too
So how I can take a life when it's dark in the room
When that means it's nighttime so I talk to the moon
And it tells me that I'm flier than the stars on a broom
Yes I'm wicked 

[?]
And I don't care what niggas say nor what bitches said
We like green all got a different bread
Push my eraser and I will give you lead

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
I ain't really the nigga you gon really wanna front on
I put your whole life on your front lawn, come on
Stunt on some shit that none on, gun on

[I can drive the whip and work the tooly whop with one arm](x5)

[Intro]
Weezy wassup with it bruddah?
Tell Maestro I need to fuck over his beat real quick
Hear me?

[Hook]
I'm the best rapper under 25, 24 inches on my ride
Ball like 23 and I shot my first .22 when I was 9

[Verse 1]
That's no lie, ho
Rappers out they mothafucking minds so I gotta go
Psycho on these niggas, call me Norman Bates with a poker face
Got the banger in my hand and I'm out to poke your face
.38 Special, grab it, let him have it, where the safe, we hungry
Housing authority saved my Section 8
My section be on the west side of Compton Cali, champ
Where the killers posted on the corner like a letter stamp
Let a rapper tell me I ain't better than whoever's out
I'ma knock 'em out his Force 1's once I air 'em out
Air jets flying 'cross the atlas, I made it momma, made a promise
Married to hip hop, and the maid of honor gonna be R&B
I'm fucking her too, so please hand me my condoms
Where the honeymoon in the mother fucking booth
You're fucking right, I'm the fucking truth
I put my hand on the bible
Swear to god if I lie, then I'll probably die tomorrow
Tell my momma don't feel sorrow cause her son was a gunner
They found my corpse with a rapper's head in my stomach
I'm right here, I ain't running even if the Iraqis w-was in back of me
Back against the wall I'm clapping them rapidly y'all
Would never stop what you can't see
It's like a red light when driving with Stevie
Wonder if you can understand or withstand the blast of my wrath
I steer the game with both hands while you crash
Like Earnhardt my heart to the fallen soldiers
You can either ride, or get rolled over
Sleeping on me, I put you in a coma
So please chill out before you meet the coldest
Starving every day, see my face where the bowl is
Bowl on my face, I walk while my mouth hold it

[Hook]
Hold it
I'm the best rapper under 25, 24 inches on my ride
Ball like 23 and I shot my first .22 when I was 9

[Verse 2]
21 gun salute
And my soldiers killed 20 of your troops at a time
And I got about nine teens on the corner fucking with marijuana
Jive and heard about 18 rappers say that a bird can go for 17.5
Motherfuck that my sweet 16's be equivalent to about 15 pie
I was 14 when I wrote a rhyme
All I seen was 13 ghosts every time I wrote a crazy line
All these 12 bars in my verses, that's what Notorious and Pac arrived
God dammit I spit just like a Mac 11 every time
I drop jewels, you drop dimes, you pretending to be like mine
I intend to put about 10 of you rappers on channel 9
Straight up, fuck around and get ate up
Cut 'em up in 7 ways, funeral carried by 6 in 5 days you'll know I go for
Money when I sink my teeth in Carter III beats
To you from me, my son the victory is mine, I won
I'm the one
The beat was the pussy
And I cum, hard

[Produced by Cool and Dre]

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
In due time I'm the modern day Albert Einstein
I'm prime time like Deion
And the rest of y'all is peons
I pee on the best
Whoever you are you can step
Like a prosthetic leg
I see monsters in my head
That's why I rap with such aggression
I tear down studio sessions
Rappers scared, they walk in the booth
With a bible and a reverend
I use my mouth as a weapon
Bullets rip through your mid section
Rat tat a tat tat tat rata tat tat tat
I'm a Comptown, nigga get a casket
Go against me, that'll lead to my advantage
Because I've got to eat
And for real I'm feeling kind of famished
Hotter than the earth core, don't show me where no fan is
Show me where your fans is so they can see the real
I'm sick and electrifying, that's double ill
Me feel like me will be a legend like Will was a legend
But I'm not an actor, put that in my will
Gimme a second uncut coke lyrics what I'm stressing
She want the raw so I fed her lines like Kevin
Tell 'em I'm a werewolf, behold the 5 6 bigfoot
Lear jet overlook the country like Garth Brooks
Lyrics on point, plus I got the right hooks
Like Tommy Hearns, punchlines burn
I'm not concerned about the SoundScan
Cause most of y'all is drowning
A lifeguard that's lounging
Meaning I don't worry about none of you rappers
I'm way more live
That's evil backwards
Now with that great word play
I tend to let my words play
Like children on a Saturday
It's sad to say you're not up to par
And I don't play with mini golf and sharks
Jump inside the pool of sharks, we're biting off your head, your heart, your legs, arms
Bled like Jay Rock or Big Wy
And make sure you wear a vest
Because they my family ties
Suit up
You got a three piece? I got a three piece
A MAC-11, a 9 mili, and a DE
He backpedaling like a DB
I'm such a Martian
Call me ET
Always behind it like I own the TP
I shit, fart, pee pee on anybody track
Walk in the booth and drink down a fifth of Ex-Lax
Wassup
Now phone home
My nigga Punchline is on, wipe 'em down

[Verse 2: Punch]
Your boy carry that flame I am a arsonist
I spit arsenic at you niggas cartilage
Ill wip, drive by, niggas carsick
20 on the charm
VVS studded flawless
Try and reach we specialize in garbage
Taking out the trash put you underneath the tar pits
How many times I gotta tell y'all niggas the big fish in the small pond
I wail on niggas I'm vicious
No, I'm serious
Skip the birth canal and climb straight Cesarean
You niggas ain't listening
I'm not from 'round these parts
I'm nonexistent
Hit you with brake light
Leave you missing
Shawty Make Me Feel Like We Fuckin On Tha Pill Shawty-Shawty Make Me Feel Like We Fuckin on Tha Pill

[Kev Tha Hustla]
So Baby Come Fly Wit A Nigga Who Space Surf

[Intro: Redfoo]
Sorry for party rocking

[Verse 1: Redfoo]
Yo, I be up in a party looking for a hottie to bone
I got a drink in my hand and they just called buffalo (Buffalo!)
Poppin' bottles in the house with the models in the V.I.P
All the girls make out for the whole damn club to see

[Chorus: Redfoo]
Let's go
People always say that my music's loud
Sorry for party rocking
Neighbors complain saying, "Turn it down!"
Sorry for party rocking
Haters don't like we got the spotlight
Sorry for party rocking
When they talk shit, we just be like
Sorry for party rocking

[Verse 2: Skyblu]
Baby, baby, baby, I'm awfully crazy
Off Ciroc, off Patron, shit whatever's tasty!
We don't got no manners hanging off the rafters
Let's go drink for drink, a hundred bucks she won't out last us
Check my style, take a good look, I'm fresh, bitch
In my whip with music so loud I'm deaf, bitch
Getting brain at a red light with people watching
Sorry for party rocking

[Bridge: Redfoo]
If you show up already toe up, this is what you say
Sorry for party rocking
And if you're blacked out with your sack out, this is what you say
Sorry for party rocking
And if you throw up in your hoe's cup, this is what you say
Sorry for party rocking
And if she has a hissy fit cause you're whiskey dick, this is what you say
Sorry for party rocking
Oh!

[Verse 3: Redfoo]
I don't give a fuck when I'm in the club
Sipping bub, really drunk, and I see a fat booty
Gotta have it, I'm a grab it, it's a habit, automatic like Uzi
Uzi with the sick flow
Make a chick go crazy and flash them ta-ta's
Redfoo, the dude, a true party rocker

[Verse 4: Skyblu]
I'm true to the game too
It's called beer pong and I can't lose
I got a bunch of bad bitches in the back
With Ciroc on tap and a little bit of Grey Goose, ooh
Oh yeah we killin shit
With our money we diligent
So here's a sorry in advance
No hard feelings bitch
Sorry for party rocking

[Chorus: Redfoo]
People always say that my music's loud
Sorry for party rocking
Neighbors complain saying, "Turn it down!"
Sorry for party rocking
Haters don't like we got the spotlight
Sorry for party rocking
When they talk shit, we just be like
Sorry for party rocking

[Verse 1]
I'm try watch my mouth, I already know what it is
Yeah the mental state of a young black genius conflicted
The fast life I done seen on the screen is addictive
Money and clothes I done dreamed about
And all the hoes that I thinked about
Ey tell me am I wrong for visualizing material things I never had?
Waving gats instead of flags, the American Dream
Why do we cling to the villians?
Knowing they killin’
My niggas high enough to swing from the ceiling
Ink from the pen spilling on my notebook
Filled with dreams, this is my hope book
Still the screams from little girls shot and killed fill my head on the daily
At times I question God can you blame me? They can’t tame me!
My voice screech through the street I'm a beast on em!
Oh no he will not fold, you will not see a crease on him!
He will not slip or lose his grip, they got them cleats on him!
But never will he run unless you call police on him

[Verse 2]
C.R.E.A.M get the money, dollar dollar billion
Cash rule everything around me, C.R.E.A.M get the money
Everything around me, C.R.E.A.M get the money dollar dollar
Look hey
I'mma kill the game and invite witnesses
No death penalty, I'm giving life sentences
Like keep grinding boy, your life can change in one year
And even when it's dark out, the sun is shining somewhere
Yeah, look here I pay dues
My own worst enemy so fuck it either way I can't lose
808's so my south niggas feel me
Light-skinned so the house niggas feel me
She catch me creeping out your house she'll kill me
Is it worth for what's under that blouse?
My heart'll turn pitch black and cold if I split with my girl
If I could gift-wrap the globe, I would give you the world
But, do you love me like you used to?
Even though I ain't that nigga that you're used to
Remember back when I was broke, you would fix me
Do you prefer the broke me or the rich me
The broke me couldn't buy you meals, not even a value meal
And now I pay for everything, how you feel?
Mixed feelings cause now all the chicks feeling him
You gotta adapt though I'm never going back
I said I'm never going back No!

[Verse 3]
Look kid, its raining outside boy
F--- an umbrella, man they banging outside boy
They guns'll dumbbell a nigga
Tired of telling niggas that's deceased, rest in peace
We tired of only having just a piece
And f--- policing, they killing brothers what's the reason
His daughter starving and she fucking freezing
So no wonder why he fucking squeezing
They out here bussin’ leavin’ niggas stuck and bleedin’ on the flo’
Bullets wet you like a semen on a ho
Breathing slow man, I'm in hell
One day you tryna make rent, next day you in jail
Lord knows he meant well
So I take the pencil and write like a pen pal
Some shit that’s darker than the tints up on the windshield
Welcome to Sinville where niggas on base
Shit is looking like an infield
High as a Sprint bill
What you think, that's the reason why this ink in my pen kills
Phoney niggas until they are extinct, boy I’ve been real
Westwood I said I've been real
One more again head down pussy poppin on a handstand

[Hook]
Head down pussy pussy poppin
Head down pussy pussy poppin
Head down pussy pussy poppin
Head down pussy poppin on a handstand

[Verse 1: Ludacris]
On a handstand
On my american banstands
Summersalts cartwheels bitch just keep on dancing
Chinese splits-splits slide on down that pole-pole
And feel this dick getin outa control-trol
Oh no keep goin till a nigga like me say stoooop
Let it kiss the sky and then make it droooop
Tuck and twist, it's your luck if you fuckin Cris
Im rubbin clits so stay in catch don’t try to duck and miss
(Bitch!) Do your stretches don’t pull no hamstrings
You got me movin infact your doin the damn thang
Stronger muscles exersize every body your body hurts
Lets do this sweatin thank God your bath and body works
I like a woman who makes her own doe don’t need a lot of help
But your heart’ll melt if I put a thousand in your garder belt
Lipgloss traces your pierced in 11 places
And your lips down town just made some familiar faces like WOAH!

[Hook (x2)]

[Verse 2: Shawna]
I'mma send a chapter to this pussy poppin legacy
Shawna be that Bitch can't no bitches come fuck wit me
When I pop that cris im on that business and bubbly
When im in that 6 wit 20s spinin on luxury
Cuz I got that head game

But don’t get me wrong now shawty gon’ let that lead aim
Better learn that game shawty
Better get yo’ man shawty
Foe he endup tamed and be gone all in the brain shawty

[Hook (x2)]

[Verse 3: Lil' Fate]
Every time we hit the club

Smokin' purple, pourin' grichi got everybody geeked
At the club 7 days a week find DTP off in this bitch
That ho! poppin dropin God damn shawty who is this
Redbone wit a scorpio tatted on her tummy
Im sittin slouched back in the chair stuntin waving money
And shawty start zig zaggin her derriere for me
A bowlegged throughbreded said her name was strawberry
Up her pussy she pushed in a whole bottle of Mo
Reached in my pocket grabbed a G and then threw it on the floor
Here u deserve this doe now jump on stage and work the pole
Face down ass up ho hands on those
Now pop that couchie you know the procedure
If you want this cash gotta make that ass shake like a seziure
Either Magic or Pleasers
Find me spending cheese up
Maxin out my visa
Trickin on stip teasers

[Hook (x3)]

[Intro (Spoken)]
I just wish we all understood... the beauty... of music

[Chorus]
Keep (Yeah!) your head (What!) to the sky (Uh, uh, uh, uh, come on!)
Keep (Yeah!) your head (What!) to the sky (Uh, uh, uh, uh)

[Verse 1]
When I think I don't deserve it, I think about Jesus
And the fact that he was perfect and he thinks that I'm worth it
I know I got a purpose, so when I don't like what I see in the mirror
I learn to look past the surface
Believe me God heard this, 'cause these words came from my heart
I was in pain, it was dark
Then came the spark to light down the road
To let me know that he would lighten up my load
And it's gon' get greater, later
God only wants the best for me, but the devil's a hater
I can see his eyes through the smiles of fake friends
If y'all think hate wins... just keep waitin'
At the end of the day who's will will you think will prevail
Or will you live to tell
Miracle after miracle it comes through
The spiritual individual is in you

[Chorus]
Keep (Yeah!) your head (What!) to the sky (Uh, uh, uh, uh, come on!)
Keep (Yeah!) your head (What!) to the sky (Uh, uh, uh, uh)

[Verse 2]
Lord if you hear me, You know that I'm comin' to You sincerely
I need You near me, please feel me
I'm sick and I need for You to heal me
I'm lost and lookin' for the real me, I'm tired and weary
Haven't been able to see things clearly
And even though I know You love me dearly, I still get leery
So where does that leave me? Lost and alone
I wanna call God but it's like I lost my phone
Every day is a struggle, 'cause I juggle my problems
Need to let go and let God, 'cause only he could solve 'em
I'm tired of lyin' to myself, thinkin' I could do it on my own
But when I get left alone
That's when the devil sneaks in and creeps in
Knocks on the door lightly then peeks in
And it's usually around the weekends
That I get reckless and jump off the deep end (Come on)

[Chorus]
Keep (Yeah!) your head (What!) to the sky (Uh, uh, uh, uh, come on!)
Keep (Yeah!) your head (What!) to the sky (Uh, uh, uh, uh)

[Verse 1]
Stoned on the stoop, got the box pumpin' Billy Joel
I'm Mickey Mantle while you motherfuckers semi-pro
Neck to colon how a slice from the machete go
Shoot your gun and throw confetti cause I'm ready ho!
Look in my eyes, you can tell that I'm a stand-up
Call me the teacher, wanna talk just put your hands up
We eat the lamb, duck, goose, beef or chicken
Two seater shiftin' with the smooth Cedar Strippin'
My facial hair is light red just like a ball of fire
Golden sound, blow the town, 'lo attire
Brown haze leather swampy like the Everglades
I'll switch a style so that I'm ready when the era change
First pressed virgin oil from the Greek Border
Spit the shit that have me laid up with the sheik's daughter
Three quarter on the Bally jacket to the knee
Lights flashin' when I'm rappin', tappin' tree
That smoke lingers son it shine through the curtain
Cracked pepper motherfucker I'mma grinder for certain
So never in your life come with scared business here
Fuck around never found bitch, disappear

[Verse 2]
Time after time I'm a winner
Seasoned in the barrel, harvest in the winter
Far from a beginner, keep an extra cartridge in the denim
Twisted off of Manischewitz, Harlem in a rental
The hash tanner than Connie, gorgeous
360 is the ways and the caesar's huggin' knotty flosses
Never stop until we hoppin out of grimey Porsches
One night shorty needin' over 9 abortions
I'm the whole shit, one you wanna roll with
When in canoe waving the ganja like a glow stick
Number one, numero uno with the flow shit
Your style is tired and limp just like an old dick
Bitch

[Verse 3]
Roman sculptures, all of my students hold a diploma
Stairs to the bath, garage door, behold the Lotus
Finest tuna right out the sea straight off the boat this
Hurricane rap spit tap low, rock a toga
Bronsonelli chef de cuisine I flex the two seam
Inject the vein with marijuana I'm a true fiend
Up-to-the-minute, all the weapons we invented
That's hidden inside the rented, the window tinted ten the percentage
Sacrificin' the lamb for the nutrition
"Criminology 101" hard cover, newest edition
Nuclear fission is heavy weighty top the division
Lots of provisions collosal status stoppin' collisions
Too beaucoup, fresher than a lake trout
Barbecue the venison, pair it with a great stout
Peace I'm out kid, a motherfucker pace out
Every time I take that motherfuckin' weapon from my waist out

Pulled up in that asphalt, fuck these niggas talkin' 'bout?

You talk shit, huh, nigga, we will blast you
Blast dude, and he ain't even worth it
Niggas talkin' but he can't check that we're fit
When I'm south side ridin', you see me
When I'm on the west side, posted on that TV
Niggas wanna be me, I'm movin' in 3D
I'm so swagged up, these niggas can't see me
Fuck what you heard, bitch, it's Soulja, I'm swagged up
50/13, KP, bruh bruh, what's hannenin'?
Tear it up, we smashin' the city, on beast mode
I pulled up in Maseratis, them hoes lookin' like he's on
Goddamn, she's throwed, ho hittin' my phone
But which phone? 'Cause Soulja, I ride around wit' three phones
Dope boy swag, swag out the asphalt
Them niggas keep on askin', I'ma give 'em what they ask fo'
Pulled up in a tour bus, followed by a Hummer truck
Followed by that Bentley, in the back of that old Hummer truck
Goddamn, it's Lil' Dre, chain cost one hunnid K
Fuck what you heard, I'm the sun, the one, mane
Niggas know I'm that nigga, I fuck around wit' them, doe
Gang pop up and make yo' clique take a swim, doe
Clearin' out the lobby, that's word to Young Lo
I don't move sloppy, killas in Toronto
Nigga hit my phone once there gon' be a mission
Mission accomplished, bitch, that's a ticket
Soulja Boy Tell 'Em, you know I'm on cloud nine
On the West Coast, they lookin' for us now
Nine on my hip, I don't slip, I'ma blast it
You talkin' that fuck shit, yo' body in casket
Soulja Boy Tell 'Em, 50/13
I fuck off wit' KP, we get green in between
These fuck niggas can't see me 'cause I'm so outer space
Bitch, I'm on Mars, I might fuck around, catch the case
I'm flyin' in my jet, doe, I'm flyin' in my flown car
Goddamn, it's Lil' Dre, so I'm like a movie star
My life is a film, doe, goddamn, I'm in, doe
Soulja Boy Tell 'Em, where is the killas?
Call up my niggas, they'll kill you first thrilla
We dump yo' damn body off up in that river
I came out the ocean, my third eye is open
Really, it's nothin', my whole clique is stuntin'
Ocean Gang, nigga, you know we get cash, homes
Hopped out the water, then I turn my splash on
Goddamn, it's Lil' Dre, double cup my Styrofoam
Everybody gettin' high, dirty Sprite, no Patrón
Fuck what you heard, bitch, my mansions are ballin'
Fuck what you heard, bitch, them girls keep on callin'
Fuck what you heard, Louis V on my wallet
Niggas, that's racks racks, MCM backpack
And I take off, shouts out to Jay Clink
We get so much money, fuck what them niggas think
Hit my phone line, they up on my timeline
You know that I do shine, you know that I do grind

[Verse 1: Kid Cudi]
Movin' wit out movin', Pure Crush Groovin'
Right on track, right on and I'm back
Rap Ex-Lax yeah, I be pooin' on 'em
Damn right, Mr. Cudi he be dippin' on 'em
Say it loud, y'all want the new-new
Explorer like Dora, that's how I got a clue too
So fucking underground, barely on Youtube
'Till Day N Nite, now they all got a clue who
Took me a minute man, took me a while
Hard headed nigga ever since I was wild, a child
But my ambitions made bitches beg for attention
DJ's un-mixin' their mixes, just to toss in some Cudder
And I tried to tell my mother
But she ain't underdig, figure me on some other
But see my mommy 'ain't a fronter
So nowadays she calls me a bad motherfucker

[Hook] x2
And, just when it seemed that the game is hopeless
We arranged some things for a dose of dopeness
I, I do, what I do
And, I, I do, what I do

[Verse 2: Ke'Ondris]
Kid cudi keondris is tha dopest
My selfish little buddy like 2 poke shyt
Like ford im focus
Dissapear like hocus pocus
You bogus I own this flow
You drowning in tha water slow fish
If you did every drug in existance you still wouldn't be dope so
Im so consistant I put my ice t in her coco
I thought I was tha coolest and tha coodest till I
I tried sniffing coke and got ice stuck up my nose
These bitches frooze
Female subzeros
Made her do a full spilt and the I told her pose
Jolly green giant
Fee fi foe fum
With jack bean stalk
Im about to beat up like a drum

[Bridge]
Niggas need to open they fuckin' minds, Nigga!
Cause this is some shit, that Ya'll niggas ain't ready for

[Verse 3: Kid Cudi]
Moovin' wit out moovin', Pure Crush Groovin'
Right on track, right on and I'm back
You make songs about some new dances
I make songs 'bout the black man advancements
I'm talkin' classic homie, I'm talkin' monumental
And I don't need much but Dot instrumentals
That's how I lay the stencil, me smilin' up out the window
I'm in the leaner dome, that's my crib on the moon
And I'm livin' in hotel rooms
In the mirror, laughing at my crooked tooth
How a nigga eat, is how a nigga speak
And how a nigga live, is sacrifice was big
And I'mma say it right before the hook
Maybe in due time, Pimpin', I'mma write a book
But now I'mma play my Andre 3000
And dream about an island wit model girls eyein'

[Outro]
Um... Hello...
Hey Baby...
Um...yeah
Some people call me CuDi
Some people call me Scott
It don't matter what you want to call me, as long as you call me something
As long as you call me, Baby
But Um...
You know...
You seem real pretty
And I ain't talkin' bout how you look
I'm talkin' about your vibe
Your vibe is pretty
But, I'm pretty hungry, you want to go get something to eat?
Sip on something?
Where we going?
The Moon...
La musica de Harry Fraud

Smoke something, biatch!

[Hook: Action Bronson]
Blow a kiss to my dick, wash my body with the sponge
Feed me Fla-vor-ices, put the chronic in my lungs
Tailor me a leather suit, on some Jodeci shit
Bi-coastal man, we both will﻿ be rich

[Verse 1: Action Bronson]
Leave the party with your daughter (little Debra)
In the morning do karate in the water
Hear sounds of samurais
Rockin shorts in the winter don’t fuck with splinters (rats)
Roll with sinners — A bunch of winners, catered lunch and dinners
Why my drug jar look so empty?
Drop a hook and then I’ll probably cop an M3
Long knife ('chete), that’s in the event
Somebody try to get me then to Heaven they’ll be sent
Oh, off the strength, caviar and Porsche taste
All the beans are gettin' Boston baked
On thin ice, I skate across the lake
With the CCM tacks, my feet are like Cassius
Smoke premium cabbage

[Hook: Action Bronson]
Blow a kiss to my dick, wash my body with the sponge
Feed me Fla-vor-ices, put the chronic in my lungs
Tailor me a leather suit, on some Jodeci shit
Bi-coastal man, we both will﻿ be rich

[Verse 2: Ft. Riff Raff]
Yo we 80,000 shopping malls but we ain't browsin'
Poppin' hood in Transco Towers
Prowler prowling Gucci towels and bathroom vials
Nouns, owls, Aston Martins
Sparkin' one in valet parkin', loan sharkin'
Hopin' that my days-don’t-get-darkened
Cheetah skin outside the parka
Propaganda propels us – ostrich feathers
Security guards with 9 berettas, pullin' up Volkswagen jettas
Causin' storms in sunny weather, in sunny whether, in sunny weather
Hopin' that my days get, hopin', hopin' days get, days get better

[Repeated Background Refrain]
A moon shaped pool
Dancing clothes won't let me in
And now I know it's never gonna be, oh, me
A moon shaped pool
Dancing clothes won't let me in
And now I know it's never gonna be, oh, me
A moon shaped pool
Dancing clothes won't let me in
And now I know it's never gonna be, oh, me

[Verse 1]
The sweet-faced ones with nothing left inside
That we all can love, that we all can love, that we all
Sweet-faced ones with nothing left inside
That we all can love, that we all can love, that we all

[Chorus]
But now I see you messing me around
I don’t want to know, I don’t want to know, I don’t want
When I see you messing me around
I don’t want to know, I don’t want to know, I don’t want to know

[Bridge]
Broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain

Broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts
Broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain

[Verse 2]
The pieces of a ragdoll mankind
That we can create, that we can create, that we can
Pieces of a ragdoll mankind
That we can create, that we can create

[Chorus]
But when I see you messing me around
I don’t want to know, I don’t want to know, I don’t want
When I see you messing me around
I don’t want to know, I don’t want to know, I don’t want to know

[Verse]
Wish that I could come out of your phone
Superhero powers
Burst out of the sand
With a bunch of flowers
And you just say the word
Apparition comes
With a long and winning
Handsome smile
Wish we could connect
Step into the void
Off the diving board
Blend into the light
Down the cable lines
Roll under the earth
Reforming on the wind
Two places at once
Taste the air with you
Undo all the ties
Wish that I could flip
One of those lies
Lift this all away
See that stretchy smile go
Right across your face

[Outro]
Cut a hole
Cut a hole
A hole
A hole

[Intro]
I hate gossip
And I don't walk around looking for it, you know?
But, yesterday it seemed to just
Wander around 'til it found me
You know like, the gossip found me
Then why don't try provin' it?
How? You don't know how to prove it?
Well, what you just do is, stop
(Streetrunner)

[Verse 1]
Stop hatin' on a nigga
That is a weak emotion, the lady of a nigga
And you can get tipped like you're waitin' on a nigga
Put a body bag and a apron on a nigga
I give my all behind the mic
But you can never see if you sit behind the light
And you don't have to pick me to win the title fight
But I'mma wear that championship belt so tight
And if I'm wrong, there is no right
And if I'm wrong, there is Snow White
I'm tryna be polite
But you bitches in my hair like the fuckin' po-lice
And my flow is rare, these other rappers nice
These other rappers bark, some of 'em even bite
But I'm much more bright, I give the game sight
So before you dim the light, you just might, might wanna

[Refrain]
Think it over
Ooooh, think it over
Think it over, baby baby (Get 'em)

[Verse 2]
Stop! Analyzing, criticizing
You should realize what I am and start epitomizing
Legitimate, I got the heart of the biggest lion
I'm confident, like fuck 'em all, pull out my dick and ride it
My flow sick, so sick, it's like my shit is dying
It rains a lot in my city because my city's crying
Because my city's dying
Still I emerge from all of that, I am a living pion–eer, near Zion
Fear God, not them, steer my robin coupe
Through the streets of the Boot, and soo-woo!
And then I leak blood in the booth, I leave a bloodbath
Sorry, there's a tub in the booth, now where the drugs at?
I'm twisted like the strings on a shoe, no, nigga, fuck that
I'm twisted like the strings on a boot, now where New Orleans at?
I feel hip-hop stole me like a bus pass
So in your possession, I-I-I must ask

[Refrain]
Hey, haven't I been good to you?
(Think it over) Tell me, haven't I been sweet to you?

[Verse 3]
Drag my name through the mud, I come out clean
Cast away stones, I won't even blink
A gun is not a math problem, I won't even think
Just leave you dead like the mink under my sink
Don't believe in me, don't believe me
I graduated from hungry and made it to greedy
My flow is like pasta, take it and eat it
But I'm gon' need cheese if I'm baking a ziti
You niggas want beef, I want a steak, and, uh, we be
Lost in Amsterdam or Jamaica where weed be
Hardbody nigga just takin' it easy
All about my paper, 'bout my paper like E-Z
Wider wrappers, why do rappers lie to fans, lie to rappers?
Lot of rappers lie like actors, cut the motherfuckin' cameras
Cut the check, nigga, fuck your props
And make it out to "Mr. Hip-Hop"

[Outro]
I'm not dead, I'm alive
Fifty nigga, thirteen
Everybody smoking, more green
I mix that purp with them Beans nigga
I mix that purp with them beans nigga
Fifty nigga, thirteen
Everybody smoking, more green (sushi)
I mix that purp with them Beans nigga
I mix that purp with them bins nigga

My nigga young low did a lot of stag
That louis brief case that's a lot of money
I hit the block with a ton of chronic
You see my closet, that's a ton of money
These niggas talking but don't know the words
What around my niggas steady of flipping work
Fuck what you heard, I grind hard
So every time you see me bitch I shine hard
Rolex, that's fifteen
Whole block, about ten beans
Infrared on the silencer
Disrespect young low I might silencer
It's Soulja Boy I'm from that ocean
Gold on deck wiping Bentley slow motion
Middle finger to the fucking sky
I'm getting money, counting bread while I'm stupid high
Fifty nigga, thirteen
Everybody smoking, more green (sushi)
I mix that purp with them Beans nigga (sushi)
I mix that purp with them beans nigga
Fifty nigga, thirteen
Everybody smoking, more green

If you standing on this earth bitch go to work (sushi)
In my turf we get in there first
Pull up, top off, her pussy get moist
She in love with the street nigga
And we in love with that beef nigga
Fuck, what you heard is fifty nigga
Thirteen fuck around and rip you nigga
My young nigga's getting in quicker
Gold on deck, Louis interior
Bitch I'm hungry I'm a take the pipe
Bitch I'm hungry I'm a break the block
Fuck what you heard bitch we going up
Niggas see my new chain start throwing up
Fudgy allow oozies when we rolling up
Promethazine nigga what we pouring up
Nothing but shooters when we showing up
Nothing but ocean gang throwed up
Fuck what you heard he's a little nigga
Fuck what you heard he's a little nigga
I get it in just might deal with them
I get it in just might deal with them
Fifty, thirteen, bin
Purp with them beans

[Hook: Peter Bjorn and John]
Do this thing, this type of thing
Put a little money in this type of thing
I've got nothing to worry about
I've got nothing to worry about

[Verse 1]
Speak in the third person, he don't like it when he overlooked
Last year he was a cook, always been a crook
Handing money out, his palms are feeling itchy
You still a bitch if you bitch, b
He make the paper, never made he, seat laid back
In a five wagon, champagne, eat off rap
Twin angels made of porcelain
Prayer scripted on the black Steve Austin shit
Yo, you lost it, kid
Call my Peter Luger Junior, keen shop house in shorts
Island hopping, winter time
Pad Thai with the peanuts and the bitter lime
And shorty will take a shit on the chest of any stupid bitch that you consider fine
He one of a kind off the couch
He piss standing up
He read books and write poetry
And he strong as a Samoan
Straight from Flushing and you know it, bitch

[Verse 2: Peter Bjorn and John]
Negative, why always so negative?
If you have problems, why don't you go solve them?

Bringing home the bacon, I'm fucking Miss Piggy
Loaded like a semi, sen' me naked pictures
She knows my dick, she call that nigga Richard
Prior to me coming, I had to stick my thumb in
Her ass one time, smell my finger make you vomit

Tunechi, coochie, that what she call it
Flag scarlet, I killed it, mournin'

[Hook]

[Intro: Rico Wade]
Man, the scene was so thick
Lowriders, '77 Sevilles, El Dogs
Nothing but them 'Lacs
All the players, all the hustlers
I'm talking bout a black man heaven here, nahmsayin, yeah

[Verse 1: Andre 3000]
"It's beginnin' to look a lot like" what?
Follow my every step
Take notes on how I crept
I's bout to go in depth
This is the way I creep my season, here's my ghetto rep
I kept, to say the least no, no it can't cease
So I begin to piece my two and two together
Gots no snowy weather, have to find something to do better, bet
I said subtract, so shut up that, nonsense about some "Silent Night"
I gots it crunk, if it ain't real, ain't right
I'm like no matter what the season
Forever chill with Smith
I sip my fifth, I chill with Wesson, got my reasons
So tell me what did you expect?
You thought I'd break my neck, to help y'all Deck the Halls?
Oh naw, I got other means of celebrating
I'm getting blizzard at HoJo, I got that hoochie waiting
I made it through another year can't ask for nothing much more
It's OutKast for the books I thought you knew so now you know, let's go

[Chorus: Sleepy Brown]
All the players came from far and wide
Wearing afros and braids, kicking them gangsta rides
Now I'm here to tell you there's a better day
When the player's ball is happening, on Christmas Day

[Verse 2: Big Boi]
Halle-lu-jah, halle-lu-jah
Y'know I do some things more different than I used to
'Cause I'm a player, doing what the players do
The package store was closed, okay my day is ruined
This is ridiculous, I'm getting serious, I'm getting curious
'Cause the house is smelling stank, the chitlins old as bitches
I made no wishes cause I'm mobbing folk niggas in the back
Getting tipsy off the nog and high as hell off the contact smoke
They having a smoke out in my back seat
They passing herb rewinding verses 'cause it's in the air
I hit the parks, I hit the cuts, I'm hitting switches
'Cause I'm switching from side to side looking for hoes and snitches
I'm wide open on the freeway, my pager broke my vibe
'Cause a junkie is a junkie three-sixty-five
It's just another day of work to me the spirit just ain't in me
Grab my pistol and my ounce see what them junkies gotta give me
'Cause it's like that, yeah
Forever pimpin', never slippin', that's how it is

[Chorus: Sleepy Brown]
All the players came from far and wide
Wearing afros and braids, kicking them gangsta rides
Now I'm here to tell you there's a better day
When the player's ball is happening, on Christmas Day

[Verse 3: Big Boi]
Ain't no chimneys in the ghetto so I won't be hanging my socks on no chimney
I'm fit as a tick, fix me a plate, I got the remedy
Some greens and that ham, not
Don't need no ham hocks, don't play me like I'm smoking rocks
I got the munchies, we got the Mary Jane in the Dungeon
Just to let you niggas know in '93, that's how we coming
So ho ho hoes, check my king-ass 'fro
The gin and juice has got me tipsy so, um

[Verse 4: André 3000]
It goes, give me ten, and I'll serve you then, now we bend
The corner in my Cadillac
My heart does not go pitty-pat for no rat
I'm leaning back, my elbow's out the window
Coke, rum and indo fills my body, where's the party?
We roll deep, we dip to Underground, see a lot of hoes around
I spit my game while waiting countdown
A five, fo', a three, two, here comes the one
A new year has begun, P-Funk, spark another one

[Chorus: Sleepy Brown]
All the players came from far and wide
Wearing afros and braids, kicking them gangsta rides
Now I'm here to tell you there's a better day
When the player's ball is happening, on Christmas Day

[Outro: Peaches]
Here's a little something for the players out there hustling
Getting down for theirs
From East Point, College Park, Decatur, Da 'Briar
You know, niggas worldwide
Down, for theirs

[Chorus: Sleepy Brown]
All the players came from far and wide
Wearing afros and braids, kicking them gangsta rides
Now I'm here to tell you there's a better day
When the player's ball is happening, on Christmas Day

[Intro]
Man, Beyoncé, I'm mad at you
Man...

[Chorus]
They say, "Hello" (Ayy), "Hello" (Ayy)
I can daydream about Beyoncé all day
Thinkin' 'bout the good times 'fore she met Jay
See ya know
They say, "Hello" (Ayy), "Hello" (Ayy)
I really thought I had a chance to be your man
Until I seen the video with the ring on your hand
It hurt me so

[Verse 1]
I remember you were sixteen on the TV screen with Wyclef
Were you my type? Oh God, yes, I was impressed
You was like "No, no, no," I was like 12 years old
Hoping that one day I could chaperone while you were on the road
You wore braids with a bangin' body
Look like you did pilates, a lot of sit-ups probably
But bump that, I was there from the start
Even when Latoya Luckett and that other doo-doo bucket broke your heart
Hope you didn't cry cause honestly they were just so-so
They couldn't sing anyway, you deserve to go solo
No disrespect to Kelly and Michelle, I'm just sayin' they cool
But you? You are somethin' like Wonder Woman
And I just wanna hold your hand, bring you to Compton
Gonzales Park, we can build castles in the sand
Eatin' hot Cheetos with pickle juice in it
Put that napkin down, you know I'll lick your fingers when you're finished

[Chorus]
They say, "Hello" (Ayy), "Hello" (Ayy)
I can daydream about Beyoncé all day
Thinkin' 'bout the good times 'fore she met Jay
See ya know
They say, "Hello" (Ayy), "Hello" (Ayy)
I really thought I had a chance to be your man
Until I seen the video with the ring on your hand
It hurt me so

[Verse 2]
I just bought the Sasha Fierce CD
Gazed at the cover for a whole 5 minutes, 'til my girlfriend hit me
She jealous of you, 'cause I don't love her like I love you
I even make her do the "uh-oh, uh-oh," just like you do
She tell me I'm obsessed, I tell her we connect
Like Ice Cube way before the Mac 10 feud
She's like, "You goddamn fool, that girl's rich and you're broke"
I said, "So? I'm only 500 mil' away, there's still hope"
Anyway, I had feelings even way before you got paid
And I didn't laugh when you bust your ass on the stage
And I salute Kanye for takin' up for you
I would've stole the award just to prove that I love you
But Jay should've did that I thought he had your biz-ack
What happened, Mr. Izzo? Hopico? Fredrico?
He used to be my favorite 'til he abandoned my diva
Now I tell everybody, Nas had killed him on "Ether"

[Chorus]
They say, "Hello" (Ayy), "Hello" (Ayy)
I can daydream about Beyoncé all day
Thinkin' 'bout the good times 'fore she met Jay
See ya know
They say, "Hello" (Ayy), "Hello" (Ayy)
Hopefully, I still have a chance
Maybe if I sabotage your man
You never know, hm

[Verse 3]
I'ma sneak backstage at a Mary J Blige concert
With an "I love Mary" shirt, then find Jay-Z
And push him into a dancer, hopefully, they lock lips
That's when I yell out, "Sounwave, hurry up take the pic!"
Put it on Bossip the same night, yeah, that sound quite right
Publicity like that? Yep, they'd be sure to fight
Better yet, I'ma steal her cell, then call up Affion
He impersonates Jay well, get Beyoncé on the line
Then make up some bogus shit, like, "You don't rub the back of my knees right
So this marriage is over with
And the ring that's on my finger? Guess what? I'm throwin' it!
Cling, you heard the sound, so you know I did"
Haha that should get 'em
That should break em up like a Kit Kat when I do that, yeah, true that
I'ma put the plan in motion, that's for sure
But if I end up with Macy Gray, this plan never work

[Outro]
Yee, man, I hope Jay don’t be mad at me 'bout this song
Start-ay, Wizzle start me back from like the first verse
Like right before I come in
Haha, what you say? Nah, you think it’ll be hot, for real though?
Nigga, you stupid, they probably laughin' as hard as you
Nigga got the best wife in the world and shit
Run that back, though

[Intro: Pitbull]
Hey Lil’ Jon, know we tell these boys
When they campin' out with the blunt, right?
We tell ‘em puff, puff, pass with your pussy ass
I said puff, puff, pass with your pussy ass

[Chorus: Pitbull]
I smell that sticky icky
Who got that sticky icky?
I got that sticky icky, icky, icky
I smell that sticky icky
Who got that sticky icky?

Who got that sticky? Me too
I smell that sticky, oh yeah
Who got that sticky? I do
I smell that sticky, oh yeah
Who got that sticky? Me too

[Verse 1: Pitbull]
You know the drill, break it up, break it up
You know the drill, roll it up, roll it up
You know the drill, light it up, light it up
You know the drill, smoke it up, smoke it up
Now, puff, puff, pass with your pussy ass
You fuckin’ up the rotation, that thang there burnin’ fast
This ain't a joke, stop playin’, I need to smoke
This thang can get dirty and I ain't talkin’ ‘bout sprinklin’ coke
I need that sticky icky, that Miami crippy
That Washington high purple, watch out that thang will hurt you
I need that Cali chronic, damn, a chico on it
Some of that Seattle supersonic
Will have you like Nevada want it fucked up
That’s right high as a kite
Now roll the next one and pass me the light
‘Cause we ready for sure
Ready to go. Ready to blow, let's roll

[Chorus: Pitbull]
I smell that sticky icky
Who got that sticky icky?
I got that sticky icky, icky, icky
I smell that sticky icky
Who got that sticky icky?
I got that sticky icky, icky, icky
I smell that sticky, oh yeah
Who got that sticky? I do
I smell that sticky, oh yeah
Who got that sticky? Me too
I smell that sticky, oh yeah
Who got that sticky? I do
I smell that sticky, oh yeah
Who got that sticky? Me too

[Verse 2: Jim Jones]
If thirty's the new twenty, Patron's the new Henney
Rollin' in new Bentleys, blowin’ like two twenty
That ain't the price of the car
Now that's a half ounce of piff, dawg
You gotta have a strong chest just to hit the raw
Or you'll be coughin’ up a lung
Harlem, where we from so of course we gettin’ drugs (twisted)
We hit the parties, poppin’ bottles just for fun
Smokin’ weed in your club, call the coppers, let ‘em come
Miami, Trey O Five, we cop it out the grovehouse
A generator so the lights don't go out
A big profit in that greenery
We not stoppin’ by the beach just for scenery
When here it's 45, up here it's 65
Meet you in Carolina, get it for 55 (We got them pounds, nigga)
‘Cause everyday we hustlin’
It's heavy cake and druggin’ it
So heavyweight we smuggle it

[Chorus: Pitbull]
I smell that sticky icky
Who got that sticky icky?
I got that sticky icky, icky, icky
I smell that sticky icky
Who got that sticky icky?
I got that sticky icky, icky, icky
I smell that sticky, oh yeah
Who got that sticky? I do
I smell that sticky, oh yeah
Who got that sticky? Me too
I smell that sticky, oh yeah
Who got that sticky? I do
I smell that sticky, oh yeah
Who got that sticky? Me too

[Outro: Pitbull]
Puff, puff, pass with your pussy ass
I said puff, puff, pass with your pussy ass
Puff, puff, pass with your pussy ass
I said puff, puff, pass with your pussy ass
Puff, puff, pass with your pussy ass
I said puff, puff, pass with your pussy ass
Puff, puff, pass with your pussy ass
I said puff, puff, pass with your pussy ass

[Intro]
Yeah!
(Her Hasselblad was on her knees) Two!
Yeah! Two-Up!
Uh

[Verse 1]
They call me young boy, young crack
Brought up where them slums at
Hustle, I done done that
Customers I brung back
Just cause how I sung raps
Some of them are slung crack
Slide 'em in my tuck, only some will let their gun clap
Me, I'm on a cash chase, I'm running where them funds at
Roll another L and put something where my lungs at
Money come in dumb stacks, niggas lookin hungry and they wonder where they lunch at
I already come for that
I ain't find comfort at, any spot less than the top
You niggas had it but ya records done flop
So I picked it up and ran with the rock
And I ain't gotta sing it on the cards for you to understand that I'm hot
I just face one, stand up and rock
I give my hat a good cock, to the side and do my damn Diddy bop
I'm the man to be watched, or the nigga to see
If you want it, then I got it, you can get it from me
Young

[Hook]
I'm doing my thing a young nigga tryna get his cake up
(Should I feel bad for what's happening)
Doing what you can't do so you niggas out here hating us
(Should I feel bad for what's happening)
I'm doing my thing a young nigga tryna get his cake up
(Should I feel bad for what's happening)
Doing what you can't do so you niggas out here hating us
(Should I feel bad for what's happening)

[Verse 2]
Should I feel bad cause niggas sold you a dream
Now Young Khalifa, I'm controlling the scene
I ain't roll with ya team, did my own little thing
Now the records I be making got me holding the cream
And I'm only a teen, got respect like a man though
But all the real niggas say they love how ya man flow
Love how I'm repping the Burgh at every damn show (412)
Sit back, puff on the herb, countin my damn dough
Smile in my face, doubt ya kid on the down low
They ain't believe it before, them fuckers now know
But now though, you see through like a plate of glass
Tryna hide, I see you with ya hating ass
I'm bout making cash, haze by the eighty bag
Me and Sledgren switch the swag just to make em mad
And niggas watchin my moves, so I'm make em fast
I'm first up, you out of luck, and takin' last

[Hook]
I'm doing my thing a young nigga tryna get his cake up
(Should I feel bad for what's happening)
Doing what you can't do so you niggas out here hating us
(Should I feel bad for what's happening)
I'm doing my thing a young nigga tryna get his cake up
(Should I feel bad for what's happening)
Doing what you can't do so you niggas out here hating us
(Should I feel bad for what's happening)

[Outro]
(Her Hasselblad was on her knees)
(Her Hasselblad was on her knees)
(Her Hasselblad was on her knees)

[Verse 1]
Tell me what happened to us?
Mishaps, the trust, the laughs, the love, couple things we ain't doing now
I hear you say you movin' on and you movin' out
Its like we been in jail, I ain't know you was out
Say you want some new shit, you chuckin' your deuces
I'm like "Who are you Chris?" girl, you know that's foolish
I feel the rougher we come, fuck it, the lovin' is done
Chuck it up in a bums bucket and cover with gum
Lucky I'm a rugged brother, feel like the lovin' was fun
Now it's done, send it back, give up and refund
See the thing about love is it comes when it comes
But when it leaves, it'll hurt like a cut in the gums
No jumpin' the gun, think you've paired up with the one
Until one day she had enough, it's fed up and it's done
So don't ever take for granted what your mind feel
Remember she can be the one but only time tells

[Chorus]
Said I'ma write it down, hopin' you reply
I'ma throw it up, throw this to the sky
Now it's floatin' up, look at where it fly
Look at who we were, look at who we are now
I wish we could fly
I wish I could take you up and fly
And this my notice to the sky
I'm just gon' throw it up and hope it lands in front of you

[Verse 2]
This is about us, this is about trust
This isn't about lust or none of that other stuff
This is is about truth, whenever truth occurs
Do you have the courage to tell the truth instead of words?
I dislike liars, I'm just like Mia, you get the best of me and I just might fire
And it's the main reason I can't give you all my feelings or nothin'
I feel like you frontin', I feel like you be dealin'
With somethin' that got nothin' to do with me
And look what you do to me, try to give you a truer me
But you was just foolin' me
I guess the fool is me and little foolish me
I was just tryina make it better for you and me
And what I couldn't see is that me and you
Will never ever be who we use to be
And I took for granted what my mind told
I had to sit and let it happen and only time told, Swavey

[Chorus]
Said I'ma write it down, hopin' you reply
I'ma throw it up, throw this to the sky
Now it's floatin' up, look at where it fly
Look at who we were, look at who we are now
I wish we could fly
I wish I could take you up and fly
And this my notice to the sky
I'm just gon' throw it up and hope it lands in front of you

[Intro]
Hahaha
Tyga
Put the headphones up
I need to hear that Boom
That Boom

[Hook]
I'm in a Range Rove
That'll make way, ho
Cuz you don't wanna hear
That LaLaLaLaLa go Boom
Bring the damn door
If the boys say so
Cuz you don't wanna hear
That LaLaLaLaLa go Boom Boom Boom
That LaLaLa go Boom Boom Boom
That LaLaLa go Boom Boom Boom
That LaLaLa {Uh!}
That LaLaLa {Uh!}
That LaLaLa go Boom

[Verse 1]
Main nigga
I trash homes call him may nigga
I mow hoes -- Take that clay off your face, bitches
I break the news like Sway, bitches
Get up, like sit ups
My swagga skate hoes, Give them hick ups
Beg to differ
Back to begging for pot stickers
I shot some shots you never knew existed, nigga
I'm Jiminy Cricket, These liers, they never wanna listen
Take her to Disney, bitch Minnie tryna act Mickey
I'm tryna hit like Griffey
I ain't looking for a queen like the nigga Simmey
Young King like Bibby
Plus of course I got my heart with me -- Duh I'm young Money *bun jumping and 100's bun beat bumping
Ain't saying nothing
Haters talking but they muffling
Damn Louis earmuff shits is so disgusting
No Muffin man
I stay in jewelery lane
I'm so Varmin, Doctor get the comet when I'm rhyming

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Like cartoons make the car do a U like horseshoes
Ahchoo!
Allergic to rules
I break threw like pimples
Dude, you ain't shit
Get the doo doo
Throw out your do
Wait for the nurse
It's just a little boo boo
Got a ghetto chick who love bamboos
Them little sandals that Jesus made just for you
I guess it's true
Can't be a player forever
Who fucking asked you?
I'm 19 -- Roaming
Living life like the Romans do
I salute absolutely you can guzzle Absolut
Yes I'm Chewbacc-o
Chachoo!
Sniff this crazy glue
Then maybe you can be crazy like me too -- There's a clue
I ain't tryna raise a little baby, I just wanna scoot
Fill up tour, with bullets to aim at you
Guns that's so dangerous I'd rather throw you to the moon
Tell the boys "I don't know what happened. Think his body flew" -- Welcome to my zoo
Tonight you're Tyga's soup and I got the flu -- Achoo!

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
OMG -- I'm peaking the Z
Mobile if the money is free
New York timing meets and Cali summertime, they adding me
Surrally, if this shit ain't free
I work for me and only me
You bitches looking kinda cheap
I'm only paid the finest fee
No buying
Big diamonds
Loves priceless
You hate me?
Bitch I hate not grinding
GED, SBQ, Gata, JT, Rail
No Arch right, Ronix, sorry if I forgot ya
Hell, your not worth it
Just affiliates like Drama

Shout out to Ben Baller
I'm up in Harlem
What up Teyana
Taylor, my off mommy suit, nigga
I'm just balling

[Hook]

[Hook:x3]
I'm a cigarillo fiend smokin' weed like it's oxygen
Roll a lot skunk, need some blunts, get two boxes in
Goin' to pull my stash, out rollin' out this half ounce
Puff pass, nigga I puff grass till I pass out

[Verse: 1]
Half pounds what I got to smoke up in some days
Yeah I choke up and get blazed
Eyes closed up and get glazed
I'll blow some in your face
But you ain't hitting nothin'
If I'm in here I gotta smoke somethin' nigga

[Hook:x1]
I'm a cigarillo fiend smokin' weed like it's oxygen
Roll a lot skunk, need some blunts, get two boxes in
Goin' to pull my stash, out rollin' out this half ounce
Puff pass, nigga I puff grass till I pass out

I'm smokin' good x7

[Verse: 2]
Niggas know about what young Khalifa into
Love to smoke out, a lot of reefer in him
Get you skunked out, you know I'm street official
When boys gotta problem, you should keep your issue
I'm from Pistolvania, where them heaters hit you
Out in California, where the weed official
And you could tell that I'm a boss
Don't really gotta tell you that I'm smokin' good, you smell it through the wall

[Hook]

I'm smokin' good

[Part I]

[Skit]
"Gina, baby, I don't have no money, I don't have no ends
Gina, I'm ass-out"
"I'm going through something right now!"
"I done told you that"

[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
Oh, what up ho? Oh, what up?
I said, oh, what up ho? Oh, what up?
I said, oh, what up ho? Oh, what up?
Well, alright

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
I'm going through something with life
But pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón, that's some great advice
I'm going through something with life
But pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón, that's some great advice

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Welcome to my diary, stressing got me gray hairs
Something to inspire me, rather than society's
Woes, let me go, let me shine a lil' bit, love
I want diamonds, too: Ronnie on Player's Club
I used to have a nine-to-five; fresh out of school—that was '05
That bitch was racist, got me fired; ever since then, I had no job
Pushing in my momma van, stop for gas on Rosecrans
Trust me, these niggas rushed me for something my cousin prolly did
Guilty by association: story of my life, nigga
You gon' make me flip and split your shit, judge give me life, nigga
Pain since my grandma's death, Uncle killed at Louie's Burgers
Hold my tears, I tried my best; let it go, drench my pullover
Cycles of a starving artist, tryna go beyond the margin— margin
Maintaining my modest— modest as I dream
So while I go through all this— all this bullshit, what you call it
Life itself, I know what helps, let me scroll through my Blackberry
("Hey, what's up, daddy?")

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
I'm going through something with life
But pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón, that's some great advice
I'm going through something with life
But pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón, that's some great advice

[Part II]

[Skit]
"So what'd you rush me over here for?
How was your day?
Are you tipsy?"
"Mhm!"

[Bridge: Kendrick Lamar]
All I need in this lifetime: Pussy and Patrón
Give me that, once you give me that, once again, it's on
Bitch, I'm swagged up, hoes bopping when I'm off that Screw
Coming down clean, tell your baby momma, "What it do?"
Where your friends at? I got long dick—what it is?
Go'n' poke it out, situate your little positives
How I live? Big shot, on my grind, already
I'ma lay it down like a carpenter when you let me

[Refrain: Kendrick Lamar]
Give me that funk
That sweet, that nasty, that gushy stuff
I can't get enough
If I offend you, blame it on the liquor, babe
Give me that funk
That sweet, that nasty, that gushy stuff
I can't get enough
If I offend you

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Ugh, I wrote this song when Dave drove home
And caught that flat in the mean T-Flats
And it made me think if we could blink
To change locations where we at
We often get lost in the alcohol bottle
In attempt to ignore pain, problem, and sorrow
Just for a minute, then back to the bullshit
Your car note due, and you 'bout to get evicted
Two drugs, surely, Patrón, pussy, make it feel alright
But once it's empty and that bitch leave, then it's back to life
You can't run from it, gotta run to it, nigga
The antidote wouldn't last, and you knew it, nigga
But still, you proceed to dive deep, ask what's her Zodiac sign

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
I'm going through something with life
But pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón, that's some great advice
I'm going through something with life
But pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón, that's some great advice

[Verse 3: Ab-Soul]
Okay, welcome to my diary—hmm, where should I begin?
Finna get a Swisher and fill it with at least a gram
Crackers watch my every step; man, I hate to work for them
One time, I tried to work for me, but that shit didn't work for me
And here I am, stressing, questioning my direction man
What to do? Nothing's moving, traffic jam, wiggle through it
Pop the cork and take the fluid, bust that pussy open
Bust that pussy open, bust that pussy open
(Soul!) Balls deep, you dig?
Retrieve relief, you dig?
Let's kill a bottle of tequila
And lie butt-naked telling the truth, would you?
What's up?
I had a long day, and I really wanna fuck
Take a double-shot to the face and forget about my whole day
'Cause all I've been thinking the whole day (Whole day, whole day)

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
I'm going through something in life
But pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón, that's some great advice
I'm going through something in life
But pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón, that's some great advice

[Bridge: Kendrick Lamar]
All I need in this lifetime: Pussy and Patrón
Give me that, once you give me that, once again, it's on
Bitch I'm swagged up, hoes bopping when I'm off that Screw
Coming down clean, tell your baby momma, "What it do?"
Where your friends at? I got long dick—what it is?
Go'n' poke it out, situate your little positives
How I live? Big shot, on my grind, already
I'ma lay it down like a carpenter when you let me

Southeast shit
It's a Carolina thing, from the 'Ville to the QC
All my niggas on Bragg, Bunce Road, to The Murk, Greensboro, Bonnie Doone, Eutaw, Winston, Cliffdale, Durham
Cole World

[Verse 1]
Visions of home, the streets that I roam, it’s been a while
Raise me like the father I never had, I’m still your child
And though I’ve grown in ways that you’ve never known
I’ve ventured into the world, I’ve moved out all on my own
I’m doing this all for you, I hate to leave you alone
Seen shit you wouldn’t believe, I write 'em down in these poems
And put them out for the world, I know you listening too
Heard you saying shit about me I hope the shit isn’t true
Man look at the shit I came from, this narrow point of view
How you hatin’ on a nigga that wanted it more than you?
I ran through them spots with you and fucked the same bitches too
And just because I ride with you, I scrap with them niggas too
Came back for them niggas too, ain’t no trappin' nigga, it’s true
Yet they play me on repeat because I rap for them niggas too
See I started with nothing but passion and then I blew
To the Roc, damn the top's a spectacular fucking view

[Chorus]
Visions of home, visions of home
Visions of home, visions of home

[Verse 2]
Yeah, visions of home, this is my zone
This is my joy, this is my pain, this is my song
This for my cousin Ricky damn nigga it’s been too long
Hate that my nigga Smitty slangin’ but to each his own
Gotta feed yo’ self, smoke a little weed just to ease yourself
Fuck the whole world, I don’t need your help
You’re the reason why momma had those rocks
All my niggas never even had no pops
Remember that? Ya remember that?
If ya don’t, double back
Momma found a much better crib on a safe street
But I’m still where the trouble at, where the trouble at?
That’s ‘cause my folks there, what it look like if I don’t go there?
I’m dead wrong, it’s been way too long, long
My folks there, what it look like if I don’t go there?
I’m dead wrong, it’s been way too long

[Chorus]
Visions of home, visions of home
Visions of home nigga, visions of home, I'm coming home, coming home

[Outro]
Yeah, Cole world
You know who it is nigga, Fayettenam, Carolina

[Intro]
And this is for the homies
I'm talking bout the swap meets, Rollie
Chain-wearing niggas with the white tee
Baby tell the truth, yeah you know we...

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Somebody get ready to pass me the hit of that endo, I'm tryna get blown
I'm tryna get turned up like the fifteens in my Cadillac Brougham
Looking for E.T. to phone home
Tadow, the flavor I kick reminisce the good days
Thinking back when we used to run in the swap meet for the Rollie chains
Pro Club t-shirts, whiter than Anglo-Saxons
Make it a 1X-Tall, crispy with the cotton fashion
That's fashion if you come where I'm from
Compton California, One love to the murder capital under the sun
Young niggas running around the street with heat bigger than me
But I don't trip, I still dip like salsa to a chip
Rolling down Rosecrans to scoop up my man, A-Mack
He talking about some foolishness on how we can pick up on some hoes, believe that
And so I scooped him round 3:30, Telling me it's all good
Tiger Woods, Now we looking for the birdy birdies
Stopped at the sto' to get some rubbers
Pulled up on the breezies, Well what do you know? I think they love us

[Hook]
And this is for the homies
I'm talking bout the swap meets, Rollie
Chain-wearing niggas with the white tee
Baby tell the truth, yeah you know we got it going on
And if you feel good (hey)
Raise your hands high and throw up your hood (hey)
Represent the city like you know you should (hey)
I want to make sure that you understood we got it going on
(Is that right? Is that right?) We got it going on
(Is that right? Is that right?) We got it going on
(Is that right? Is that right?) We got it going on
(Is that right? Is that right?) We got it going on

[Verse 2]
As I continue my day, quite copacetic
Headed to my momma's house to see what them greens are talking bout, hungry as hell
Had the right grub, I bail, need some gas
ARCO station on Avalon, a relative hit me up as he rolled past
We used to stand in line for Jordans, excited we got 'em
Rocking platinum FUBU jeans with rubber bands tied to the bottom
Throwback jerseys, Chamberlain and James Worthy was two of my favorites
I might pull out the green Larry Bird on special occasions
But anyway I'm steady coasting, smoking on that Hiroshima
Ashtray got a million roaches, I'm focussed but feeling good
The homies hanging on {?} and Monte Carlos
Impalas and Tahoes, shoot something nigga, break that fifty
I'm grabbing the city like I'm supposed to
Making my presence felt like Christmas day, what can I say?
Every vocal is spoken with the wisdom of a G
If you can't relate then please have a seat

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
So, wherever you located, won't you let it be known
And put on for the soil of which you was grown
I put on like brand new Chuck Taylors
While giving you cuts like fresh tapers
I'm such a fool with it, go nuts
You bullshitting like Tuck, the bounce then untuck
The bounce then throw up, a rare jewel, you duck
Take 'em to school I must, this for the cool in us
This ain't for you, so what?!

[Hook]

[Verse 1: R. Kelly]
We ain't gon' leave 'til 4 in the mornin'
Thousand dollar tab, but I can afford it
On my 4th drink but I'm not an alcoholic
Shorty say she want me, she way too scrawny
By 4 o'clock I might be too horny to go home lonely
I can't be lonely
Left the last club cause the DJ was boring
Came back, valet parked it and the valet robbed me
Nigga true story, and that was 12:40(am)
By 1 o'clock I was back in the wary
Tipsy, Ferrari, this Hennessy got me
Oh baby, I'm so sorry

[Hook: R. Kelly]
But if you're drinkin' what I'm drinkin'
Put your hands up in the sky
If you're thinkin' what I'm thinkin'
You'll say "what a crazy night!"
Way-oh, way-oh

[Verse 2: R. Kelly]
We ain't go leave 'til 4, maybe later
Track so funky, make you make an ugly face
Run that back, I mean start that over
Shorty get closer, hot like a toaster
Body so tight, like she walked off the poster
Kellz caked up, make her call me the baker
Man, he a hater, she gonna see me later
He got good intentions, but not enough paper
We left doin' 80, caught a flat up on the Friday
Headed back to the highway, think they'll stay at my place
Just so fucked up, man it's not my day
I need another shot of that Bacardi

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Rock City]
(Jamaican gibberish)

[Hook]

[Intro]
I made this one for your girlfriend
This one for your girlfriend, oh, oh

[Verse 1]
You gave him your love, your love, oh
Showed him something that he never had before
But he didn't want your love, your love, no
So you started over and you're on own
But that ain't so bad, baby you're in luck
'Cause it just so happens that I'm looking for love
So why don't we take a little time?
To see if it's for real, to see if it's right

[Chorus]
You don't need no money tonight
You just need to rock with me tonight
Girl, you don't need no man telling you that you can't
You don't need no one else baby 'cause here I am
You just need me girl, I know just what you need
I got just what you need, and I'll give it to you
I want you to see girl, I know just what you need
I got just what you need and I'll give it to you, you just need me girl

[Verse 2]
To pick you up and show you round
Whenever we up, baby, it's my town
I'm on the way, come on, get up
Took off my sweats and put up the truck
Throw on my Polo, pull out the drive
Step in your heels, put on a top
Get ready

[Chorus]
You don't need no money tonight
You just need to rock with me tonight
Girl, you don't need no man telling you that you can't
You don't need no one else baby 'cause here I am
You just need me girl, I know just what you need
I got just what you need, and I'll give it to you
I want you to see girl, I know just what you need
I got just what you need and I'll give it to you, you just need me girl

[Bridge]
I swear the world stops spinning when you're around
I take my time, every minute to love you down
Give me your smile and girl, forget how he made you frown
Take a chance girl, I'm telling you
That I could be the one for you
I'm gon' do what he can't do girl
Let me be you the one to show you love
Be the only one that you're thinking of
Love is blind so you can't see but you just me

[Chorus]
You just need me girl, I know just what you need
I got just what you need, and I'll give it to you
I want you to see girl, I know just what you need
I got just what you need and I'll give it to you, you just need me girl
You don't need no money tonight
You just need to rock with me tonight
Girl, you don't need no man telling you that you can't
You don't need no one else baby 'cause here I am
You just need me girl, I know just what you need
I got just what you need, and I'll give it to you
I want you to see girl, I know just what you need
I got just what you need and I'll give it to you, you just need me girl

[Verse 1: R. Kelly]
Now I can't leave this club without you girl
I swear I want more, you deserve an encore
Backstage, V.I.P., drop it, how it's rainin'
Won't you come and tell me are you wit it?
What you want girl? You can get it
These clubbers won't treat you like I treat you
Big chips, black hearts, you'll be my costar
Somebody sayin' you lookin' for me?
Girl, here I go
Look, oh my god, who do we have
Up in the club, dancin' for me?
Girl, let me help you chase your dreams
You're so beautiful
How can I make you understand that I want to...
Rub, I wanna touch, every little inch of your body
Girl, you *have* to come with me
You're incredible, whoa girl (yes you are)

[Hook]
Baby, see the exit, exit
See the, exit
Let's go, out this club
Exit, Exit
See the exit
Now baby if that's your man, forget it, go about it and dance
I really didn't mean no harm, it's just a player's charm in me girl
And I do it around the world, in every bar
Like a professor babe, Kellz gives sex seminars
When you walk by, so slow, make me whistle
You got pretty teeth
It feels so good when you're smilin' at me
I'm about to buy you everything
Baby girl, just leave this club with me
I got a big house in the mountains
Let's go, and I even got a stripper poll
Excuse me miss, somebody sayin' you lookin' for me?
Look, oh my god, who do we have
Up in the club, dancin' for me?
Why you upstaging these chicks?
Girl, you got the dance owned
How can I make you understand that I wanna...
Rub, I wanna touch, every little inch of your body (your body)
Girl, you need to go with me
It's the last call, alcohol, girl (yes it is)

[Hook]

When you see me
Two of us, your block, back of Maybach
Black shades on, down low in your hood
Smokin' on that good
Don't take a picture or autograph
Crack some jokes, make me laugh
Take some shots, baby now, come to my hotel
Girl I love the way you're teasin' me
You and your girlfriend on the dance floor
I'm thinkin' a minage tois
Won't you jump up off in my car?
Girl, it's so pretty
Leather interior, custom made for me
Let the top of that go back, then we'll pull off from the club *real slow*
So fans can take a pic
Girl I get a kick out of splurgin' on you
Nordstrom, Prada, Gucci, Fendi, Vicky Secret's too
Baby, sky's the limit where we go from here
Once we're in that Benz
Girl, take me serious when I say, I wanna walk out of here with you

[Hook]

[Verse 1]
They told him, "Don't you ever come around here
Don't wanna see your face, you better disappear"
The fire's in their eyes and their words are really clear
So beat it, just beat it (Ooh!)
You better run, you better do what you can (Ooh!)
Don't wanna see no blood, don't be a macho man (Ooh!)
You wanna be tough, better do what you can
So beat it, but you wanna be bad

[Verse 2]
They're out to get you, better leave while you can
Don't wanna be a boy, you wanna be a man
You wanna stay alive, better do what you can
So beat it, just beat it (Ooh!)
You have to show them that you're really not scared (Ooh!)
You're playin' with your life, this ain't no truth or dare (Ooh!)
They'll kick you, then they'll beat you, then they'll tell you it's fair
So beat it, but you wanna be bad

[Chorus]
Just beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it
No one wants to be defeated
Showin' how funky and strong is your fight

How many I told you's and start overs and shoulders have you cried on before?

But no more, if you let me inside of your world, there'll be one less lonely girl

[Bridge]
I can fix up your broken heart, I can give you a brand new start

Free to fall, she's free to fall, fall in love with me
Her heart's locked, and know what, I got the key, I'll take her and leave the world with one less lonely
There's gonna be one less lonely girl, one less lonely girl
One less lonely girl, one less lonely girl
There's gonna be one less lonely girl, one less lonely girl
One less lonely girl

So when I call you're just yelling at me
I'm sorry it's my fault
It's over

[Hook]
Now what do you keep calling for

Now what do you keep calling for
(What do you keep calling for, what do you keep calling for)
It's over, it's over
(What do you keep calling for, what do you keep calling for)

[Verse 1]
In the back of my mind I question why I keep calling
I guess I'm just used to getting my way I'm spoiled
I don't wanna be what you want me to be (don't wanna be)
So when I call you're just yelling at me
I'm sorry it's my fault
Oh, the clothes I bought you could still wear (still wear)
Did you store the cards and teddy bears (ooh)

[Verse 2]
Girl talking to myself in the mirror is strange enough (strange enough)
So you gotta know sharing this with you is painful, yeah (painful)
You know we used to talk about our future
It ain't just all my fault (I know, I know, I know we used to talk about it, babe)
So say goodbye to the way the leaves would fall (leaves would fall)
The way we stand in the rain and we would bawl (we would cry)
Just say goodbye
To the walks and talks and the dark in the park
And it ain't just all my fault (hey, hey, hey, hey)

[Hook]
Now what do you keep calling for

It's over, it's over
(What do you keep calling for, what do you keep calling for)
Now what do you keep calling for
(What do you keep calling for, what do you keep calling for)
It's over, it's over

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
We lost a four leaf clover
Don't ask why shorty be over
News flash shorty we over
We like Def Jam and Hova
We like Bobby and Whitney
Except without the kiddies
Like Pamela Anderson's career
Except without the titties
We had some good times didn't we
I know I won't forget that
But we had some bad times and
That's time I wish I could get back
We coulda had it all
But I guess we'll never know
You been around me long enough
To know that now it's over

[Hook]
Now what do you keep calling for
(What do you keep calling for, what do you keep calling for)
It's over, it's over
(What do you keep calling for, what do you keep calling for)
Now what do you keep calling for
(What do you keep calling for, what do you keep calling for)
It's over, it's over
(What do you keep calling for, what do you keep calling for)
Now what do you keep calling for
(What do you keep calling for, what do you keep calling for)
It's over, it's over
(What do you keep calling for, what do you keep calling for)
Now what do you keep calling for
(What do you keep calling for, what do you keep calling for)
It's over, it's over
(What do you keep calling for, what do you keep calling for)

[Outro]
Nothing we can do with it
So we might as well forget it
Like we never ever did it, oh hey
Nothing we can do with it
So we might as well forget it
Like we never ever did it, oh hey
Nothing we can do with it
So we might as well forget it
Like we never ever did it, oh hey

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
This is for the lovers and the sexy mother, mothers
Love is in the air, I pray to God I do not suffo
Cate, late night, lights dim, candles lit
She say Weezy fuck me harder, I say ooh, you the ooh
You commit, I commit, she say she love me, I’m convinced
Don’t need a rocket scientist to see that you and I are meant
I meant to tell you, you the reason I smile more, who I fell for
You know I beat that pussy up, Rocky Balboa
Girl I’m just playing unless you ain't and I can’t think
If there ain’t a thought about you, matter of fact that’s all I do
I put you first, now tell me that we’ll never be apart
Now I say, please girl don’t you go breaking my pretty little heart

[Verse 2: Robin Thicke]
Tell me something sweet, tell me something nice
Tell me something good, baby, tell me it’s alright
Tell me that you love me, tell me you’ll be there
I get so worried, sometimes the world will not be there
Tell me that I’m sexy like I was before
Tell me I got it that you want it even more
Tell me that you’ll never, ever, ever leave me side, side
Tell me cause you know I need to hear it every night

[Hook: Robin Thicke]
Baby you got me, don’t worry your pretty little heart
I said baby you got me, don’t worry your pretty little heart

[Verse 3: Robin Thicke]
Tell me who you with, tell me where you work
Tell me did you go out and start talking to some girl
I want to believe it, you know how hard I try
After all we’ve been through, it's so hard to say goodbye
Tell me that the future is getting brighter now
Tell me that we’ll make it, that we’ll make it somehow
Tell me it’s forever, that we’ll never part
Tell me that you’ll never break my pretty little heart

[Hook: Robin Thicke]
Baby you got me, don’t worry your pretty little heart
And I said baby you got me, don’t worry your pretty little heart

[Verse 4: Robin Thicke]
Tell me that’s the money, tell me I’m a star
Tell me that you’ll never break my pretty little heart
Say you’ll take me places, everything’s okay
Tell me cause you know I need that pump up everyday
Tell me that’s your money won't get in our way
Tell me that the chance I take, won’t blow up in my face
Tell me that you’ll do it that you’ll do it real
I’ll leave you if you break my pretty little heart, I will

[Hook: Robin Thicke]
And I said baby you got me don’t worry your pretty little heart
I said baby you got me don’t worry your pretty little heart
Baby you got me don’t worry your pretty little heart
And I said baby you got me don’t worry your pretty little heart

[Outro: Robin Thicke]
Yeah.. don't you worry baby
Don’t you worry, your pretty little heart…
Na-na-na, I love you baby!
Yeah, come on now; I got you, you got me
I love you, I love you, I love you baby
YEAH!
Straight out the dungeons of rap
Where fake niggas don’t make it back
Hey, hey, ugh
Gossip from those that barely knew my name
I guess they figured I changed with this new found fame
Or this new damn chain
I’m in a new damn lane
Now my money taller than Shaq stacked with two Yao Mings
But never mind them haters girl
I won’t bring you round lames
Rather bring you round Hov
Let you meet Bron James
Sit you up in VIP and let you sip Champagne
Watch them jealous hoes peeking
Mad they just can’t hang
If that's the ish you into
This life is funny cause despite the money
Nothing stops the rain from pouring
Life ain't always bright and sunny
Nothing stops the pain, you just ignore it
And keep fighting honey
So much drive, ain't no cop alive can take my license from me
I’m swerving on em, fast lane
Fayettenam lifestyle, foot down on the gas man
Passport tight now, I’m leaving on the last plane
Balling was my first love, so you can’t have my last name
I said balling was my first love, so you can’t have my last name

[Hook: Jigsaw]
Thrown round by the wind
Thrown down in a spin
Thrown round by the wind
Thrown down in a spin
Thrown round by the wind
Thrown down in a spin

[Verse 1]
These niggas hate me cause the streets ain't make me crazy
They raised me showed me how to win follwed in them shadows
Then I jumped up on my own two feet and made it happen
Figured out I'm makin rap and if not I'll take you clappin
See I'm on top of this art and on the blocks that I trout its hotter than hot liver than rock
Fiends jerkin they got product to cop the cops searchin for the product the rock
D in the coke purple weed in my smoke
The parks where they pump out boy
Only two fears god and them jump out boys
I'm really happy on blazed hat stay with a lean
Shot this shit with Big Tymers chick stay lookin mean
I'm in the coup flyin back throw the dueces to you losers
What you stupid I'm ruthless your dude is just a nuisance
Muthafucka when your top get blown and your shop get closed
Don't be so suprised told you guys that I'll leave them

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I move the music group next to me's a few of you
But technically ill to you dudes texas squezzin rugars too
I move the people one your not as hot as me no it is what it is I'm cocky but you can't stop me
Pistolvania bred flex the pistol bang your head
And if you trade some lead left in pistolvania dead
I'm still the same old guy spittin the flame
Whippin the lanes one thing on my mind and thats gettin the chain
My pops taught me well no way you can't prevail
If you got product and a plan then you can make it sell
So I took from that ran with it no lookin back
Coke up in my written when I spit it it get cooked to crack
I'm a have you niggas mad at the game cause I'm snatchin up all the paper smackin up all you haters
Scrap you a baller faker a motherfuckin clone
I'm a titan in the game Wiz Khalifa's to blame
I'll leave you

[Hook]

[Intro: Mac Miller]
What?
Ah, Jerm
Ah, Jerm, you shouldn't have done 'em like this, man
Hey, uh

[Chorus: Mac Miller]
The definition of cool: that's me, yo
Ask your girl about me, bet she know
I'm the future, you a fake, Miss Cleo
All my bitches bad like Shaq shootin' free throws
The definition of cool: that's me, yo
Ask your girl about me, bet she know
I'm the future, you a fake, Miss Cleo
All my bitches bad like Shaq shootin' free throws

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Hey
Ayo, first name Mac, and my last name Miller
On beats, I'm a monster, iller than Godzilla
Yeah, my skin vanilla, I'm hotter than chinchillas
Hittin' Vegas for the night and cop a villa
Get my lyrics from L, and my soul from J Dilla
Chillin' with the sour 'cause some smoke'll kill ya
I'm just mean, tryna cover all these magazines
And bitches tryna give me treats like it's Halloween
Lil' old school flavor when it's Jerm on the drums
Dodge the bullet points like it's words from a gun
Spittin' flames so they burnin' my tongue
Bitches wanna fuck, but they heard that I'm young
And they still do, I'ma stick around, call me mildew
Go and stay in Bel-Air like Uncle Phil do
Get rich, go and buy me a mansion
And get my parents a nice crib up in the Hamptons

[Chorus: Mac Miller]
The definition of cool: that's me, yo
Ask your girl about me, bet she know
I'm the future, you a fake, Miss Cleo
All my bitches bad like Shaq shootin' free throws
The definition of cool: that's me, yo
Ask your girl about me, bet she know
I'm the future, you a fake, Miss Cleo
All my bitches bad like Shaq shootin' free throws

[Verse 2: Diggy Simmons]
Jet Set general, roll like a innertube
Drinking on tiger's blood: that's what winners do
It seems as if you'd like to hang from my genitals
Whoa, pause, oh gosh
It is I, the D to the I, with the two G's
Like it's Gucci attire
Why? Don't ask why, you so inquisitive
And the shoes I'm wearing are only limited
My bad, was that a bit much? A tad
Didn't mean to rap, that was low class
Pardon my rudeness, that was so crass
And I'm always making moves 'cause I never procrastinate
The number one spot is up for grabs, too late
What was that question you asked?
What's the definition of C-O-O-L?
If you haven't gotten it by now, ah, oh well

[Chorus: Mac Miller]
The definition of cool: that's me, yo
Ask your girl about me, bet she know
I'm the future, you a fake, Miss Cleo
All my bitches bad like Shaq shootin' free throws
The definition of cool: that's me, yo
Ask your girl about me, bet she know
I'm the future, you a fake, Miss Cleo
All my bitches bad like Shaq shootin' free throws

[Outro: Mac Miller]
You ain't cooler than me, go get a job, bitch
You ain't cooler than me, go get a job, bitch
You ain't cooler than me, empty pockets
You ain't cooler than—You ain't—You ain't cooler than me
Haha, little asshole, got you so mad
Ugh, made 'em say, "Ugh"
Haha, aight, Jerm, you can cut me right here, brah
I'm done talkin' my shit, brah
Haha

[Verse 1]
Manic depression is searching my soul
I know what I want, but I just don't know
How to, go about getting it
Feeling, sweet feeling
Drops from my Fender's, fingers
Manic depression is capturing my soul
Yeah

[Verse 2]
Woman so willing, the sweet cause in vain
You make love, you break love
It's all the same
When it's, when it's over, mama
Music, sweet music
I wish I could caress, caress, caress
Manic depression is a frustrating mess

[Break—Guitar solo]

[Verse 3]
Well, I think I'll go turn myself off and go on down
All the way down
Really ain't no use in me hanging around
In your kind of scene
Music, sweet music
I wish I could caress, and kiss, kiss
Manic depression is a frustrating mess

[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
Graffiti decorations under a sky of dust
A constant wave of tension on top of broken trust
The lessons that you taught me, I learned were never true

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
Now I find myself in question
They point the finger at me again
Guilty by association
You point the finger at me again

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I wanna run away, never say goodbye
I wanna know the truth instead of wondering why
I wanna know the answers, no more lies
I wanna shut the door and open up my mind

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
Paper bags and angry voices under a sky of dust
Another wave of tension has more than filled me up
All my talk of taking action, these words were never true

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
Now I find myself in question
They point the finger at me again
Guilty by association
You point the finger at me again

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I wanna run away, never say goodbye
I wanna know the truth instead of wondering why
I wanna know the answers, no more lies
I wanna shut the door and open up my mind

[Bridge: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
I'm gonna run away and never say goodbye
Gonna run away, gonna run away
Gonna run away, gonna run away
I'm gonna run away and never wonder why
Gonna run away, gonna run away
Gonna run away, gonna run away
I'm gonna run away and open up my mind
Gonna run away, gonna run away
Mind (Gonna run away, gonna run away)
Mind (Gonna run away, gonna run away)
Mind (Gonna run away, gonna run away)

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I wanna run away, never say goodbye
I wanna know the truth instead of wondering why
I wanna know the answers, no more lies
I wanna shut the door and open up my mind

[Outro: Chester Bennington]
I wanna run away and open up my mind
I wanna run away and open up my mind
I wanna run away and open up my mind
I wanna run away and open up my mind

[Intro]
So many good reviews off of Bastard
I celebrated, getting masturbated by my pastor
Now he's in a plastic, on the kitchen table
Near a bowl of Lucky Charms and the newest Thrasher

[Verse 1]
When I say Wolf Gang, you say fuck that
Room full of wolves, inhalers and used blunt wraps
Fingers in the middle of bitches bodacious butt cracks
Enough fucking atheist rappers to get a nun slapped
Um, that's not a potato, give me my gun back
Before I blast bigger than pimples on Big Pun's back
Black fat bitches was washin' on my dishes
And using my large stick on her lips like my cum's chapped
I love Jews but I hate faggots
And bitches who be nagging about me taking the trash out
I got a fuckin' can of whoop ass, who wants to pack it
Going ape shit in the newest bape straight jacket
With six dicks of chap stick, sticking in my black lips
Six sippie cups full of sick shit enhancements
Wolf Gang spit right
Ain't been this much fuckin' crack rock music since free way had flip side
So get low, lower than a ditch
I'm with some retarded bitch, hoping she know how to kiss low
They know, I'm the clinic's aid and I'm sick
So they clap for me kinda like a herpe on the lip
With some tutor bitch, tryna tickle wetback hooter this
Bitch acting I still did not know with it
Until I put this cock on, the end of clitoris
Fucking this game I used this shit as spit as lubricant
So who you with? (Umm, fuck)
I got this fuckin' gun, you better say yes you stupid bitch
Before you lose your wrist and rich make you do some dick
I'm fucking crazy, well I guess I am if these shoes will fit
Fuck the Key club, they wanna ban 'em
I got fucking fans from Compton to Montana
To Indiana, where deaf dwarfs still don't understand 'em
Because yelling at midgets is like me beefing with brandUn (Fuck him)
Stomp 'em out, with these crab ass Nikes
Make it look like some slob, scribbled all on his white Tee
Invite me, come on, you got a better chance to getting Shake
My dad and Earl's motherfuckin' momma to like me (Bitch)
Animals is farming you, patrick this is barnacles
Said he gave Ace a spongejob at the carnival
And Spongebob got his head knocked from the piss that Ace got
Nigga's soft as baby cock and the cotton swab

[Verse 2]
This that fuck music, put your shit and fuck to it
Shouldn't give one when your bumping in the trunk to it
Grab a couple gats, stuff 'em in your backpack and then take 'em to school
For show and tell day screamin' "fuck students"
Locate the bitch that didn't wanna give you kiss
Then get her tits, then use your fists to add a couple lumps to it
Shoot the faculty for taking hats, you stupid butts
Skip the music teacher and the janitor you real cool with
Continue this procedure until lunch is through with
Go home out the back like a scared student
Keep a low pro, until you on your block
Then you just make it home in time for new news brief at 2ish
Stuck at all this bible study, shit is not fun
Me and wolf gang go jump nuns for hot fun
Playing with the bell when shots heard, and cops come
But I'm still punchin' this bitch out, I'm not done
Sittin' in my room masturbating
Truthful, these lyrics are relating like my dad did
I make music for teenagers and bad ass kids
Bastard touched more boys than your local church did
Killing these niggas off quick
Don't believe me then watch me empty out a full clip
Trigger being pulled, niggers in a ditch
That wasn't bullets, that was copies of Bastard you bitch

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
Why does it feel like night today?
Something in here's not right today
Why am I so uptight today?
Paranoia's all I got left
I don't know what stressed me first
Or how the pressure was fed
But I know just what it feels like
To have a voice in the back of my head

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
Like a face that I hold inside
A face that awakes when I close my eyes
A face that watches every time I lie
A face that laughs every time I fall
(And watches everything)
So I know that when it's time to sink or swim
That the face inside is here in me
Right underneath my skin

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
It's like I'm paranoid, looking over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
I know I've got a face in me
Points out all my mistakes to me
You've got a face on the inside, too
And your paranoia's probably worse
I don't know what set me off first
But I know what I can't stand
Everybody acts like the fact of the matter
Is I can't add up to what you can

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
But everybody has a face that they hold inside
A face that awakes when I close my eyes
A face that watches every time they lie
A face that laughs every time they fall
(And watches everything)
So you know that when it's time to sink or swim
That the face inside is watching you, too
Right inside your skin

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
It's like I'm paranoid, looking over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside is right beneath the skin
It's like I'm paranoid, looking over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin

[Refrain: Mike Shinoda]
The face inside is right beneath your skin
The face inside is right beneath your skin
The face inside is right beneath your skin

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
The sun goes down
I feel the light betray me
The sun goes down
I feel the light betray me

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
(The sun) It's like I'm paranoid, looking over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside is right beneath the skin (I feel the light betray me)
(The sun) It's like I'm paranoid, looking over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within (I feel the light betray me)
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
(It's like) It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin

[Verse 1: Hodgy Beats]
Carter Wong, bring the challenge from the eight masters
Hodgy Long one of them bastards that would head bash ya
Yeah, we Skate Mental, but the meaning of a Thrasher
Is to whiplash out and leave you pussy niggas fractured
I need meds from a mental institution
'fore my brain is revenged, free throw finger shootin'
Record them screamin, interwine them in a loop, then
Take the garbage out back, I pay the homage in fact
I'm throwing T-Bones to these wannabe me clones
And their wannabe me clothes, bitch I'm actually old
I spin ya like the cover we on, you're in between the pages
I'm 21 now been running these Fairfax blocks for ages
Organic for breakfast, free-ranging on stages
It's twelve-noon on my clock, engaged for 12 Gauges
I spit the plague, and don't believe it be a pagan
I'll send your wife dead photos of you taken by Sagan, bitch

[Interlude]
Oye pero ya déjame en paz chingado. No mas me están persiguiendo hablándome de una bola de babosadas como si yo fuera a saber lo que están diciendo. Yo no se lo que es un pinche "odd future." ¿Que es eso? ¿Que es un "odd future?" Yo no se que. Es eso pero vale mas que se vaya mucho a la verga con sus estupideces

[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
This that we shit hot shit, piss off custodians
Get rich and marry fat﻿ bitch Lamar Odiom
I’m rich bitch, and y'all's jelly as that jar of petroleum
That I had used when I eloped with him and 40 Mormons and
I'm planning on firing Clancy, ain't no damn controlling him, boy
You can't carry this, them Cannon Nickelodeon boy
My boy Domo higher than fat bitches sodium
And nuggets greener than the fucking can my Arizona's in
I'm sneaking in your kid's ear lobe "Oh, no! It's him! Goblin!"
Dropped like the soap in the tub
Now I have have famous friends who like coke and they're drugged
Dancing with me, Jerry Sandusky, and the Pope in the club
Jerry's trying to get a tug but it isn't paying enough
Now if he doubles it I'll tug it in the bathtub with bubbles
And a rubber ducky that I got on tour Kentucky with some groupies
Where I had got lucky with some sucky-sucky trust me honey bunny
If you fuck me you gonna leave with runny nose
I be running in these hoes ain't no condom on, fucking fuck, me

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
I am the son and the heir
Of a shyness that is criminally vulgar
I am the son and heir
Of nothing in particular

[Chorus]
You shut your mouth, how can you say
I go about things the wrong way?
I am human and I need to be loved
Just like everybody else does

[Verse 2]
I am the son and the heir
Of a shyness that was criminally vulgar
I am the son and heir
Of nothing in particular

[Chorus]
You shut your mouth, how can you say
I go about things the wrong way?
I am human and I need to be loved
Just like everybody else does

[instrumental break]

[Bridge 1]
There's a club if you'd like to go
You could meet somebody who really loves you
So you go and you stand on your own, and you leave on your own
And you go home and you cry and you want to die

[Bridge 2]
When you say "it's gonna happen now"
Well, when exactly do you mean?
See I've already waited too long
And all my hope is gone

[instrumental break]

[Chorus]
You shut your mouth, how can you say
I go about things the wrong way?
I am human and I need to be loved
Just like everybody else does

[Intro]
Yea Yea, uh
It's Carolina, nigga
Yeah
Ay
Fayettenam
Yeah!

[Verse 1]
Listen, alive and still kickin nigga
I survived the 'Ville
But a lot will not, so they wield Glocks and Bonnevilles
Niggas lying, still get high, they ride and kill
Money hungry, tryna find a meal
Can't stay inside and chill
Little niggas thinking "fuck school, I'm finna sign a deal"
Hunting hoes, trapping niggas
Lying like they on the pill
Preachers say we blessed
But all we feel is stressed, tryna deal
If this liquor don't help, nigga, this marijuana will
Roll up, I take a shot for them niggas behind the steel gates
My mind is still racing, I'm tryna kill snakes
'Cause niggas is fake, but wait, time reveals so
Nevermind, that real shit is what I am tryna build
It's kinda ill how I'm giving y'all that Carolina feel
A nigga so deep, you tryna find me dawg, you gotta drill
It's kinda ill how I'm giving y'all that Carolina feel
A nigga so deep, you tryna find me dawg, you gotta drill
Yeah

[Chorus]
Yo, Coming home, y'all
Listen
At any given time, got the city on my mind
The city on my mind
The city on my mind
I'm riding round feeling like the city, it is mine
The city, it is mine
The city, it is mine
At any given time, Carolina on my mind
Carolina on my mind
Carolina on my mind
Said "I feel ya pain nigga, but I'm tryna go for mine,"
I'm tryna go for mine
I'm tryna go for mine

[Verse 2]
Hey
Ay, fuck them hoes, let them bunnies be
Perfect vision I'm 20/20 for this money, G
See it's funny, you get that paper, then them honeys show
'Cause they know we finna blow, like a runny nose
Money goes, the money come
Barely twenty-one, I'm thinking big things
Momma in the mansion with the fish tanks
The Carolina way
If you in college then you know the crime won't pay
Lest you find a way, fuck what them niggas is tryna say
'Cause in Carolina, we thorough
My niggas hold it down all the way from Fayettenam to the G-boro
And up in Winston, and Raleigh, did I mention?
The Bull City got them ol' fake niggas flinchin'
Tar heels state, either you shooting or you hoopin' yo
Niggas can't wait for them Panthers to win the Superbowl
So shout out to them super cold niggas up in Charlotte
No matter the city, man, Carolina shine, regardless!
Yeah
Yo, coming home nigga!

[Outro : Deacon]
Riding big in an ol' school Chevy
With the windows down when I'm rolling through my city, like
Ooh!
On my way to meet up with a freak and my nigga drunk beating
She can hear me down the street, she like 'Ooh!'
Blew game and I do my thing
Ain't tryna settle down, I ain't shopping for no ring
Oh no!
Riding with my niggas for the weekend
Carolina sounds pumping out the speakers, like
Ooh!

[Verse 1]
The morning bell
The morning bell
Light another candle and
Release me
Release me

[Verse 2]
You can keep the furniture
A bump on the head
Howling down the chimney
Release me
Release me
Please
Release me
Release me

[Verse 3]
Where'd you park the car?
Where'd you park the car?
Clothes are on the lawn with the furniture
Now I might as well
I might as well
Sleepy jack the fire drill
Round and round and round and round and round and round and round
And round

[Bridge]
Cut the kids in half
Cut the kids in half
Cut the kids in half

[Outro]
The lights are on but nobody's homeEverybody wants to be a friend
The lights are on but nobody's home
Nobody wants to be a slave
Walking, walking, walking, walking
Walking, walking, walking, walking
Walking, walking, walking, walking
Walking, walking, walking, walking

[Verse 1]
Red wine and sleeping pills
Help me get back to your arms
Cheap sex and sad films
Help me get where I belong

[Chorus]
I think you're crazy, maybe
I think you're crazy, maybe

[Verse 2]
Stop sending letters
Letters always get burned
It's not like the movies
They fed us on little white lies

[Chorus]
I think you're crazy, maybe
I think you're crazy, maybe

[Outro]
I will see you in the next life

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
I woke up in a dream today to the cold of the static
And put my cold feet on the floor
Forgot all about yesterday
Remembering I'm pretending to be where I'm not anymore
A little taste of hypocrisy
And I'm left in the wake of the mistake, slow to react
Even though you're so close to me
You're still so distant and I can't bring you back

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
It's true, the way I feel
Was promised by your face
The sound of your voice
Painted on my memories
Even if you're not with me

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
I'm with you
You, now I see, keeping everything inside
With you
You, now I see, even when I close my eyes

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
I hit you and you hit me back
We fall to the floor, the rest of the day stands still
Fine line between this and that
When things go wrong, I pretend that the past isn't real
Now I'm trapped in this memory
And I'm left in the wake of the mistake, slow to react
So even though you're close to me
You're still so distant and I can't bring you back

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
It's true the way I feel
Was promised by your face
The sound of your voice
Painted on my memories
Even if you're not with me

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
I'm with you
You, now I see, keeping everything inside
With you
You, now I see, even when I close my eyes
With you
You, now I see, keeping everything inside
With you
You, now I see, even when I close my eyes

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
No, no matter how far we've come
I can't wait to see tomorrow
No matter how far we've come
I, I can't wait to see tomorrow

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
With you
You, now I see, keeping everything inside
With you
You, now I see, even when I close my eyes
With you
You, now I see, keeping everything inside
With you
You, now I see, even when I close my eyes

[Intro: Pharrell]
Yessir!

[Hook: Pharrell]
When lil' Skateboard came with them big-ass chains
Let's get right down to business
Them bitches like, "P, why you got that on?" (Hahaha)
I'm like, "Bitch, stay in your lane, and give a nigga brain"
Y'all didn't think this could happen, huh?
Everlast 'til the break of dawn (Gangsta Gri-Zillz!)
Well, let me tell you something!
When I pulled up in that big-ass thing that was white as cocaine (Matter-fact)
Backpackers thought my mind was gone (I gotta tell y'all niggas)
But when I pull, pull-uh up with the— ugh, up
The bitch-uh-bitches be, the bitche-bitches be like, "What?" (I'm a made man!)
Studies show... (Dramatic!)

[Break: Pharrell & DJ Drama]
Yeah, haha!
Wow
Yeah, niggas! You hear it right?
Wow
You hear it!
Look, Drama, man, come on, look—this my shit
They didn't believe us, P!
You know what I'm saying? This is my shit!
We gotta go all the way on your first mixtape!
You know what I'm saying? This is MY shit! MY shit, niggas! MY shit! Take this shit back!
So we not gon' do nothing but heat-rocks!
Listen! Listen to what's happening right now!
They listening! They ain't got no fucking choice!
Listen to what's happening!
Ill!
Watch this
Oh!

[Hook: Pharrell & DJ Drama]
Yo, when lil' Skateboard came with them big-ass chains (Now y'all ready?)
Them bitches like, "P, why you got that on?"
I'm like, "Bitch, stay in your lane, and give a nigga brain" (I'm in my lane!)
Everlast 'til the break of dawn (Cannon!)
When I pulled up in that big-ass thing that was white as cocaine (AMG!)
Backpackers thought my mind was gone (BBCIceCream.com! Tr—Trendsetter!)
But when I pull, pull-uh up with the— ugh, up
The bitch-uh-bitches be, the bitche-bitches be like, "What?"
(DJ the fuck Drama! Skateboard P!)

[Verse 1 (false start): Pharrell]
Studies show that eyes get damaged (Dramatic!)
When you stare into the ultraviolet rays— be like, "what?" (Dramatic, nigga! Haha!)
Studies show that eyes get damaged
When you stare into the ultraviolet rays— be like, what?" (Gangsta— Gangsta Gri-Zillz!)

[Verse 1: Pharrell]
Studies show that eyes get damaged
When you stare into the ultraviolet rays in the ears
And the ears through the glass of my Rolls Ruh—
C-E, that smells like the potpou-
'Pourri provided by my chauffeur (Dr—Dramatic!)
The chains is flooded, the dames, they love it
The rock so big, I'm amazed, but it's strange they cut it
The belt-buckle frames is smothered (Ugh)
Don't look too long, you might get "what?"-ed
Once they scream "What?" (Gangsta!)
Then, they grab the gun by the butt
Squeeze the dick—once it go "click"
Open your shit, now the back of your shit open (Ugh)
The front of your shit got a hole that's smoking
"Father forgive me, I'm sorry, another idiot croaking"
"9-1-1, what's the emergency?"
Now, they rushing that ass to get that surgery
You wanted to have it your way like Burger King
Flame-broiled, broil-flamed (Gangsta!)
The royal brain is ignoring you lames
Don't make no comparisons, we ain't sort of the same
Look at your wallets—we ain't sort of the same
Your rocks is treated—that ain't sort-of the chain
Better go to the back of The Source and order again (Uh-huh)
Lyrically, I'm XXL, I drove you home
The bracelet got a Vibe when I'm holding the phone
When I wave, bitches call me Rolling Stones

[Hook: Pharrell]
Yo, when lil' Skateboard came with them big-ass chains
Them bitches like, "P, why you got that on?" (The Aphilliates, nigga, pay attention!)
I'm like, "Bitch, stay in your lane, and give a nigga brain"
Everlast 'til the break of dawn (Dr—Dr—Dr—Dramatic!)
When I pulled up in that big-ass thing that was white as cocaine
Backpackers thought my mind was gone
But when I pull, pull-uh up with the— ugh, up
The bitch-uh-bitches be, the bitche-bitches be like, "What?" (Gangsta!)

[Verse 2: Pharrell]
Yo, I overlook the whole city with a nice, clear view
You trying to call your bitch that's pretty, but she can't hear you
She arguing with my doorman tryna get upstairs
Describing the prototypes to my Icy Airs
The Ice Creams make all the bitches want to fuck
Plus, the black card is something like an armored truck
Parking lot—see, it's a art to "hot"
You know who's who, when who's quiet, and who talks a lot
See, there's money machines and those who spark it, not
Those be the type of niggas left in the dark to rot (Gangsta!)
I greens marks the pop-ular; then, I get new cars
That's protected by Rugers that'll shoot you
Alternate your future, quicker than the Wu-Tang bu-tar 

[?]
Bitches see my face and say, "Me gusta"
Mama used to drive a Cougar
But now, I drive horses with Italian names
Equipped with a bitch with a nice stallion frame
She half-Haitian, call her Geneviéve and shit
"C'est pas c'est, tout n'est," like she Clef and shit
She respect my dick, like it's break-fer-ast
She's insecure; her girl wanna get with this
The expresséd bliss of what I'm blessed with
When I finger-fuck the track, it caress the gift
If you study my mixtape, you'll see what my method is

[Hook: Pharrell]
When lil' Skateboard came with them big-ass chains
Them bitches like, "P, why you got that on?"
I'm like, "Bitch, stay in your lane, and give a nigga brain"
Everlast 'til the break of dawn (Gangsta!)
When I pulled up in that big-ass thing that was white as cocaine
Backpackers thought my mind was gone...

[Instrumental Intro - 0:00-1:12]

[Verse 1]
Then, as it was, then again it will be
And though the course may change sometimes
Rivers always reach the sea
Flying skies of fortune, each a separate way
On the wings of maybe, downing birds of prey
Kind of makes me feel sometimes, didn’t have to go
But as the eagle leaves the nest, got so far to go

[Hook]
Changes fill my time, baby, that's all right with me
In the midst I think of you, and how it used to be

[Guitar Solo - 2:30-3:19]

[Verse 2]
Did you ever really need somebody
And really need 'em bad?
Did you ever really want somebody
The best love you ever had?
Do you ever remember me, baby?
Did it feel so good?
'Cause it was just the first time
And you knew you would

[Instrumental Bridge - 3:43-4:22]

[Verse 3]
Through the eyes and I sparkle, senses growing keen
Taste your love along the way, see your feathers preen
Kind of makes me feel sometimes, didn't have to grow
We are eagles of one nest, the nest is in our soul

[Hook]
Vixen in my dreams, with great surprise to me
Never thought I'd see your face the way it used to be
Oh darling, oh darling
Oh, oh darling, oh yeah, oh darling

[Outro]
I'm never going to leave you
I'm never going to leave
Holding on, ten years gone
Ten years gone, holding on, ten years gone
I'm never, I'm never
Oooh, yeah...

[Verse 1]
A friend indeed
Feeling like Cee Lo Green
Middle finger in the sky
Meditate and let it ride
Rock-a-bye beddy-bye
A friend indeed
More than jimming to
More than giving you
No prohibits to
You can have a listen too
I couldn't find no one else that I could give it to
And now that we on
I could put my family in a brand new home
My kids is grown
And I'm still rocking on the microphone
People love me everywhere
And I know why
It's not that I'm dope and my style is so fly
James Brown sat me down in a chair
And said, "Snoopy, don't you ever cut your hair"
I was dazed and amazed
That's why I keep my shit in ponytails or either braids
When I was in school, I used to get cool grades
When I graduated, used to smoke two jays
With a fifth of Seagrams
Mixed with some sacco
Then I got a Caddy sack, just like them vatos
Posted up six-one, yeah, that's the block though
Ride by slow and get your ass popped, though
Me and Geeda, Faith and Terry, that's when rump was enough
Can't forget Tim, Baby Dog and Half-Dead
Dre-Loc was a 20 Crip that showed me a lot of shit
But moving along, I went from a Camaro to a Fleetwood Brougham
My sack in the back
My strap in my lap
Room to the back
Rolling through the neighborhood, checking my traps
As you get old, life like just might unfold
Can't settle, this might be untold
Twilight Zone, live life long
Smoke you a bone, and hit you a blunt
Buy you a zo', and roll you a jay
And put it in the E-I
And let's stay way fucked up til we D-I
All in together now if you agree
And lighters in the air, repeat after me
I’m too blowed, forever in a day
I love for oh's so
Cause everybody green ain't dro
Everybody can't smoke like we smoke
Give a dog a bone
I like trees that cypress hills grow
Roll up this shit, pimpin', it's on
Stoners worldwide singing this song

[Intro]
"Boarding completed I'd like to welcome you aboard flight number F2B3
Our scheduled flying time will be four hours and twenty minutes
And we will be cruising at an altitude of thirty-three-thousand feet
At this time we would like to acquaint you with some of the features
Relax and breathe normally"

[Verse 1]
Uh, coming down like I'm uphill
Hogging both lanes better than a bus will
She tell me that my head bigger than a bus wheel
But it don't matter cause she still gon' let me fuck still
I mix a little bit of Kendrick with some L.A. weather
Then step out like Chicago in its finest era
You niggas begging for attention, doing extra-extra
Downgrading yourself, you get an F for effort
Ha-ha, I let the world know
I chose to keep to myself and let the world go
And if you don't like a nigga, then let your girl know
So she can be curious on Twitter looking me up
I'm laid back with a bad one, you ain't never had one
Ass so fat that it tipped over the Aston
Speeding on the 1-0-5 till the fucking badge come
Hello to my wittiness, I'm Cadillac's grandson

[Hook]
And I'm a trip
Ever since an understudy man I've always been a trip
Mama tell me that she love me but she know her son a trip
Baby open up your ears, you ain't heard it like this
Sounwave drop the beat, I lock the flow down
Now all the way to the moon we bout to go now
I got enough of the mojo to go around
So pack your bags and tell him you going out of town
Cause I'm a trip

[Verse 2]
Landing on another runway, fly with me
Or die tryna fly, a shot-down Frisbee
Shout out to Black Hippy, nigga we on
Like we never been off, straight shots of Patron
I'm give y'all the business to give y'all some business
Pussy ain't shit, I can give y'all some bitches
Clean off her sports bra, she clean off my dishes
Then wear off the Kangols, hood rats, I hate those
And she know what this is, hey lil' mama
Seen your pretty ass around the way lil' mama
But why you always in somebody face lil' mama?
Embarrassing yourself, get off the stage (Lil Mama)
Nigga, I gotta be that nigga
If I ain't, I gotta beat that nigga
Curtesy of Paula's oldest son, pay homage
Or pay attention, open your eyes and hear knowledge

[Hook]
And I'm a trip
Ever since an understudy man I've always been a trip
Mama tell me that she love me but she know her son a trip
Baby open up your ears, you ain't heard it like this
Sounwave drop the beat, I lock the flow down
Now all the way to the moon we bout to go now
I got enough of the mojo to go around
So pack your bags and tell him you going out of town
Cause I'm a trip

[Verse 3]
Gi-give me that, gi-gi-give me that
That's how I get at 'em when I look at a shoe rack
Penny for thoughts, mine start at a few racks
So I can live on a hill just off a few raps
I want to live in a space that none of y'all can visit
That might be outer space, the Jupiter district
I quadruple my vision
If you don't see it then you're dead with your eyes open
I've seen bullets hit the wheel, left his ride smoking
On some Compton shit
Somebody that'll ride or die, that's a Compton bitch
You see my city is the city of Lamar
It'll take twenty years 'fore a nigga see them all
The swap meet dumping, the sawed-off pumping
The tree for the low, don't you know, Paul Bunyan
I'm on cloud nine, I can see rain coming
So if I'm out my mind, people don't say nothing

[Hook]
And I'm a trip
Ever since an understudy man I've always been a trip
Mama tell me that she love me but she know her son a trip
Baby open up your ears, you ain't heard it like this
Sounwave drop the beat, I lock the flow down
Now all the way to the moon we bout to go now
I got enough of the mojo to go around
So pack your bags and tell him you going out of town
Cause I'm a trip

[Outro]
"How was your flight Mr. Lamar?
Good, hope to see you next time"

[Intro]
Is this the top?
Cool
They say we too rich
Too rich

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Ain't holding on to nothing, I've been trained to blow it
Pick your favorite place, I get the plane, we gone
Roll the marijuana right up where my job is
Getting all this money got me living lawless
Popping hella bottles don't care what it costs us
Started small time, now all my diamonds flawless
Fuck you talking bout bitch my new watch just changed the game
Rich and all my niggas balling, call me Major Payne
I just spent some racks on all this fabric
And my stylist it say she got it
Swear to god is just like magic, cause the store didn't even have it
My flow is supersonic, bitch I'm floating off that chronic

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa and Fashawn x2]
Champagne, I got lot of it, if it's new then I'm rocking it
Climbing all my money, standing on top of it
New chains I got 2 of those, lot of haters we through with those
Getting money and getting more

[Verse 2: Fashawn]
I used to smoking some OG, used to burn about an OZ
Sold weed that was '03, now a nigga need 4 keys
Bare arms, no sleeves, in my khaki shorts, no jeans
Shawn Don in my styrofoam, motherfuck that codeine
I'm east side, so what, bitch niggas got no nuts
Y'all B.G.'s, we grown ups, teach ya how to keep chrome tucked
Ain't a bad bitch that I won't fuck
And if her head good, she might can get her toes up
High socks and some low cuts, fat spliff I don't roll blunts
You shine while I glow chump (glow chump)
Not a day that I'm sober, on the block and I'm posted
Cork poppin', we toastin'

[Hook x2]

[Hook]
Bababababa
There is no one like me
Th-th-there is no one like me, like me

Ma-ma-manners take a second look and you'll see (we pretty much amazing)
There is no one like me 

[x2] (mind your manners)

[Verse 1]
I'm blowin' up like my swagger on the Gaza
I'm writing movies where I'm making out with Aubrey Plaza
And homegirl my homegirl, it is not like that
But if she tried to rape me, I would not fight back
Girls that turn me down are saying? Please and sorry
You lucky that I'm Randy, Aziz Ansari
So now I'm in the club telling strippers they should back it up
I wanna hang with Lil Wayne, I just hope that I'm black enough
Damn, I guess we're all friends here
Except for I don't know you, like you was me last year
It's funny how these niggas all treat me like we best friends
I wanna fuck these small girls, minus "sm"

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I ain't going nowhere somebody better tell a hater
He's goin' down like my living room elevator
Fuck what you heard, bitch I'll fuck your fuckin' brains out
And make you wash your boyfriend's sheets to get the stains out
Put your fucking boots on it's time to kick the lames out
You got your favorite rapper in your ear, it's time to change out
Watch your girlfriend, I'll fuck her then I up and leave her
Girls chase me like they think my dick is Justin Bieber
Pussy thrown at me, you fucking with a wide receiver
I'm a genius, and I don't need to hide it either
Got a lot of hay, let me pay for what you sip tonight
Mixed girls from Williamsburg, that's my fucking kryptonite
Baby girl, shorty, have it however you want it
Whatever you asking bout, I promise you that I done it
My swagger's New York but my home is the South
And it's amazing how I eat more pussy than Alf

[Hook]

[Chorus]
They still at the side door
Foreign models follow everywhere that I go
I go, I go, I go, I go, everywhere that I go
Switchin' lanes, rather we ride slow
The way that I'm livin', it's so true man, listen, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know, I swear that baby, I know

[Verse 1]
Introduce you to the new-new-new-new-new-new-new
UK flow, it's a new day so another girl wet like blew-blew-blew-blew
And I'm, and I'm so foreign, so fly that I'm in there soarin'
No paint, just like a McLaren, she a freak but I need me a Lauren
Duffelbag full of euros in the belly of the bearau, niggas in the Merlot
Bad ting with her hair low, I'm gettin' money like a freak and my whip is a weirdo
Got boos in my car, it's a Phantom
We shine like a broad with a light on
They ain't never call way back when
Now all the tings wanna pour with the mandem
I send them shots back around-round-round-round-round
London goin' down-down-down-down-down
Let's have some fun tonight, right, lovin' life
Under the summer light, I gets me money right
You feel the rhythm when I get 'em and I got them
Hit the rest, need to find me a shy them
You talk, need a watch, no chop man
Your dad know, so you dealin' with a bodmon
Roll with a whole squad full of bad man
Oh bye bye to your bougie ban time
Coupe look like soup with the wanton
Sit back, blow L with the mandem, swave

[Chorus]
They still at the side door
Foreign models follow everywhere that I go
I go, I go, I go, I go, everywhere that I go
Switchin' lanes, rather we ride slow
The way that I'm livin', it's so true man, listen, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know, I swear that baby, I know

[Verse 2]
Sittin' back with a style full of badsies
Think about when the people used to judge me
Wanna miss call me and say, "Fuck me"
Lame 'cause they knew they want to plug me
Then I think back and I blame back
Tings tryna pull me like sling shot
In the Maybach, givin' money to the niggas tryna block
Tryna make them a quick shot
Roll out on the window, endo, even though the whip get low like limbo
For your info, kinfolk with me, hit me you get slice, no Kimbo
Your wife my bimbo, I just show her where her chin go
This that U-U-U-U-U-UK flow on you snitches
Man, I got too much time on my mind for me to catch and get away
Now let me leave and take your girl oxygen away
I'm sippin' coolers, that's the summer breeze
Somehow I can't recollect my memories
My bad, I said I'm UK swavey
So all the girls, they go UK crazy
My bad, I said I'm UK swavey
So all the girls, they go UK crazy

[Chorus]
They still at the side door
Foreign models follow everywhere that I go
I go, I go, I go, I go, everywhere that I go
Switchin' lanes, rather we ride slow
The way that I'm livin', it's so true man, listen, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know, I swear that baby, I know

[Outro]
Put the needle on the record, let it play, let it play, away
Foreign Models want to follow, let 'em play, let 'em play, away
I don't want to hear no chat
Ya hear blood?
Before I run in your house with a bump and end it
It's UK Lanez, yeah
Me and Sunny want all the girls, yeah

[Verse 1]
I was born into this world
A little bitty baby girl
Not looking white, looking so black
In a racist world
Now it's a difficult process
The matter is our perception
When I look in the mirror, what do I see
Is it my reflection

[Hook]
See, repercussions
Talkin bout the things we do
You need to know repercussions
Things can come right back to you
You see repercussions
What goes around comes around
Repercussions

[Verse 2]
See I was born into this world, in another space and time
Time has moved on, and death has grown closer
Surely has blown my mind
Ain't that a bitch, the way the world spins around
Everything everything everything that I said and I did
Surely came back around

[Breakdown]
See, repercussions
Talkin bout the things we do
Repercussions, things sure can come right back to you
Repercussions, what goes around comes around
Repercussions, they will get you down

Repercussions,talkin bout the things we do
Repercussions, things sure can come back to y
You need to know that repercussions, what goes around comes around
Repercussions, they will get you down

[Verse 1]
I slip away
I slipped on a little white lie

[Verse 2]
We've got heads on sticks
And you've got ventriloquists
We've got heads on sticks
And you've got ventriloquists

[Verse 3]
Standing in the shadows at the end of my bed
Standing in the shadows at the end of my bed
Standing in the shadows at the end of my bed
Standing in the shadows at the end of my bed

[Outro]
The rats and the children will follow me out of town
Rats and children follow me out of town
Come on, kids

[Verse 1]
That there, that's not me
I go where I please
I walk through walls
I float down the Liffey

[Chorus]
I'm not here
This isn't happening
I'm not here
I'm not here

[Verse 2]
In a little while
I'll be gone
The moment's already passed
Yeah, it's gone

[Chorus]
And I'm not here
This isn't happening
I'm not here
I'm not here

[Bridge]
Strobe lights and blown speakers
Fireworks and hurricanes

[Chorus]
I'm not here
This isn't happening
I'm not here
I'm not here

[Intro]
Lundy, Fastnet, Irish Sea
I got a message I can't read
Another message I can't read
Lundy, Fastnet, Irish Sea
I got a message I can’t read
Another message I can’t read

[Verse 1]
I'm on your side
Nowhere to hide
Trapdoors that open
I spiral down

[Chorus]
You're living in a fantasy world
You're living in a fantasy world

[Verse 2]
I'm lost at sea
Don't bother me
I've lost my way
I've lost my way

[Chorus]
You're living in a fantasy world
You're living in a fantasy world
You're living in a fantasy world
The most beautiful woman in the world

[Outro]
Come back
Lundy, Fastnet, Irish Sea
Another message I can't read
Lundy, Fastnet, Irish Sea
Come back
Another message I can't read
Another message I can't read
Another message I can't read

Another message I can't read
Another message I can't read
Another message I can't read

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
We met at city walk, universal studios
Uhh so beautifullll
Truly cold
Shawty need a movie role
I am not an actor but I'm stickin to da script
And Tony Montana had me stickin to the blimp
But now I got an actress stickin to my hip
And she hit me with her fubbb
You can roll the credits, and shawty is my fetish
And you know I like em redish and shawty is reddish
You know I like em fast and shawty is the last number on my dash
Uh, speedin like a cop behind me
Tryna catch up wit this girl like some 57 Heinz
And you deserve lobster mami
So how bout I make reservations at crustaceans for now
Table for two, just me and you, some drinks and some food
Couple yeah I know's a couple jokes
A couple cries a couple girl I know you lying, lines
Cup of Patrón
Cup of Dom Pérignon, cup of hound
Cup of moans, couple groans
Couple ground, and we get our couple on
And her goodies so good I can't make a bad sound
And her pussy so good wish I could wear it for cologne
And her pussy so wet I wish I slip and break my neck
And I took her to Rodeo she shop all day-o
And I fucked her Hollywood ass like she was from Vallejo

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
I wish they all could be California girls
California ca ca California
Man I wish dey could be Californa girls
California ca ca California

My California love

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Uhh but shawty got the nerve doe
Cuz now she telling me to stop, now she said she wanna stop
Now I'm callin one stop, where the purple? Like where the purple?
And my mama told me never hurt a woman but what if that woman hurt me
And they say love is priceless but right now it's dirt cheap
And we say we will fight this until round 13
But just like Mike Tyson we were not sure thing
We were only biting on a dream
In that boxing ring
And in dat box is a ring... a ring
Now somebody call Don King
And tell him shawty give me back my ring
Shawty give me back my ring
And the bell went ding

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Tyga]
Uhhh my Cali's consist from Compton to the Valley
A few stallions in Rancho Cucamongo
So run those they say waitin patiently like a drumroll
From my area codes got em all from 213 310 323
Oh, I got bad one up in Carson
Soon as we met her heart stuck, she gorgeous, I'm falling
Can't fall though never been my morals, just plenty oral

[Wiz Khalifa]

[Hook]

[Hook]

Play it on the radio
Plat it on the radio
Play it on the radio
Play it on the radio

[Verse 1]

I wanna call my girlfriend
But shes all mad
Everything was good then
Nows shes all bad
I hit your phone up
You never call back
Would I be wrong if I took
Everything I brought back
Me and you against the world
Girl I thought that
I be able to see them signs
No contracts
So high off of life
Will make a hater catch a contact
But now I treat her like im
Jumpin out a plane and fall back
Cause I can only dream of what we had
Try to work but seem that we go wrong
Sometimes I pray that god will take me back
Then run and tell the homies ive moved on
But soon as I get my head right
You gon think im stuck and im just
Frontin no headlights
Put you in the club and brought you
Stuff you never wear twice
Now the thrill is gone and the
Decisions in the air like
Damn

[Hook]

[Hook]
Chorus:
One for the money
Two for the po'
Three for my streets
Another four for the flow
Which I do so properly
God willin ain't no stoppin me ya know?(I say)
One for the game
Two for the Sco
Daps to my niggas
‘Nother five for the hoes
Not the ladies that wanna bring me round
But the haters that wanna bring me down. I ain't trippin

Verse 1:
Im tryna get a few bucks man
And I hate crime like the klu Klux klan
So I ain't tryna shoot a supply to shoot up man
Cuz’ it ain't honey when the fast money screw up fam
Dead crew come back up to through to boot us man like give ur loot up
The devil rootin’, But God really boo us (damn)
So put your cool up, rims on a school bus
And begin to rule you how they rule us man
Came out head first afoot, and they’ll hate that
If you start doin you how they do us man
So on the payback I snaps like gas money for a wax
Laid back on my scoot up fam
So when they thinking that Im just getting repped
I done been blew up like a crip getting dressed
You see I know to keep the B.I low
So they can't be holdin’ me back like G.I Joe (I guess so)
Chorus:
One for the money

Daps to my niggas
‘Nother five for the hoes
Not the ladies that wanna bring me round
But the haters that wanna bring me down. I ain't trippin

Verse 2:
So that means I’m a pimp on par
Till I’m six feet under, like its 3 niggas in a Flintstone car
I keep my ear to the street like I can hear with my feet
I’m here till its clear, then adhere to the beat
Like a walking police that peep my peers
I keep my peer on my peeps that’s dear and move career
Here on the streets, I tell my niggas walk slow so I can steer on the creep
I try not to be too deep, cuz I ain't really ready to go
I try and stayin something that only got two seats
But you never know when your green go from go
And bring you round to a screech
And streets were starting to cook
That why I put my foot in the floor for keeps
Uh, for Jay Rock, Co, Chees, Bishop G, Doughboy, homeboys that’s deceased peace
Chorus:
One for the money
Two for the po'
Three for my streets
Another four for the flow
Which I do so properly
God willin ain't no stoppin me ya know?(I say)
One for the game

Daps to my niggas
‘Nother five for the hoes
Not the ladies that wanna bring me round
But the haters that wanna bring me down. I ain't trippin

Bridge:
To the westsiiiiidddeee(Westside) to Madison street
And all the homies that be rockin wit me
I had the game quite flat thank God for that
And now I do it so properalyyy(properly)
And if you does not know you can't smudge our glow
The flow and the swag is mean
Four eyes and a fitted up’d and done did it
All on the first and fifteen

Verse 3:
And to the gangsta don’t get gassed by the eyeglass and me
Cross my path, feel the wrath like a crash at sea
1 pound like a half a key
To the haters that was mad at me
See your heat brought it outta me like
Um, a bag of tea
Made me a big bad MC
Associate a lot but my family few
Survey before I say like family feud
Make sure my family cool and one
Chorus:
One for the money
Two for the po'
Three for my streets
Another four for the flow
Which I do so properly
God willin ain't no stoppin me ya know?
One for the game
Two for the sko
Daps to my niggas
‘Nother five for the hoes
Not the ladies that wanna bring me round
But the haters that wanna bring me down. I ain't trippin

End:
Now nobody ain't see that
Nope you didn’t see that
Nobody ain't see that
Whoa don’t tell nobody
Like, nobody didn’t see that
No you didn’t see that
Homie you didn’t see that
Whoa don’t tell know nobody
Now you know you didn’t
Nobody ain't see that
Police ain't see that
Whoa don’t tell nobody

[Verse]
Diamonds hang around my neck, the crib is all finished
No love for these bitches I said this year it’s all business
It is a shame that a couple of ‘em are off limits
No offence to my nigga, it’s just the industry is small
We all lust for the same women
You know the ones we saw before we came in it
I know he ain't trippin’
I know I got a couple things that Lil’ Wayne dipped in
Ain't ashamed to admit it, I be the same with it
This shit is all about hits and misses
The ones that you fuck and the ones that you wife up
Don’t let them fuck your life up
Half a mill to perform, I can’t let them fuck that shit up
Plus I love the way my middle name looks when it’s lit up
Jim Moore got me dressing like a leading man
A little favour for a friend when I need a hand
Young Frank, suits cut right always
Just got a couple Warhol’s for my hallways
New verses crush the hood like I’m driving into something
Bitches on the kid like I’m Iverson of something
Like a Sixer, since I sold 680 in my first
Drizzy Drake, the only one that got the gift without the curse
Swag!

[Intro]
Yessir, haha, ayy
Woah-oh-oh
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
Ayy, ayy, yeah

[Verse 1]
Now every girl I've been with, been with after you
Baby, it just ain't the same, no-no, no-no, no-no
Recently I had a girl and her name was Nikki
But she left me 'cause I called her your name, no-no, no-no
Girl, I been on that rebound tip
I can't believe that you got me feeling like this
And every other morning it's your face that I miss, man, your boy's sick
'Cause shawty was a ten but I was on that bull when I was with you

[Chorus]
You, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you

Girl, when I was with you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you
(You, you, you, you)

[Verse 2]
And every other phone call it's one of, one of my dawgs
"Man, I just seen Keisha and Nikki and them up in the mall"
So what did she have on? "Gucci jeans, BeBe tee"
Air Force Ones, hair all done, damn
Man, please don't tell me no more, man, my heart is so sore
I wanna reclaim her, but you'll never get over what I put you through
And there's nothing that I wouldn't do, man, my momma loved you
It's my fault I wasn't true but I was on that that shh when I was with you

[Chorus]
You, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you
(You, you, you, you)
I was on that shh when I was with you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you
(You, you, you, you)
Your boy was different 'cause I was with you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you
(You, you, you, you)
Baby girl, when I was with you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you
(You, you, you, you)
When I was with you

[Bridge]
Girl, I know it's way too late to even say, "I'm sorry, babe"
I wanna pick up, up the phone
But inside my heart, I know I'm wrong
And I still wanna be your man
But I thought it through time and time again
This road that I'm traveling on will leave me lost and alone

[Chorus]
When I, when I was with you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you (Oh)
(You, you, you, you)
Girl, when I was with you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you
(You, you, you, you)
When, when, when, when I was with you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you (When I was with, oh)
(You, you, you, you)
When I was with you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you
(You, you, you, you)

[Intro: Wiz Khalifa]
Uh
Keep saying "I do this, I do that" but, you know
I just keep doing the same shit, haha
My fault, hahaha

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
I'm not tryna be a right, tryna be a wrong
I'm just try to make it out here on my own
I say I do a lot of things but I (But I)
Prolly never change (Change)
I'm not tryna be a right, tryna be a wrong
I just try to make it out here on my own
I say I do a lot of things but I
Prolly be the same (Same)

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
Every time I try to get my life together someone seems
Whatcha doing tryna ruin my hopes and my dreams
Push away and always go get away
And keep some grams in my pants have a hit a day
Am I wrong am I right, do I care, living life
On my own, cop a zone, what it feeling like
Transition crimination whatch you call it mack upon
Do my thang with my gang put your back up on
Recollect and reflect on how I used to be
I'm probably the same way cud' cause I'm goin' keep it G
Secretly sactredly yall wake and bake with me
Solo creepin on the dolo tippin' like a lolo
Fans come in vans with they clans expecting to get that photo
Won't need to come back stage and have a chance to hit my dodo
Cool individual, I'm never too good
See Mack is from the hood and never Hollywood

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
I'm not tryna be a right, tryna be a wrong
I'm just try to make it out here on my own
I say I do a lot of things but I (But I)
Prolly never change (Change)
I'm not tryna be a right, tryna be a wrong
I just try to make it out here on my own
I say I do a lot of things but I
Prolly be the same (Same)

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Uh, growing up I ain't know as much
I was too busy chasing money and rolling stuff for I was old enough
Getting every dollar and fold it up
Putin' all my weed in papers instead of blunts so they could know it's us
Every party we showing up, baggy full of pre-rolls
Light it up and pass it you holding that one too long nigga matter fact you can have it
Another one in rotation my motivation is cabage my Rollie face filled with carrots
And niggas think they are but they know that they ain't comparing
And they ain't doing no harm but I don't think I'm really caring
I keep making deposits and no way no interference
From your broke ass, I just keep hustlin all the time and gettin more cash
And rolling weed you smell the chronic when I go past
You look at me and then put down notes on your notepad
Yeah, I'm kinda high, but you should know that

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
I'm not tryna be a right, tryna be a wrong
I'm just try to make it out here on my own
I say I do a lot of things but I (But I)
Prolly never change (Change)
I'm not tryna be a right, tryna be a wrong
I just try to make it out here on my own
I say I do a lot of things but I
Prolly be the same (Same)

[Intro]
Yeah, it's how I feel, right
It's only me right
Ha, it's life, ha

[Verse]
I was 15, a Virginia nigga with ambition
Young but I envisioned fuckin' 'em bad bitches
Live my life with no regrets, I try to show respect but you don't give it
I guess you don't understand winnin'
It might take me a lifetime to take it back
And it might take you a lifetime to know the facts
Yeah, just 'cause we different, don't mean we distant
And if you kill a man, ain't no way to bring him back
Yeah, they say it's mind over matter
But what we livin' for? What really matters?
Some niggas silver spoon just on a platter
And other niggas is doomed just for disaster
All alone sleepin' in my bedroom
As I wet the sheets, momma gon' be dead soon
'Cause a man beat her, but he don't realize
She important to this family like a fuckin' heirloom
Yeah, a nigga still found his way out
A record deal came, that nigga played out
My momma livin' good, she takin' days out
They sayin', "Boy, all that hard work paid off"
500 racks for an hour show
But ain't gon' ever do no 60-minute interview
'Cause all you wanna do is twist my words up
And all I wanna do is flip my birds up
Kinda tipsy off that red rum, murder
I'm a singin' ass nigga, know you heard of me
Every day my clique stuntin'
Niggas talkin' down but I'ma make them pick they words up
I done said all I had to say, what else?
Cock suckers low blowin' under my belt
Yeah, they hangin' from the tip, they tryna get a sip
Don't let them get a grip, I'm pissin' on them myself
19 a nigga went through a tragedy
Three years a nigga just found a better me
Yeah, you might find another lover
But you always started with Breezy like the letter "B"
Nightmares feelin' haunted
Thinkin' do I really like this star shit?
Huh, because fame ain't freedom
And this diamond chain only mean they hold you hostage
Now I got a lot of offers
Tellin' me to wear their clothes and they wanna be my sponsor
But when a nigga fall off again, they be like, "Off him"
And then they gonna smile up in your face just like, "Awesome, great"
Wait, police and a thug cannot relate
I guess that's why this war on drugs is the debate
So I'ma keep on livin' my life from day to day
Learn from my mistakes

[Verse 1]
I think I'm nauseous
Hey mister, Derrick is it?
You can call me giddy, brain spinnin'
The virus you been missin
Ill, crazy, what's the difference?
No defense can defend
I'm Monte Kiffin, A Buccaneer
These fuckers here, might wanna listen;
Cause there's no recovery from this ill once you get it
Hot head nigga, fever is check my temperature
Tamper with my temper, get this missile to your temple
It's simple lights, no paris hilton
More shit like the toilet's speaking
Regurgitating things I've eaten, poly seeds and jelly beans and shit, mickey d and these demons are fish
Love the sea men, I love fishing
I go like every weekend;
From Monday to Sunday, these weak niggas stay sleeping
Waking that old ass up like black people ringers
Far from a genius
Should've stayed far from them yellow blinkers
Now you're blinking, no idea where you're ID is

[Hook]
I been around the world
The fact I have to go
You can't fix this
Doc thought I'd let you know
I'm so sick, I think I'm nauseous, nauseous
I'm so sick, I think I'm nauseous, nauseous
I been killed, but I always come back for more
I'm here to stay if the NARCs don't let you go
I'm so sick, I think I'm nauseous, nauseous
I'm so sick, I think I'm nauseous, nauseous

[Verse 2]
Step in the caution tape
Come around the corner
Coroner is just a call away
Pull board like sandwiches spread flat today
No quick quote, just smoke from the barrel blast for me, against what I have to say
Powerful nigga In position, the president today, 'Bama bitch
If they talking sideways, ladda yippy yapping them hotter
Your not a factor, the son couldn't father if his own taught him
Better park it, for they break your waters like auto insurance
Can I show your life in that bentley baller?
Welcome to Compton!
Check my pockets, all green like the slossin
Don't even count it, it's all there like Peggy lee partner
Facin the faucet, time to drown out the sorrow
How long could you hold your breath for, underwater?
Watch ya turn purplish, ooh, balloons, see ya soon
Don't fall in that fiery doom

[Hook]
I been around the world
The fact I have to go
You can't fix this
Doc thought I'd let you know
I'm so sick, I think I'm nauseous, nauseous
I'm so sick, I think I'm nauseous, nauseous
I been killed, but I always come back for more
I'm here to stay if the narcs don't let you go
I'm so sick, I think I'm nauseous, nauseous
I'm so sick, I think I'm nauseous, nauseous

[Verse 3]
Fucking shit
Whatchu thought? You could get rid of me?
I'm poison and you gotta remember me, I'm like history
Socially study gecomedin
I hate being sick, every time I throw up feel like I'm dying quick, blaaghh
Hold up!
Drink this soda, soothe the odor
Turn it to more throw up
I'm tyga man, contagiously god made me
Don't shake my hand, If you afraid of satan, jewelry by jason, that's why they hatin', I'm hot!
Dawg, you ain't nathin

[Hook]
I been around the world
The fact I have to go
You can't fix this
Doc thought I'd let you know
I'm so sick, I think I'm nauseous, nauseous
I'm so sick, I think I'm nauseous, nauseous
I been killed, but I always come back for more
I'm here to stay if the narcs don't let you go
I'm so sick, I think I'm nauseous, nauseous
I'm so sick, I think I'm nauseous, nauseous

[Intro]
Rare Breed, Kendrick Lamar
Breed up or speed up
Breed up or speed up
Breed up or speed up

[Verse 1]
This is for my niggas that be all blacked out
Hit the streets a hundred deep, what Rare Breed about?
Riding hard, bending corners, the girlies on us
Leave a hater scarred, big Dressers sit at the stop light
Road Glides and Road Kings deep in my hindsight
You do it right or don't do it at all
Put that candy paint on it, ride them twenty-threes homie
Custom seats, custom brakes, hit the streets and ball
Centre of attention like Bynum and GasolYou know that killer californication
When you feeling like you sitting on a ceiling, chasing
Dreams, hoping this conglomerate can run the nation
It's abomination how we bomb yo' block
I'm talking Big Punch, K-Dub, Baby Slip Billy
Bad Azz, Rare Breed, we all we got
See 'em out, show 'em love, chunk the deuce, give it up
It's a lot of bike clubs but they not this hard, nope

[Hook]
Pounding on the highway stretch
All blacked out, making sure we on deck
Might catch us on them Dressers or them Road Glides, yes
Tell the world I'm a Rare Breed baby
Breed up or speed up (don't stop, don't stop)
Breed up or speed up (don't stop, don't stop)
Breed up or speed up, I'm a Rare Breed baby

[Verse 2]
And it's like that to the death though
Two-oh-point and seeing decimals, I ain't lying
Pounding on the interstate in the state that shines
Or we might be in a hood near you
Around the globe baby, Rare Breed under control baby
Them pipes loud, the movement entice crowds
We heat it up in the cold baby
It's three degrees out? Then you should see me out
Or see bout them kitty cats and how they go meow
Ha-ha, we be the father of Harley drivers, so don't bother
Show you infants how to whip it, have a bye-bye
Posers try to hang? Then we hang 'em by the collar
Silk, lannie, Rare Breed family
Stunting hard like a black circus, voila
Breed up or speed up, get ahead
So with that said, bye-bye

[Hook]

[x2]

[Outro]
Shouting out the one and only Rare Breed
Now Breed up!

[Verse 1]
I remembered black skies
The lightning all around me
I remembered each flash
As time began to blur
Like a startling sign
That fate had finally found me
And your voice was all I heard
That I get what I deserve

[Chorus]
So give me reason
To prove me wrong
To wash this memory clean
Let the floods cross
The distance in your eyes
Give me reason
To fill this hole
Connect this space between
Let it be enough to reach the truth that lies
Across this new divide

[Verse 2]
There was nothing in sight
But memories left abandoned
There was nowhere to hide
The ashes fell like snow
And the ground caved in
Between where we were standing
And your voice was all I heard
That I get what I deserve

[Chorus]
So give me reason
To prove me wrong
To wash this memory clean
Let the floods cross
The distance in your eyes
Across this new divide

[Bridge]
In every loss in every lie
In every truth that you deny
And each regret and each goodbye
Was a mistake too great to hide
And your voice was all I heard
That I get what I deserve

[Chorus]
So give me reason
To prove me wrong
To wash this memory clean
Let the floods cross
The distance in your eyes
Give me reason
To fill this hole
Connect this space between
Let it be enough to reach the truth that lies
Across this new divide
Across this new divide
Across this new divide

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
God bless us everyone
We're a broken people living under loaded gun
And it can't be outfought, it can't be outdone
It can't be outmatched, it can't be outrun, no!
God bless us everyone
We're a broken people living under loaded gun
And it can't be outfought, it can't be outdone
It can't be outmatched, it can't be outrun, no!

[Chorus 1: Chester Bennington with Mike Shinoda]
And when I close my eyes tonight
To symphonies of blinding light!
God bless us everyone
We're a broken people living under loaded gun
Oh, like memories in cold decay
Transmissions echoing away
Far from the world of you and I
Where oceans bleed into the sky!

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
God save us everyone
Will we burn inside the fires of a thousand suns?
For the sins of our hand, the sins of our tongue
The sins of our father, the sins of our young? No!
God save us everyone
Will we burn inside the fires of a thousand suns?
For the sins of our hand, the sins of our tongue
The sins of our father, the sins of our young? No!

[Chorus 2: Chester Bennington with Mike Shinoda]
And when I close my eyes tonight
To symphonies of blinding light!
God save us everyone
Will we burn inside the fires of a thousand suns?
Oh, like memories in cold decay
Transmissions echoing away
Far from the world of you and I
Where oceans bleed into the sky!

Oh, like memories in cold decay
Transmissions echoing away

It can't be outmatched, it can't be outrun

[Verse 1]
Days like this, I want to drive away
Pack my bags and watch your shadow fade

[Pre-Chorus]
You chewed me up and spit me out
Like I was poison in your mouth
You took my light, you drained me down
But that was then and this is now
Now look at me

[Chorus]
This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me, no
This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me, no

[Post-Chorus]
Throw your sticks and your stones
Throw your bombs and your blows
But you're not gonna break my soul
This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me, no

[Verse 2]
I just wanna throw my phone away
Find out who is really there for me

[Pre-Chorus]
You ripped me off, your love was cheap
Was always tearing at the seams
I fell deep, you let me drown
But that was then and this is now
Now look at me

[Chorus]
This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me, no
This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me, no

[Post-Chorus]
Throw your sticks and your stones
Throw your bombs and your blows
But you're not gonna break my soul
This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me, no

[Bridge]
Now look at me, I'm sparkling
A firework, a dancing flame
You won't ever put me out again
I'm glowing, oh whoa
So you can keep the diamond ring
It don't mean nothing anyway
In fact you can keep everything
Yeah, yeah, except for me

[Chorus]
This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me, no
This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me, no (Away from me)

[Post-Chorus]
Throw your sticks and your stones
Throw your bombs and your blows
But you're not gonna break my soul (My soul)
This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me, no

[Refrain]
This is the part of me (No)
Away from me (No)
This is the part of me (Me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me)
No

[Post-Chorus]
Throw your sticks and your stones
Throw your bombs and your blows
But you're not gonna break my soul
This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me, no

[Verse 1]
Your love is like the ocean, and I am like the sand
Responding to your power, a safe place for you to stand
But when the undercurrents come, and pull you out to sea
I'm left with shells and slippery rocks where you used to be
And when the sun comes beating down and burns my body dry
It's hard to wait until the tide to quench my thirst, so I cry, I cry
Cry, cry, and then at last, the sun goes down
And leads into your sea
And I can feel your desperate hands all over me, all over me
I dream of you, when I know I shouldn't, shouldn't
You are hurting me and you said that you wouldn't
You promised me you wouldn't you wouldn't
I said I'd be with you and I know I couldn't
And I knew I couldn't
Oh, I, oh I. Indeed, indeed, indeed

[Outro]
So moves like that
This is how we bust rhymes on a phat track
Me and Kahlee, female refugees, we get down like that
I don't know what to sing so my artistry brings
Things from off the top of my head
I bust freestyles instead
Of memories of the time when we were free
Soulja..Kony, 2012

Right now, there are more people on Facebook
Than there were on the planet two hundred years ago

Humanity's greatest desire is to belong and connect
And now we see each other

Stop Kony, Stop Kony..

Stop Kony man, I can't believe it's going down
From my town to your town
They taking kids, turn em into souljas
Put a gun in his hand and his life is over
It's getting so crazy, gotta take it over
We gonna stop Kony, it's 20 over
It's 2012, 10 summers
Kidnapped the kid took him to the jungle
AK47 and he can't never ever
Never seen his daddy, never seen his mama
Make this his history, all you gotta do is believe
Soulja Boy Tell Em tatted on my sleeve
SODMG
The next 27 minutes are an experiment..

Stop Kony, Stop Kony..
We can do it y'all
Stop Kony, before it's too late
Soulja..

[Snoop Dogg:]
My goodness my gracious shell toe Adidas with the fat blue laces
Hand full of aces trumped up dump trunk white wall paces
Drink til you drop motherfucker cop
Old English 800 on the block
Way before St. Ide's came to the spot
Niggas used to hang out and do the pop lock
And if we got into some shit we never pop shots
We'd squab scrap whatever it was
And live to talk about it and we get old cause
And keep a pack of zig zags for that good old bud
We do a house party what the fuck is a club
And the ese's they sold most of the drugs
La familia hell yea and we the plug
We get money yeah and we do low ride
Represent it and talk nope no not I
That's the code in every hood that you roam
Fastest way to catch a hot slug in your dome
O.G. the place that I call home
Black Lac like that and it's sitting on chrome
Plaque in back strap in Lac
Antennas wake you up for a rat trying to set a new trap
Swinging the track dripping curl juice on your back
Breaking hearts like Roger and Zapp motherfucker

[Bootsy Collins:]
Back in the day it was cheaper to keep her
Hang out with your friends and smoking the reefer
Pound for pound we were the baddest in town
You just had to get up for the get down
Some say we the next generation
But we lack education

[Goldie Loc:]

[?] drinking mad dog 20/20
Silver satin blue Kool Aid sagging in my Dickies
I got my loccs on sailing through my neighborhood
Catch you slipping on them bricks it ain't all good
Front door kicker Glock spitter
Black and gold flag across my face when I get you
3 wheeler tipping turning up the Alpine

[?] sippin while I listen to the grapevine
Gotti blue Crips all by the front door
East side rip riding gang banging all I know
Heart break hotel hush puppy neck kicker
I grew up on that crazy one five nigga
If you locc from my block then hop something
And I ain't talking bout no peel nigga block hunting
Blue corduroys while I'm talking on my brick phone
14 years old had to bring the shit home
My uncle Sugar Bear showed me how to bag it up
Look at the block now nigga it's sewed up
I ain't playing with you old grand pubas
Peace out Rolando ran things with no cuz
Now take a picture of this 8 ball sipper
Look down at my shoes blue strings nigga
Goldie Loc will keep this motherfucker crack-a-lackin
The only thing I wanna hear is gang bang rapping

[Bootsy Collins:]
Some say we the next generation
But we lack education
Hanging with the crew of devastation
Yeah but we one nation mama
Tally-ho and away we go
See you next week with a brand new show
When you funk around here ain't nothing consensual
You know I funk so hard you gonna need your parent's credential
Now I'm in the street cause I lost my sheep
But now I know where to find that
Now how cool is cold when you're trying to compete
Standing next to me son you better take a seat
Can't none of you cut throats funk like me
You better check with Snoop Dogg and get your pedigree
Why oh why do I think like that
If I am with the dog you must be a cat
Now tally-ho and away we go
See you next week with a brand new show
I want the bomb I want that O.G. back
There's a party going on in my head
While I think about the blood that we shed
Then party uh when the player play
There's a party going on up in here

Back in the day it was cheaper to keep her
Hang out with your friends and smoking the reefer
Pound for pound we were the baddest in town
You just had to get up for the get down
Some say we the next generation
But we lack education
Hanging with the crew of devastation
Yeah but we one nation mama
Hanging with the Snoopatronics bobba

[Intro; Tyga]
Ha ha~!
You are now, listenin to a new sound
It's called something...
No Introduction
I could make a style off nuttin - frontin?
Listen to my instructions
And I could show you how Tyga easily does it
That's the new name they lovin
Studio to the show, I'm the heat in the oven
I can't breathe cause I'm buzzin
Gimme a lil' space, even space I'm above it

[Hook: repeat 2X]
Ever heard a sound like this?
Who you know that'll put it down like this?
Ever move a crowd like this?
I don't think nobody sound like this

[Tyga]
Now this is where you all pause
Now gimme some flavors watch me mix it all
Sounds like somethin out of the norm
So labels get ready for my proposal
It's like, one of the two rappers on somethin new
The other dude caught in the door while I'm sneakin through
This comfortable rap (my tracks loungin too)
They say fly guy you hot; shit~! Thought you knew

[Hook]

[Tyga]
Back to this lil' quick discussion
The sound that you hearin right now is somethin (somethin)
That can not be compared to others
I mean basically I'm in the league with no teams
You see, I never thought to get above B
A grade A rapper just wait and C
Feed me beats, I'll grow into a beast
Gimme a second with fame - watch what it's gon' be

[Hook] - 2X

[Outro]
Ever heard a sound like this?
Ever move a crowd like this?
Ever heard a sound like this?

[Intro/Hook: repeat 2X]
Jet lagged; Louis Vuitton bag
Under the icey they don't recognize me
So are, you following me?
Cause I +Stay Puft+ like the marshmallow man

[Tyga]
Oh my, must I been in a coma?
Cuban chicks lookin my way cause I'm so fly
Right now, should I approach him like
How was you uh, attacked like a cobra
Like some guys, but I ain't the type ma
I super thirst my girst, all hyped up (whassup now?
More words than you can think of
Feral, flashy, young and almost famed up
(T-Y) G-A the man yessir
Went from real price to please sir? (No charge) Thank you
Now that's me directing like all-star
Songs with similes making you smell like Armour
Cops, cards, me fake ID
Probably in the glove compart, I'm sorry
Underage, so you can't charge
But officer, no autograph y'all cause I'm

[Hook]

[Interlude]
I gotta supersize me (ha ha)
I gotta supersize me (I do, I do~!)
I gotta supersize me (what?)
Cause they don't recognize me (recognize me)
I gotta supersize me (I do)
I gotta supersize me (ha ha)
I gotta supersize me (uh)
Cause they don't recognize me (c'mon)

[Tyga]
Little baby steps, share harder than the next
If it goes by turns then I should be next
VT's rated X, MTV's first listen
Look under the chair - you put diamonds on your chest?
A Monopoly set? Skip Baltic Avenue
Gimme a house or a jet (no a house and a jet!)
Like Rhymefest, when I'm rhymin on the set
I need a brand new fit shoes, to have
But now, I'm lookin like more to the stars
When there's light fame they can see who you are
(See they love you now, they didn't love you before)
Well maybe right now, to them I'm so import-
-tant in the tint and the rims on the sport
Car, come along I got four
Underage, so you can't charge
But officer, no autograph y'all cause I'm

[Hook]

[Interlude] w/ (different ad libs)

[Tyga]
AHHHHHH~! I guess they gon' recognize me now after this pink stuff
We got 'em goin to the club on this track, ha ha!
G.D.I.C., Young Money NT, Decaturs!
Big Evil, Corporation I see you
Tell I made it
Ha ha!

[Interlude] w/ (different ad libs)

[Tyga]
Ahhh~! What if your mother, regretted havin your brother?
Would you forgive her and kiss her and tell her you love her?
Or would you press it? Cause bein the only child
Could leave you feelin desperate, in need of attention
Every second, but since you man of the house you never get it
Pops left without a smile but you never miss him
But when you reminiscin, you wished you had a father figure
At least weekends, man pay a visit
Awww forget it~! what about Lil' Jason up in prison?
You think an eight-year-old had bad intentions? (I don't know)
Pullin the trigger, on dad just barely killed him
Just wanted to protect moms from the brutal hittings
But he a kid so it's their word against his
Moms won't even testify scared of husband
So he in for some years, don't even know he did it
But can't regret it now, cause it's too late

[Hook: Patrick Stump] + (Tyga)
We come to life when first class takes flight
Only sing the lines that make you press rewind
Even dealing with electric, I think that he regrets it now
Heart in light, dying love, everything looks better from above
You say it's getting old but I call it vintage love now, now
Don't regret it now
(At a human's price, tryin to live that life)
(Can't slow down) Don't regret it now
(Uh-uh determined by that dice, you only roll twice)
(You broke now) Don't regret it now

[Tyga]
Let's say you and your homey, best friends one and only
Confidant, who I trust, never phony
Just I and the young guy I called my brodie
We was like age of 5 since he known me
But now it's like hazy skies and the mornings
Waking up police say he died hollows pointed
Damn I can't believe you God, why you want him?
I needed him more than you, now what, you lonely?
Just two more months man, we was good money
Now he can't go to awards and meet stars
I'm all alone now ridin in luxury cars
Life like a movie now someone press fast forward
So I can chill with him again and feel real
I'd rather have him here than this rap deal
But he can't regret it now, walkin into that crowd
Had his jewelry on - next thing, man down

[Hook]

[Patrick Stump]
Work twice as hard to get half as far
Love has legs, feet don't fail me now
Brand new boy, brand new year
Curtains open, I am a grand finale
Did you get my voice mail? Sorry I'm out
Having the time of my life
And, I'm gonna do whatever you'd do
If you could be me for one night

[Tyga]
If you could be me for one night (night)
Could you live you're life under lights? (Lights)
Laminates, cameras, ice (ice)
Four A.M. morning flights (flights)
Uh I don't think you can handle that pal
I don't think you can handle this crowd
It's t-too late, can't regret it now
It's t-too late, can't regret it now

[Patrick Stump]
We come to life when first class takes flight
Only sing the lines that make you press rewind
Even dealing with electric, I think that he regrets it now
Heart in light, dying love, everything looks better from above
You say it's getting old but I call it vintage love now
Now

[Hook]

[Intro: Tyga]
Feels good don't it?
Stress, have a lot of stress to get off my chest
{Aww baby let me talk to you baby}
Y'know I think if sometimes we would have talked it out
{Ayy, sit dowwwwwwwwwn}
And said I'm sorry... but it never happened that way
So I went to bed with my music {now listen}

[Hook]
Why do we fight, why do argue you
All through night, when we should be pillow talkin baby?
Make the wrongs, all things aside
Swallow our pride, and just love each other all the time
You got me, and I got you
What else could really matter but loooooooooovin
That's what it's all about
'til death does us part

[Tyga]
Dear Princess, remember, what I called you
Markin those calendar days away til that moment I saw you
And I fell, in love, from that very moment I saw you
Glad I, played on the phone and dialed them numbers to call you
Now I'm, thinkin about how could that go wrong?
You was so special to me like the music in this song
From my heart, I said 'til death, do us apart
But then, dated for only a month or so, how is this possible?
She she got me stutterin, my words beginnin to slur
As I say, I love her, but I'm lovin it, it feels so right
When I'm, huggin her, she sayin the same she feelin complete like
Two way streets, ringin my phone, she never hear a beep
That means, I'm answerin, fulfilling her every need and desire
Your dream, this is life with me, continuous shoppin sprees
When I'm on the road, even gave you all the security codes
So baby, tell me, tell me

[Hook]

[Tyga]
I thought it was more to what we had, her secret stash
Filled with bundles of emotions now I'm startin to notice
All that shit was bogus, all the dozens of roses
Thinkin, you was my golden token, now I'm feelin frozen
Lookin like my life is hopeless, no human
Should ever experience what I drove in, now my car is broken
My engine hood I should have never left it opened
Lookin like I'm on E, no fuel I can't even eat
Don't even want to breathe if you ain't close to me; no friends
My only enemy is Cupid, how could you be so stupid?
Please tell me why love hurts, can you even hear me?
Can you even imagine if your arrow wasn't workin for weeks
I don't, think so, I'm just tryin, to think slow
It just ain't me, so please, play the drum rolls
And roll the red carpets out, as I wait for you to return
With an explanation, so baby start explainin

[Hook]

[Outro: Tyga]
Heh~! I hope you heard the whole song
It was from me to you, somethin special
Heh~! I'm lovin this music
But I wish you was here with me
To love it too... {*fades out*}

[Chorus]
Let me take you down, 'cause I'm going to
Strawberry Fields
Nothing is real
And nothing to get hung about
Strawberry Fields forever

[Verse 1]
Living is easy with eyes closed
Misunderstanding all you see
It's getting hard to be someone, but it all works out
It doesn't matter much to me

[Chorus]
Let me take you down, 'cause I'm going to
Strawberry Fields
Nothing is real
And nothing to get hung about
Strawberry Fields forever

[Verse 2]
No one I think is in my tree
I mean, it must be high or low
That is, you can't, you know, tune in, but it's all right
That is, I think it's not too bad

[Chorus]
Let me take you down, 'cause I'm going to
Strawberry Fields
Nothing is real
And nothing to get hung about
Strawberry Fields forever

[Verse 3]
Always, no, sometimes think it's me
But you know, I know when it's a dream
I think I know, I mean—er—yes, but it's all wrong
That is, I think I disagree

[Chorus]
Let me take you down, 'cause I'm going to
Strawberry Fields
Nothing is real
And nothing to get hung about
Strawberry Fields forever
Strawberry Fields forever
Strawberry Fields forever

[Outro]
Cranberry sauce

[Verse 1]
Medication in the plastic bag
I'm a man motherfucker, you're a half a fag
My chest is hairy like the Cubans rocking silk
In the 80s on Miami beach
You're just a rabbit that be captured by the falcons feet
I hunt for the meat see me we can thump in the street
Fuck around leave you slumped in your seat
'Cause we're coming from Queens, every platter is Zagat rated
Caramelized up, bulls are getting castrated
Hold up hold up someone pass the weed to me
Fuck a routine I'm switching up the scenery
Boats with decks strictly using throats for sex
Yoga stretch, open pussy like a sofa bed
Key lime spear fishing off the Yucatan
Grab a barracuda higher than a parachuter
Pair of shooters: Anthony and Harper
Caciocavalli dog, I'm sharper than the archer
I'm an artisan down for bi-partisan
'Cause everyone getting paid, see me with the freshest fade
Charles Oakley, gecko belts and durangos
I fuck good and make big seeds like a mango
NFL ready, sculpted for the clay court
Simple spaghetti shifting in the gray sport
Suck my dick bitch real good
Mother fuck a kid, Action Bronsolino suck my balls

[Verse 2]
No disrespect ma, I'm tryna eat the pussy
Lift your legs over you head so I can taste the tushy
King Thrust is what they call me at the hooker house
260 pounds of pressure right in a hookers mouth
5'7" with the ass of of a horse
Put it in from behind its the salad I toss
She ride me like a maniac
Best believe the bitch a brainiac
She known to keep a fresh shaven cat
Milk chocolate and her eyes like the sun
Keep a loaded 22 inside her thighs and her buns
Her pussy lips are tight just like the box of a nun
She'll have a fiend itchy and scratchy for rock in the slums
Boosting in the boostiere
I give my favorite Goose away just to get a closer look at how the juices spray
Fucking tired can't go no more
My raps are marinated days ahead
Jalapeno cream cheese on the raisin bread
That's for breakfast
I've got a death wish you never catch Bronsolino in a necklace
I'm on the block like tetris
Caddy green Northstar engine
Pecan pie seats Lord I'm a legend
Queens shit man

[Hook]
I wanted you to know
That I am ready to go, heartbeat
My heartbeat
I wanted you to know
Whenever you are around, can't speak
I can't speak
I wanted you to know
That I am ready to go, heartbeat
My heartbeat
I wanted you to know
Whenever you are around, can't speak
I can't speak

[Verse 1: Childish Gambino]
I know what your boy like
Skinny tie and a cuff tight
He go and make breakfast
You walk around naked
I might just text you
Turn your phone over, when it's all over
No settling down, my text go to your screen
You know better than that
I come around when you least expect me
I'm sitting at the bar when your glass is empty
You thinking that this song's coming on to tempt me
I need to be alone like the way you left me
You start calling, you start crying
I come over, I'm inside you
I can't find you
The girl that I once had
But the sex that we have isn't half bad
The text say that "It's not fair"
That's code for "He's not here"
And I'm-a flirt with this new girl
And I'm-a call if it don't work
So we fuck till we come to conclusions
All the things that we thought we was losing
I'm ghost and you know this
That's why we broke up in the first place
Cause

[Hook]
I wanted you to know
That I am ready to go, heartbeat
My heartbeat
I wanted you to know
Whenever you are around, can't speak
I can't speak
I wanted you to know
That I am ready to go, heartbeat
My heartbeat
I wanted you to know
Whenever you are around, can't speak
I can't speak

[Verse 2: Olson]
Hab dir ein Schloss gebaut aus Luft
Zwischen Wodkarausch und Clubs
Es ist Schrott gehauen nach so vielen Versprechen
Mit diesen zwei Händen
Steh nicht mal auf eigenen Beinen, doch auf den Gästelisten der Stadt
Habe Tag und Nacht was zu feiern, doch weiß beim besten Willen nicht was
Zerspreng die Panzerketten
Bestell die Tanztabletten
Streu so viel Zucker in die Wunden bis das Salz nicht mehr brennt
Hab einen großen Palast
Dir so nobel vermacht
Und dann in eisiger Nacht
Aus eigener Kraft in den Boden gestampft
Wache steht’s in fremden Betten auf
Such den Weg ins fremde Treppenhaus
Setz ein eklig fremdes Lächeln auf
Und geh dann mit den ewig selben Sätzen raus
Du rufst an und ich mach das Handy aus
Und ich weiß wie es dich zerreißt
Und na klar vermiss ich dein Lächeln auch
Doch am meisten vermiss ich meins
Damit du weißt

[Hook]
I wanted you to know
That I am ready to go, heartbeat
My heartbeat
I wanted you to know
Whenever you are around, can't speak
I can't speak
I wanted you to know
That I am ready to go, heartbeat
My heartbeat
I wanted you to know
Whenever you are around, can't speak
I can't speak

[Verse 3: Childish Gambino]
It's late night Thursday
I know that you heard me
But you don't want the same thing
Well two can play that game
So I'm chilling with my girlfriend
But she not my real girlfriend
She got a key to my place but
She's not my real girlfriend
Stupid, so dummy
Say the wrong thing and wrong girls come runnin'
I'm paranoid that these girls want something from me
And it's hard to make a dime go one hundred
And my dude freakin' out over a worse fate
She on time, but she late for they first date
Cause he went and tried out all new condoms
Slipped off in a threesome, good problems?
Right? Wrong
Askin' him if she gonna play games
With the super smash brothers, but none of them you
I miss the sex when you kiss whenever you through
Sixty-nine is the only dinner for two
I was wrong, but would you have listened to you?
Uh, you were crazy
I got a heart, but the artichoke
Is the only thing girls want when you in that stroke
And like

[Hook]
I wanted you to know
That I am ready to go, heartbeat
My heartbeat
I wanted you to know
Whenever you are around, can't speak
I can't speak
I wanted you to know
That I am ready to go, heartbeat
My heartbeat
I wanted you to know
Whenever you are around, can't speak
I can't speak

[Intro: Action Bronson]
Bronsolino, damn
Been on the honor roll, sculptures of my body out in Nagano
My shawty features like Madonna-
I ain't like that one
Yo, line for line
Straight up lambs on the arm, Giambi lenses
Ken Caminiti, Bosworth

[Verse 1: Action Bronson]
Been on the honor roll, sculptures of my body out in Nagano
My shawty features like Madonna, Lo designer
Bending these young Lola Fellanas over. Ace the test
Baste the breast with the juices
Under the influence of fly shit, I glide like Ovechkin
Disqus hoody, puff hibiscus, balance be the crispest
Baby girl, you're wylin if you sniff this
You gotta take a piss test, piss right through your fishnets
Robert Moses State Park, lamb in the sand
Blam blam a piggie try to put my fam in the can
Strictly cop and go's, until we laid in the Galapagos
Eating tacos, higher than a opera note
We never ride Civics, the Mont Blanc scripted lyrics
It's like avant garde to the critics
I throw you in that armbar with the quickness
Either you with me or bitch you on the shit list

[Verse 2: Roc Marciano]
Bitch, please, picture me in Sicily
The hard bottoms gators is slippery
I just had an epiphany
And now I'm shittin' on your whole steez ridiculously
45. fire at ya attire, to break your armor up like fine china
Fly designer hoes diggin for gold like a 49er
I hit the diner, the Carolina
Pass the lighter to the passenger in the spyder
Vagina splash like apple cider
So fuck your little 2 cents blue benz bitches jump like Harold Miner
I'm in the recliner, we traced like eye liner
And I escape like MacGyver
Bank robbers, bang 38's to taste cobbler
And lay up with a case of vodka
Get cake and prosper
Ate steak and lobster to Frank Sinatra
Air you out, leave your face for pasta
Get laced and dip the jakes in the grey Boxster
Beige fox, 88 Clarks
Ladies identify gangsters' posture
I'm feeling like J Hoffa
Fuck yall, eat a fat dick with the monster
Kim kardashian, kim kardashian, kim kardashian
Kim kardashian, kim kardashian, kim kardashian
Kim kardashian, kim kardashian, kim kardashian

[Verse 1]
When the rain is blowing in your face
And the whole world is on your case
I could offer you a warm embrace
To make you feel my love

[Verse 2]
When the evening shadows and the stars appear
And there is no one there to dry your tears
I could hold you for a million years
To make you feel my love

[Bridge 1]
I know you haven't made your mind up yet
But I will never do you wrong
I've known it from the moment that we met
No doubt in my mind where you belong

[Verse 3]
I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue
I'd go crawling down the avenue
Know there's nothing that I wouldn't do
To make you feel my love

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge 2]
The storms are raging on the rollin' sea
And on the highway of regret
The winds of change are blowing wild and free
You ain't seen nothing like me yet

[Verse 4]
I could make you happy, make your dreams come true
Nothing that I wouldn't do
Go to the ends of the earth for you
To make you feel my love
To make you feel my love

[Verse 1]
Your butt is wide, well mine is too
Just watch your mouth or I'll sit on you
The word is out, better treat me right
'Cause I'm the king of cellulite
Ham on, ham on, ham on whole wheat, all right
My zippers bust, my buckles break
I'm too much man for you to take
The pavement cracks when I fall down
I've got more chins than Chinatown

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Well, I've never used a phone booth
And I've never seen my toes
When I'm goin' to the movies
I take up seven rows

[Chorus]
Because I'm fat, I'm fat, come on
(Fat, fat, really really fat)
You know I'm fat, I'm fat, you know it
(Fat, fat, really really fat)
You know I'm fat, I'm fat, come on you know
(Fat, fat, really really fat)
Don't you call me pudgy, portly or stout
Just now tell me once again who's fat

[Verse 2]
When I walk out to get my mail
It measures on the Richter scale
Down at the beach I'm a lucky man
I'm the only one who gets a tan
If I have one more pie a la mode
I'm gonna need my own zip code

[Pre-Chorus 2]
When you're only having seconds
I'm having twenty-thirds
When I go to get my shoes shined
I gotta take their word

[Chorus]
Because I'm fat, I'm fat, sham on
(Fat, fat, really really fat)
You know I'm fat, I'm fat, you know it
(Fat, fat, really really fat)
You know I'm fat, I'm fat, you know it you know
(Fat, fat, really really fat)
And my shadow weighs forty-two pounds
Lemme tell you once again who's fat

[Bridge]
If you see me comin' your way
Better give me plenty space
If I tell you that I'm hungry
Then won't you feed my face

[Chorus]
Because I'm fat, I'm fat, sha mone
(Fat, fat, really really fat)
You know I'm fat, I'm fat, you know it
(Fat, fat, really really fat)
You know I'm fat, I'm fat, you know it, you know
(Fat, fat, really really fat)
Woo woo woo, when I sit around the house
I really sit around the house
You know I'm fat, I'm fat, come on
(Fat, fat, really really fat)
You know I'm fat, I'm fat, you know it, you know it
(Fat, fat, really really fat)
You know, you know, you know, come on
(Fat, fat, really really fat)
And you know all by myself I'm a crowd
Lemme tell you once again
You know I'm huge, I'm fat, you know it
(Fat, fat, really really fat)
You know I'm fat, you know, hoo
(Fat, fat, really really fat)
You know I'm fat, I'm fat, you know it, you know
(Fat, fat, really really fat)
And the whole world knows I'm fat and I'm proud
Just tell me once again who's fat

[Verse 1]
I see you picked me out from the crowd
Could it be the way I play guitar?
Master of the soft, not too loud
One day maybe I will be a star
I see you picked me out like you want something
Shame on you babe, can't you see this ring?

[Chorus]
What do you want me to do, girl?
What do you want me to do, babe?
What do you want me to do, girl?
What do you want me to do, babe?

[Verse 2]
I got a woman, you got a man
So we got to do what's right
I said you'd get beheaded in other lands
If I were in your arms tonight
Quit trying to get me under that icy plunder
Boy oh boy, what a scare!

[Chorus]
What do you want me to do, girl?
What do you want me to do, babe?
What do you want me to do, girl?
What do you want me to do, babe?

[Bridge]
You picked me out of the crowd and
Ooh, just so bold and so proud and
Dressed like you want everybody to just say
"Wow! Didn't her mama teach her better?
Ow! Dressed like that somebody gon' get her!"

[Verse 3]
I see you picked me from the crowd
Could it be the way I play guitar?
Master of the soft, not too loud
I don't ever really want to be where you are

[Chorus]
What do you want me to do, girl?
What do you want me to do, babe?
What do you want me to do, girl?
What do you want me to do, babe?

[Verse 1]
As merry as the days were long
I was right and you were wrong
Back at the old grey school
I would win and you would lose
But you've got everything now
You've got everything now
And what a terrible mess I've made of my life
Oh, what a mess I've made of my life

[Chorus 1]
No, I've never had a job
Because I've never wanted one
I've seen you smile
But I've never really heard you laugh
So who is rich and who is poor?
I cannot say... oh
You are your mother's only son
And you're a desperate one
Oh...
But I don't want a lover
I just want to be seen... oh...
In the back of your car

[Verse 2]
A friendship sadly lost?
Well this is true...and yet, it's false, oh...
But did I ever tell you, by the way?
I never did like your face, oh...
But you've got everything now
You've got everything now
And what a terrible mess I've made of my life
Oh, what a mess I've made of my life

[Chorus 2]
No, I've never had a job
Because I'm too shy
I've seen you smile
But I've never really heard you laugh
So who is rich and who is poor?
I cannot say... oh
Oh...
You are your mother's only son
And you're a desperate one
Oh...
But I don't want a lover
I just want to be tied... oh... to the back of your car
To the back of your car
To the back of your car
To the back of your car
To the back of your car
To the back of your car
Oh...

[Verse 1]
Gipsy Salami cheese is from the cave
Wild dandelion greens dressed up on the plate
Parmesan crisp, we wildin' in Marea
Doing all the drugs off of Pico and Labrea
Peace to Kings English, sticky green fingers
Brock Fetch Polaroids
Bitches named Inga
Cunnilingus, Buddy Holly singin
Hash between my butt cheeks, hookers in the plush suite
Whole grain mustard, 12 grain bread
Move cocaine out of Spokane, I got no shame
Spit the propane, relieve you of your gold chain
Go to bed without even knowing the hoes name
Hazelnut spread, banana on the bread
Treat you like a shark, put the hammer on your head
Mock neck sweaters, Alpaca on the threads
Fat black leathers. Leave your body in the shed
Damn

[Hook]
Ron Simmons
Peace to motherfucking Iceland
Ron Simmons
Ron Simmons
Ron, Ron Simmons
Ron Simmons

[Verse 2]
Damn, your fucking with a pro kid
No triple A I went straight up to the show, kid
While You can catch me out in Spain on the coast, dick
Don't ever say my fucking music sound like Ghost shit
Born alone, stood strong for half of fifty
Vocal reminiscing of a kid that hold a semi
Old and sweaty, motherfucker shit the bed
They crying in the corner while their shorty give me head
Yeah, ice sculptures, Venezuelan white vultures Chinese wizardry, long capes
Old grapes in the glasses she suck me while I'm flaccid
Every summer catch me grilling steaks by Lake Placid
Dabble then pass it, don't ever babble or get blasted
Bitches ass to ass, double dildos made of plastic
Remain classic with all this flash inside the pan shit
Like Jr. Griffey smashing homers, never land bitch

Damn, we never land bitch
Yeah, we never land bitch
Kinda high, never land bitch
But you can see me eatin Lamb, bitch
Damn
"Never too late, too late to stop stop, never too late, too late to stop stop"

I'm tryna have the wrist all glitted up
Whip all kitted up
Niggas say Cam change, wiz couldn't give a fuck
Spit it like my last song, one life live it up
Niggas see Cam's change, kids couldn't get a buck
So please don't approach me man
Like this a free show, cause you don't know me fam
And please don't extend your hands like you know we fam
And please don't pretend like we homies scram
Where was all this love at when I was only Cam?
When I was tryna sell y'all my only jam?
I don't keep friends, I'm my only fan
And take falls, I'll never, I will only stand
Ima make this all riches, is what I told E then
If you don't know me now, then how you know me then?
And I hope y'all loving the kid, but if not, its

"Never too late, too late to stop stop, never too late, too late to stop stop"
Im tryna have the strip all whipped out
Crib all pimped out
Chicks smiling in my face, tongues all licked out
Flat on the front side, back all sticking out
Waiting for that one time, a rap nigga dig her out
But you gone have to slow up love
Tryna skee cause she think ima blow up cuz
All she thinking me getting her nails done, and her hair done
Ma I'm not the one
Ion need no chick plotting all my chips
No birds tryna fly with me on my trips
If I am with a Miss, she a down ass chick
So take a sec, just chill and get off my tip
I'm just tryna get rich of these tracks I get
And you tryna get rich off the scratch I get
And you chicks think it's all about bread, but it's not, its..

"Never too late, too late to stop stop"
"Cause I wan't to tell you, that there's no point in hating anybody, because to the extent that you tear down another, you tear down yourself (yea, yea), we have to understand that"

I'm tryna have the city on lockdown
Fam off the block now
Money coming fast, more cash then the cops now
Would harass, but they can't really not now
Used to laugh, but your man's really hot now
I used to rap for the kids in class
Told em I would use rap just to get my cash
And I was only worried bout how to get my math
And told my teachers and the staff they can kiss my ass
Cause I can't find a interest in my book
So I stayed to myself in every class I took
Supposed to be doing work, but I made my hooks
Cause I get motivation everywhere I look
And I show no regret for any chance I took
But I learn from mistakes just like I should
So if you dudes ain't paid your dues, for you fools its..
"Never too late, too late too stop stop, never too late, too late to stop stop"

[Refrain]
Jungle Rule - can't be no fool
Jungle Rule - can't be no fool
(I needed a little taste to that)

[Verse 1]
Twisting joints like a contortionist
Laid in the Porsche
My father driving
Days been sunny since I started rhyming
No denying me; I'm known to keep a fresh foot like podiatry
Nobody high as me
Green Timbs, in Vegas I'm like Steve Wynn
At the same time, fellatio from three twins
Those are triplets; I've been wilding since the Rabbi snipped it
Then they laughed, and ate brisket, fuck!
On my behalf, he had a meeting at the Neptune
Had little daddy hide the heater in the restroom
Guns drawn like my bath by my lady friend
Mesothelioma money: drop Mercedes-Benz
And I ain't never left, you know I'm still here
Spit the shit to bring a cripple out the wheelchair
Bite a bitch like George Whipple in the stair case
Long as she got big nipples and a tan face

[Refrain]
Jungle Rule - can't be no fool
(Yeah, you're in the concrete right now)
Devil is on the loose, no coop

[Verse 2]
Foul living like Sandusky and Paterno
I've been husky, motherfuckers couldn't touch me
'Lo rugby with an Asian model so ugly
Celebration 1987, no bubbly
Facially, I'm like a young John Kennedy
More obscenity; EBT in Genovese
Go to Ock, get 70 for 100
I want the 75 from Ocky but he fronted
Take the money, cop 5 dimes, 2 chicken sandwiches, 9 limes
For the Canada Dry; pose for the cameras by the banister, "Hi"
In the summer, rock the vest set – Salmon Kani
Flex the three-quarter cream Fi's
We some esteemed Gs; steamed red snapper – Vietnamese
Catch a case, get a Jewish lawyer, beat it with cheese
Fuck the beef cause it don't go together, read em and weep
It's very easy, make you disappear now, kid
Make your paper, but you need to stay grounded
Eyes wide like a chick that got the dick in the butt
We're out here, trying to get the money, baby, live it up

[Outro]
Talk about me if you please, but I must be Hercules
Hercules
I must be Hercules!

[Verse 1]
Yeah, girl, it's late at night and I'm driving
Over to your crib for some action
And I just can’t wait to put it down (Down)
I just wanna work you out (Out), I'm pulling up in your driveway
Could you keep the door unlocked? I'm coming in, girl
A nigga going up the stairs into the bedroom
A bubble bath, rose petals on the floor
We gon' do it all night, we gon' do it all night

[Pre-Chorus]
So baby, can we play a little game?
Girl, your body on mine, up and down
Just make me work for it, work for it, baby
I'ma give you the business and girl, you gon' get when I start really using my tongue, baby

[Chorus]
Yeah girl (Yeah girl), whenever I'm in your city
You know I'ma blow 'bout 50 and I'ma fuck the city up (Now, yeah)
I'ma give my love to you, you, I'ma fuck the city up
I'm coming over, babe (Babe), over over, babe (Babe) and I'ma fuck the city up (City up, yeah)
I'm hella paid, h-hella paid, so I'ma fuck the city up

[Verse 2]
Girl, it’s 1 AM to me, I know it’s kinda early
But let’s take it in for the night, baby
But if you wanna bring your friends (Haha)
She can come, she can come (Fuck it up, fuck it up)
Just let me lay you both on the bed, hands on the pillow
I'ma go deep, putting in work in the middle
Ass up, face down, baby, I'ma work it out
The three of us holding hands screaming a little
Both of y'all can get it all (Can get it all, can get it all, can get it all)

[Pre-Chorus]
So baby, can we play a little game?
Girl, your body on mine, up and down
Just make me work for it, work for it, baby
I'ma give you the business and girl, you gon' get when I start really using my tongue, baby

[Chorus]
Yeah girl (Yeah girl), whenever I'm in your city (Ayy)
You know I'ma blow 'bout 50 (Ayy) and I'ma fuck the city up (Now, yeah)
I'ma give my love to you, you, I'ma fuck the city up
I'm coming over, babe (Babe), over over, babe (Babe) and I'ma fuck the city up (City up, yeah)
I'm hella paid, h-hella paid, so I'ma fuck the city up (What? Look, ha)

[Verse 3]
The nightlife rough, I fuck the city up
Ride this bitch all night, tell her giddy up
Champagne, some new drinks, some new bucks
My life’s too bright, thank my jeweler
This is the epitome of jealousy
When niggas expect me to strike out, like a felony
It’s not my intention to lash out, but you tellin' me
A nigga that he never be one of the
The greatest
Bitch, you hatin' 'cause a nigga made it
When I was cuttin' records in my fuckin' basement
A lil', lil' nigga couldn't get a placement
But like a spaceship I'm outta here and outta fear
You bring the uh and I buy the beer
Lookin' at my chain, it's like a chandelier
But these diamonds here and these diamonds real

[Pre-Chorus]
So baby, can we play a little game? (Haha, yeah)
Girl, your body on mine, up and down (Shake it for me)
Just make me work for it, work for it, baby (Haha, work)
I'ma give you the business and girl, you gon' get when I start really using my tongue (Like), baby

[Chorus]
Yeah girl (What?), whenever I'm in your city (Yeah!)
You know I'ma blow 'bout 50 (Ayy) and I'ma fuck the city up (Yeah, now, yeah)
I'ma give my love to you (Woo!), you (Woo!), I'ma fuck the city up (Yeah!)
I'm coming over, babe (Babe, over babe), over over, babe (Babe, over babe) and I'ma fuck the city up (Yeah, city up, yeah)
I'm hella paid (Yeah!), h-hella paid (Woo!), so I'ma fuck the city up
Explain

[Intro:]
I'mma smoke a trippy stick on this one
OG Hash Oil

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Roll a joint, roll another one
When it's all said and done
I'll be at the top bitch
Cause I hustle a lot
Them cars, we pulling 'em off the lot
Don't even test drive it before I cop
Just boarded a yacht
We're at the craps table in Vegas
The dealer saying how he admiring my watch
I'm placing my wager
Don't even care about how much paper I blow
Cause I been getting this money and stay on
A couple things that I know
I'm blowing that stink by the O
My weed so strong I swear to god you would think it's cologne
I go anywhere in the world and just make it my home
Staying at the highest level but I didn't make it alone
Now that my money right them suckers keep thinking I'm wrong
But I'm just switching lanes, foot off the brake and I'm gone
If you ain't talking money homie, you can't get a call
Cause this a muthafuckin life that you can't live at all
I'm getting high while I drive, I ain't thinking of y'all...

[Hook]
I just wanna ride in my ride with my top down
And smoke weed with my niggas

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Still rolling weed on my XXL
Only difference is that's me on the cover
Once in a while call my little sister and tell her I love her
Cause shit can get crazy in this industry
Most of your friends become your enemies
That's why I stay down with the ones that's still with me
The niggas who started and they down to ride to the end with me
Make sure the positive energy keep flowing
All the weed keep rolling
And all of us keep getting high, the sky
We gonna keep from falling
Niggas keep hating, but baby I'mma keep ballin'
A lot of y'all turned fakers, you found out what I make
Now I'm buying a steak
Going on private island vacations
Flying on private planes
I'm cool with the pilot, he let me roll something
Put on a movie, let my girl watch it
At the dealer, high, look at that Ferrari option
Just an everyday life, when you young and bossin..

[Hook]

I Love You Baby ;)

[Intro: Rob Markman]
Nobody to call, your big homie Rob
You know what it is, it's Rob Markman on Twitter
Send all your hate mail
You know how we do it

[Hook]
Gettin' paid's just a regular thing to us
Cause if it ain't gettin' money, it's strange to us
And if you don't wanna smoke, you ain't gotta pay
Rolling up by myself trying to find a way
Floating away, floating away
Floating away, floating away

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
I, swear I got so high, last night I don't even remember goin to sleep
But I do know that these Louis's go with my feet
And the critics they feel how my lyrics do go over beats
Twenty-K shoppin' when dude go overseas
Smokin' weed in the most expensive suite
Even though we ain't supposed to be livin' anywhere close to these people
How they gon' hate on me, I got more bread than most of these people
Don't wish death on my enemies, I pour a toast for 'em
And keep positive energy and hella smoke for 'em
Bombay and high-grade liquor for my niggas
Never seen a ghost in person, now she ridin' in one
Never seen a ghost in person, cost me five figures
That's like fifty G's a person if you ridin' with us
To the sky's limits, Roll some weed, and get high with winners
My niggas eating when it's time for dinner

[Hook]
Gettin' paid's just a regular thing to us
Cause if it ain't gettin' money, it's strange to us
And if you don't wanna smoke, you ain't gotta pay
Rolling up by myself trying to find a way
Floating away, floating away
Floating away, floating away

[Interview: Rob Markman & Wiz Khalifa]
We see you come out of Pittsburgh
Chevy Woods is always by your side
But you're building a team now?
Absolutely
The team just consists of what has motivated me
To get to this point
And what I see taking me into the future
Not me personally, but I feel like my spirit is worldwide
And we all share the same spirit

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Uh, I'm higher than a plane and I don't wanna land
Every time I speak I see a hundred grand
Rollin' so much weed it's like the motherland
I ain't talkin' English, I'm talkin' rubber bands
Jacksons, Franklins, either one of them
You ain't talkin' paper, dawg, so you don't understand
Spazzin' on these niggas, bitch I'm goin' H.A.M
Taxin' all these niggas call me Uncle Sam
Rappin' got me on the beach relaxin'
Smokin' OG, by the LB now the Ocean's filled with ashes
And niggas keep on hatin', I just roll one get my cash and
Hear 'em talk bout what they gon' do, but I know that ain't gon' happen

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
When you think of a gang of real niggas spendin' money
Then you thinkin' bout us
When you think of who came in here bought anything they wanted
Then you thinkin' bout us
When you think of some niggas who gon' get it how they live
Then you thinkin' bout us
When you think of who really out here doin' it big
Then you thinkin' bout us

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
I roll 'em faster than a train and I don't wanna stop
Niggas say "need a verse", they 50 grand a pop
Smokin' on the best, graded at the top
Finish up another tour and buy another watch
Fly a new plane, board another yacht
Do another show, I'm out here gettin' paid, but you will never know
My cheese so long, my weed so strong, think I'mma overdose
Uhhh, man I'm baggin' it, MCM bag, loud pack in it
Try turn down but I can't get it
I'mma roll one, pass it around til everybody in the room can't finish
You a fuck nigga so you can't hit it, ball so hard that you can't win it
So much money bank can't fit it, had my own style til you ran wit it
OG kush I'm the man wit it

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
When you think of a gang of real niggas spendin' money
Then you thinkin' bout us
When you think of who came in here bought anything they wanted
Then you thinkin' bout us
When you think of some niggas who gon' get it how they live
Then you thinkin' bout us
When you think of who really out here doin' it big
Then you thinkin' bout us

[Interview: Rob Markman & Wiz Khalifa]
Recently you wrote a letter to your fans
And it was about four or five paragraphs
And about two sentences said
“Rolling Papers, maybe I would’ve done it different.”
Honestly, that was just me being real with myself
And real with my fans
Rolling Papers was a learning experience
Just like how everything  was
And me getting with a label and trying new things
Like I say, I'm not a stubborn person
So, I work with different people
I write different records that people may say that they like
You gotta try different things, you gotta do different things
But when you talk about longevity
You can't base that off one year or six months
Or eight months or anything like that
So, really I was just speaking to anybody that was
Riding with me for the long run
And who's looking for the next thing for me
To do

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Wake up to the cleanin' lady knockin' and shit
I close the door so I can bake up
Cause yesterday we, partied the night away, stumbled in close to four
Room full of expensive bags, still all the shit on the floor
But that's just how you live when your wife's a model
Smoke a pound soon as we touch down, do the same thing twice tomorrow
Not to mention what I spend in the club, nigga don't need a price the bottle
I promise my weed exotic, all my tree is fire, when you see me I'm just

[Hook]
Floating on that chronic, floating on that chronic
I'm just floating on that chronic, floating on that chronic
Floating floating on that chronic, floating on that chronic
I'm just floating on that chronic, floating on that chronic
Floating, floating

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Down the street, pound a beat, I smoke a pound a week
Heard about it, don't believe, come to my house and see
I'll be high, I'll be somewhere where them ounces be
California kush, New York smokin' sour D
Detroit bubba kush, ATL it's OG
Ask my nigga Berner, err'body know me
Out in Amsterdam, Wizzle smokin' overseas
I'm gon' hit this bong for everyone who smoke trees!

[Hook]
Floating on that chronic, floating on that chronic
I'm just floating on that chronic, floating on that chronic
Floating floating on that chronic, floating on that chronic
I'm just floating on that chronic, floating on that chronic
Floating, floating

[Interview: Rob Markman & Wiz Khalifa]
You said a lot
I'ma translate just for the people:
That phone's been ringing

Hahahahahahahaha

They wanna know who can get up with Taylor Gang
I imagine these labels are really throwing
Some things at you for your business mind
As well as your artistry

I don't know how to say it
We don't have shit
When we start out we don't have shit
So we really make due with what we have
And in turn that turns into million dollar corporations
But what labels don't have is that mind frame
That spark that makes that million dollars
They know how to manifest that
And make more millions off of that
But they don't have that spark

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
God damn, I'm rich as fuck, drunk as hell
Throwin' money, pick it up, life is good, live it up
How much for that bottle? put it on my tab
Hop out like a model all them foreign tags
Get so drunk and high, I'll have to call a cab
You won't end up giving it back if you had this for one night

[Hook]
One night
One night
One night
One night
One night
One night
You could have this for one night
One night
One night
One night
One night
One night
One night
Let you try it for one night
One night

One night
You could have this for one night

You could have this for one night

Ooo, we in the club goin' bizzurk
My OG sippin' on that sizzurp
I mix the OG with the pizzurp
I O.D. spilled it on my shizurt
Drinking Bombay so I'm slizzered
My diamond chain lookin' like a blizzard
So many rings, my fingers startin' to hizzurt
If you didn't know me you'd swear I had that Wizard
And I'm from Pittsburgh

[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]
Roll one then I'll light it, order one and I'll buy it
If it's green then I'll try it, too drunk to now drive
Don't know where I'm going, all I know is I'm flyin'
And that's as real as it gets, make you feel like you the shit for one night

[Hook]
One night
One night
One night
One night
One night
One night
You could have this for one night
One night
One night
One night
One night
One night
One night
Let you try it for one night
One night
One night

One night
One night
One night
You could have this for one night
One night

You could have this for one night

[Interview: Rob Markman & Wiz Khalifa]
You're in the tabloids, so that's another pressure
So it's the business, it's the celebrity
And then you gotta make the same music
That you used to make

Yeah. You know, what inspired me back then
Is the same shit that inspires me now
And it's just life
You know, like what I hear, what I see
I'm really sensitive to everything that goes on around me
And I really don't think too much about shit

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
Lifestyles of the rich and famous
Well I'm rich and famous
But if you got money, they know what you're name is
If you don't, you're nameless

[Verse 1: Chevy Woods]
84, that's 3 in the pot, these niggas jealous, I'm something they're not
It's all good, shit, I expected that
Shit, I've been asleep since we lifted off where we left at
Yeah it's cool to you, but it's what we deserve
Needle on the track, I'm dope, you niggas got some nerve
That's drug talk, '88 Volvo, gold B.B.'s, man rest in peace, Macho
Shit, where I'm from, even kids know the call
Hit it with some ice, just to cool it off
I was workin up on that corner like I had a job
Up in the corner servin', I ain't have a prob
I'm still feel like I'm sleeping
With all of this happenin', am I dreamin'?
But, shit, I'm high and I'm wide awake
And I what I want I can afford, ain't that an escape

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
Lifestyles of the rich and famous
Well I'm rich and famous
But if you got money, they know what you're name is
If you don't, you're nameless

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Uh, talkin' raw papers and long leathers
Nigga, my drawer filled with couture textures
Killin' these niggas, bring more stretchers
Amazed by how I'm in that new Mason Martin Margiela
With my team, we're at the car dealer
Smokin' big green, I'm talkin' Godzilla
You're talkin' money, then you sound familiar
The suite wasn't big enough so me, I bought the villa
The whip was sick enough, I went and got the ill one
Your tree wasn't enough, good thing I brought some killa
Bitch I'm a king, and all my team is loyal niggas
My wife's a queen with diamond rings and full chinchillas
And I was raised with niggas with get-money intentions
Lot of young niggas gettin' made, but I'm the realest
Give a fuck about if a nigga hatin'
My dollar accumulation; my only motivation

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
Lifestyles of the rich and famous
Well I'm rich and famous
But if you got money, they know what you're name is
If you don't, you're nameless

[Interview: Wiz Khalifa & Rob Markman]
I'm pretty sure he likes my music

He might. he's aware of it, we know that

If you like rap music, if you like hard stuff
You can't deny it

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Uhh, hundred thousand dollars, it may sound like it's a lot
Really it's not to me, now grab some of this weed and roll this pot
I had to speed up, cause all these niggas slow
I probably won't be up in there if I ain't got an O
Now I got my feet up cause I'm on top and niggas hopin' that I stop
But I'm just smokin', livin' life like in the movies that I watch
In my jacuzzi, roll another doobie
See what's newest on Netflix, order another movie
See I'm smokin' the best shit
Mo'fuckers ain't ballin', so they're seein' the exit
I stay on my job so you can see I'm up next
Dawg I be goin' so hard, some say I'm needin' some rest
Got so much smoke in my lungs, it ain't s'posed to be on my chest
And niggas talk but don't even be on them jets
Man they don't even seein' them checks
But you can tell by how I spit it, nigga I be gettin' dough
Take her all the places that she never been befo'

[Hook: Amber Rose]
(Don't give a fuck about the)
Money, clothes, cars
I've never been, this far
And fuck that other shit them niggas talking about
I've never been, this high

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
I'm in my Grand Natty, smokin' on that granddaddy
It got an odor like a motor runnin', fantastic
Never the minor things, I'm movin' on to finer things
Yellow stone, diamond rings, Balmain designer jeans
Chanel frames, Louis scarves, movin' like the mob
I'm gettin' money, so maybe baby come get a job
So fuck them other bitches, we onto other business
And fuck them other niggas, we at them dollar figures
Versace chains, gold rollies, it's the same game
Racked up, shawty, Rosé bottles every day
Sipping that purple stuff, twistin' the pretty leaf
Pull up in that Ferrari, this bitch in disbelief
On the road to the riches, 'nother crook in the castle
Only fuck with my niggas, pray we all livin' lavish
I pray we all livin' so lavish
I pray we all livin' so lavish

[Hook: Amber Rose]
(Don't give a fuck about the)
Money, clothes, cars
I've never been, this far
And fuck that other shit them niggas talking about
I've never been, this high

[Interview: Rob Markman & Wiz Khalifa]
So you're not a pop rapper? You said, nah
Yeah, I'ma pop rapper
I'll pop up and make $5 million nigga

How does that feel man, like...
Does anybody have regular size papers out there?
King size? I'll use those
Let me see that grinder

[Hook]
Got the windows down, radio's on

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
You got it all, well at least you think you do
When it's time to ball, niggas better think of you
You see the life you wanna live on TV and wanna be a part of it
Spend every night just popping bottles, pouring drinks in VIP, and you love it
The more you make, the more they hate, the more they're fake, don't worry, that's just how the game go
The more you make, the more they hate, the more they're fake, but I'm just singin' the same note, playin' the same song

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
You got it all, well at least they think you do (woo, yeah)
When they say workin' hard, man, they better think of you
Cause all these plaques, nigga, that's because of it
Wouldn't have shit if it wasn't for it
Smokin' on medicinal, spraying ozium to try cover it
In the game playin' hard, but I'm just in the game, I ain't in love with it
Y'all niggas tryin' to get famous, a nigga like me tryin' to get fuckin' rich
Fuckin' rich, fuckin' rich, broke ass niggas can't fuck with this
Fuck a deal, when it goes down, got a hundred mill on my bucket list
Y'all niggas gon' keep on hatin' but we ain't gonna stop then
You'll catch me in somethin' foreign and the top gon' be droppin'

[Hook]

[Interview: Rob Markman & Wiz Khalifa]
When you think of those, you think of the
Jay Zs, the Diddys and Master P back when he was
Really, really getting it
Now, you didn't rank— number 11 is a nice place to land

Yeah, that's cool. And I did that on accident

You tripped and just fell?

Nah, forreal, I didn't even do that on purpose bro
I'm not even stuntin' so imagine when I start tryin'

[Intro: Wiz Khalifa]
Yeah
Rolling weed while I'm drivin' nigga
Uh, uh

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
I'm cool with the new me
Some niggas told me they wish I'd go back to the old me
But don't even know me
Cause I be on some rich nigga shit
Guess they comfortable with the broke me
I blow by the O.Z
But you knew that and all you niggas knew this jackin'
Now you muthafuckas owe me
Some people ask why I be low-key
Guess I'm too real for me to act like I'm your homie
A lot of niggas try to get involved when they see you make it on your own
Hear they songs, but they not as real
Cause when you got it all, something's gotta give
And we ain't talking if it's not about a dollar bill

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
I got so many things running through my mind...
Just drink and smoke, while the flow unwinds...

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Amazed how I get so much paper
I'm more amazed how you could be such a hater
Getting my lemonade squeezed fresh
No refrigerator touching my shit
Private island, waiter, chef, maid, butler
Riding jet skis all day
Come home the bed already made for us
Niggas who's winning like this they got a name for us
Fucking champions cause we run the game, Forrest

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
I got so many things running through my mind...
Just drink and smoke, while the flow unwinds...

[Interview: Rob Markman & Wiz Khalifa]
I mean why'd you do that?
How does that fall in line with your whole ideology of being a Taylor?

Taylors do what they want to do
That's the ideology about it
For me, personally, I prided myself on doing
Things that were different
And kinda like unacceptable and weird
So when I start seeing things become the norm
I kinda stray away from that

[Intro: Wiz Khalifa]
Young niggas in this bitch
Trippy ass niggas in this bitch
Rich icons muhfucka
Creative motherfuckin' genius
And I don't give a shit
Street up

[Chorus]
Roll it up, light it up, have a puff, let's take a plane
Roll it up, light it up, have a puff, let's take a plane
Roll it up, light it up, have a puff, let's take a plane
Roll it up, light it up, have a puff, let's take a plane

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Nothin' but gin in my trippy cup, pouring more, I can't get enough
Young Khalifa on that hippie stuff, I break it down and it lifts me up
So much shinin', so much diamonds, all that there comes from so much grindin'
So much weed up in my lungs, I'm in the air, I'm somewhere flyin'
In your town I cop me a pound, show me one and I'll roll one
All my niggas straight drug addicts cause it takes one for you to know one
Bake somethin' and never hold none, young niggas with some old lungs
Catch me out at your college campus, weed rolled with a cold one
Outside with my new car, my Chally parked by my old one
Got a couple of rollies dawg, but I'm usually rocking a gold one
Catching flight on them private planes, Ferrari doors I close 'em
Don't talk a mil', you ain't sold one, don't talk a pound, you ain't smoked one

[Chorus]
Roll it up, light it up, have a puff, let's take a plane
Roll it up, light it up, have a puff, let's take a plane
Roll it up, light it up, have a puff, let's take a plane
Roll it up, light it up, have a puff, let's take a plane

[Verse 2: Juicy J]
Smokin' and sippin' while watching hoes strippin'
Poppin' and rollin', I'm chieffin' this potent
Dope by my side with the pistol and chopper
Got from my bitch and she get from her mama
Talking like this, I be walking like this
Sold a few hoes and I bought a new bitch
Taylor Gang niggas the number one chieffas
Smokin' on gas prolly louder than speakers
Mix with the hash, dip in the lean blue dream, I'm a fucking fiend
Standing on Fairfax getting smoked out with them niggas from Supreme
Trippy sticks, bong rips, blunt dip, I'm down to do whatever
She wanna pop a molly man, Juicy J gon' fuckin' let her
For a stronger strain I'm spending bands, this ain't no reggie
When it's 'bout this gettin' high, ain't nothin you can tell me
Xanax bars, beans and syrup, that's my trippy kit
I'm like a pimp in the club working your bitch

[Chorus]
Roll it up, light it up, have a puff, let's take a plane
Roll it up, light it up, have a puff, let's take a plane
Roll it up, light it up, have a puff, let's take a plane
Roll it up, light it up, have a puff, let's take a plane

[Interview: Wiz Khalifa]
I don't like to say I because we're a collective
Sledgren makes the beats and fuckin' Cardo
Or Jerm does the engineering
Or me and Chevy sit around and talk about shit
And come up with shit
We made it comfortable for a lot of people to do
Like what they're doin' and feel cool doin' that shit
So what we're gonna do with this mixtape is
Really just turn it around and step that up

[Verse 1: Kool A.D.]
Yo, brown Napoleon Dynamite, white Dolemite
Sho' Ya Right, Holy Moly, totally tight
White America, good morning Erykah
Badu, where are you at?
Allahu Akbar, do that, do that, do that
Do-do that that that
Do do do, do do that
Do that, show that, pro-black, pro-brown
Down, round, getting down, down
Yippee-kai-yai-yay, it's a showdown
Girls say chill, you ain't too cool to be nice to boo-boo
You right, you right, you right, true, true
Sorry if I'm acting too cuckoo
All the zoom zoom got me acting like there's flowers in my doo doo
I'mma roll the dice for some new shoes
If that don't work then, boo hoo
At least you couldn't say I never grew two
If I can't win, then it's lose-lose
Do it for the kids like Blue's Clues
Choo-choo-choose to be
Half-asshole, half-bashful
Uh, give me like half a glass full
Or maybe a quarter that
I'm like a black quarterback
In the motherfucking... oh shit, bobbing, ducking
Weaving, passing and running
Passing and running, passing and running
Like a caravan
Um, wait, what was it?
I don't even know, buddy
Exactly

[Verse 2: Action Bronson]
As my grandma knits the sweater
Chickens with the cheddar
Timbos and yarmulkes, you ain't in my genre
Bitch, blow me: harmonica
Arts and leisure, peace to Jon Caramanica
Sam Sifton rate the plate that we feasting on
I jerk my penis off at the precinct, dog
Since a youth, all proposals been indecent, dog
Sense of humor so I'm down for a comedic song
Rub my dick like my zipper when I walk
Touch of Down's Syndrome, flip it when she talks
Gums are purple, teeth monkey
Her look is mix with streetwalker and a junkie

[Produced by Jake One]

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Rolling up the grass, living better than them niggas
That I used to look up to, I can show you how to come up
Yeah, I came up from the gutter to a condo out in Hollywood
Where the weather's good and the parties always popping up
Or somebody be dropping off some trees
I mean I got enough to go around everything for the free so you ain’t gotta
Smoke with me and my homies down to go at any one town and get this paper
I swear ain’t nobody do me no favors
Twisting up the medicine, shitting on my competition
Easy part’s forgetting, but the hardest part’s to try forgiving
Niggas for mistaking me, or thinking I was one to wait on
Thought cause I was young that I'd be dumb
But nigga what you made’s a photographic memory
Now look at my wife, she got a pornographic figure
And my autograph is bigger to your nieces and your nephews
Than yours ever was, not to mention your niggas
You caught ‘em repping Taylor Gang with us

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
I see TMZ cameras, paparazzi taking pictures
I spark up a J and ask ‘em if they wanna take one with us
Made man, ain’t nobody make a nigga
‘Bout to book a flight to Vegas, tryna take one with us
You niggas too small dawg, me I’m thinking bigger
Critics comment on how I’m smoking weed and drinking liquor
Or how I was nominated, but not the winner
But you should start counting on how much I made this year

Yeah nigga, I’m up in the air, nigga
And the shit that I got on cost some money to wear, nigga
Owner of the team, I ain’t even a player, nigga
Before I was on, niggas ain’t care
Now it’s getting dark for you niggas it ain't even fair, nigga
Blowing hella dank, I mean so much I think it’s growing out my hair
The weed is in the jar, the grinders over there

[Interview: Wiz Khalifa]
Nah man, we're always gonna be the same
They're always gonna look at us the same
And they're always gonna look at us like
We ain't supposed to be there

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Rolling up a seal, blowin' up but still
Going hard on my job like I ain't sitting on a mill
Now filet mignon come with every meal
I swear to God that I'm so high, feel like I'm going up a hill
Car marijuana coated
Paid 250,000 for it, still hop in that thing, ride like I stole it
I'm talking vacation island resorting
I made eleven million nigga without any endorsements
Took the niggas out I was out on the porch with
To Saint Tropes to race them in Audis and Porsches
Bentleys and rolls, plenty of smoke
Thousands for weed, Fendi's for clothes
I remember I couldn't get shit back then when I was broke
Now that I'm rich, everything's for the low
So I could give a fuck 'bout what they saying
Cause they wasn't with me way back when a nigga was just

[Hook]
Macking, Hanging
Rowland, Getting that paper
Macking, Hanging
Rowland, Getting that paper

[Verse 2: Smoke DZA]
Riiiiightt
We living life shit, the bud is never ending
Kush God Bob Marley on my pendant
You know that lo is the life that I'm living
Ralph Lauren always keep a nigga spending, word
I can't lie, it's the truth, a stack for these joints
Five-hundred a boot, double R L I don't do Trues
That ain't for me
Getting money killing shows in the home of the maple leaf
These rap niggas live in a land of make-believe
Jimmity Cricket ass niggas and cool enough to fool with us
Nah, cool table geeks play the back, haters play the side door
Jet Life, Taylor Gang what you ride for
We keeping the ends, competition is slim
In case you looking for them niggas, have no fear, we are them
Corner the market, getting money, Rolling Stoned
Young Khalifa, rugby rohdes, riight

I know people in Pittsburgh might be like
Well he's not from the 'Burgh
And young rappers might be like
Well, he's a veteran, signed to a young guy
Everybody seems to have an opinion on...

We all grew up on Three Six in Pittsburgh
And anybody who don't understand it or don't see it
It's just cause they aren't meant to
They aren't built, they don't have the mind capacity
To understand that this motherfucker
Influenced everything I do up until this point
As far as songwriting, as far as beat selection
As far as all of that shit

[Intro:]
You know what that is
Just keep goin', and goin', and goin'..

[Verse 1]
I seen it coming
Yeah, I seen it coming
You do everything for these niggas
They treat you like you did nothing
But fuck that, because all of this came from nothing
Now when I pull up, I ain't on top of my nig
I'm stuntin. Smoking something
Playing my newest shit, and you know its bumpin
You ain't used to it, you gon grow accustomed
Niggas hate me cause they got no progression
All the realest niggas, they know and trust em
And plus, your money's slow as fuck
I bet soon as I roll one up
That they gon know it's us
Before I pass it, hit it twice and I hold it
Trying to get my money to the point where I can't fold it

[Hook]
Going away...

[Talking: Juicy J & Wiz Khalifa]
Mane I'm fucked up
Trippy niggas
I don't give a shit about nothing
But drugs
I'm lighting another joint
And cash

[Verse 2]
I made it happen, I made it happen
And niggas got mad at me cause I did this shit off of rapping
Hear what they saying
They need no luck because I mapped it
And now I got my own gang, nigga
I'm the captain
You know me player, ballin nigga and stackin
All the same with a passion
All cause I'm bringing racks in
Remember when all those niggas was passed em?
But now they still call me the main attraction
Some niggas want the power, I want respect
Some niggas want the fame, I want the check
I'm in Dubai wake up I'm in Tibet
Them niggas had it, man, it's sort of sad they

[Hook]

[Interview: Wiz Khalifa & Rob Markman]
We gettin' ratchet right? Let's get ratchet

How do you resolve that?

There is no resolution. These people they resolve within themselves
They're not really made at me, they want what I got

[Verse 1]
She had the sweetest scent I ever smelt a woman have
Skin would glisten like reflections off the blueish Jag
She had a Jewish dad, and a Jamaican maid
Started hanging with strippers and dropping the zippers
And selling the pussy for paper to play
Crusty feet like she hiking for days and live in the mountains
At the park she piss in the fountain, shit on the Michigan towel
She quick to split up an owl
She loves some dick in her bowels
Dabble in crystal, polish the pistol, powder her sniffles with flour
Straight flieshman
In the private part of her pussy pocket
Randomly pussy farting
Sold at the hookers auction
Left as a crooked orphan
Wrapped in the sports section
Box score, fake black rubber cock in the top drawer, what

[Bridge]
Make this fucking bitch sit in vinegar
Apple cider baths
Sit in the vinegar
Bronsolino
PS

[Verse 2]
Yo, so many unfamiliar faces that have come and gone
You're a constant, fucked you in the school closet
We were young then, experimental periods
Laid a towel cause I fucked you on your period
Stole my mothers car crashed it by the Burger King
Young love, but we thought it was eternity
Raw sex – never thought about paternity
But now this cunt is trying to murder me
Abusing me physically and verbally
Said my dick was too small
I went and got the surgery, just to show it off
This ain't real shit, baby, I'm just going off
Clear the mind, fuck it, so I wrote a song
Night life, I'm destined for the bright lights
Knife fights at the bar with some white dykes
She hold me down, break a bottle on the bitch head
.25 out the pussy and it spits lead
We always end up in a situation
She throwing diapers out the window at me
Called the cops said I beat her face
Beat the case, now I shiver at a sweet embrace

[Riff 1]
I rap now, bitches sucking like a vacuum
On the bed, stay bent like a smack spoon
Bubble butt thicker than the double dutch
In the van, leave her tied up in bumblefuck

[Verse 3]
Cold, tired and I mean it
I thought we'd grow to old farts in Phoenix
Well now you see me 'lo scarves and a ski knit
But I've been here since the beginning, like a prefix
But I'mma to do what I gotta do
Trying to make this french dough like a Pâte à Choux
Over your head, after sex shorty hold me in bed
Smoking Ethiopian red
The son rose, a single teardrop fallopians bled
Nowadays you catch the hooker sniffing coke in the shed
It's a damn shame I'm just chilling eating lamb brain
I keep the weiner on display for the campaign

[Riff 2]
I'm just doing what I had to do
Tryna Drop me in the ground but I'm not going
To the top till I fall just like Owen
Heartbreak drowned sorrows in a large steak

[Outro]

[Chorus: Sia]
Hey, I heard you are a wild one
Ooh-ooh
If I took you home, it'd be a home run
Show me how you do
I wanna shut down the club
With you
Hey, I heard you like the wild ones, wild ones, wild ones
Ooh-ooh

[Verse 1: Flo Rida]
Oh, I, I like crazy, foolish, stupid
Party going wild, fist pumping music
I might lose it, glass to the roof
That's how we do's it, do's it, do's it
I don't care tonight
She don't care we like
Almost there, the right vibe
Ready to get live
Ain't no surprise
Take me so high
Jump and nose dive
Surfing the crowd
Ooh-ooh
Said I gotta be the man
I'm the head of my band
Mic check, one, two-ooh
Shut 'em down in the club while the playboy does
And they all get loose, loose after bottle
We all get bent then again tomorrow
Gotta break rules 'cause that's the motto
Club shut down: a hundred super models

[Chorus: Sia with Flo Rida]
Hey, I heard you are a wild one
Ooh-ooh
If I took you home, it'd be a home run
Show me how you do
I wanna shut down the club
With you
Hey, I heard you like the wild ones, wild ones, wild ones
Ooh-ooh

[Verse 2: Flo Rida]
P-p-party rocker, fa' sho' stopper
More Chambull, number one club popper
Got a hangover like too much vodka
Can't see me with ten binoculars
So cool
No doubt by the end of the night
Got the clothes coming off then I make that move
Somehow, some way, gotta raise the roof, roof
All black shades when the sun come through
Uh-oh, it's on like everything goes
Wild out, baby, 'til the freak, it shows
What happens to that body, it's a private show
Stays right here, pri-private show
I like 'em untamed, don't tell me high pain
Tolerance, bottoms up when the champagne
My life, call my hanna to be explain
Do you busy with the bail, we get insane

[Chorus: Sia with Flo Rida]
Hey, I heard you are a wild one
Ooh-ooh
If I took you home, it'd be a home run
Show me how you do
I wanna shut down the club
With you
Hey, I heard you like the wild ones, wild ones, wild ones
Ooh-ooh

[Bridge: Sia, Flo Rida, both]
I am a wild one, break me in (Yeah)
Saddle me up and let's begin (Yeah, yeah)
I am a wild one, tame me now (Now, now)
Running with wolves, and I'm on the prowl
Show you another side of me
A side you would never thought you would see
Tear up that body, dominate you 'til you've had enough
I hear you like the wild stuff

[Chorus: Sia & Flo Rida, Sia]
Hey, I heard you were a wild one
Ooh-ooh (Oh)
If I took you home, it'd be a home run
Show me how you do
I wanna shut down the club
With you
Hey, I heard you like the wild ones, wild ones, wild ones
Ooh-ooh

[Outro: Sia]
I am a wild one, break me in
Saddle me up and let's begin
I am a wild one, tame me now
Running with wolves, and I'm on the prowl

[Intro (Sampled): Win Butler of Arcade Fire]
My body is a cage

[Chorus: Buffalo Madonna]
In the darkest of days
Men become kings and still die of old age
While the children become gods
At last the whole world begins to play

[Verse 1: Pearl Dragon of Champagne Champagne]
My body is adorned with thorns
King with a crown of thorns
I wash my feet and kiss the ground I'm on
I wash my feet kiss the ground I'm on, I'm on
Jump niggas cos they thought I was a pawn
But knowing I'm a king, I'm about to get on
This the sirens for the quiet of the storm
Ring that alarm, r-r-ring that alarm
Yo, her body was adorned, adorned
And I adored her, so much that I had to ignore her
Her body I explored it, like an explorer
Her first name was Dora, her first name was Dora
I opened up the door and saw
My queen getting raw, getting raw
So like me beating, Resevoir Dog
Had to hit it raw, no not raw, dog
I was a hog, but I don't eat the pork
She was a swine, crippling' my time
On the cast of my pearl, yo she wasn't my girl
This wasn't reality, this wasn't my world
Like Jimi or Kurt before
King with a crown I shall be adored
Even if I have, always been ignored
I was not the norm I will not be ignored

[Chorus: Buffalo Madonna]
In the darkest of days
Men become kings and still die of old age
While the children become gods
At last the whole world begins to play

[Verse 2: Sir Thomas Gray of Champagne Champagne]
Young world, this the story of the kings
A nigga couldn't decide should I rap or should I sing
And since God blessed me with my wings
I'm like a lil' nappy-head Bill Russell with the rings, feel me?
Lately globetrotting through a lotta traps
Friends become rats, I'm talkin Judas in expensive slacks
Fuck 'em, to tell the truth now, I'm over that
Sucker'll be suckers, it don't matter that you roll with pack
I steady grab my nuts and you can roll with that
Pardon my back, and the weight on my shoulders, black
History's on my side, these niggas hard in they cars
But in the streets they can't look me in the eye
Look me in the eye, look me in the eye
Champagne Champagne

[Verse 3: Macklemore]
(Can I get 'em?)
Stand like a man, move like a legend
Talk but with action, that's how you'll be remembered
The greats learned that humility is a weapon
Sever ties with the part of you too big to learn a lesson
Sit in silence, to fight the mind and try to find the present
Cos we only get a couple chances to be epic
And I'm connected, like God plugged my headphones
Directly into Heaven and told me to go and get 'em with this
Mic cord, I am, nothing you can tell me
They bark when they talk, but they walk like the legless
The purpose of my art is for people to respect me
I'm not a king, I'm a servant to the desires that tempt me
Only way to escape the cage in a valley of roots
Be Emir to the people when they're searching for truth
Only way to escape the cage in a valley of roots
Claim the mirror, my people, keep searchin for you

[Chorus: Buffalo Madonna]
In the darkest of days
Men become kings and still die of old age
While the children become gods
At last the whole world begins to play

[Verse 1]
And after the storm
I run and run as the rains come
And I look up, I look up
On my knees and out of luck
I look up

Night has always pushed up day
You must know life to see decay
But I won't rot, I won't rot
Not this mind and not this heart
I won't rot

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And I took you by the hand
And we stood tall
And remembered our own land
What we lived for

[Chorus]
But there will come a time
You'll see, with no more tears
And love will not break your heart
But dismiss your fears
Get over your hill and see
What you find there
With grace in your heart
And flowers in your hair

[Verse 2]
And now I cling to what I knew
I saw exactly what was true
But oh no more
That's why I hold
That's why I hold with all I have
That's why I hold

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And I won't die alone
And be left there
Well I guess I'll just go home
Oh God knows where
Because death is just so full
And man so small
Well I'm scared of what's behind
And what's before

[Chorus]
There will come a time
You'll see, with no more tears
And love will not break your heart
But dismiss your fears
Get over your hill and see
What you find there
With grace in your heart
And flowers in your hair
And there will come a time
You'll see, with no more tears
And love will not break your heart
But dismiss your fears
Get over your hill and see
What you find there
With grace in your heart
And flowers in your hair
When I talk you should listen
All of you belong to me
Come on, we should get it going
Now, what I want is specific, hey hey

[Verse 1: Juicy J]
Cash in the bag twirlin' up hash
Blue in the count and I pour it out the mask
Weed on repeat up all night
Cash over sleep got hoes all type
Live and you burn, grind and you earn
Bitch I'm on fire, I sit and I burn
Stackin' up money flippin' it too
Y'all ain't heard me but the﻿ Benjamin's do
I'm bouncin' through the club like Tigger

Nigga get wrong I'mma hit a nigga
Take a nigga bitch home and I'mma hit her

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
Reppin' TGOD

Passin' every joint that I roll to the ones that grindin' with me

Passin' every joint that I roll to the ones that grindin' with me
Now that's Taylor, (Taylor, Taylor)
Lil' Homie that's Taylor, (Taylor, Taylor)

[Verse 2: Lola Monroe]
Bitch, I'm Taylored, ain't no ho cut from the same cloth
Realest, this money only thing fame brought
The crown ain't safe and I'm comin' for the spot
Snatchin' all wigs bitch I'm coming for the top
Put a run up on trip how I run up in the shots
Queen Roe, I don't see nothin' but the gwap

[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]
All my money I'mma get it soon as I get it I'mma spend it
Bought a new car soon as I whip this
Smokin' that marijuana in it
Takin' the value down but also taking a pound
And breakin' it smokin' it all to me ain't no savin' it
Fuck with them pods, no seeds or no shake in it

[Verse 4: Chevy Woods]
Uh, fuck these niggas they ain't really bout that
Look I know what these niggas these niggas all rap
What they know about nights that they never come back
But he two shot now shells all in the mac
On the top will never see none of that fall back

Taylor Gang fam you know I rep that
And we gettin' bake on anywhere the bread at

[Bridge: Wiz Khalifa]
Now that's Taylor, Taylor, Taylor

[Interview: Wiz Khalifa]
Like for real, these niggas got it fucked up dog
I came straight from Pixburgh last year
And now I'm up there
You can't not put me up there with big niggas' names
They count me out of the lil' niggas' names
'cause I'm not with the lil' niggas
I'm gettin money, I'm balling hard
Heard them niggas hating on me cause they falling off
I'm gettin money, I'm balling hard
Heard them niggas hating on me cause they falling off
I'm gettin money, I'm balling hard
Heard them niggas hating on me cause they falling off
I hustle bitch, I'm balling hard
Yeah it's my time and ima shine just like my audemar, my audemar
Bust down, and iced out
Just hit the switch, that bitch be shining when the light's out
Bust down, and iced out
Look at my wrist, that bitch be shining like a lighthouse

I spit a verse, that's like a point
I do a show, that's like a joint
That's like a perv, oh nigga you ain't heard
I'm in a mission like...
Pull out in the maserati
Got them bitches looking at me like I shot somebody
I'm stacking paper, I need that dropped ferrrari
Got them trying to claim a nigga and we not A'Mare
My ap, cool as a ac
Look in the magazine, the same exact as jay z (same one)
I'm getting money, nigga you straight flea
That bitch be shinin down the road, I call it KT

Bust down, and iced out
Look at my wrist, that bitch be shining like a lighthouse

[Verse 1: Action Bronson]
Yeah my sole purpose/Long hair, speak Turkish
Twisted sisters out like the UniverSoul Circus
About to cop the crib furnished
Wood burning brick oven shit with the furnace
Quattro fromage
Big plate look like a lobster collage
I'm on the art and the food scene
Fuck rap, laying back, eating poutine
Matter of fact, couple raps will make a coupe lean
While you see me in the shorts all weather
Whether Puerto rica bitches chilling on the boardwalk
Rockaway smelling like Georgi
Ready for orgies, slightly retarded
Breading the porgy
20 seconds dead in the forty
All this money to be gotten
Hailin' from the rotten
Scotch make it neat, no socks on the feet
When I'm stepping the loafer Creamy like the robiola
Guaranteed I'm getting box like an old controller
Baby momma catching cases
High speed chases
Fiends rocking the ID bracelets
You only live once, so fuck if I'mma waste it
I'm in France, stepping on grapes, you can taste it
Yeah, make cheese like the fromagia
Tatted chest cover pain wash the scars
Daddy disapprove of my life just like I'm Marvin Gaye
Keep the Dodge, I want the '87 Saab in gray

[Verse 2]
Stuff a shorty like the man a gut
Light tan on the shoe like banana nut
Strong odor off the weed like your grandma's butt
No attempt to disrespect, but my grandma blunt
But I'm known to eat expensive lunches
From the farm right to the table
Aired straight right to the plate I doubt you could relate
Figs at the peak of their ripeness
Money off this music, motherfucker I like this
So cut the check

[Verse 3]
Ayo, the kush get flipped to a swan origami
Floating in the water, north of North Dakota
Dip to Barcelona Algeria connection
Pussy like a leather jacket
Been to hell and back
They tried to sell me back, but they couldn't
Hookers by the Ho-Jo chillen with Doc Gooden
“tapas up for grabs so fuck it, then why wouldn’t
Bronson be the one coming through with the gold belt

[Hook]
You know what's on my mind
And why I'm always on the grind
Cuz I'm 'bout mine

[Verse 1]
Yeah, it's the youngest in charge
Known for the hottest of rap
Straight from the top of the map
Yes, I'm a popular cat
Been to the pits of The Burgh
To the left, cocked, is my hat
Wiz keep a spliff full a herb
Niggas with knots full of stacks
And I ain't talkin to cats
I'm overdosin your brain
Go for the dope in this game
Bro, and the flow is insane
I'm like the young Shaq of rap
Low in the lane
I'm like a Sony to lames
Man, I'm controllin the game
And I'm bout mine
Say you on your grind?
Well it's about time
Outshine
Haters
So the paper
Can amount right
Bout mine
Lay it down
Homie, you'll get out-rhymed
On the track
Or flat on your back
You'll get out-lined
Keep the goonies with me
Never leave the crib without mine
And no, I ain't talkin ya gang
When I say I'm bout signs
I'm talkin dollars, guy
Here's what you should follow by –

Dumb high

See, I'm a boss

And here, my job

Spittin' flame
To makin' sure you lames
Fall to the back
It's a shame
I'm here now
So for your squad
It's a wrap
It's the gritty city
That strong-armed onto the map
More than a rapper, in fact
Man, you fuckin with the finest here
The best one that's rhymin here
So I guess I'm a pioneer
No question, I'm fly as air
I'm high, but I'm sittin low
A blast
So if you niggas gotta ask
Then your bitch'll know
Sicker flow
Short change nigga
You need bigga dough
You a Kodak moment
Shit I'm the bigger picture, bro
You niggas simply spendin chips on these pros
I'd be right to call you a pimp
Cuz your niggas is hoes
You see me? A little different
Don't do shit for these hoes
But have them pigeons in my cribbits
Washin dishes and clothes
You know Wiz
The young wise guy
Grind with my eyes wide
I can stop or rewind
I come ahead of my time

[Hook]
You know what's on my mind
And why I'm always on the grind

Man I stay doin the damn thang
Cuz I'm 'bout mine

[Verse 3]
If you 'bout yours
Never let another nigga doubt yours
Life is full of lessons
And them blessins
Better count yours
Watch out for the haters
Cause your paper's
What they out for
Be a boss
Not just another loss
To account for
And the flow sick
You know Wiz
Gonna split line-for-line
'Til this nigga get so rich
Gonna hold shit
And I keep tellin' you time-and-time
That this young'n is focused
Movin' so quick
Slow up
Pace that'll make ya get ya get dough up
And but you can, you can't just show love
Stay spittin flame which makes 'em go nuts

[Hook]
You know what's on my mind

[Verse 1]
I, I, I remember them streets so well
I, I, I remember them people well
Them, them, them, them same niggas
Walk around and be tellin' everybody I changed nigga
I know that you only wanna fuck with me 'cause I hope you get
You say you want the old me 'cause the old me nigga was broke as shit
That's what you want huh? That's what you want huh?
Just gon' and say it to my face, my nigga, don't lie
Lately niggas been fakin', no blow but a nigga's been patient
Low blows, niggas just hatin', oh no
They just want to mess around and turn me to the nigga I used to be
Chillin' with the girls that I used to see
And all them same girls wanna keep it real with everybody else
And never want to tell the truth to me
But on the outside I'm a cool ass nigga
Y'all can't see all the pain nigga hold
Y'all can't see all the pain nigga show
Sittin' back watchin' all these lame niggas blow
But uh, don't trip 'cause I know a nigga time comin'
I be waitin' on the shit like a ride comin'
But right now I got to sit it on the side youngin'
Don't worry, I'ma get it, I get it
The fam like, "Nigga, admit it ya did it" and I be like, "Nigga, I ain't did shit"
Mind on the big shit, time for the big shit
I been on the grind so long, it's ridiculous
But niggas gon' doubt, well tell 'em wake there ass and see
I promise ya'll it's gon' happen for me!

[Chorus]
I can't let you haters be my stress
Even though y'all done me all wrong
When they gon' cut me my check
Haters I remember all y'all, haters I remember all y'all

[Verse 2]
I, I, I used to walk around free
I, I know that you often doubt me
I, I can't help but feel the pain
Some nights nigga needed sun light but I really can't help but feel the rain
My gift, God given, hard liquor for hard livin'
My bluntness, pardon it, got a dream, gon' get it
Nigga, I'm never gon' go, let you niggas get used to me
Nigga, I'm feelin' so low that a nigga need a booster seat
I still feel like a bet he gon' get 'em
I'm in the studio like 24/7
I be on the move, plenty momentum
I ain't got room for any more venom
For you snakes and shit, the fakes in shit
It just makes me sick
This is not the motherfuckin' life a nigga signed up for
Lookin' at it like this can't be it
Damn, what a real nigga gots to do
To get a condo with a private view?
'Cause I be in the game lookin' at the superstars like
Everythin' you doin' nigga, I can do
So how could you be so arrogant, some of y'all people?
Walk around here like ya runnin' our people
And they talk like everyone is our equal
Y'all niggas fake, everyone of y'all see through

[Chorus]
I can't let you haters be my stress
Even though y'all done me all wrong
When they gon' cut me my check
Haters I remember all y'all, haters I remember all y'all

[Intro]
Even though I'm in love, sometimes I get so afraid
I'll say something so wrong, just to have something to say
I know the moment is right
Tell the girl a comical lie to keep the conversation high
Tell the girl a comical lie to keep the conversation high
Tell the girl a comical lie to keep the conversation high
Tell the girl a comical lie to keep the conversation high

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
I seen you from afar
Nice frame and your braids long
Gucci bag matching your frames ma
And like a don I approached you
I'm not the player type
But if you play it right, ma I'll coach you
I'll put it down how I'm spose to A popular dude
But I'm tryna to see what's poppin with you
Know a little bout the kid cause she's been watching my moves
Got my picture on the wall from when I popped in the news
And true
I been runnin' the town
Lot a chicks thought I was nuttin
All of a sudden, wanting me now
Doing research and hunting me down
But never mind the stuntin'
Trying to see what's on your mind and somethin'
Got a place to unwind, it's nothing
Have a wild discussion
I'm a roll some of this, ride n then puff it
Yea, we start off slow, then kick it in gear
Off of that smooth shit, I kick in the air
To keep the conversation

[Hook]
Ride, I'm in to taking my time, so I

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Here I go, putting myself out there
Really trying to see what shorty about here
Nothing to doubt here
See what you get
Get what you see
Me I keep it 100%
Never see myself loving a chick, you might change that
And if not, I'm happy being the same cat you
Think it's a shame that, that's how it has to be
But you with another dude, that'd be sad to see
You still mad at me, some high school tragedy
Seeing how I played your home girl who had it bad for me
I'm like woah, slow down baby
And kick it with your man itta go down crazy
I wanna get to know ya
Talk to ya hold ya
And them places you ain't been

And she gone' let the kid handle his biz
Off of that smooth shit I kick in the air
They keep the conversation

[Hook]

Now she can't get me off of her mind cause I
(Tell the girl a comical lie to keep the conversation high)

[Verse 3: Boaz]
I hit your girl with that slick talk, won't see her again
Drop the top, let your hair go, free in the wind
Now we can go and get a room on the other side of town
Or give me head in the whip if you wanna ride around
Roll up the koheeba getting blunted by the pound
I made it to the top, who thought I rubbled from the ground
Bird city, who holdin it down, me and my man Wiz
Hit the club, buy the bar, we let the champ fizz
Knockin couple of brauds you know the plan is
We call the whole crew, and then we ran trillz
I'm so street I feel a part of the canvas
Hard knocks University, the heart of the campus
And you know I got my PHD
But that don't stand for player hating
That's a Pimpin Heavy Degree

[Hook]
Ride, I'm in to taking my time, so I
(Tell the girl a comical lie to keep the conversation high)
Ride I don't tell her no lies, I just
(Tell the girl a comical lie to keep the conversation high)
Right, you better know she get down, you know
(Tell the girl a comical lie to keep the conversation high)
Now she can't get me off of her mind cause I
(Tell the girl a comical lie to keep the conversation high)

[Drake]
Are you familiar with this feeling
No concealing
Its out all out in the open
The type of life you first timers could soak in
That virgin pussy's waiting
And Im about to poke it
Im underrated, I am Ricky Henderson to Oakland
But im about to sleep em, Acquire em', and keep em'
I require a retainer to retire them and sweep em' in a Dust pan
New guy, Too fly, who buy seven cars
Dubai seven stars
You die heaven's our's
And you don't see the jag drop in here
Its like im chasing my dad the way I tag pops in in here
Lets see how many carrots we can do
Mixin' farm land green with that paratrooper blue
Who are you? You confused homie, that's a pensive look there
Where those are dark oak floors and that expensive cookwear
Thats a 07 but I got a even newer ride
Doors all suicide
I should be your tour guide
Im expedia flown
Wikepidia known
Obtain a key to your home
And take a seat on your throne
I been through it all
Spend it all to do it all
You are not me man I could never be you at all
Cause you just stupid dog
The A8 super large
And yea you got a range but that shit ain't even supercharged
Aight check, flow switch, Flow switch

I don't ever pay a percentage of the retail
Only thing Im paying is attention to the detail
Schedule can change at the mention of a email
Booking up a show with some tension with a female
My Dad said to get rich you have to dig deep
Cause Drake these some big streets
And you are not Big Meech
And you are not Rayful
And this is not DC
Four years later quarter million off of TV
You was having hoop dreams
I was drafting group schemes
Take us off of bus kids and turn us into coupe teams
Well woop there it is
Oops now my troops clean
First car Audi drop, Color like a poutine
Im feelin grown up, Don't ask me for id, like you know who I be, bouncer I know the owner
I never go, I felt out of place at a school dance
Cause they know the layout of the mall like I knew france
Inside and out, Therefore I been Hiding out
And you drive cars that I been riding out
Correction I been rode em out
Been showin' out, sold off shit the stories you've been told about
And dog, I been old amount
Young money old accounts
Degrassi my royalties
Homie you just owed an once
No weight move
My shoulder counts
Man, I don't even know my name anymore man (laughs)

[Verse]
Could this be Earth? Could this be light?
Does this mean everything is going to be alright?
One look out my window, there's trees talking like people
I've dreamt of storms, I've dreamt of sound
I've dreamt of gravity keeping us around
I've slept in the darkness, it was lonely, and it was silent
What is this love? I don't feel the same
Don't believe what this is could be given a name
I woke, you were there, tracing planets on my forehead
But I'll forget 23 like I forget 17
And I forget my first love like you forget a daydream
And what of all my wild friends, and the times I've had with them
We'll all fade to grey soon, on the TV station
(Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah .... Uh huh)

(La La La La La)

I'd like to welcome everybody to the wonderful world of Kid Mes-Cudi
You know what I'm saying
I'm from Cleveland uhhh
You know we get it in
Chillin', drinkin' , and smokin' that 10 K

We party all the time

[Verse 1]
When it's over with, the heats comin' in
Chillin', drinkin' and smokin', we gon' get it in
Comin' out the house down tees and some jeans

Now I ain't gettin' drunk Nigga, but I'm gettin' right
I gotta keep my compose before the nightlight fam
In the night life, yeah that's some shit right
Clowin' in the streets livin' up all night
Money's good cause I stacked up all week
We gon' cop a bottle other then the soft drinks?
Mix it up right, mix it up slick
It's the mystery mix make them girls turn tricks
But we rollin' now, headed downtown
And I'm drinkin' and drivin', but I'mma hold it down
Malt whiskey, pass me the cup
And while your at it my nigga open the doors up

[Chorus]
We going to party all the time
Party all the time
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah

Just to check out the clubs
And we sippin' our drinks
They can our lungs
Girls poppin' cause they Curious George
They can't master ours
Made available in stores for sure
They don't even know it's a store
Them other niggas is lame they makin' you poor
Nigga we scream down the strip
How I beam on a bitch
In my head, like a sandman I'm already rich
But um — The lines are thick so girls take a pick
"So how it standing Boo?" — Come take a sip
Yeah take a sip, got lots to go round
What we headed to? You know we Telly-bound
I'mma put it in you so you like it
Then I'm gone, like the wind
Don't be mad girl, I got other friends
"Will I call you boo?" That depends
If I remember or forget how the night ends

[Chorus]
We going to party all the time
Party all the time
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
We going to party all the time
Party all the time
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
We going to party all the time
Party all the time
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
We going to party all the time
Party all the time
Party all the time

[Bridge]
Cause I've been drunk before (yeah)
But I'm feeling this shit
I've been high before (yeah)
Well that's burn another stick
I've been drunk before (yeah)
But I'm feeling this shit
I've been high before (yeah)
Well that's burn another stick
Nigga

[Verse 3]
Crop us over wit, we gon' park a pimp
That niggas that you talking to girl, make some sense
Come fuck with me, it's the K-i-d
Now I'mma lite up my blunt, that's naturally
I know you seeing me, me and Mel Whiskey
Chillin' every day, poppin' with this breezys
And that's how we do, just me and my crew
Party all the time, so fuck what you do
(Chorus)
We going to party all the time
Party all the time
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
We going to party all the time
Party all the time

We going to party all the time

Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
We going to party all the time
Party all the time
Party all the time

[Intro]
(Alright, testing, testing, testing
Hey, is this thing on!?
Testing! Test... Is this thing on?
Can you hear me back there?
Yeah, well, then shut up!
Alright? Hey, listen)
Is that him in the studio?

[Hook]
These dudes better stay in they lanes
And keep they brains on the right track
Now you got a check that you can't cash
And you let your mouth write that
We ain't playing, man, the shit get real
Talk slick, get your life snatched
And don't rest, better guard ya grill
That's how it is, cause it's like that

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I move blocks to rude pops and dude drops
I'm too hot; mix J, Big, and 2Pac
So move not, I'm way big and dude shot
Your crew watch, I'm hot bitch and you not
I'm not a fake, not a
Nigga that'll pop shit about my cake, holla
Make dollars
But you perp, and you make nada
Not a man, not a cent, ho I stay propa
Fake scholar, they can let the tre 8's holla
And punk nigga, play dumb, get your face swallowed
You not a hustler, dogg
You don't know what a half a brick means
In rap, you'll get ate, like half of sixteen
I'll bash your team, dang I'm sickening
I'm dope, plus coke that'll smash your trip beam, man
Before them boys come and lump your face
With all that tough talkin', pump your brakes
Ease back shorty

[Hook]
These dudes better stay in they lanes
And keep they brains on the right track
Now you got a check that you can't cash
And you let you mouth write that
We ain't playin, man, the shit get real
Talk slick, get your life snatched
And don't rest, better guard you grill
That's how it is, cause it's like that

[Verse 2]
Uh, your rhyming's a waste can
I mean that it's basic, look
The Nin' to your face
It'll eat through your face, and then
I breeze through the place
No heat on my waist, but still
Will eat through your face
With knees at his face and grill
I'm on the move now, high price, big places
Leave a nigga like them hunneds, with the big face, and
Niggas try to act bad in them rare cases
Til that metal's in they mouth, like a pair of braces
Big bro talk slick up in them fake lines
Same time, he just another fruit up in the grapevine
You see I laugh, clock math, cause I take time
And you trash, bust ass than a waistline
And don't test, cause dude you'll be losing your breath
Got respect like I'm moving a Tec
And I advise you and your crew be doing your best
Try and get your mind right, or we'll be moving it left
Nigga

[Hook]
These dudes better stay in they lanes
And keep they brains on the right track
Now you got a check that you can't cash
And you let your mouth write that
We ain't playing, man, the shit get real
Talk slick, get your life snatched
And don't rest, better guard your grill
That's how it is, cause it's like that

[Verse 3]
You see it's rare that a nigga say he ball, and really got dough
Rare that he say he push coke, and really got blow
Common that he claiming that he thug, but he not though
And when do a nigga say he spit, and really got flow?
I ain't playing around
Not a gangster, but if you cross mine, I'll be laying 'em down
And you talk about poppin' your heat
But when the beef's on the real OG's will come and rock you to sleep, coward
In my advice you should think twice
Before you cross the path of a real nigga, live the street life
Who pull cards, and they reach for they heat, right
And you'll get smoked, like the trees in the peace pipe
Man, they put you in the dirt here
You steady throwin' up the set, but you ain't never put in work there
So all that talk about the gang you bang
Just stay in your lane, before a shot lay in your frame

[Hook]
These dudes better stay in they lanes
And keep they brains on the right track
Now you got a check that you can't cash
And you let your mouth write that
We ain't playing, man, the shit get real
Talk slick, get your life snatched
And don't rest, better guard your grill
That's how it is, cause it's like that

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Listen, I came in the game feet first
Hit the ground runnin, a hustler 'till I meet dirt
Gotta be consumption I'm pumpin, the people need work
Love the niggas frontin' I came from nothin and seen worse
The long-armed Khalifa reachin with each verse
I got that food for your thought, plus what the streets thirst
And you can ask around the haters'll know
I'm tame with the flow, I'm sorta like the jaeger and blow
I see the dream like a Martin Luther, I preach to the constitution in peace
But violate it, get that ass annihilated
I'm on the grind, money is time so why waste it
And everything but my piss clean, I'm high maintenance
You niggas are weak, sweet like one of them Now and Laters
The cannon blast your candy ass if you try and hate it
I made it, cause I stayed a couple steps ahead of y'all and
A hundred percent, since benji got the bread involved I'm
Lovin this shit, come fuck with the prince
I'm leavin heads hollowed like them things stuffed in the clips
And the streets gon' remember this cat name, I'm beatin the rap game
Just like nigga huggin the strip (why?)
Cause that's how a hustler do, fall back I don't fuck with you
We make it happen the clappin know we can scrum with you
Yeah we can take it to the heads, give you a lump or two
A fool is still, team bring heat like a oven dude

[Hook: Kev Da Hustla]
Ladies stand up, gentlemen stand up
This is pure skill, far from damned luck
You gotta make a plan to never give your man up
And man up, to positively stand up

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Once again the youngest sin came to drop the hammer
How could a bystander feel that this is not bananas?
We earn stripes, you all hype in that propaganda
Gats spot, you cats shot, but not from cameras
Back Glock, cause snap shots'll stop your plan up
Stuck in my ways, the haze taste like tropicana
Thinkin the days of way back, people will say that
The youngin was gifted sick when he stayed back
Now the people listenin play back, I got it made
Obligated to gettin passin grades and blaze tracks
You'll be amazed at how I make units move
Self-made, twelfth grade, boy I'll take you to school
I'm through the streets of pistolvania where my goonies move
(??????) can't miss these trucks with the rims on them
And you can find me speedin, listenin to Big and Em
Fresh outta class with the weed tucked in my Timberlands

[Hook]
Ladies stand up, gentlemen stand up
This is pure skill, far from damned luck
You gotta make a plan to never give your man up
And man up, to positively stand up

[Verse 1]
I'm out in front of Supreme, like I own it
Buttercream Benz, Goldfinger wheels
Driver can't steer, but look like Pam Grier
She like "Where's there parking around here"
That spots reserved, so are those right there
Reserved for who?
For pretty girls in sports cars

[Pre-Chorus]
Pretty girl driving my sports car
Cause my license been suspended
Pretty girl driving my sports car
Got my feet up on the wood grain, roof missing

[Chorus]
You've got that whip appeal
Whipping my stick, shift, gear
You'd be under the jail, girl
Only if whipping could kill

[Verse 2]
Up and down Mulholland, on the weekends we chill
You're driving with no shoes, cruise control
Love the way you take the wheel
Got your photo on my air freshener
In a scents just like the

[Pre-Chorus]
Pretty girl driving my sports car
Cause my license been suspended
Pretty girl driving my sports car
Got my feet up on the wood grain, roof missing

[Chorus]
You've got that whip appeal
Whipping my stick, shift, gear
You'd be under the jail, girl
Only if whipping could kill

[Verse 3]
I just finished practice
She's on her way to get me, she's in traffic
She said give her 20 minutes
I'm finna hop in the shower
Girl I hope 20 don't mean an hour
And as the cold water runs over my chest
I've been thinking 'bout your skirt on my head rest
Pretty girl driving my sports car
Pretty, roof missing

[Chorus]
You've got that whip appeal
Whipping my stick, shift, gear
You'd be under the jail, girl
Only if whipping could kill
You've got that

You've got that whip appeal
Whipping my stick, shift, gear
You'd be under the jail, girl
Only if whipping could kill
You've got that
You've got that
You've got it

[Verse 4]
I let you drive my Benz
Flossing on your friends 'round town
I let you fill my seats with shopping bags
I let you go do your thing riding with your friends 'round town
Riding with your girlfriends
And I'll always keep it clean
So why don't you park in the front just to stunt
That'll make all them bitches mad
Why don't you lift up the roof just to stunt
It'll make all them bitches mad
All them girls wanna be you

[Chorus]
You've got that whip appeal
Whipping my stick, shift, gear
You'd be under the jail, girl
Only if whipping could kill

You've got that

[Intro]
Look baby don't play me, play lotto okay, you gotta try to cum okay
I'm a nice girl dont play me out
I know its not everything baby but I'm out here working and I gotta pay up

[Verse 1]
Cindy, she not herself unless she smoking crack
7 times she got stabbed in the back
By a regular john she dealt with many times before
Thats what she gets for being a whore though
She walked the streets, patent leather mini skirt
With the zipper, damn I know her kitty hurt
10 hour shifts she thinking' bout retiring
Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah I think she lying man
She'll suck a Jewish lawyer, or an African cabby
"It ain't about the money, tryna get back at my daddy
Plus I'm feenin' tryna smoke me some crack in the alley"
Grease the cops, found her mouthing off Captain O'Malley

[Bridge]
Yeah, its Hoookers at the point
Bitch, get my motherfucking drink, bitch. Henny
Quarter filled, in the fuckin sniffter dont put it in the rock glass again please
You fucking stupid bitch treat you like garbage kick you in ya fuckin ass
Come here bitch, put your breath on my pinky ring bitch
Get my motherfucking drink bitch HENNY

[Verse 2]
As I ride inside my 92' Seville
Windows half down so I can see my bitches in the field
Best believe they bringing daddy money
How you think I copped the caddy dummy
Tryna get this Puff Daddy money
The name silk but all my bitches call me montel
Spit the marvel, with the soft top not the hard shell
Three shades of green- suit, hat, and matching lizards
8 bitches look like they straight from the Alaskan blizzard
Bitch get my money 'fo I kill ya
You know the life you chose
But know you wanna be a mother
The kid will be retarded you can add him to his brother
Do the world a favor line your pussy up with rubber
Now you done made me spill my henny on my pinky ring
My nails are filed
Perfect though right you see me shinin
Now get the fuck up out my car and sell ya joint
We gettin luchey this is hookers at the point
Bitch

[Verse 3]
Dos en el morning, rocking sweatpants ya know what up
Slowly approaching animals in motion
Pussy safari, twenty for a lay
Ten for a BJ, but free for some free base
Before I purchase, I wanna peek at the turkey
Make sure that its perky so it won’t turn my dick to jerky
Open the door, soon as she sat down, she took a bump
She caught the rush, then made a hooker grunt
Let’s talk about me, I’m always on the road
Got a little dick, many of the secrets I behold
Name is dano born in the Bronx, half Puerto Rican
Drive a truck hooked on dope cook a soul
Was once a prospect for the twin now im on a mission
Cryin naked shootin dope up in the kitchen
Falling asleep right on the shitter
Word to Roberto Clemente dog I’m still a hitter, yeah!

[Outro]

[Verse 1]
She's all alone with a bottle of patron
I see you and ask you where you're from
But she tells me just to stop right there
Cause I'm not gone get no ass, so I'm on my way
But a few more drinks and she returns
Don't know what she's saying, her speech is slurred
So I grabbed her waist

[Hook]
And I look you in your eyes
Ya know that I wanna baby
Ya know that I wanna baby
Dance with you, dance with you
Ya know that I wanna baby
Ya know that I wanna baby
Dance with you, just you, only you

[Verse 2]
You're safe with me so don't be scared (Just come this way)
The bedroom, let's go upstairs (Just come this way)
United we can form as one
I just wanna feel ya touch, then I'm on my way
But I think I'm starting to like this girl
Or maybe I'm just twisted, so I'll ask her to stay

[Hook]
Ya know that I wanna baby
Ya know that I wanna baby
Dance with you, dance with you
Ya know that I wanna baby
Ya know that I wanna baby
Dance with you, just you, only you

[Outro]
Do you wanna have some fun
Do you wanna have some fun
Do you wanna have some fun
Do you wanna have some fun

[Intro]
Broke dick, I'm looking for a drug lord

[Verse 1: Hodgy Beats]
Okay, welcome to my 12 bar (One, um..)
The beat, wears it like a kevlar
As I smoke my tree, medlar, South African
Coughing 'til there's pains in my fucking abdomen
I spit negative just like a halogen
My breeze more of a fucking masculine
The rascals win, killing 'em off with a javelin
Snakes, I'm just rattling, suit tailor never tattling
You niggas a bunch of squares, Madison
As far as real niggas, bitch nigga my battle's sick
On top of being talented, bitch I'm fucking passionate
I'm a golden curse, call me treacherous, treasure chest
Better yet, I'll build on to the beat like tetris
Remember me forgetfulness? I am your correctionist
I stitched Odd and Future together like a leather vest
You fucking sweater neck, feather peck, Rosetta checks
I put together decks and push for beef, if hefferless
I'm headed out to Sydney Australia with Tim Donnelly
He gets caught up at security, the TSA don't follow me
Tea parties are the shit, forty mags by the scones
I'm fighting for gun rights to shoot a nigga in his dome
Click your fucking heels, there's no place like home
Cock back and blast off written on the tombstone, ain't that a bitch

[Interlude]
That wasn't a 12 bar (Tyler, what's up, nigga?)
I can't count (What's wrong?)
(Tyler what's wrong man?)

[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
Let's see, what's wrong with me?
Might be my fucking Tourette's, see?
I need a vacation cause all this shit got me stressing
So after the showers with Sandusky
Me and Sean Kingston went and rented a couple jet skis
Lionel rolled the blunts up, so meanwhile
Me and Lucas getting fucked up
You can smell us coming like a faggot when he hicks up
Listening to Common's last album to get pumped up
To finally ask *censored* when I can get my dick sucked
You know Casey Anthony, was handling
Dropping her kids off so she could come out and dance with me
Wine in the pantry, wrestling on my trampoline
Learned some new chords while you uncreatives were sampling
I'm Wolf, I spit flow retardedly
As retarded as the sound of deaf people arguing
You hold the future of the kid you daughter's gargling
Me, I have the Odd Future mothafuckin' sergeanting
(Tyler, calm the fuck down) No, I'm the fuck now
My poppa didn't give one, that's why I'm like this now
I'm still down to cut throat and if another fan asks
For a fucking photo while I'm snacking on my pizza lunchable
I'm 'a fucking snap like Berman when he acts right
Then have a mental breakdown and proceed to use a crack pipe (don't do that!)
OF will be done for, niggas will be dumb poor
Don't believe me, ok be right back, I'm headed to the gun store
M-16's and them 6 teens came out of nowhere
Like your kid's wet dream, what you mean old news
Oh you really need us to fucking show you
Why we're harder than findin a fuckin Snicker bar in Whole Foods
In a black hoodie, nose bruised and a gold tooth
Hoping the fuckin' security guard doesn't hold you in custody
But luckily had a couple of guns with me
Like gay step moms, none of you mothafuckas can fuck with me

[Outro]
Vete a la casa de tu mama
No mas andan aqui con sus babosadas
Que Odd Future ni que Odd Future
Yo no se que es eso, idiotas
Que chingados es Odd Future
Golf Wang, Golf Tyler? A mi me vale madre
Ja.. y mira esa ropa
Parecen una bola de payasos mugrosos!
Por favor!

[Intro: Taco & Tyler, the Creator]
Yo, shout out to everybody that worked on the album, you feel me, son?
Yo, shouts out to Ty Dollas
Shouts out to Hodgy Daddies, shouts out to Left Brizzle
Shouts out to Domyen, shouts out to Frankie Ocean
Shouts out to Syd the Dude
Shouts out to L-Boy, awwwwk
I told you

[Verse 1: Tyler, the Creator]
The big-eared bandit is tossin' all his manners
In a bag and wrappin' them in Saran wrap bandages
Tossin' 'em in baskets with the rest of those sandwiches
So when he says, "Catch up, nigga," it looks like an accident
Um, flowing like my pad is the maxiest
My bitch white and black like she's been mimicking a panda
It's the dark-skinned nigga, kissing bitches in Canada
Then kicking all out like Mr. Lawrence did Pamela
Put her in the chamber all against her Wilt Chamberlain
I never had a reason, nigga, I was just Ableton
Not a fucking Logic-contradicting dickhead (Not a Logic)
Flyer than an ostrich moshing in a tar pit
Semen-scented cheetah printed tee
In that 'Preme five-panel, I'll repeat it for the season (Hahaha)
Previous items in the present
With the normal-ass past like I cheated on my team
It's me (Tried to get that nigga, but, Golf Wang see, he did come back, though)

[Verse 2: Hodgy]
To have some type of knowledge that is one perception
But knowin' you own your opponent is a defeatin' bonus
I'm Zeus to a Kronos, cartilage cartridge is boneless
Smiles of cowards in lead showers, dead spouses in red blouses
Children who fled houses on Mustang horses and went joustin'
I'm on my Robin Hood shit, robbing in the hood
Whips, drugs, jewels and your pet, I'm stealin' your rims
Coke diamonds and your Vette, soldiers lace the fuckin' boot
And salute like the troop, when they shoot, you gon' brrrooop
It's KILLHodgy, nigga, stay the fuck off my stoop
And out my Kool-Aid, Juice

[Verse 3: Left Brain]
What's up, bitch?
Hodgy got the juice, I got the gin
Jasper got the Henny, my nigga, we get it in
Wolf Gang party at the hotel
I call a ho, you call a ho, and all the hoes tell
You know Left Brain need a freak (Yeah)
I need a bitch to go down like a Nitty beat
Yup, uh, and her ass fat
Don't be surprised if I ask where the hash at
Nigga, I'm tryna smoke, bitch, get higher (What up, what up, what's up, smoke)
Domo, where that Flocka Flame? Talking 'bout a lighter
Still bang salute me or just shoot me
'Cause if you don't salute me then my team will do the shooting
Yeah, my nigga Ace will pull the black jack
The king Mike G is in the cut with the black mac
We like the mafia, bitch, don't get to slacking up
And if these haters acting up, throw 'em in the aqueduct
Free my nigga Earl, yo, I don't really ask for much
But two bad bitches in front of me cunnilingus

[Verse 4: Mike G]
(We out here)
What the fuck is caution?
Often I leave 'em flossing in KAWS, exes next to coffins
Lost in translation, the dreams you chase
Got you diving for the plates like you stealing home base
That's great, I'm home alone dreaming of two on ones
With Rihanna and Christina Milian, bring it on
And Travis is in the closet organizing and hanging the tramp
Three lettermans that Ace has been making him
No strays while we catching matinees, huh?
I'm getting blazed thinking 'bout those days
I had the top off the GT3 like toupees
One finger in the air, all's fair when crime pays
My grand scheme of things is to be attached
To the game like bitches to their wedding rings
And you don't even need to look 'cause we gleam obscene
In the light, ride slow to my yellow diamond shining
Like the Batman logo over Gotham, rock LA to Harlem
If you say, "Get 'em, Mike G," then I got 'em
One man squadron, nigga, I'm a problem
From Briggs, I got bars and plans to
Pimp these Polish bitches into pop stars
Humanity kills, we all suffer from insanity still
And if I said it then it is or it's gonna be real
OF 'til I OD and I probably will, uh

[Verse 5: Domo Genesis]
It's still Mr. Smoke-a-Lotta-Pot, get your baby mommy popped
With my other snobby bop, do I love her? Probably not
Know your shit is not as hot as anything I fuckin' drop
Bitch, I'm in the zone, stand alone, like Macaulay Culk
I've been runnin' blocks since a snotty tot
Big wheel was a big deal with the water Glocks
Now I'm all grown, same song, just a different waltz
Fire what I talk, but still cooler than an Otter Pop
Op, Dom next shit in your wish list
Mad sick shit, mad dick for your bitches
On some slick shit, your mistress on my hit list
And I'm lifted 'til I'm stiff outta this bitch
Odd in your motherfuckin' area (Motherfuckin' area)
Blood clots give me five feet 'fore I bury ya
('Fore I bury ya)
Suicide flow, let the big wave carry ya
(Suicide flow, let the big wave carry ya)
Tyler got the mask like he held Jim Carrey up
And fuck your team, ho, nigga, wassup? (Wassup?)
Wolf Gang so you know we not givin' no fucks
You know me dog, I'm a chill in the cut
So I can cut it short, break it down, couple pounds, roll it up

[Interlude: Frank Ocean]
Get me a Persian rug where the center looks like Galaga
Right, right

[Verse 6: Frank Ocean]
Rent a supercar for a day
Drive around with your friends, smoke a gram of that haze
Bro, easy on the ounce, that's a lot for a day
But just enough for a week, my nigga, what can I say?
I'm high and I'm bi, wait, I mean I'm straight
I'ma get you this wine, the runner just brought the grapes
My brother give it some time, Morris, and Day
Course you know the vibe's just as fly as the rhymes
On the song, cut and you could sample the feel
Headphone bleed, make this shit sound real
Used to work the grill, fat burger and fries
Then I made a mil' and them psychics was liars
Now, how many fucking crystal balls can I buy and own?
Humble old me had to flex for the folks
Down in Muscle Beach pumping iron and bone
Bumping oldies off my cellular phone
Yeah, bumping oldies off my cellular phone
Bumping oldies off my cellular phone

[Interlude: Jasper Dolphin]
Goddammit!
Rapping is stupid and it's hard
Gotta do it over and over and over again but here it go

[Verse 7: Jasper Dolphin]
Hey, it's Jasper, not even a rapper
Only on this beat to make my racks grow faster
Got a TV show, so I guess I'm an actor
Pothead, half-baked, lookin' like Chappelle
Rollin' up a blunt with that fire from hell (Woo)
Still ignorant, still hit a bitch (Wow)
Wolf Gang, nigga, so I still don't give a shit (Woo)
Catch me in the back with Miley's on my lap (Shit)
Bong rips as I feel on that little bitch cat (Cat)

[Interlude: Jasper Dolphin & Earl Sweatshirt]
Hah, nigga came through with a 9-bar real quick
Just for the bitches, little bit of money in my pocket
Fuck it, Wolf Gang
Yeah, fuck that

[Verse 8: Earl Sweatshirt]
Look, for contrast, here's a pair of lips
Swallowin' sarapin, settin' fire to sheriff's whips
(Whoops, whoops!) Fuckin' All-American terrorist
Crushin' rapper larynx to feed 'em a fuckin' carrot stick
And me? I just spent a year Ferrisin'
And lost a little sanity to show you what hysterics is
Spit 'til the lips meet the bottom of a barrel, so that sterile piss
Flow remind these niggas where embarrassed is
Narrow, tight line, might impair him since
I made it back to Fahrenheit, grimey get dinero type
Feral, fuckin' ill-apparel-wearin' pack of parasites
Threw his own youth off the roof after paradise
La di da di, back in here to fuck the party up
Raidin' fridges, tippin' over vases with a tommy gun
Never dollars, poppa make it rain hockey pucks
And sixty-day chips from fuckin' awesome anonymous
Call him bloated 'til he show 'em that the flow deluxe
Off the wall loafers, Four Loko in a cobra clutch
Vocals bold and rough, evoke a ho to pose as drum
And let me hit and beat it with a stick until the hole is numb
The culprit of the potent punch
Scoldin' hot as dunkin' scrotum in a Folgers cup
Or Nevada, drivin' drunk inside a stolen truck
And shittin' like his colon bust
Belly full of chicken and a fifth of old petroleum
Supernova, I'm rollin' over the novices
And roamin' through the forest and spittin' cold as his porridge is
Stay gold 'til the case closed and the story end
Post mortem porkin' this rap shit and record it
To escort it to the morgue again, lord of lips
Bored of this, forklift the tippy top, best under 40 list
Stormin' the gate, ensurin' the bass
Scorchin', leave these motherfuckers sore in torso and face (Ugh)
Get at me, we savages, half a pack of Apache
Indian pack of niggas who don't give a fuck if we nasty as flatulence
As a matter of fact, your swagger is tacky
So see me, you can't, like Crunchy Black catchin' a taxi
Uh, back like lateral passin'
With that motherfuckin' gladiator manner of rappin'
As an addict, I let Percocet and Xannies relax me
Fall back if your paddies is Maxi, please

[Verse 9: Tyler, the Creator]
OF, shit, that's all I got
From my bigger brother Frankie to my little brother Tac
From that father figure Clancy to that skatey nigga Nak
Shreddin' down 'Fax, Wolf Gang run the fuckin' block
Storefront, knee tat
Book cover is the same lettering on lettermans and cotton socks
And grip tape... and my shoes
Um, I was fifteen when I first drew that donut
Five years later, for our label, yeah, we own it
I started an empire, I ain't even old enough
To drink a fucking beer, I'm tipsy off this soda pop
This is for the niggers in the suburbs
And the white kids with nigga friends that say the n-word
And the ones who got called weird, fag, bitch, nerd
'Cause you was into jazz, kitty cats and Steven Spielberg
They say we ain't actin' right
Always try to turn our fuckin' color into black and white
But they'll never change 'em, never understand 'em
Radical's my anthem, turn my fuckin' amps up
So instead of critiquing and bitchin', bein' mad as fuck
Just admit, not only are we talented, we're rad as fuck, bitches

[Outro: Tyler, the Creator]
OFM, banging on your FM
Gnaw, 2011, yeah

Shit sound like some, Al Green shit nigga
Yo Doms, please, hit these niggas

And I got a Capri Sun in here
A bit of this cold Capri Sun
Kiwi Strawberry
Dom, hit these niggas, man

[Verse: Domo Genesis & Tyler, the Creator]
I'm a mothafuckin' asshole, it's natural
To act bashful in the presence of niggas with cash flow
I spaz ho, laying somewhere close to where the grass grows
Listening to jazz cause these niggas mad trash, yo
And that, kicking dust, my shit is ridiculous
Quickly put my dick in sluts who nose tend to be sticking up
Silly niggas, give it up, no person is sick enough
The doctor needs to fix me up, fix me up
Miss nurse in the red shirt, I'mma need some fucking head work
Talk you into anything, with talking, I'm an expert
Just talking to you niggas and it's sounding like my best work
Best work? For now, yes, with every drop I'm better
Better than the rest, these niggas apply pressure
These niggas, every verse is lyrically def to these niggas
When that hearse drop, 6 feet death for you niggas
Many men opposing me, no success for you niggas
And I'm still on my bullshit, loc'ing with a full clip
That's the iPhone full of verses that I could spit
Preaching to the real, why he standing at the pulpit
Throwing middle fingers at the haters like, "What's good, bitch?"
Nah, really, what's trilly hood, bitch?
Ham I may go, nigga extra mayo
That's the Frigidaire billionaire Bruce Wayne flow
Show the fuck out, dunk on a nigga and just hang, yo
I'm a boss nigga, fuck what it cost nigga
You wanna oppose me? Chalk up a loss nigga
Get lost nigga, out my vicinity
Cause I terminate your kind, lames is the enemy (Fuck it!)
And these haters won't get my energy
T the C, we did it (What?) G (Yeah!)
And I'm higher than an Asian score on SATs
And yeah, whatever

[Outro: Domo Genesis & Tyler, the Creator]
Woooo!
Wolf Gang, nigga! (Yeah!)

Bye-bye!

[Intro: L-Boy]
Goddamn nigga!
This shit ignorant as fuck, my nigga!
Bitches, this your motherfuckin' chance

If you got a problem with a nigga
Sock that motherfucker in the motherfuckin jaw right now nigga
If you didn't know nigga, if you didn't know nigga, I'm back!

[Verse 1: Taco]
Spit on a bitch, punch on a bitch
After I eat some steak, have her tug on my dick
Nigga filthy rich, two car notes
No house nigga, that's how I roll
Yeah nigga I do this fuckin' shit
Count money, get my hair braided by your bitch
She drivin' me around town, nigga
Where I'm at nigga? Dog pound nigga
Oh shit nigga, what's good ho?

We ratchet, we goon in the hood section

[Hook]
We got bitches, we got bitches, we got bitches

We got bitches, we got bitches, we got bitches
We got diamonds, we got diamonds, we got diamonds
We got cars, we got cars, we got cars
We got jacuzzis and your bitch be on my dick

[Verse 2: Jasper Dolphin]
Mobbin' in the club, 60 niggas deep
Keep talkin' shit and you'll meet 60 feet
Cats on everything, that's all a nigga see (meow)
I fuck with a bad bitch I'm smokin' on some weed
Nigga got racks, shout out to the team
Posted in the house, nigga countin' green
Golf Wang, Wolf Gang, niggas know what our name
Six hundred sixty six bitches on my dick, man
Six hundred and sixty motherfuckin' six
Bitches on a nigga dick (Wolf Gang nigga, fuck everybody else)

[Verse 3: Tyler the Creator]
Sock that bitch out! (Sock that bitch out, don't give a fuck)

[Verse 1: Hodgy Beats]
Gold chain and some J’s like Nas in Illmatic
I’m so real, I’m something to feel, peel fabric
My folks kill, they hunt every meal, meat cabbage
Lyrically get out my way, protein; the beats radish
Roll the weed LB the police smell me
High profile, sweet, bring them hoes to the telly - nah
Bitches fuck your shit up words from DMX in Belly behind you back
Planning your downfall, I thought that was your relly-
Relative, skin of ribs and eat healthy
I belch a bitch and leave her tits on a shelving
I felt a bitch, she let me in, welcoming
Fuck duct tape nigga, I like Velcro-ing
I ain’t the one to be tampered with
I make you shit all in your pants and your Pamper, bitch
Niggas quick to sing a hook and make a dance up quick
For you it’s never or never, my camp’s legit

[Interlude]
Wolf Gang! Fuck your crew, nigga! This Wolf Gang, nigga!
Go the fuck home, mutherfucker! Night night, mother fucker!
Smoke up, Left Brain!

[Hook: Frank Ocean]
Snow so white, moon so bright
They’re on a playground making canines fight
Ain’t no place for my kids to go

[Verse 2]
The wolves are rowdy and in the parking lot
I don’t mean basketball when I say that they be balling in the park a lot
It’s like the big bad wolf duplicated
If they getting shitted on by critics, it’s cool, they super rated
Life on the huge and playlist, daily’s the fucking basis
Accounting for all the hatred, get off the children’s sacred
I’m international, actual but in fact I go from
The US to the UK to Amsterdam in like two days

[Hook]
Snow so white, moon so bright
They’re on a playground making canines fight
Ain’t no place for my kids to go

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
One thing's for sure, two things for certain
Got booked with three bricks, you back home, niggas workin'
Clown-ass niggas, shoulda put you in the circus
Home of Philly, if you get a Benz niggas lurkin'
Churches, hearses, is it really worth it?
If you heard he tellin', why you dappin' and conversin'?
Lock me in the cell, let me strap on my Converses
Before I drop a dime, tell them people a lie
Swear to God, man, I was nineteen I caught my first case
Nine co-defendants and snitchin' wasn’t the worst case
Had a hard time givin' my name and my birth date
But nowadays niggas go to jail and it’s a earthquake
They get all shook up, write a whole book up
Rattin' their connect out, tellin' where they got the hook up
Got a niggas twenty years talkin' 'bout that cook up
Back to the home, niggas fuckin' with him, good luck
Twelve shots of Henny to the face got me stood up
Any situation, ask about me and I stood up
Catch you slippin' like a transmission, fuck your hood up
From my hood to who your hood, good, what up?
Ugh, nothin' though my hunnit high
This MAC will leave a nigga look like Spongebob

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
I said all I know is Flex, shittin' on my ex
Bad hoes on my team, dick 'em down like next
I rock YSL so fresh, fly as hell, no jet
Waves on them 360's make that pussy get so wet
She say I'm cocky, I say that’s not me
She call me papi and I say "¡ven aqui!"
Wrist wear on hockey, Porsche Box like Ali
My sneaks they Bally, in my hood I'm prob'ly
Just rollin' round in that Ghost, watchin' out for them folks
Heater on my hip, trunk full of that work
I say my shooters like Dirk, 10 racks and you merked
I put that on your head, nigga
First week and you dead, nigga
I bottle pop, I model pop
Catch me on them bikes, let the throttle pop
Niggas know I'm nice and I got a lot
Like F your corner, nigga, I’ll buy the block
It’s Maybach, we way back
Yeah, I was starvin', this the payback
It's off the top…

[Verse 3: Meek Mill]
I got my hustle from Hova and my stuntin' from Baby
That’s why I'm fuckin' 'em over and my new watch cost me eighty
Got a couple of Rovers, had a drop one Mercedes
I know these suckers don’t like me, I'm probably poppin' they lady
I got 100 racks on me now
No computer but I got a MAC on me now
And I'm a shooter and I really clap homie now
And fuck the jail 'cause my nigga Ross hold me down
I'm skippin' bail and we in this bitch, fresh out the dealership
I just came in the game, but I'm killin' shit
My nigga Wale—
We in the building, we in the building

[Verse 4: Meek Mill]
I had a dream like Martin Luther
I was in the Phantom gettin' brain like a Harvard student
Check my record for the fame, ain't really hard to prove it
Went to jail, came home to that kitchen just like Martha Stewart
With a Pyrex tryin' to make a nine stretch
Just was in the yard with lifers, workin' on my biceps
You would think they all was like us, they ain't have my mindset
When I was missin' sleep and workin' weeks to get my mom set
And to get my son right so he don't live my young life
'Cause I remember some nights I used to hold that gun tight
Middle of the jungle tryin' to make it to the sunlight
Stillmatic with that pen and pad, just give me One Mic
And I'm gon' get richer, they gon' get sicker
Why they mad at me? 'Cause they ain't in the picture
'Cause they was on some bullshit when they started flickin'
And the camera started flashin', niggas came up missin'

[Verse 5: Stalley]
Black Chevelle on them blades, boy
Dark shades, leather jacket like I'm Blade, boy
Come through my city like, "What’s the focus, boy?"
I come though with open doors
Six by nines through theses door panels, make a bunch of noise
I’m mobbin' on these back streets and city blocks
Middle finger every cop
Chevy block engines, everything is heavy stop
Sweat pants, the car dance, I make that bitch do the wop
Man, I'm losin' my religion
Got these angels on my shoulders and they tellin' me to listen
I blast this Alpine and get lost in my system
They tellin' me it's devil music and demons have imprisoned
My mind, body and soul and I’m travelin' down hell's road
This strap got no Velcro
So I’m down for whatever, whenever, wherever
Any way the hell I go
You think I’m scared and here’s your answer: hell no!

[Verse 6: Meek Mill]
Every night I’m on the road, tryin' to get how it come
Still findin' time just to kick it with my son
I know niggas see them blogs and it's lookin' like it's fun
But when you out to get that cake, you gotta pick every crumb
Yeah, you gotta pick every crumb
I never thought I'd see the day that I get up out the slums
Did it for my team, put 'em on some ones
And every day we shittin' on them, we them niggas with some runs
I was outta control, block was hot as a stove
I was out with them O's, same time the block was patrolled

[Verse 1]
I remember when you used to take me on a bike ride every day on the bayou
(You remember that? We were inseparable)
And I remember when you could do no wrong
You'd come home from work and I jumped in your arms when I saw you
I was so happy to see you (I was so excited, so happy to see you)

[Chorus]
Because you loved me, I overcome, yeah
And I'm so proud of what you've become, yeah
You've given me such security
No matter what mistakes I make, you're there for me
You cure my disappointments and you heal my pain
You understood my fears and you protected me
I treasure every irreplaceable memory and that's why
I want my unborn son to be like my daddy
I want my husband to be like my daddy
There is no one else like my daddy
And I thank you for loving me
Daddy, daddy, daddy...

[Verse 2]
I still remember the expression on your face
When you found out I'd been on a date and had a boyfriend
(My first boyfriend, you should've seen your face)
I still remember I caught you crying 'cause of my tattoo
Could have said "Beyoncé, I told you so"
Instead you said you'd get one too
(Even my mama said y'all get one just like mine)

[Chorus]
Words can't express my boundless gratitude for you
I appreciate what you do
You've given me such security
No matter what mistakes, I know you're there for me
You cure my disappointments and you heal my pain
You understand my fears and you protected me
Treasure every extraordinary memory and that's why
I want my unborn son to be like my daddy
I want my husband to be like my daddy
There is no one else like my daddy
And I thank you for loving me

[Bridge]
Even if my man broke my heart today
No matter how much pain I'm in, I will be okay
'Cause I got a man in my life that can't be replaced
For this love is unconditional, it won't go away
I know I'm lucky
Know it ain't easy
For men who take care of their responsibilities

[Chorus]
Love is overwhelming
Lord, why did you pick me?
Can't stop my tears from falling
I love you so much, daddy

[Outro]
(Thank you, you've done so much for me. I love you, daddy.)
I get so emotional, daddy, every time I think of you
I get so emotional, daddy, every time I think of you
There is no one else like my daddy
No one else will replace my daddy

[Verse 1: Busta Rhymes]
I said baby girl, lighting up the room like the light's up
You excite a nigga 'til you got me feeling niced up
Everything about it feels amazing, spiced up
Hot and steamy like my mother cooked a little rice up
See that 20 karats, please get it priced up
I'm past that girlfriend shit baby, wifed up
Elevated feeling like we going a couple flights up
Next level, with a hope you ain't afraid of heights
What?
Skyscrapers take it higher
Even got a helicopter on the roof waiting for a small fire
And add flame to the spark
And let us ride up to heavens to the next level, let me do my part

[Verse 2]

[Mary J. Blige:]
It feels like your hands were designed to be on my body

[Busta Rhymes:]
You best believe that, and I agree with you too

[Mary J. Blige:]
Like I was made to be your girl

[Busta Rhymes:]
Yeah, and you already know

[Mary J. Blige]
That's why I won't give my time to just anybody

[Busta Rhymes:]
You know I'm with you, baby

[Mary J. Blige:]
Cause my time's your time, my world's your world

[Pre-Chorus:]
So if it's cool with you
I'm a tell my girls go out tonight, without me
Got thing's to do with you
Let's bring the party to the house tonight
Cause tonight I'm ready, yeah

[Hook]
I'd rather play with my baby
I think it's time that me and him go to the next level
Uh, I'm gon' love him like crazy
I hope he's ready cause we gonna go to the next level

[Verse 3: Busta Rhymes]
Baby ain't nothing left to do but rock on
Want a G5 to the next level, hop on

[Mary J. Blige:]
Let's go to the next level

[Busta Rhymes:]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, alright
I love it when we're in the bed and we cuddle
Or you riding out with me like we on a space shuttle

[Mary J. Blige:]
Let's go (yeah) to the next level

[Busta Rhymes:]
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 4]

[Mary J. Blige:]
And I'm OK as long as I got your arms around me

[Busta Rhymes:]
You know I love when I got my arms around you too

[Mary J. Blige:]
I feel free to loose control

[Busta Rhymes:]
Let it go baby

[Mary J. Blige:]
And I was lost in love, so glad that you found me
Cause your love's too good, too just, let go

[Pre-Chorus]

[Hook]

[Busta Rhymes:]
Baby ain't nothing left for you to do but rock on
Want a G5 to the next level, hop on

[Mary J. Blige:]
Let's go (yeah) to the next level

[Busta Rhymes:]
I love the way you really take my love muscle
And you ride it out with me like we on a space shuttle

[Mary J. Blige:]
Let's go (yeah) to the next level

[Verse 5]
Everybody get to putting up your lighter now
Baby girl you see me shining much brighter now, yeah
Fulfilling all of your desires now
Give me a hug, open your arms a little wider now
Damn, you see the feeling we creating
Bottles up, let's make a toast and do a lot of celebrating

[Mary J. Blige:]
Let's go to the next level

[Hook]

I think it's time that we go on
Baby come on, let's go
To the next level

[Busta Rhymes:]
I love it when we're in the bed and we cuddle
Or you riding out with me like we on a space shuttle

[Mary J. Blige:]
Let's go, to the next level

[Intro: Tyler, the Creator]
Fuck Steve Harvey

[Verse 1: Domo Genesis]
This life is a game if you wanna play, counting all your old mistakes
Living it with no delay, so fast I'm getting growing pains
Father didn't show me my instincts to take the open lane
I go insane, all these problems comin' with my growing age
Blowing haze, tryna clear the doubt that's sitting on my brain
I don't complain but the kid inside me's feeling so restrained
Gotta stay gold and let desire rekindle the flame
Searching for the Fountain of Youth when I'm freein' my brain

[Bridge: Tyler, The Creator]
Bring in the horns, you hear that fucking brass?
That's little boy nigga with the trumpets
Marching with the bandwagon, looking for his heart
No sleeve, but his hand carry muskets
Lurking in the meadows, oblivion
Motherfuck Geppetto, he's a leader, not a puppet
Some professors nuttier than Klump's dick
So think before you blink and aye-aye make assumptions

[Refrain]
(Niggas!)
Your left, your left, your left, right left
(Niggas is coming!)
Your left, your left, your left, right left
(Niggas!)
Your left, your left, your left, right left
(Niggas is coming!)
Your left, your left, your left, right left

[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
They want a story, a story I write the shit that I find
Very amusing, 'cause all of they fucking stories are boring
It's really awkward to know that a bunch of kids do adore me
It's like I fathered these fuckers, so you won't find me on Maury
I'm still a kid in my heart so I have a problem maturing
But it will come from experiences and shit I see touring
I'm like a bird when I'm soaring, really high
And I'm really horny, from watching this porn, nope, but

[Bridge: Tyler, The Creator]
Bring in the horns, you hear that fucking brass?
That's little boy nigga with the trumpets
Marching with the bandwagon, looking for his heart
No sleeve, but his hand carry muskets
Lurking in the meadows, oblivion
Motherfuck Geppetto, he's a leader, not a puppet
Some professors nuttier than Klump's dick
So think before you blink and aye-aye make assumptions

[Refrain]
(Niggas!)
Your left, your left, your left, right left
(Niggas is coming!)
Your left, your left, your left, right left
(Niggas!)
Your left, your left, your left, right left
(Niggas is coming!)
Your left, your left, your left, right left

[Interlude]
5, 4, 3, 2, and where's Tyler?

[Verse 3: Tyler, The Creator]
Bottom of the countdown, shit ain't been the same
Since I found out Hodgy Beats ghost wrote for Bow Wow
Now I’m the loud, shock value style, foul-mouth fucker
That your teenage kid likes to bow down
Riding around town in Seattle
With the same shotgun that Kurt used to click-clack, boom-pow
Still suicidal but some assume that I'm cool now
'Cause I got a fucking award and my own room now
Nope, but I can flip shit like a couch pillow
And have my death silent like a loose vowel
The bandwagon turned into caboose, so
So, don't let that little nigga trumpet lose sound
Just let him play

[Intro: Wiz Khalifa]
Real trippy niggas
Hippy niggas
Uh nigga my mom blow that kinda cash nigga
What you talking about poppin bottles and shit...
Groceries fool

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Uh you know I kill...
Any motherfuckin' song that I go on
And now I dont gotta count the money that I spent
Cause I get it in
My bread so long, my bank big nigga prolonged
My brain fried nigga so long
I hate fake niggas and so on
Take all the money that I made this year
And that be the reason that you're hatin
Plus I smoke the bombest weed I call it Californication
A island for vacation I'm piling all this cake
A hundred thousand for the safe
Just bought a pound and I'mma face it
Now watch me
You nigga see my pieces try to copy
My Rollie presidential plus the rings that I got on by Versace
And I ain't even cocky I'm just confident that I'm the shit
You hatin mother fuckers know what time it is

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa & Juicy J]
I'm just riding around on my side of town
Got my windows up and my speakers loud
And we smokin so I'm gonna need a pound
Bet the haters wish they could see me now
But the money in the way
Everyone of us get money bruh
But the money in the way
My nigga on the real, all you see is dollar bill

[Verse 2: Juicy J]
I blow a hundred bands just to fuck around with
That ho that you in love with the ho I mess around with
Come fuck with a Taylor, blue dream in my paper
Bombay Sapphire for my people but tonight I'm doing Jaeger
20 years on and I ain't falling off
Niggas flex about the check and they run their mouth
Ferrari pull up guess who hoppin out
With a double couple in hand and some money count
Rockin Louie this I'm rockin Louie that
Louie on my ass, Louie on my hat
When I hit the club Louie in my hand
That's the Louie 13, Louie in my glass

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa & Juicy J]
I'm just riding around on my side of town
Got my windows up and my speakers loud
And we smokin so I'm gonna need a pound
Bet the haters wish they could see me now
But the money in the way
Everyone of us get money bruh
But the money in the way
My nigga on the real, all you see is dollar bill

[Interview: Rob Markman]
It's Rob Markman, you already know what it is
You know me and Cap go back
Taylor Allderdice it's just gettin' started
O.N.I.F.C. is next
The Gang album, Chevy Woods Gangland
Juicy J got like 4 mixtapes that he's just ready to drop on you
Keep movin' and movin'

[Intro]
Life is what you make it
They say time is money
If that's the case
I don't got neither for your broke ass

[Verse]
Life is such a dark image that I can't dream
I used to give these hard visions, in my near teens
Yea I'm getting dirty money, but my hands clean
Making money stretch, Ben Frank pull a ham string
Another get rich quick hair brain scheme
Just so we can shine like sterling
Time goes on, consider me the new guy
Walking in the office, brief case and a new tie
Rocky is the flyest on the banner when I cruise by
(How fly is he) The motherfucker too fly
Shit change mane, act yo age not your shoe size
Last of the dying breed, the game got her tubes tied
Niggas selling true lies, I'm all about the mula
Stressful, so every now and then I gotta woo sah
Bout to turn it up, see I'm hot as fuckin' July
Smooth suede shoes, I'm Busta Rhymes yelling "Woo Hah!!!"!
Snacks on the menu, it's best we continue
ASAP turn up events in the venue
And these fucking critics do their best to offend you
They don't care about your dress, and your veteran credentials
Motherfuck em' all, motherfuck em' all
We only shop boutiques, like motherfuck a mall
And I'm bright as stars, fresh as death in these McQueens
My outfit is deceased, Alexander rest in peace and I'm Gone

[Intro]
Uh, uh

[Verse 1]
Bitches ain't serious, man, these bitches delirious
All these bitches inferiors, I just pimp my interiors
I just pick up and go, might pick up a ho
Might give conversation if you kick up the dough
Never mind my money, never mind my stats
Every bitch wanna be me, you can find 'em in Saks
Pink Friday two milli, "Super Bass" triple plat'
When you see me on Ellen, just admit that I'm winnin'
Do a show for Versace, they request me by name
And if they don't get Nicki, it just won't be the same
When I'm sittin' with Anna, I'm really sittin' with Anna
Ain't a metaphor, punchline, I'm really sittin' with Anna
Front row at Oscar de la Renta, posture
Ain't a bitch that could do it, not even my imposter
Put these bitches on lockout, where the fuck is your roster?
I pull up in that new new marinara and pasta

[Pre-Chorus]
Shake my head, yo, I'm mad, ain't a bitch in my zone
In the middle o' nowhere, I just feel so alone
Got the certification, 'cause it come with the stone
But this ice is so cold, it should come on a cone

[Chorus]
It should come on a cone, it should come on a cone
Man, my ice is so cold, it should come on a cone
It should come on a cone, it should come on a cone
'Cause my ice is so cold, it should come on a cone

[Verse 2]
7-Up went and gave my commercial to Cee-Lo
But don't tell 'em I said it, let's keep it on the d-low
If you need you a look, just put me on your song
But you know it'll cost about six figures long
But you bitches ain't got it, where the fuck is your budgets?
Flying Spurs for hers, mean I'm fuckin' above it
And I just got the Ghost and I'm callin' it "Casper"
But that shit is so cold, it belong in Alaska
Why the fuck am I stylin'? I competes with myself
When you went against Nicki, you depleted your wealth
And I'm not masturbatin', but I'm feelin' myself
Paparazzis is waitin', 'cause them pictures'll sell
Now don't you feel real stupid? Yeah, that's egg on yo' face
If you wasn't so ugly, I'd put my dick in yo' face

[Interlude]
Dick in your face
Put my dick in your face, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Shake my head, yo, I'm mad, ain't a bitch in my zone
In the middle o' nowhere, I just feel so alone
Got the certification, 'cause it come with the stone
But this ice is so cold, it should come on a cone

[Chorus]
It should come on a cone, it should come on a cone
Man, my ice is so cold, it should come on a cone
It should come on a cone, it should come on a cone
'Cause my ice is so cold, it should come on a cone

[Outro]
Ooh-ooh, dick in your face
Ooh-ooh, dick in your face
Ooh-ooh, dick in your face
Put my dick in your face, put my dick in your face, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah
Kyuh

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Uh, look, sucker, this my gun butt-uh
Street fighter, bitches, this the up-cut-uh
Nunchuk-uh, no time to duck-uh
Sign of the cross, 'cause this is her last supper
Play wit' me, check who came wit' me
I bought a couple nines, plus the Ks with me
I breeze through Queens to check some bad bitches
I stunt so hard, assess the damages
'Cause this that "Oh," this is that "Oh"
And yes, I body bitches, go get the bandages
Y-Y-Y-Young Yummy, fuck you got for me?
I hate a phony bitch that front that chum-chummy
I'm me, top shotta, drop the top, top-uh
Big fat pussy wit' a icy watch

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
I am your leader, yes, I am your leader
You not a believer, suck a big dick

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Yo, when I fly, it's one letter and one number
You wack hoes could get hot for one summer
After that, the Queen'll still reign here
I'm Santa Claus to these hoes without a reindeer
Saint Nick, Ross, hey, Rick
I just got a toy, cost eight fifty
Now I'm in the hood, niggas is gettin' woodies
Hit up Hot Topic, Nicki Minaj hoodies
I-I-I-I-I'm a brand, bitch, I'm a brand
Go to Harlem and get Cam
It's Dipset, get your dick wet
Boarded a big jet and got a big check
Now you tell me, who the fuck is winnin'?
I'm on my Russell Simmon, Nicki denim, Nicki linen
Kyuh

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj & Rick Ross]
I am your leader (Uh), yes, I am your leader
You're not a believer, suck a big dick

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
Jealous niggas is gossip, watch me tie up my laces (Ugh)
Bitches be jocking, tell by the look on they faces
Eight digits I'm clocking, a lot of gold in my bracelet (Woo)
Seven figures on watches; I told my mama I made it (Ha-ha)
Made a deal for my project; just give me ten mil', I'm gravy (Gravy)
I went back to the projects, in two mil of Mercedes
I get head from your lady; have her bill me later
I'm old school with the hustle, just gave Rihanna my pager
Heartbreak hotel, I'm in the A-Rod suite
Rolls Royce wood, I'm talking playoff seats
Know that boy busy balling, I like to play all week
Monday night with the RAW, I’m Vince McMahon with a beat
Power-slamming them hammers, I get you handled for free (Uh)
So where the fuck is her manners? She give me brain while I tweet
DM, in the BM, you "cm"; you bucket, you love it
Motherfuckers on my dick, suck it

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
I am your leader, yes, I am your leader
You're not a believer, suck a big dick
I am your leader, yes, I am your leader
You're not a believer, suck a big dick

[Verse 4: Cam'ron]
Ugh, see the car is European
But got imported from Tokyo (It did)
Looking like a shark
The nose, call it Pinocchio (No lie)
Well off, wealthy, LV logo (Uh-huh)
Middle of July, but the wrist on snow-flow (Swish!)
Only do the Aspens
Y'all can have the Poconos (Y'all can have that)
I'm Sonny, and you my son (Calogero)
Ride the whip, five on the hip
Live with the pies, got nine for the flip
High with a bitch, she cry for the dick
Oh my, know why? I'm fly as it gets
Now I need a Aspirin; she said, "You're only Cameron"
Girlfriend, you don't know Cameron from nowhere
So don't go tampering (Watch ya mouth)
You're just a nail, I hammer (Yup!)
'Nother girl that's on my camera (Yup!)
My name, you cannot slander at all
Girl, watch your manners (Yup!)
She run and tell her mother, "I think I love him, Nana."
Because you sat upon my lap? Nah! I ain't Santa (Nope!)
They call me "Pied Piper," OJ no glove I knife her
Never been a lifer, even do Rikers
Why would I fight? I don’t even like her (Ch-ch)

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
I am your leader, yes, I am your leader
You're not a believer, suck a big dick
I-I-I-I am your leader, yes, I am your leader
You're not a believer, suck a big dick
I-I-I-I am your leader, yes, I am your leader
You're not a believer, suck a big dick
I am your leader, yes, I am your leader
You're not a believer, suck a big dick

Yo

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
Bitches ain't shit and they ain't sayin' nothing
A hundred motherfuckers can't tell me nothing
I beez in the trap, bee-beez in the trap
I beez in the trap, bee-beez in the trap
Bitches ain't shit and they ain't sayin' nothing
A hundred motherfuckers can't tell me nothing
I beez in the trap, bee-beez in the trap
I beez in the trap, bee-beez in the trap

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Uh, man, I been did that, man, I been popped off
And if she ain't tryin' to give it up, she get dropped off
Let me bust that U-ie, bitch, bust that open
Might spend a couple thou' just to bust that open
Rip it off, no joking, like your name Hulk Hogan
Niggas move weight in the South, but live in Hoboken
Bitch, I spit that crack, like I'm in that trap
So if you need a hit, then I'm with that bat (Bow!)

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj & 2 Chainz]
Bitches ain't shit and they ain't sayin' nothing
A hundred motherfuckers can't tell me nothing
I beez in the trap, bee-beez in the trap

Bitches ain't shit and they ain't sayin' nothing
A hundred motherfuckers can't tell me nothing (Tru!)
I beez in the trap, bee-beez in the trap (Yeah)
I beez in the trap, bee-beez in the trap (2 Chainz!)

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
Okay, now, Nicki, Nicki, Nicki, put it in your kidney
Got a new LS 450, ain't no keys in this doohickey
If I weren't rapping, I'd be trapping
If I weren't trapping, I'd be pimping
If I weren't pimping, I'd be getting it, period
I don't smoke no Bobby, but my denim be from Ricky (Ricky)
Got your girl on Molly, and we smokin' loud and drinkin' (Drinkin')
Got my top back so you can see what I been thinkin' (Thinkin')
I—If you know me then you know I've been thinking Franklin (Franklin)
Money (Money), thousands (Thousands)
True Religion trousers (Tell 'em!)
Got a private home, started from them public houses (Damn)
Hair weave killer (Killer), causing her arousal (Tru)
Audi A8, told them "outtie 5000," uh!

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
Bitches ain't shit and they ain't sayin' nothing
A hundred motherfuckers can't tell me nothing
I beez in the trap, bee-beez in the trap

Bitches ain't shit and they ain't sayin' nothing
A hundred motherfuckers can't tell me nothing
I beez in the trap, bee-beez in the trap
I beez in the trap, bee-beez in the trap

[Bridge: Nicki Minaj]
Damn, damn, what they say about me?
I don't know man, fuck is on your biscuit
If I get hit, swinging on a big bitch
I don't know man, I'm shittin' on your whole life
Damn, damn, what they say about me?
I don't know man, fuck is on your biscuit
If I get hit, swinging on a big bitch
I don't know man, I'm shittin' on your whole life

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
Bitches ain't shit and they ain't sayin' nothing
A hundred motherfuckers can't tell me nothing
I beez in the trap, bee-beez in the trap
I beez in the trap, bee-beez in the trap

[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj]
Man, I'm out in Texas, man, I'm out in A-town
Then I'm up in Chi-town or Miami shuttin' it down
It's that New Orleans, it's LA or The Bay
It's New York, Philly, and the whole DMV
I'm a Detroit player, man, it's North-South Cack
Ohio, Pittsburgh, got St. Louis on deck
It's Delaware, Connecticut, it's New Jersey got hella bricks
It's Queens, Brooklyn, and yeah, they wildin'
Bronx, Harlem, and Staten Island

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
Bitches ain't shit and they ain't sayin' nothing
A hundred motherfuckers can't tell me nothing
I beez in the trap, bee-beez in the trap
I beez in the trap, bee-beez in the trap

[Verse: Empress Stahhr]
I'm still dope even if the bag ain't Coach
Even if I don't smoke 'til the hydro roach
I'm still dope, rock a thrift store coat
And a fresh pair of moccasins comfortable for walkin' in
No A&R marketin', this is my reality
Still dope, power walk, burning off the calories
Fact and not fallacy, Metal Face family
Imminent fatality, taking us too casually
I got it, it's cool, just part of the school
And I'm acing the lesson, it's time, so quit stressin'
Still dope, vibrant, natural game
No ring, no chain, still bringin' the pain
Still dope, got no choice but to cope
Listen, take notes, I'm showin' you the ropes
Still dope, very high dosage
My approach is lights out, buenos noches
Hold my glasses so I can get Riddick
Send 'em home tail tucked, holdin' they fitteds
Cold as a Guinness, "One pint miss!"
Yo, chill, watch the table, a fish might flip!
Crack jokes spit, pop mad shit
That's what it's made for, cop that quick
"Drop that, vic!" Butterfingers, oopsie
Signed away your publishing for Jordans and a loosie?
The old one-two, see; solo not groupie
All over they ass like sweats by Juicy
Cats is puss like Sagwa and Morris
Stay spittin' lines, there is no chorus
Deploying the troublesome, sleep in bubblegum
That's a double dumb, hum if you feel where I'm comin' from
Do it 'til ya lips are numb, you gotta go for it
I stay moving forward, I'm baby bear porridge
Knick-nack paddywack, fuck y'all critics
This dime on the grind when it come to the spinach
Conquered the Id, vicious like Sid flow
Not a nympho, IMpress Official!
She rock mikes, you wait to exhale
She rock shows like DMC rock Cazals
She rock shells, manicured nails
Rock for every belle with a spliff to inhale
Holdin' she own cone of homegrown shrubbery
Won't go hungry, the flow too lovely
Leavin' grills dented on a SUV rented
Classic as vintage Impalas that's all tinted
Raw bidness, like how them wifeys get hitted
Authentic, the track is so love, I'm all in it
Aww quit it, of course I'm inclined to shine, did-ick
Line for line wit it, climbin' infinite
¿Tu no sabe? Yo soy una bien mala madre
Confident aren't we? Playin' it smartly
Word to Dios, Estrella is lethal
Flow muy frio, roll the dice chico
Live crazy decent insanely frequent
Strangely sleep wit' one eye open not jokin', outspoken
Provokin' and chokin', ego strokin' is lame
Word bonder than James, four alarm wit' the flame
Way ahead of the game, we still playing the same
Royalty in my veins, it'll always remain
Forever doin' my thing, solo or crew I can hang
Like ylang and ylang, bring the Yin to the Yang
They got placenta for brains, testing my venomous slang
Fools get fitted for bangs and rented for change
Some people think I'm deranged, others a little bit strange
Just trying to rattle my cage cause I'm way outta they range

[Hook]
Herpes on my lip, I got herpes on my..
Herpes on my lip, I got herpes on my..
Herpes on my lip, grandma got herpes on her..

[Verse 1]
You got full blown AIDS, I got full blown crabs
You got full blown AIDS, I caught it from your dad
He gave me kiss so I call the cops
Not to tell nobody, they gave me money and a lollipop
My name is Bob, your real name is Charm
I hate Myspace, nigga fuck a Tom
You gotta fidget, get up in it in my video
There's gon' be transsexual Cambodian midgets

[Hook]
Herpes on my lip, I got herpes on my..
Herpes on my lip, I got herpes on my..
Herpes on my lip, grandma got herpes on her..

[Verse 2]
You like my clothes, you like my shirt
You like my purse, my girlfriend got a flat chest
Mustache, flat ass, no hair
Chicken head weave wearing dirty underwear
Rogue Status: fresh Nikes
Nice bikes, skateboard no
Nice dikes
I got a cat,, you got a frog..
You got a girlfriend, my girlfriend is a frog

[Hook]
Herpes on my lip, I got herpes on my..
Herpes on my lip, I got herpes on my..
He dont like the Herpes on my lip, thats why he sent me that message

This is dedicated to all the beautiful people in the world

[Intro: Mario Savio]
There's a time when the operation of the machine becomes so odious
Makes you so sick at heart, that you can't take part
You can't even passively take part
And you've got to put your bodies upon the gears and upon the wheels
Upon the levers, upon all the apparatus
And you've got to make it stop

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
To save face, how low can you go
Talk a lot of game but yet you don't know
Static on the way, make us all say whoa
The people up top push the people down low
Get down and obey every word
Steady getting mine if you haven't yet heard
Wanna take what I got, don't be absurd
Don't fight the power, nobody gets hurt
If you haven't heard yet then I'm letting you know
There ain't shit we don't run when the guns unload
And no one make a move unless my people say so
Got everything outta control, now everybody go

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Steel unload, final blow
We the animals, take control
Hear us now, clear and true
Wretches and kings we come for you

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
So keep pace, how slow can you go
Talk a lot of shit and yet you don't know
Fire on the way, make you all say whoa
The people up top and the people down low
Get down and I'm running it like that
The front of the attack is exactly where I'm at
Somewhere in-between, the kick and the hi-hat
The pen and the contract, the pitch and the contact
So get with the combat, I'm letting 'em know
There ain't shit you can say to make me back down no
So push the button let the whole thing blow
Spinning everything outta control, now everybody go

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Steel unload, final blow
We the animals, take control
Hear us now, clear and true
Wretches and kings we come for you
Steel unload, fire blow
Filthy animals, beat them low
Skin and bone, black and blue
No more this sun shall beat onto you

[Bridge: Mike Shinoda]
From the front to the back and the side to side
If you fear what I feel, put 'em up real high
Front to the back and the side to side
If you fear what I feel, put 'em up real high
Front to the back and the side to side
If you fear what I feel, put 'em up real high
Front to the back and the side to side
If you fear what I feel, put 'em up real high
Front to the back and the side to side
If you fear what I feel, put 'em up real high
Front to the back and the side to side
If you fear what I feel, put 'em up real high

[Outro: Mario Savio]
When the operation of the machine becomes so odious
Makes you so sick at heart, that you can't take part
You can't even passively take part
And you've got to put your bodies upon the gears and upon the wheels
Upon the levers, upon all the apparatus
And you've got to make it stop
And you've got to indicate to the people who run it, to the people who own it
That unless you're free
The machine will be prevented from working at all
Wolf gang set off the car alarms
Ive been the same as I was before I had gone
And this prolonged, chronic rapping son who belonged
To a father who left, told mom to keep an eye on
Yeah, sent away quick, to become a mute swan
Whos really there, when you need someone to hang on
Niggas who were friends, slip em' a gallon of exxon
To flush em' out, and slowly, fuck islands, theyre lonely
Referenced, im in the book, the one and only
Breaking out fights like a canadian playing goalie
Fuck religion my nigga, im the only one holy
My futures even, keepin it lowly
Gawking the spat through your tooth gap
I dont need a crew, lets just keep it at that
Im that scab to pick at, flying solo, European brown bat
Caught up in a group of domestic cats
Strike on up at bat, you stick to me like gnats
Living in a home wit' welcome back on my place mat

[Intro]

[Verse 1: Roy Harper]
Come in here, dear boy, have a cigar, you're gonna go far
You're gonna fly high, you're never gonna die
You're gonna make it if you try, they're gonna love you
Well, I've always had a deep respect an' I mean that most sincerely
The band is just fantastic, that is really what I think
Oh, by the way, which one's Pink?

[Chorus: Roy Harper]
And did we tell you the name of the game, boy?
We call it riding the gravy train

[Verse 2: Roy Harper]
We're just knocked out, we heard about the sell-out
You gotta get an album out, you owe it to the people
We're so happy we can hardly count
Everybody else is just green, have you seen the chart?
It's a hell of a start, it could be made into a monster
If we all pull together as a team

[Chorus: Roy Harper]
And did we tell you the name of the game, boy?
We call it riding the gravy train

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 1]
I got imitators, haters, and some psychos
But what I have most are bitches who are fame whores
Seen her at a party posing for photos
She don't think about the world past painting toes
This girl has been doing rounds at the local mall
And a evading past doing dudes in rock and roll
Pretty face character deadly like a
She always claims she's part native Navajo
It's kinda easy dressin' head to toe in black
Her style is straight whack off a magazine rack
Buy it, post it, link it, spread it, ready and read it
You're always on Myspace but you need phone credit

[Hook]
You wanna be the next big thing, "it" thing
Do anything, but you can't sing
Hey Marsha
What'd you do yesterday?
'Cause when I read the blog story
Don't add up to what you told me
Hey Marsha
What'd you do yesterday
What I read on your blog story
Don't add up to what you told me

[Verse 2]
You want, you want, you want, you want
You want to be a model for American Apparel
It's apparent that yourself is way dumber than Cowell
You want high fashion so you worked at fashion high
Cocaine kept you talking most of it a fucking lie
You shooters now dumber trying to talent call job
Your shoes could feed a village
You should think about that
Facebook face facts can you know that
"Blah blah blah blah blah", girl, you should post that

[Hook]
You wanna be the next big thing, "it" thing
Do anything, but you can't sing
Hey Marsha
What'd you do yesterday?
'Cause when I read the blog story
Don't add up to what you told me
Hey Marsha
Hey Marsha
What'd you do yesterday
What I read on your blog story
Don't add up to what you told me

[HOOK: K-Young]
You wanna be my girl?
I think you wanna be my girl
Why you wanna be my girl?
You said you wanna be my girl
First you gotta know

Is it about you?
First I gotta know (yeah)
Can you bring out you?
First I gotta know (yeah)
Can you hang with your boy?
Can you be my girl ?
First I gotta know

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
You wanna be mine
Lil Angelina
Make me your Brad Pitt
Mr and Miss Smith
Tokyo and then Paris
Neck and wrists full of carats
Used to worry but don't care about
Now she wanna get tat
Call when I'm on the road
When I'm home I'm lettin' you have it
Give you space cuz I'm grown
What's going on ain't no marriage
Every city I'm known
Plus my bank above average
So I can't get mad if ...

[HOOK: K-Young]

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
It ain't no secret, (got what)
I'm the Prince where I'm from
She want be my Ms.Pinkett (but)
Your girls don't think I'm the one
On the road to freak with
Groupies jockin' them major
Swear world but these freaks in
I'm just getting this paper
Stuntin' when they in your face
On the low y'all haters
Wishing they was in your place
Trips we're going all paid for
Everything become taylor
Fastlane ain't no slow mo'e
Feelin like I'm already your man so...

[Verse 1: B.o.B as an old friend]
What ever happened to Bobby Ray? He used to be here for us
Then he got famous and left all of his fans in the dust
We never hear from you, you're constantly changing
And your relatives always miss you at family occasions
And your mother misses you too, since all the fortune
You've been too busy recording, now she feels unimportant
And your daddy's been going through it since he lost his mother
The least you could do is call him to show him, you support him
I never thought you would sell out, you're becoming so cocky
I asked you for a picture after your show, you walked right by me
I'm like, "Ain't this the dude that said that it ain't about the price tag?"
Now on your records all that you do is brag
Come on, Bob, I thought you was better than that, dawg
What happened to "Cloud 9" and "Generation Lost"?
You were my idol, just when I thought I'd give up on everything
I heard you play this familiar melody (Melody, melody, melody, ...)

[Hook]
I heard you play this familiar melody (Melody, melody, melody, ...)
Da-da-dum, da-da-dum, da-da-dum
Da-da-dum, da-da-dum, da-da-dum
(Melody, melody, melody, ...)
Da-da-dum, da-da-dum, da-da-dum
Da-da-dum, da-da-dum, da-da-dum

[Verse 2: B.o.B as a longtime fan]
What ever happened to B.o.B? He once was my favorite
I swear to God that I had all of his mixtapes on my playlist
He was hood, but so different at the same time
It was like a breath of fresh air, everytime he rhymed
And everybody was on him and the world fell in love
The girls, the money, the lifestyle, all the above
I guess he's stopped giving a fuck for all of his little people
With your shades on, we can't even see you
Is that what happens, when somebody makes it off of rapping?
They taste the fame and change like it's just automatic
Where's the integrity? You're on that other shit
You don't even sound the same, I liked your other shit
But we'll still stand beside you, 'cause somewhere deep inside you
There's more than what meets the eye
I swear on the Bible, you were my idol
Just when I thought I'd give up on everything
I heard you play this familiar melody (Melody, melody, melody, ...)

[Hook]
I heard you play this familiar melody (Melody, melody, melody, ...)
Da-da-dum, da-da-dum, da-da-dum
Da-da-dum, da-da-dum, da-da-dum

Da-da-dum, da-da-dum, da-da-dum
Da-da-dum, da-da-dum, da-da-dum

[Verse 3: B.o.B]
I watched my whole life change in a couple of years
Who woulda ever thought I woulda caught the world by the ears?
I swear, this shit is so much bigger than I had figured
But if it wasn't meant to be, this wouldn't be my career
It's like, people only see it the way it appears
But they never see the ropes and the pulleys and the gears
Blood, sweat, and tears, we cry blood, all we sweat is tears
In the middle of this rap game on the battle field
All of these shock jock interviews, tryna phone me
You never know who's gonna try to play you and make you look phoney
I live and die for my team, these niggas are more than my homies
We put it all on the line, we gave up all our belongings for this rap shit
'Cause at the end of the day, it ain't just rap shit
I call it making a way for our survival
Just when I thought I gave up on everything
I dreamed about this familiar melody (Melody, melody, melody, ...)

[Hook]
I dreamed about this familiar melody (Melody, melody, melody, ...)
Da-da-dum, da-da-dum, da-da-dum
(Melody, melody, melody, ...)
Da-da-dum, da-da-dum, da-da-dum
Da-da-dum, da-da-dum, da-da-dum

[Verse 1: Madonna]
Wake up, ex-wife
This is your life
Children, on your own
Turning on the telephone
Messages, manager
No time for a manicure
Working out, shake my ass
I know how to multitask
Connecting to the Wi-Fi
Went from nerd to superb
Have you seen the new guy?
I forgot the password
Gotta call the babysitter
Tweeting on the elevator
I could take a helicopter
I don't even feel the pressure

[Chorus: Madonna]
I'm gonna be okay
I don't care what the people say
I'm gonna be alright
Gonna live fast and I'm gonna live right
I'm moving fast, can you follow my track?
I'm moving fast and I like it like that
I do ten things all at once
And if you have a problem, I don't give a

[Verse 2: Madonna]
You were so mad at me
Who's got custody?
Lawyers, suck it up
Didn't have a pre-nup
Make a film, write a song
Gotta get my stockings on
Meet the press, buy the dress
All of this to impress
RIde my horse, break some bones
Take it down a semitone
I forgot to say my prayers
Baby Jesus on the stairs
Gotta sign a contract
Gotta get my money back
All the bottles have to go
Standing in the front row

[Chorus: Madonna]
I'm gonna be okay
I don't care what the people say
I'm gonna be alright
Gonna live fast and I'm gonna live right
I'm moving fast, can you follow my track?
I'm moving fast and I like it like that
I do ten things all at once
And if you have a problem, I don't give a

[Bridge: Madonna]
I tried to be a good girl
I tried to be your wife
Diminished myself and swallowed my light
I tried to become all that you expect of me
And if it was a failure, I don't give a
(I don't give a, I-I-I don't
I don't give a, I-I-I don't
I don't give a, I-I-I don't
I don't give a)

[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj & Madonna]
Shots fire!
Anything you hear Nicki on, that's fire!
You don't hear them bums on nothing, that's fire!
Tell 'em, "catch fire"
In the Bugatti, ten grand, one tire
Ayo Madonna (Yes, Nicki?)
Mi yuh say you original, Don Dada
Inna ya Gabbana, inna all ya Prada!
We material girls, ain't nobody hotter
Pops collar!
See, I really can't relate to your Volvo
And you can't get these shoes at the Aldo
When I let a dude go, that's his loss
I was cutting them checks, I was his boss!
Yo, I don't give a F you, curse nor bless you
Never let 'em stress you, yo
I ain't a businesswoman, I'm a business, woman!
And I'm known for giving bitches the business, woman

[Chorus: Madonna & Nicki Minaj]
I'm gonna be okay (Mama)
I don't care what the people say (Madonna!)
I'm gonna be alright (Nicki Minaj!)
Gonna live fast and I'm gonna live right
I'm moving fast, can you follow my track? (Let's go)
I'm moving fast and I like it like that (Catch up)
I do ten things all at once (Mama)
And if you have a problem, I don't give a

[Outro: Nicki Minaj]
There's only one queen and that's Madonna
Bitch!

[Intro]
Go!

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
It all comes down to this
I miss your morning kiss
I won't lie, I'm feeling it
You're gone now, and I'm missing it
I'm so dumb, I must admit
It's too much to hold it in
I can't say no more than this
I just hope your heart hear me now

[Pre-Chorus 1: Nicki Minaj]
Gotta let you know how I'm feeling
You own my heart, he just renting
Don't turn away, pay attention
I'm pouring out my heart, oh, boy

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
I, I'm not livin' life
I'm not livin' right (yeah, yeah, no, woah)
I'm not livin' if you're not by my side, oh
I, I'm not livin' life
I'm not livin' right (woah, oh, oh, woah, oh, oh)
I'm not livin' if you're not by my side, oh (woah, oh, oh, yeah)

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Let's meet at our favorite spot
You know the one
Right around the block from the nice place that you love to shop
Can you get away?
Girl, just sit down, let's talk it out
One-on-one, without a crowd
I wanna hold your hand, make you laugh again
I need to be near you

[Pre-Chorus 2: Chris Brown]
Gotta let you know how I'm feeling
You own my heart, and she's just renting
Don't turn away, pay attention
I'm pouring out my heart, girl

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj & Chris Brown]
I, I'm not livin' life
I'm not livin' right
No, I'm not livin' if you're not by my side, oh
I, I'm not livin' life
I'm not livin' right (woah, oh, oh, woah, oh, oh)
I'm not livin' if you're not by my side, oh (woah, oh, oh)

[Bridge: Nicki Minaj & Chris Brown]
I can't eat, I, I, I, I
I can't sleep, I, I, I, I
What I need, I, I, I, I
Is you right by my side, I
I can't eat, I, I, I, I (you)
I can't sleep, I, I, I, I
What I need, I, I, I, I (I, I, I)
Is you right by my side, I (yeah, yeah)

[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj]
It, it, it, it, it ain't your spit game, it's your dick game
That got me walkin' 'round ready to wear your big chain
I only argue with him when the Lakers on
Other than that, I'm gettin' my Marc Jacobs on
Man, my pussy game so cold, that he always seem to come back
'Cause he know that it be a rap, when I'm ridin' it from the back
Wait, oh, let me see your phone 'cause all them bitches is ratchet
And don't let me get in my truck; 'cause all them bitches will catch it
Wait-we-we-we-we-we-wait, damn, there I go again
I be trippin', I be flippin', I be so belligerent
Man, the shit that we be fightin' over so irrelevant
I don't even remember, though I was probably hella bent (let's go, let's go)

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj & Chris Brown]
I, I'm not livin' life
I'm not livin' right (yeah, yeah, I'm not livin', oh, yeah)
No, I'm not livin' if you're not by my side, oh (no, no, no, no)
I, I'm not livin' life
I'm not livin' right (oh, yeah, I'm not livin', I'm not livin, ooh)
I'm not livin' if you're not by my side, oh (ooh, baby)
I (woah, oh, oh, yeah)
Life (woah, oh, oh, yeah)
Right (woah, oh, oh, yeah)
If you're not by my side (woah, oh)

[Outro: Nicki Minaj & Chris Brown]
I can't eat, I, I, I, I
I can't sleep, I, I, I, I (I can't eat)
What I need, I, I, I, I (I can't sleep)
Is you right by my side, I (without you, baby)

[Verse 1: Frank Ocean]

Could this be Earth? Could this be light?
Does this mean everything, is going to be alright?
When I look out my window there's trees talking like people
I've dreamt of storms, I've dreamt of sound
I've dreamt of gravity, keeping us around
I've slept in the darkness, it was lonely, and there was silence
What is this love? I don't feel the same
Don't believe what this is, could be given a name
I woke, you were there, tracing planets on my forehead
But I forget

[Verse 2: Melo-X]

I forget 23, shit what year was that?
Nowadays life can fly by so fast like cars you see on highways
Watch 'em driving past, they all got a destination
Many elders say that you should focus more on the steps that's takin
To get there, but damn it's taking too long, been waiting so long
Now I feel like I'm breaking my strong
Ways of thinking about the reality of this industry
And exactly what it takes for me
To get to where I want to be
If trees could speak
They would talk about these brand new humans that came around
Building things that brought smog around
Now, how's that for gentrification?
While I'm patiently waiting the arrival
Of real shit that goes viral
I speak to those with they eyes closed
Tell 'em open 'em up
Sit, back, relax and tote on a blunt
Frontin' like I been sober for months
Last night I was in the club laying drunk
Screamin' out what the, huh
Yeah you know the word
And at the end of the day I'm just tryin' to be heard
Ya heard

[Verse 3: Frank Ocean]

But I forget 23 like I forget 17
And I forget my first love, like you forget a daydream
And what if all my wild friends, and the times I've had with them
Will all fade to grey soon, on the TV station

[Verse 1]
Zippin', I’m zippin', I’m zippin'
Soon as they come out, I’m dippin'
Big ass closet, I’m trippin'
Big booty strippers, I’m tippin'
Big ass chain, I’m heavy
And it ain't cost me a penny
They pay me to rock it
Damn, I got niggas in pocket
Super Bowl, Grammys
What a hell of a jammie
All these bitches my sons
I’ma get ‘em a nanny
Argentina for Pepsi, Orlando All-Star
Fuck you said, bitch? Fuck you, porn star
I don’t do shotgun, I be drivin' my own car
I don’t do shots neither, I’m buyin' the whole bar
Holy moly, G copped me a Rollie
I ain't catchin' the puck, but iced out like a goalie, nigga

[Chorus]
I'm in the HOV lane, I'm in the HOV lane
And you, y-y-you, y-y-you? Soul Train
I'm in the HOV lane, I'm in the HOV lane
And you, y-y-you, y-y-you? Soul Train
I'm in the HOV lane, I'm in the HOV lane
And you, y-y-you, y-y-you? Soul Train
I'm in the HOV lane, I'm in the HOV lane
And you, y-y-you, y-y-you? Soul Train

[Verse 2]
I travel more than you walkin' with a basketball
I'm out in Spain, runnin' game to the Matador
I'm in my own lane, you ain't in my categor'
You like a RAV4, I’m like the Aventador
Birkin bags, man, I murk them ads
When I re-up on Reloaded, I'ma hurt them bad
Every shoot is hot, when I'm out, I'm spotted
They gon' frame the receipt if I sign the dotted
N-n-niggas on Banshees is speedin'
Dirt bikes is out for the season
Back break wheelie and leanin'
Damn, a bitch late for a meetin'
NYPD comin’
Belt Parkway, we gunnin’
Double R engine hummin'
Actin' a fool, we dumbin’

[Chorus]
I'm in the HOV lane, I'm in the HOV lane
And you, y-y-you, y-y-you? Soul Train
I'm in the HOV lane, I'm in the HOV lane
And you, y-y-you, y-y-you? Soul Train
I'm in the HOV lane, I'm in the HOV lane
And you, y-y-you, y-y-you? Soul Train
I'm in the HOV lane, I'm in the HOV lane
And you, y-y-you, y-y-you? Soul Train

[Bridge]
N-N-N-Nintendo and we in the end zone
I don’t give a fuck, ho, like we in the friend zone
What the fuck it look like? What the fuck it’s hittin' fo'?
Tell 'em bitches, "Y-y-y-y-you you ain’t about that life"
Nintendo and we in the end zone
I don’t give a fuck, ho, like we in the friend zone
What the fuck it look like? What the fuck it’s hittin' fo'?
Tell 'em bitches, "Y-y-y-y-you you ain’t about that life"

[Chorus]
I'm in the HOV lane, I'm in the HOV lane
And you, y-y-you, y-y-you? Soul Train
I'm in the HOV lane, I'm in the HOV lane
And you, y-y-you, y-y-you? Soul Train
I'm in the HOV lane, I'm in the HOV lane
And you, y-y-you, y-y-you? Soul Train
I'm in the HOV lane, I'm in the HOV lane
And you, y-y-you, y-y-you? Soul Train

[Verse 1: Action Bronson]
Yo, pop, sniff confetti for the toast
Dropkicks like Janetty off the ropes
Mach 6 smoking heavy on the coast
See me dip the law like vanilla in a cone
Use caution cause if not, then you a goner
Only talk business where we sitting in a sauna
Ain't trying to be in prison, taking shits up in the corner
Rikers Island know the water so it's all water
Shoes native, rock a husky as a headdress
Mind's sick so we need to be on bedrest
You're favourite niece give me head sex
She's a squirter, so the bed's wet
You're gonna have to lay the towel down
Retard shit, class in the basement
Free form jazz band, eat a pussy
While she do a handstand, out in Flushing call me Bam-Bam
Smoke good, stay chopped, Van Damme hand
Damn, the bitch like Mrs. Schroeder
Vinegar by the bed, that's for the vicious odor
Vicodin from Minnesota, make her kiss the cobra
Bottle service, snap my fingers, tell them bring it over
"Ohhh but I don't even drink"
Then shorty sipped the liquor, then I'll fuck her on the sink
Red mink to the ankle mat lotioned
Arch your back, slow motion
Hold a green toast out in Oakland, shooting juice in my upper cheek
Shorty dripping like a tunnel leak
You know your whole team pussy like a muffin sheet
Stay balanced like a runner's feet, it's me

[Chorus]
I'm a-a diva (hey), I'm a, I'm a-a diva (hey)
I'm a, I'm a-a diva (hey), I'm a, I'm a-a diva

[Post-Chorus]
Na-na-na, diva is a female version of a hustla, of a hustla, of a, of a hustla
Na-na-na, diva is a female version of a hustla, of a hustla, of a, of a hustla

[Verse 1]
Stop the track, lemme state facts
I told you, gimme a minute and I'll be right back
Fifty million 'round the world and they say that I couldn't get it
I done got so sick and filthy with Benjis, I can't spend it
How you gon' be talkin' shit? You act like I just got up in it
Been the number one diva in this game for a minute
I know you read the paper, the one that they call the Queen
Every radio 'round the world know me 'cause that's where I be (first!)

[Chorus]
I'm a-a diva (hey), I'm a, I'm a-a diva (hey)
I'm a, I'm a-a diva (hey), I'm a, I'm a-a diva

Na-na-na, diva is a female version of a hustla, of a hustla, of a, of a hustla

[Verse 2]
When he pull up, wanna pop my hood up
Bet he better have a six-pack in the cooler
Gettin' money, diva's gettin' money
If you ain't gettin' money, then you ain't got nothin' for me
Tell me somethin', (Tell me somethin')
Where yo boss at (Where yo' boss at?)
Where my ladies up in here that like to talk back? (That like to talk back)
I wanna see her (I wanna see her)
I'd like to meet ya (I'd like to meet her)
What you say? (Not to me)
She ain't no diva (She ain't no diva)

[Pre-Bridge]
Na-na-na, diva is a female version of a hustla, of a hustla, of a, of a hustla
Na-na-na, diva is a female version of a hustla, of a hustla, of a, of a hustla

[Bridge]
Since 15 in my stilettos, been struttin' in this game
"What's yo' age?" was the question they ask when I hit the stage
I'm a diva, best believe her, you see how she gettin' paid?
She ain't callin' him to greet her, don't need him, her bed's made
This is a stick-up, stick-up (I need them bags, all that money)
We're gonna stick-up, stick-up (You see them ask, "Where that money?")
All my ladies get it up, I see you, I do the same
Take it to another level, no passengers on my plane

[Pre-Bridge]
I'm a, I'm a-a diva (hey), I'm a, I'm a-a diva
I'm a, I'm a-a diva (hey), I'm a, I'm a-a di...

[Bridge]
This is a stick-up, stick-up (I need them bags, all that money)
Stick-up, stick-up (You see the mask, "Where that money?")

Na-na-na, diva is a female version of a hustla, of a hustla, of a, of a hustla
Na-na-na, diva is a female version of a hustla, of a hustla, of a, of a hustla...

[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
Been ready
Jay, I been ready
HOV, I been ready
They say patience

[Verse 1: Kendrick]
Everybody wanna know why my game plan so strong
Cuz' I ain't gotta think with a light bulb on
Nigga I eat, sleep, and shit rap; I never relax, been a busybody since I was born
"Is he really fucking with Sean?"
I reply, "His pick, I would take a tool on."
Dolce brown nigga, I'm right now, you ain't gotta wait later
Where the CD at? Put it in the disc player
Tell ho ride to it, I do it like none other
K-Dot, definition of a young motherfucker with a problem
"Future of the West Coast" I am
And that's real tough
Southern California, Angels, AKA LA Sharks
Make comparisons when I seen him duck
Man you think "What was to Pac and Big, before?"
And that was before
I picked up a pen, and when I did, my thumb and my index sore
And then I started writing with it
Found that it flows better, like a Venice Beach sea shore
He don't wear the same clothes as ya'll
He is cut from a different cloth
Ya boy is cool, but I'm a different frost
Like igloo, every time I come off
Every time I take off
Pandemonium when I take off
They hanging on the wing of that G4
30,000 feet and still won't fall
Why you do that for?
Why you had to sell out that store
You made my record sales come up short
My reply is that it ain't my fault
Blame God

[Chorus: Kendrick]
I can't wait when its my time (I'm coming)
No I take that back, cuz' I got time (I'm coming)
I know that patience is virtue
But that being said, you got time before I hurt you
No lie (No lie)
I can't wait when its my time (My time)
No I take that back, cuz' I got time (Got Time)
I know that patience is virtue
But that being said, you got time before I hurt you
No lie (No lie)

[Verse 2: Kendrick]
When the lights get dark
And every body quiet, know its my part
I might start a riot
The main event
Bulletproof under that black tent, you can't shoot through shit
I never played the bench
Star Point Guard
Never pass up money, I'm a ball hog
Touch anything I get my hands on, into pushin' like Ray Charles
I never had no flaws
"Ooos" and "Ahhs" after every bar
Take your bitch, then give her back
For no reason for, just because, ya'll actin hard
I'm bein myself
And I got some plastic under my belt, so rest assured
You don't want your moms thinkin' bout pullin' that hospital cord
Went from a Honda Accord, to a Bentley Azure
Back seat got a flock of broads
And I ain't gotta say to kiss it, just like "Sure"
Momma gon' clean or fix it
Use Terrific, Easter Brum????????
All it need is a little season on
Who said a veteran can't be so young?
I sound better than half ya'll on
Damn K. Dot, let me see your arm
I ain't gotta do a show, my jewels perform
I ain't gotta do a show, my jewels perform
Princess cut looks stupid dumb
Eyes close shut, all I see is dollar signs
And I won't get enough till I'm layed in the grave or hand cuffed up bout one time
No Lie
Blame God

[Chorus: Kendrick]
I can't wait when its my time (I'm coming)
No I take that back, cuz' I got time (I'm coming)
I know that patience is virtue
But that being said, you got time before I hurt you
No lie (No lie)
I can't wait when its my time (My time)
No I take that back, cuz' I got time (Got Time)
I know that patience is virtue
But that being said, you got time before I hurt you
No lie (No lie)
If you hear this message, wherever you stand
I'm calling every woman, calling every man
We're the generation
We can't afford to wait
The future started yesterday and we're already late

We've been looking for a song to sing
Searched for a melody
Searched for someone to lead
We've been looking for the world to change
If you feel the same
Then go on and say

If you're out there
Sing along with me
If you're out there
I'm dying to believe that you're out there
Stand up and say it loud
If you're out there
Tomorrow's starting now
Now, now
No more broken promises
No more call to war
Unless it's love and peace that we're really fighting for
We can destroy hunger
We can conquer hate
Put down the arms and raise your voice
We're joining hands today

Oh I was looking for a song to sing
I searched for a leader
But the leader was me
We were looking for the world to change
We can be heroes
Just go on and say

If you're out there
Sing along with me
If you're out there
I'm dying to believe that you're out there
Stand up and say it loud
If you're out there
Tomorrow's starting now
Now, now

Oh now, now
If you're ready we can shake the world
Believe again
It starts within
We don't have to wait for destiny
We should be the change that we want to see

If you're out there
Ooooh
If you're out there
And you're ready now
Say it loud
Scream it out

If you're out there
Sing along with me
If you're out there
I'm dying to believe that you're out there
Stand up and say it loud
If you're out there
Tomorrow's starting now

If you're out there
If you're out there
If you're out there

If you hear this message, wherever you stand
I'm calling every woman, calling every man
We're the generation
We can't afford to wait
The future started yesterday and we're already late

[Hook]
So, Just call me Richard, cause I'm a dick
It's also Richard cause I feel like you should
Pry your fucking mouth up off of it
I said just call me Richard, cause I'm a dick
You ain't gotta be no detective to figure out I'm a dick
When I hold my privates to your first clue, Sherlock, prick!

[Verse 1]
And I would like to introduce myse-self, surprise! Hi, it's Ike
'bout to get my Ike on I come with a life supply of wife beaters
And my Nikes on and a white tee over that iron mic
Lookin' fly tonight, feel like I might die from a spider bite
Come back as Spider-Man, park my Peter inside a dyke
Bitch actin' like she got fuckin' higher standards than Meijer's, right
Had to pry her fingers off the mothafuckin' Breyer's ice cream
With the pliers, like "Ahh!" only a ruthless bastard would do this
Take a toothless bitch with no taste buds to Ruth's Chris
Give her toothpicks, stop on the way home, pick up two Big Bufords
Scrupulous, girl, you got a nice pair, but you're plumb stupid!
So when I pull up in that Benz, don't try to pretend you ain't interested
To impress your stupid ass friends and refuse to get in woman
And get slammed on the ground and snap like a pool stick against cement
If you sick of dick, pretend it's a musical instrument
You get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
I can tell at first glance you're a ho cause your pants are so tight
When you dance with O. Trice, your implants explode
So cold to dykes, the chance is snow in San Francisco
Boy I'm from Detroit city, you live in animosity
That's a fucked up state to be in, such an atrocity
Look where these random thoughts get me in senseless mind babble
"What me? Apologize?" That's just the way the rhyme unravels
And I wouldn't fucking take it back if I time traveled!

[Hook]
So, Just call me Richard, cause I'm a dick
It's also Richard cause I feel like you should
Pry your fucking mouth up off of it
I said just call me Richard, cause I'm a dick
You ain't gotta be no detective to figure out I'm a dick
When I hold my privates to your first clue, Sherlock, prick!
Just call me Richard

[Intro]
Yeah
Almost, almost
Hm, damn
Hey

[Verse]
So here we are
So here we are
So here we are
It's funny how so close can seem so far
Seem so far
Seem so far
Seem so far
Funny how so close can seem so far, I mean
Nigga, this is your moment
Damn, this is your moment
Damn, this supposed to be your moment, ain't it?
This supposed to be your moment
This supposed to be your moment
This supposed to be your moment
What good is being the one when you the only one that knows it?

[Verse 1]
Hey, girl, stop what you're doin'!
Hey, girl, you'll drive me to ruin
I don't know what it is I like about you, but I like it a lot
Won't you let me hold you, let me feel your loving touch

[Chorus]
Communication breakdown
It's always the same
I'm having a nervous breakdown
Drive me insane

[Verse 2]
Hey, babe, I got something I think you ought to know
Hey, babe, I wanna tell you that I love you so
I wanna hold you in my arms, yeah!
I'm never gonna let you go, 'cause I like your charms

[Chorus]
Communication breakdown
It's always the same
I'm having a nervous breakdown
Drive me insane
Suck!

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Communication breakdown
It's always the same
I'm having a nervous breakdown
Drive me insane! Yeah!

[Outro]
Communication breakdown
(I want you to love me all night)
(I want you to love me all night)
Communication breakdown
(Whoa, ah, a whoa oh)
Communication breakdown
(I want you to love me)
(I want you to love)
Communication breakdown
(I want you to love, yeah)
(I want you to love)
Communication breakdown
(I want you to love)....

[Verse 1]
It was an April morning
When they told us we should go
And as I turned to you, you smiled at me
How could we say no?
With all the fun to have
To live the dreams we always had
Oh, the songs to sing
When we at last return again

[Verse 2]
Sending off a glancing kiss
To those who claim they know
Below the streets that steam and hiss
The devil's in his hole
Oh, to sail away
To sandy lands and other days
Oh, to touch the dream
Hides inside and never seen, yeah

[Verse 3]
Into the sun, the south, the north
At last the birds have flown
Shackles of commitments fell
In pieces on the ground
Oh, to ride the wind
To tread the air above the din
Oh, to laugh aloud
Dancing as we fought the crowd, yeah

[Verse 4]
To seek the man whose pointing hand
The giant step unfolds
To guide us from the curving path
That turns our feet to stone
If one bell should ring
In celebration for a king
So fast the heart should beat
As proud the head with heavy feet, yeah

[Guitar Solo]
Oooooh, yeah

[Verse 5]
Days went by when you and I
Bathed in eternal summer's glow
As far away and distant
Our mutual child did grow
Oh, the sweet refrain
Soothes the soul and calms the pain
Oh, Albion remains
Sleeping now to rise again

[Verse 6]
Wandering and wandering
What place to rest the search
The mighty arms of Atlas
Hold the heavens from the earth
For the mighty arms of Atlas
Hold the heavens from the earth
From the earth, oh, oh, oh , oh
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
I know the way, know the way, know the way, know the way
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
I know the way, know the way, know the way, know the way

[Bridge]
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh

Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah ah ah ah
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh

[Outro]
Oh, the mighty arms of Atlas
Hold the heavens from the earth

(Ohhhhh, ohhh, ohhh, ohhhhh, ohhhhhh)
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Oooooh oooh, oh

[Verse 1]
Oh, nobody's fault but mine
Nobody's fault but mine
Trying to save my soul tonight

[Hook]
Oh, it's nobody's fault but mine

[Verse 2]
Devil he taught me to roll
Devil he taught me to roll
How to roll the lot you like

[Hook]
Nobody's fault but mine
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Harmonica Solo]

[Verse 3]
Brother he showed me the gong
Brother he showed me the ding dong ding dong
How to kick that gong to life

[Hook]
Oh, it's nobody's fault but mine

[Verse 4]
Got a monkey on my back
M-m-m-m-monkey on my back, back, back, back
Gonna change my ways tonight

[Hook]
Nobody's fault but mine

[Outro]
How to kick that gong to light
N-n-n-n-n-no, nobody's fault

[Intro]
K-K-K-K-K-Mac

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
You're a breath of fresh air
I need you, without you, I can't live
You're in cahoots with my heart
That's the way you stole it, it's gotta be an insider job
(Babey Drew, turn it up)
You're a diamond, short of perfect (Perfect, oh)
But your body still sparkles (Sparkles)
I'm on a knee holding your left hand
I know where that missing diamond should...

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
Go-oh-woah-oh-oh-oh-oh
Is there a magical garden where more of you
Grow-woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh?
I didn't think so

[Chorus: Kevin McCall & Chris Brown]
Feel like I just won the lotto, I found a one in a million you (Ooh)
God made you from the Earth and he broke the mold
There will never be another you
Oh, never be another you
Oh-oh, never be another you

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Now I can spend my whole life
Searching for something that's better than my dear
But that's a waste of my time
'Cause what’s better than perfect love?
Nothing that’s what my point is
You can stand in front of a mirror (Mirror)
And there wouldn't be a reflection, no
'Cause there's only one of you
And that's why I never let you...

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
Go-oh-woah-oh-oh-oh-oh
Is there a magical garden where more of you
Grow-woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh?
I didn't think so, no

[Chorus: Kevin McCall & Chris Brown, Kevin McCall]
Feel like I just won the lotto, I found a one in a million you (One in a million you, ooh)
God made you from the Earth and he broke the mold (Ooh)
There will never be another you
Oh (Another you), never be another you (You)
Oh-oh (You), never be another you

[Bridge: Chris Brown]
I'm a firm believer in never say never
But I can say I'll never find another you
They can say whatever, man, it don't even matter
'Cause I know our love is true
I'm a firm believer in never say never
But I can say I'll never find another you
They can say whatever, man, it don't even matter
'Cause I know our love is true (Yeah)

[Chorus: Kevin McCall & Chris Brown, Chris Brown]
Feel like I just won the lotto, I found a one in a million you (You, you, ooh)
God made you from the Earth and he broke the mold (Oh)
There will never be another you (You)
Oh, never be another you (You)
Oh-oh, never be another you

[Outro: Chris Brown, Chris Brown & Kevin McCall]
Woah-oh, woah-oh-oh
Woah-oh, woah-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh, woah-oh-oh
Oh, there will never be another you
Woah-oh, woah-oh-oh
Woah-oh, woah-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh, woah-oh-oh
Oh, there will never be another you

[Intro: DJ Drama]

Stuntin' on shawty, she a bad chick

I will take you down if you let me do it, do it
Girl, you can get all of me if you let me do it, do it, yeah (Gangsta Grillz)

[Chorus: Chris Brown, Chris Brown & Kevin McCall]

Girl, I put in work, lemme do my job
Call me "bang bang" 'cause I go so hard
Girl, you know I'm too freaky (Ayy), too freaky (Ayy)

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Wait, babe, won't you come over and play, babe?

Have you in the kitchen licking your plate clean
All up on the counter
Lady, have you had it good lately?
I'ma give you what you need, right now
What you need now, what you need now
Now, now, what you need now, what you need, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]

[Outro]
P.S., non-stop

[Verse: Action Bronson]
Hit the clutch, shift to the gear
Mash on the gas. You're soon to see me
Right by the lake just like a bass (kid)
Burn these sticks like a native, gold potatoes, cold tornados
Hash is like a ball of Play-Do
But never play, though, tryin' to get that play dough
To have the whole team creamy like alfredo
The mozzarella, basil, oil, and tomato
The thirty year balsamic laid up on that table
Next to me, a cigarette of drugs lay
There in my lungs that's while i'm driving, never drunk, wait
In the taxi shorty blessing me with tongue play
Ditch the cab, gonna twist it up the one-way
She lost a shoe, I bounced - dipped on her
Just a victim of the cold world to get warmer
Then I dipped with my spic friend in a quick Honda
Pick up a package from Juan down at the ship harbor
Sell it off in the crib, making the shit marble
Mar-vel taking chugs out of the big bottle
Dick sucks disappears thanks to a thick model
Her ass is fat but the coconut is a bit hollow
No point in asking if the motherfucking bitch swallow
Absolut(e), like the shit that's in the clear bottle
Straight from Sweden, see me counting money cheesin'
Ducks get shot out the sky, that's when it's huntin' season
Phone rings fiendin' for stuff, Danny Tanner
I handle business like a man, you're just a tranny dancer
I'm going down, kid
East motherfucking bound and down, bronsolino
Bon appetite, bitch
Yeah
Finally Famous in this
Yeah

(Chorus)
Do I really need an intro
Cause dey know, dey know, dey know
Do I really need an intro
Who I am, Who I am, Who I am
Do I really need an intro
Dey know, dey know, dey know
Do I really need an intro
Who I am, Who I am, Who I am

All I get is respect, as soon as I eject the vehicle
I bet you cannot detect, the scratch of a defect
From where the streets feast at, but made it out the belly of the beast without a C-sect
I'm so straight up, I'm so erect
Hype off that action, I'm so direct
I know it's a hundred thousand niggas up in Michigan
Doing it, but where I lack in talent I make up for it in discipline
And go hard, so hard til nobody else is on my sonar, radar, or lane cause I Bogart
Nowadays all we do is classic, Mozart
Outta here, it would be polite to send a postcard
I meant a post heart, yall niggas post hard
So lost co-star, coast off au revoir
I mean look at all we been in
And I look up in the mirror like boy you ain't even finished
(Chorus)

Do they really need my info, to show them what they in for
I'm recognized like kinfolk, even when my brim low
I come from where that life talk, where dat where dat knife talk
D-town, be brown, more money than white chalk
And on them nights how we grind til its light out
Grind til the sunset, til my grandson set, yup
Yeah, man my kids gone have the good life
Good days, good nights, and not the wish I could life
Strongest survive it, they see he trying to make something outta nothing
They like damn he Macgyver
Damn he go live, but too good to try and let up
And im better than whoever put together

(Chorus)

[Intro]
Uh
Chyeah
Uh
Uh
Dedicated to
This dedicated to
Fuck it

[Verse 1]
Uh, I got a pocket full of posies
Some devil with a pitchfork keep talkin' like he know me
I'm psychopathic, low-key, my hyperactive dome piece
Get no sleep, ill as fuck, the hospitals seem so weak
I stood before an Angel as he told me 'bout the glory
Put me in a room of people, how the fuck could I be lonely?
I only get money, these labels tryna clone me
Uh, my thoughts get heavy, hit the ground and crack the concrete
So, I try to keep 'em in my head
It's sad to see when everything that you believe is dead
Word to Heavy D, and rest in peace to all that come and pass
Life is good sometimes, but it just doesn't last
A bunch of stress, you see this mic is like my punchin' bag
Rock 'n' roll, drugs and cash, you softer than a bubble bath
Sucka ass ma'fucka, ma'fucka's sediment
Doper than the shit that killed Chris Tucker in Dead Presidents
Desert rhymes, homie, ridin' beats, I'm on a camel
I'm way too hot to handle, life a beach, I brought my sandals, heh
You want a war? I got a lot of ammo
You ain't a soldier 'cause you rockin' camo
Young Rambo, hundred million fans though
And I do it big, you a iPod Nano
Fire on wax, look like I brought candles
Yeah, you got a show, but you ain't on my channel

[Interlude]
That's HBO, bitch, you gotta pay for that
Aha-ha-ha
Your channel's free
Aha-ha-ha (I'm gonna fucking kill you)
Uh
IMAX some shit motherfucker, yeah, suck my dick

[Verse 2]
Hey
Ayo, I'm 'bout to start gambilin' with Ambien, I'm dutch smokin'
That's a strike but fuck bowlin', I could tear a pin of Maryland
See, I'm American, apparently it's damagin'
To be in front of cameras in your underwear with Marilyn
Monroe-lookin' dumb hoes who want too much dough
And come close to have you straight trippin' when you jump rope
Don't rock the love boat, this business fuckin' cutthroat
And it's gonna crack if you just paint the wall with one coat
Rooms filled with blunt smoke, peep me through the fog
These rappers who be hatin' probably need to get a job
See, me, I'm with my squad, gettin' money, livin' comfortable
I know a couple hoes who model, but they ugly though
Fuck a toast, y'all is fuckin' broke, cut ya throat
Judgin' me is nothin' dope, boy, you lyin' under oath
God made the world, why did man make the scriptures?
And if he created Lennon, why'd he go and make a Hitler?
I could take a photo, but I'd rather paint a picture
Of the one Laurence Fishburne, we'll shoot up all you hipsters
I'm from Pittsburgh, that's black and gold
If my skin gets filled up, I'ma tat my soul
Runnin' out of paper, writin' on my hand
Hundred thousand haters writin' 'bout my jams
Want a number one independent album? I'm your man
I'ma hit Preme and leave you all right where you stand

[Outro]

[J.Cole]

(Cole World)

[Verse 1]
Now you can choose the easy or hard way
Cole took the long way
A loser car-ley I moved up to Broadway
With night time to broad day
Pregame to foreplay
Used to cruise up to Bojangles
In R Jay’s lil Hyundai
Little bottle of that E&J
Liquor all in my DNA
Shout out NC A 'n' T, where I found that TNA
Ain’t seen me at the VMA
Nigga like me wasn’t nominated
One month later fuck a hater
Nigga like me done dominated
Wanna ride to the top
Then roll with me baby
They waitin' on me to drop
Like hov and B baby
Went from crappin' in diapers
To rappin' in cyphers
Ta doing more numbers
Then all them fuckin' lifers in Rikers
You see life is just like a box of chocolates
Never know what you 'bout to get
Take a bite rock wit it
And I love a bad bitch with confidence
Yo smile nice yo style right
And girl you got some mean thighs
So this right he is mean time
In between time

[Hook]
Girl I know how much you really want somebody
Want somebody that don't really need you
Girl I know how much you really want somebody
Want somebody that ain't trying to keep
You heard what I said, that could put you to bed
That ain't tryin' to love you baby, just fuck you instead
And don't tell 'em nothing baby, you know that I'm comin' baby
Just hit up my phone whenever you need you some company
Got this drank in my cup, oh yeah
I got this drank in my cup
I got this drank in my cup, cup, cup

[Kirko bangz]
I done came down, came up
Slow pitch, change up
Same hood, same style, same drink, same cup
She call me when she wanna fuck
I never call, she knows what's up
Same page, same book, different song, same hook
Everytime her nigga trippin', she on the phone with the same crook
And everytime I pull up, she hit me with that same look
Lips bitin', hips right
She left her man for that get right
I'm in the middle, like midnight
Only if you got that sit tight
Only if you got that wine fine
Only if you got that sip type
Only if you got that mine bomb
Only if you got that sip type
Eat that shit like wonton
Jokin' baby, I'm pimp tight
I'm used to bein' that one and done
But girl you got that g-get right

[Hook]
Girl I know how much you really want somebody
Want somebody that don't really need you
Girl I know how much you really want somebody
Want somebody that ain't trying to keep
You heard what I said, that could put you to bed
That ain't tryin' to love you baby, just fuck you instead
And don't tell 'em nothing baby, you know that I'm comin' baby
Just hit up my phone whenever you need you some company
Got this drank in my cup, oh yeah
I got this drank in my cup
I got this drank in my cup, cup, cup

[Outro]
H-town, oh yeah, I got this drink in my cup

I came down, hold up, hold up, I said hold up
Hold up, I done came down like hold up
Hold up, hold up, fuck, 'chea

[Spoken Intro]
Oh my God (God)
I am heartly sorry for having offended thee
And I detest all my sins
Because I dread the loss of Heaven (Heaven)
And the pain of Hell (Hell)
But most of all, because I love thee (Thee)
And I want so badly to be good (Good, good, good, good, good)

[Verse 1]
It's so hypnotic (Hypnotic)
The way he pulls on me
It's like the force of gravity
Right up under my feet
It's so erotic (Erotic)
This feeling can't be beat
It's coursing through my whole body
Feel the heat

[Pre-Chorus]
I got that burnin' hot desire
And no one can put out my fire
It's coming right down through the wire
Here it comes
When I hear them 808 drums
It's got me singing

[Chorus]
Hey-ey-ey-ey-ey-ey
Like a girl gone wild, a good girl gone wild
I'm like, hey-ey-ey-ey-ey-ey
Like a girl gone wild, a good girl gone wild

[Post-Chorus]
Girls, they just wanna have some fun
Get fired up like a smokin' gun
On the floor, 'til the daylight comes
Girls, they just wanna have some fun

[Interlude]
Like a girl gone wild, a good girl gone wild
I'm like a girl gone wild, a good girl gone wild

[Verse 2]
The room is spinning (Spinning)
It must be the Tanqueray
I'm about to go astray
My inhibition's gone away
I feel like sinning (Sinning)
You got me in the zone
DJ, play my favorite song
Turn me on

[Pre-Chorus]
I got that burnin' hot desire
And no one can put out my fire
It's coming right down through the wire
Here it comes
When I hear them 808 drums
It's got me singing

[Chorus]
Hey-ey-ey-ey-ey-ey
Like a girl gone wild, a good girl gone wild
I'm like, hey-ey-ey-ey-ey-ey
Like a girl gone wild, a good girl gone wild

[Post-Chorus]
Girls, they just wanna have some fun
Get fired up like a smokin' gun
On the floor, 'til the daylight comes
Girls, they just wanna have some fun

[Bridge]
I know, I know, I know I shouldn't act this way
I know, I know, I know good girls don't misbehave
Misbehave
But I'm a bad girl anyway, hey
Forgive me

[Chorus]
Hey-ey-ey-ey-ey-ey
Like a girl gone wild, a good girl gone wild
I'm like, hey-ey-ey-ey-ey-ey
Like a girl gone wild, a good girl gone wild

[Post-Chorus]
Girls, they just wanna have some fun
Get fired up like a smokin' gun
On the floor, 'til the daylight comes
Girls, they just wanna have some fun

[Outro]
I'm like a girl gone wild, a good girl gone wild
I'm like a girl gone wild, a good girl gone wild

[Intro: Sir Michael Rocks & Mac Miller]
I think this is yours
Uh (Hahaha, hahaha)
That works too
Anyway
Guess who it is, everybody

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Y'all is dead weight, less great, always gettin' second place
I tend to race ahead of pace, dippin' while I'm dressed in Bape
Then they chase, catch me if you can, I ain't DiCaprio
This lucid dream will have you go like half a dose of Adderall
Capicola sandwiches are tasty from Primanti's
I'm a 5'7" giant, Brandon Jacobs, Eli Manning
Girls with makeup get demanding, but they fake like orange tanning
So my girl and I be up like we some college students cramming
For a test that we ain't study for, wonder will she love me more
With money, 'cause if not, I'm not sure what all this money for
Feelin' like a hundred wars are goin' on currently
Soldiers sent to death on some jets for the currency
Poison, take this mercury, I'll teach you for a learner's fee
How to turn your girlfriend to a circus freak
Cool by the word of Keith, fabric by the hand of Zeus
Actin' like you fuckin' with me, that's some shit I can't excuse
Focus is on manual, control the panoramic view, universe
You got a chance, don't blow it like how a tuba works
I plan to do somethin' that ain't tangible
Now I'm 'bout to hand it to the homie Mikey (Michael) Rocks
Hear what he sayin' to you

[Verse 2: Sir Michael Rocks]
Take a trip, took a molly out with Banco Populari (Uh-huh)
The word round the city is he sit in a Ferrari (Yeah)
I told myself I wouldn't get it, I'm sorry
That's my bad, I party 'til my Carties get foggy
Can't keep her hands off of me, got her lock, then lost the key (Lost it)
Weed smoke make it hard to see, we go harder than Carter one
Excuse me, baby, pardon me, can you fuck me like the honeymoon?
Not sayin' it's comin' soon, but I want the real show (Real show)
Get me the treatment that you gettin' all the heels for (Heels for)
The shit they payin' all the bills for (Bills for)
Man, I missed it, that cake taste delicious
They can't wait for vacations, paid for by pictures
I'm feelin' good (Feelin' good), I'm peelin' bills, I'm real as hell
I don't front (Yeah), I roll blunts and papers
I don't fuck with fakers, your girl is askin' me if I'ma take her
I'm straight though, you see, I'm booked up 'til April
That's mine, that's me, I take those, you tryna see some pesos
Then shake though, you get exactly what you pay for
Stop actin' like you can't go, you swaggin' to the ankles
I feel you, baby, hopefully I look familiar, maybe

[Chorus 1: Sir Michael Rocks]
Fallin' down the same rabbit hole lookin' for love
But you will never ever get it, because
It seem like it only happen when I'm holdin' the drugs
And you can never ever see her, because

[Verse 3: Mac Miller]
Life a cliché, it ain't a bad one
First the plane land, and then the bags come
We walkin' on this planet, seekin' action
Break a girl's heart, sorry Ms. Jackson

[Chorus 1: Sir Michael Rocks]
Fallin' down the same rabbit hole lookin' for love
And you will never ever get it, because
It seem like it only happen when I'm holdin' the drugs
And you can never ever see her

[Chorus 2: Mac Miller]
And it don't stop 'til the aliens fight the robots
And all the ladies take their clothes off
I'm here with Mikey and we gon' rock
This some shit you won't top (Uh-huh)
I said it don't stop 'til the aliens fight the robots
And all the ladies take their clothes off
I'm here with Mikey and we gon' rock
This some shit you won't top (Top)

[Interlude: Mac Miller]
Uh
Cheah

[Bridge: Mac Miller]
I'm so high, what you think about that, baby?
On some other shit that tend to make me act crazy
Fifteen thousand, blow it on clothes
Six in the mornin', still sittin' here throwed
I'm buggin' out, buggin' out, I wonder if they know
Pull up to her house and I wonder if she home
Buggin' out, buggin' out, I wonder if they know
Pull up to her house and I wonder if she home

[Outro]
Can I have some?

[Intro: Mac Miller]
Sometimes I wonder who the fuck I am
Sometimes I wonder who the fuck I am
Uh
Yeah (Want you to feel it)
Man, my voice probably sounds mad raspy right now
(I want you all to feel it) Yeah
So step up on the mic and, uh
Show 'em what you got, tiger
A'ight, look

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Uh, sometimes I wonder who the fuck I am
So I've been lookin' in the mirror and it still don't make no sense
I'm askin', "What am I supposed to do?"
Done so much in my short lifetime, but I haven't done shit
I done flew around the whole world
First I shook a million hands, then I took a million pictures
But I'm a hostage in my own world
Yeah, my thoughts my own enemy, got no time for these bitches
I got too much on my damn mind
So if I add some more stress, I just don't see how I'ma cope
I think they underestimate the grind
I do to bring this dough, and I'm only 20 years old
I wonder why I sip this devil juice, 'cause it feel incredible

[Refrain: Mac Miller]
Problems, I got several
Thank God that none of that medical
Uh, I've been blessed with, much to be expected

[Chorus: Mac Miller]
What am I doing here?
I wonder what am I doing here
What am I doing here? (Uh)
What am I doing here?

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
I hope this feelin' last for fuckin' ever
I don't wanna come back down, let me stay above the ground
I hope I do what I was meant to do
'Cause I've been searchin' for that answer, I just hope I get it now
Please, let me find euphoria
When you up above the clouds, like, "Who gon' touch me now?"
And do we ever get to know the truth?
'Cause everybody seems to have it, but to me it seems they lack it
Now I'm rollin' and I'm sippin' lean
Sometimes I catch a buzz just to help me picture love
Drinkin' liquor and I'm smokin' weed
And you don't ever do too much if you could never do enough
Wonder why it's me instead of you, I'll be there to rescue you

[Refrain: Mac Miller]
Problems, you got several
Thank God that none of that medical
Uh, I've been blessed with, much to be expected

[Chorus: Mac Miller]
What am I doing here?
I wonder what am I doing here
What am I doing here?
What am I doing here?

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Uh, sittin' in my Bentley,  thinkin' 'bout these hoes
All I do is kill 'em, I kill 'em like Nicole
Simpson, flag crimson, smoke 'em like Winstons
I just bought a new chopper, I treat it like an infant
I'm lightin' up a stogie, it's longer than a hoagie
Situation's gettin' fishy and I don't eat anchovies
Fuck the world, kill 'em all, she answer when I call
If the cops pull us over, she gon' hide it in her drawers
See, I come from a place where stars never shine
And drama is accepted, credit cards are declined
Everybody gotta die, but I ain't everybody
If that ho play with me, I whoop that chick like Terrence Howard
I'm a pimp, I ain't lyin', but that is not important
I'm just tryna buy time, but can't really afford it
Sayin' ain't that a bitch, but I hope that bitch is bad
I feel like money in the trash, like...

[Chorus: Mac Miller & Lil Wayne]
What am I doing here? (Whoa)
I wonder what am I doing here (Yeah... Young Mula, baby)
What am I doing here?
What am I doing here?

[Intro]
It was all about a dream
Turned into reality, double-cup of lean
Uh

[Verse 1]
Let me get a one-way ticket, haven't picked a destination
I'm just tryna catch the train before it has to leave the station
Packin' no bags, nothin' but the clothes on my back
With a Cognac, let me sip it, tryin' to relax
Red wine up in my glass plus Filet Mignon
I got a army right up under me, I'm Genghis Khan
Yeah, it's me against the world, I guess I'll take them on
I might stop and see my girl, but I ain't stayin' long
What if I'm gone, what the fuck you gon' think then?
I told my story, put my life inside this ink pen
Said I'll make it big when everybody know me
Well, I made it big and everybody phony, ha
So could you pour me? I need a cup
No, none of that liquor, mix in purple stuff
I could talk my pain, but would it hurt too much?
Go 'head, judge me, hate cost money, but this love free

[Chorus]
They just dreams, turn 'em to reality
Double-cup of lean, standin' on my balcony
Lookin' at the sky, thinkin' it could all be mine
All we got is memories, so what the fuck is time?
They just dreams, turn 'em to reality
Double-cup of lean, standin' on my balcony
Lookin' at the street, thinkin' it could all be mine
All we got is memories, so what the fuck is time?
What the—, what the fuck is time? (Heh)
Ask 'em, what the fuck is time? (I don't know)
What the fuck is time? I ask 'em, what the fuck is time?

[Verse 2]
What do you do when you think you could be a icon?
'Cause all these people get to screamin' when the lights on
Like they just seen a ghost, earn my stripes, zebra coat
Racin' to the gate but my flight gone
And now these writers takin' shots without a Nikon
But I don't fight though, figure it's a typo
Seems we in some shit now, gonna be alright though
Potion in my Sprite, then my night slows... down, down (Aha)
See, that's exactly what I need
My khaki's filled with cheese, my homie Sap is on the beat
Like it was "Donald Trump," a fuckin' hit but I just call it luck
They throw it on when I'm walkin' in the club
Hey, this the 'Burgh shit, I don't deserve this
Well, I don't think you lookin' far beyond the surface
Learn quick, now I'm big time
Fill ya cup up, and I'ma sip mine

[Chorus]
Fill it up with dreams, turn 'em to reality
Double-cup of lean, standin' on my balcony
Lookin' at the sky, thinkin' it could all be mine
All we got is memories, so what the fuck is time?
They just dreams, turn 'em to reality
Double-cup of lean, standin' on my balcony
Lookin' at the street, thinkin' it could all be mine
All we got is memories, so what the fuck is time?
What the—, what the fuck is time? (Heh)
Ask 'em, what the fuck is time? (I don't know)
What the fuck is time? I ask 'em, what the fuck is time?

[Outro]

And a girl a girl, a bitch a bitch, a bitch a bitch

Gave fifty racks just to make a wish
Brand new crib, I'm paintin' it
Half a mil, just paid for it

But we marchin' like the Saint's came in
So run and hide, eyes open wide 'cause this gon' be your jam (Jam)
Just burn a Dutch, then turn it up as I pass it off to Cam, damn

[Chorus: Cam'ron & Mac Miller]

[Verse 2: Cam'ron]
Yo, we never met before but there'll be a mess for sure (Yep)

Another K, another tank, another Glock (Another Glock)
They smokin' weed, shippin' E, crushin' rocks (Crushin' rocks)
Forget the Porsche, they want your baby mother boxed (Mother boxed)
And you pamper honey (Pamper honey)

Say jack, say jack, I got that Mac with me

[Chorus: Cam'ron & Mac Miller]

[Outro: Female Voice]
Why are we here?

[Intro: Mac Miller]
Uh, close your eyes

[Verse 1: Mac Miller & Iman Omari]
So watch her do the Macarena, somewhere out by Pasadena
Love a drug that everybody here just tryna get a taste of
You a waster of the space that you take up
Livin', this time around I'm not kiddin'
I had an intuition 'bout these women and suspicion
Got me lookin' at shit different, how a man in my position
Can't start slippin' down these slopes 'cause it's all just downhill from there
As a kid I didn't learn that, but now I'm aware
When you a youngin' you just tryna live your life and have some fun in
A world where you have yet to see how evil it's become
It's hard to have a dream when you deep inside of one
And I know you hate them spirits so I keep 'em in my lungs
I'm a Beatle to these young kids
But sometimes I be feelin' like a needle to these young kids
You had the world, you 'bout to leave it to these young kids
And we gon' show you what the love is...

[Chorus: Iman Omari & Mac Miller]
Stay high
Go for what you know
Let it in your mental
And don't ever let it go
It won't stop!
You can't fight the feeling
Feeling
You can't fight the feeling, no
It won't stop!
You can't fight the feeling
Feeling
You can't fight the feeling, no

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Uh
And I keep a couple Most Dope homies by me
So there ain't too many times it's me, myself and Irene
We stay smokin' through the night, wake up, do some tai-chi
Homie, can't you see I'm chillin'? Please don't fuck up my chi
Yeah, my jacket Y-3, recently been up on fashion
Waste a bunch of money, kinda stinks of satisfaction
Fell asleep at Hollywood, woke up in Manhattan
Ballin' like I'm Jordan, but I'm fresh as Mars Blackmon
A penny for your thoughts, a dollar for your dreams
A price on a idea, we never can agree
They tell you what to know, but it's better to believe
So why you tryna act like what you never gonna be?
Still I tell em, "Fuck what you know, I'm feelin' comfortable"
Just continue livin' life, 'cause enough of 'em don't
You spent your days countin' every single penny made
Restart now, 'cause we comin' for you anyways

[Chorus: Iman Omari & Mac Miller]
Stay high
Go for what you know (Yeah)
Let it in your mental (Macadelic)
And don't ever let it go
It ain't never gon' stop, 'cause
You can't fight the feeling
(No) Feeling
You can't fight the feeling, no
Uh, I told you it won't stop, 'cause
You can't fight the feeling
Feeling
You can't fight the feeling, no

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Sometimes I wake up, up in the morning, make her
Wrap this much make-up off my bed, soon as she's yawnin', take up
Hours upon days just to find power shit to say
But you won't hear it even if your ears was pierced with Beats by Dre, I mean
The sun is slowly fallin', we all surely should die eventually
So what's your calling? Oh, you left your phone behind?
Identity crisis, break mirrors, vices steer us through wickedness
Jesus Christ is right near us and Devil said you owe ten percent
Sold your soul, I know, sold your soul and you're hopeless
My focus, stare at elopin' on boats that float in the open of oceans
That coast the line on the margins I rhyme, you chokin' or soakin' up game
I'm hopin' you picked the second one, shame
The emotion of jealousy that you're holdin', you're tellin' me
That you're golden but really cubic zirconia, let me see
I'll break you down like a pound of fire, whenever
Your tactics are mighty clever but even if you're Mayweather you

[Chorus (Condensed): Iman Omari & Mac Miller]
You can't fight the feeling
Feeling
You can't fight the feeling, no
It won't stop!
You can't fight the feeling
Feeling
You can't fight the feeling, no

[Outro]
Fuck me
I want you to fuck me (I want you to fuck me)
I want you to fuck me (Oh yeah)
Oh, fuck
Oh, fuck
Oh, fuck
Don't stop
Stop

[Verse 1]
Mornin' after, my lungs hurt
Eat your pussy just to show you how my tongue works
It's funny how we fucked but fell in love first
Been three years, I wish I finally trust her
She make me feel like how them drugs work
Itchin' for my fixture, when she gone the love hurts
I just get her temper, I just need somebody I can vent to
Someone get me stoned, be my Emma
Left your lipstick on the glass of your daiquiri
Ruby red, usually end up tragically
Work of art, you could be my masterpiece
But you fast asleep

[Chorus]
Somethin' 'bout the pain makes me want more
Done a lotta drugs, never felt like this before
I hope one day it all makes sense
It'll all make sense
And you could have it all, tell me what you need
Believin' all them silly things you read
I hope one day it all makes sense
One day it'll all make sense

[Verse 2]
Uh
Then she wake up, cryin' while she puttin' on her make-up
Trapped inside her love for me, ain't no escape for her
You wanna leave? Say the word, but she can't
Lookin' in my eyes, "Is everything okay?"
She lies, put on her disguise, play it safe
'Cause we've been fightin' for the past three weeks
She keep this one inside, she don't wanna seem weak
Strong, baby, tell me what's been goin' on
I don't wanna be sober long
So you need to get me high again
I got all this money we could try to spend
Until we strung out like a violin
Come back to life, then we die again
Little angel, where's your halo?
Somewhere above them horns

[Chorus]
Somethin' 'bout the pain makes me want more
Done a lotta drugs, never felt like this before
I hope one day it all makes sense
It'll all make sense
And you could have it all, tell me what you need
Believin' all them silly things you read
I hope one day it all makes sense
One day it'll all make sense

[Bridge]
Uh
You get me high, girl, scared to overdose
I don't sleep much, when I do I'm comatose
May I propose a toast? Someone usually does
To our fucked up love
You get me high, girl, scared to overdose
I don't sleep much, when I do I'm comatose
Propose a toast? Someone usually does
To our fucked up love

[Chorus]
Somethin' 'bout the pain makes me want more
Done a lotta drugs, never felt like this before
*Snorts*
*Exhales*
And you could have it all, tell me what you need
Believin' all them silly things you read

[Outro: Female]
Don't cry, it's okay
It'll all be over soon

[Hook]
I'd risk everything
For one kiss, everything
Yes I'd do anything
(Anything?)
Anything, for you

[Verse 1]
Go DJ, cause that's my DJ
No more producer so, that's my DJ
I know the story, same song, that's a replay
We pressing fast forward, this ain't the last straw
We all ready to shit, don't need an asshole
And if you feeling froggy, leap you little tadpole
Yea it's that cold, but I'm so family fam-o
Got 'em on my back like a camel
I say I got them on my back like ammo
Stop the sweating, damn where did all your fans go?
Cash Money Millionaires, straight cash flow
We don't need nobody else, Lil Weezy got the cash flow
Yea, so flow on lil nigga
Got the company, I can throw on my own lil niggas
And ya'll can team up and come on lil niggas
Ah, stop crying, what's wrong lil niggas?

[Hook]
I'd risk everything
For one kiss, everything
Yes I'd do anything
(Anything?)
Anything, for you

[Verse 2]
Hey, the situation ain't all that
And bitches say your conversation ain't all that
And we ain't got the time of day for all that
So bitch nigga get your money and fall back
And in the long run, they gone crawl back
But ya'll got problems Einstein couldn't solve Jack
Don't take it personal, somebody had to jump up
And I happen to have a broom to come and sweep the mess up
It's me, Baby and that's me
And maybe you'll diss me
But fuck it, then it's beef
We laughing at you clowns
You niggas got that hating season passing it around
But we still got caskets in the basement
Burners on the counters and tats on our faces
Yea this is what you want
You said it was a publicity stunt
Well bitch I'm a stunner (The son of a stunna)

[Hook]
I'd risk everything
For one kiss, everything
Yes I'd do anything
(Anything?)
Anything, for you

[Hook] x2

[Verse 1]
I woke up one morning
Waking with the rising sun
Woke up one morning
Awaking with the rising sun, ah
Thought about my baby
Did I just do what she done

Well, I should loved you more
I know I didn't treat her right
Oh, yes, I should loved you more
I know I didn't treat her right
I know that a woman needs
Rolling every day and night
Oh, yeah

[Verse 2]
Well, my heart beat like a hammer
My eyes plumb full of tears
Yes, my heart beat like a hammer
My eyes plumb full of tears
She's been gone about an hour
But it seems like a thousand years
Don't ever dog no woman
You know you're gonna ruin yourself
Don't ever dog no woman, ah
Cause you know you're gonna ruin yourself
Know that a woman she'll
Run off with somebody else
Oh, yeah

[Verse 1]
When I first met you baby, I didn't even know your name
Yes, when I first met you babe, I didn't even know your name
I was feeling so low on the ground
Bad luck and evil women was to blame

[Verse 2]
I never realized just how sweet and kind one woman can be
Yes, I never realized, people, just how sweet and kind one woman can be
Yes, but when I looked in your eyes
Yeah, I knew true love had come to me
Yeah

[Break]

[Verse 3]
Take my hand, baby, now, you hold it tight and don't let go
Take my hand, now, hold it tight and don't let go
Yes, 'cause our love is like a merry go round
And 'round forever it's gonna go

[Verse 1]
I've got a long grey mare, she won't let me ride
I got a long grey mare, she won't let me ride
She makes me brush her in the morning
And put her to bed every night

[Verse 2]
Long grey mare, why can't we be just like before?
Long grey mare, why can't we be just like before?
We used to ride so hard
Until we just couldn't ride no more

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Look at me, grey mare, don't I feed you everyday?
Look at me, grey mare, don't I feed you everyday?
But when I dig you with my spud
You turn around the other way

[Intro: Mac Miller]
Check it out
Uh-ah-ah, top of the morning to you
You know, it's been so dark outside
That I—that I figured I'd turn a couple motherfuckin' lights on real quick

[Verse: Mac Miller]
Uh
I ain't talkin 'bout nothin' with a flow so disgutin'
Ashtray by me that I gotta dump my guts in
Need substance, feed it to the public
No one gon' touch it like my Poppy's old musket
Roll up to the function, eatin' all the Funyuns
Sentence keep runnin', word to double E Cummings
When people say to me it doesn't mean nothin'
Bumblebees buzzin' 'cause the trouble needs lovin'
Wonder who really give a fuck what I have to say?
Those are the people to which I dedicate this rap today
Your shit is fragile, if I have to I'ma crack your face
Monday to Saturday, I'm actin' like a basket case
While Sunday I'm goin' golfin' with my Callaway's
Or watchin' football, word to Joey Galloway
Take a shower, start singin' like Al Green
From outside, it probably sound like some loud screams
Always had child dreams and nightmares
My music like the airport, I hop on a flight there
Wanna go to Monaco to see what it's like there
Roll up in a pair of Nike Airs, just like, "Yeah
Wassup?" Here I am, lookin' in the mirror and
All I see is me, I'm at peace
Go rent out a penthouse, forget all my problems
The things I regret now, be gone by the mornin'
My life is startin', I'm ready as I ever been
Pencilin' my schedule that I gotta move on from mistakes
Number One albums, always givin' you mixtapes
And that's what I'ma do until I'm richer than Bill Gates
It ain't all about money for me, though
I do this for the people who need a boost in their ego
Work a lot, I'm an addict not a fiend, though
Get up, get out, and get somethin', word to Cee Lo
Bottles of Clicquot, a couple of Cristal
May head to L.A. like I'm Chris Paul
'Bout to go platinum off of "Missed Calls"
So all of y'all can lick balls, ha ha
Yeah
Just, you know

[Chorus: Iman Omari]
Run from the dark
And into the light
You know, you know
You're gonna find your way out
Run from the dark
And into the light
Oh-woah, you know
You're gonna find your way
Just run to the sunlight
Just run to the sunlight
Just run to the sunlight
Just run to the sunlight

[Intro]
Clarity...
Clarity...

[Verse 1]
Clarity
Figure all this out, I ain't gonna take a charity
Marry me
Wish everyone could shake and play the tambourine
Perfect
I know I love you, I ain't tryna let those words slip
Pure bliss
I knew that we would stay together, we in cursive

[Refrain]
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la

[Verse 2]
Infatuation
When every single move you make is fascinatin'
Gravitatin'
Towards anything that gives a sense of happiness
Activist, love activist
Sendin' my love for girls who got some cuts at their wrists
Hope you found what you lookin' for
I hope you find what you lookin' for

[Chorus]
You take away the pain and I thank you for that
If I ever get the chance, bet I'm payin' you back
I'ma be waitin' for that
I'ma be waitin' for that

[Verse 3]
Misery
You represent love, you the epitome
So wish for me
I'll come out of nowhere—your epiphany
Disconnect
From everybody who don't understand my vision yet
In a jet
Is where my mind is, so I light another cigarette to calm me down

[Refrain]
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la

[Verse 4]
So calm me down
Everybody who can save me now is not around
Chopper down
Busy today, but can you tell me how tomorrow sounds?
In between
Purgatory ain't as bad as it would seem to be
Live a dream
That's so cliché, but I can tell you what it means to me

[Chorus]
You take away the pain and I thank you for that
If I ever get the chance, bet I'm payin' you back
I'ma be waitin' for that
Said, I'ma be waitin' for that
(Waitin' for that)

[Outro]
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh
It's A Major Move Right Here Baby
Got Get Ready To Get Lost You Understand...

Money to be made best believe a nigga clockin'
I run it myself like a quarterback option
I pitch 'er ten g's, tell a bitch to go shoppin'
She buy herself some clothes and she brought me back a chopper
See niggas trying to kick it but no I don't play soccer
I'm all about my cake, I'm trying to marry Betty Crocker
A package on the way you know my whip game proper
And off of one ki, I see seventy thousand dollars
Now I was shootin dice, smokin on a joint
I bet with' Yo Gotti he hit five straight points
We over here hustlin, we over here grindin
You rap bout money and a nigga might sign you
Rap bout me and a nigga might find you

Move like you really wanna be number one
You can, you can, you can beat out the comp
Run like you really wanna be at the top

Never ever fold under pressure
Desperate times get desperate measure

(Alright), I got my own world to look through
And uh, I ain't gonna copy you, yeah

[Verse 2]
Now if a 6 turned out to be 9

Dig, cause I got my own world to live through
And uh, and I ain't going to copy you

[Bridge]
White-collared conservatives
Flashing down the street
Pointing their plastic finger at me
They're hoping soon, my kind will drop and die
But I'm going to wave
My freak flag high, high ow!

[Instrumental Break]
Wave on, wave on

[Verse 3]
Uh, ha-ha, fall mountains
Just don't fall on me
Go ahead on Mr. Businessman
You can't dress like me, yeah
Nobody knows what I'm talking about

I'm the one that's going to have to die
When it's time for me to die
So let me live my life
The way I want to, yeah
Sing on brother
Play on drummer

[Instrumental Outro]

[Intro]
Woop, turn the lights on
Oh woah, oh woah

[Verse 1]
We share something so common, but still so rare
And I’m in awe, never been here before
So high, we’re still climbing, even here inside these walls
Breaking each others hearts and we don’t care 'cause we’re so

[Chorus]
In too deep, can’t think about giving it up
But I never knew love, would feel like a heart attack
It’s killing me, swear I never cried so much
'Cause I never knew love would hurt this fucking bad
The worst pain that I ever had
Oh woah, never knew love, oh woah
Would hurt this fucking bad
The worst pain that I ever had

[Verse 2]
All the times when I know I should be smiling
Seem to be the time that I frown the most
Can't believe that we're still surviving
'Cause I'm slowly breaking down even when I hold you close
And if I lose you, I'm afraid I would lose who
Who I gave my love to
That's the reason I stay around
Even though I fell way

[Chorus]
In too deep, can’t think about giving it up
But I never knew love, would feel like a heart attack
It’s killing me, swear I never cried so much
'Cause I never knew love would hurt this fucking bad
The worst pain that I ever had
Oh woah, never knew love, oh woah
Would hurt this fucking bad
The worst pain that I ever had

[Bridge]
And it hurts 'cause I wanna leave
And you wanna leave, but the love keeps us together
And if I lose you, I'm afraid I would lose who, who I gave my love to
That's the reason I stay around, even though I fell way

[Chorus]
In too deep, can’t think about giving it up
But I never knew love, would feel like a heart attack
It’s killing me, swear I never cried so much
'Cause I never knew love would hurt this fucking bad
The worst pain that I ever had
Oh woah, never knew love, oh woah
Would hurt this fucking bad
The worst pain that I ever had

[Intro]
Take me
Take me—do you miss me?
Can we stop now? Melt with me—are you okay?
I'm never gonna let you go—touch me—please don't go
Where are we? Do you miss me?
Please don't go—wake up—touch me
Where are we?

[Verse 1]
I have a vision to add: the gift of subtractin' limits
If everything was gone tomorrow, who would miss it?
And if I pack my bags and moved away, who would visit?
If you knew what you should say who would listen?
Yeah, I'm talkin' 'bout a new religion
Somethin' to feed off, we searchin' for it like groups of pigeons
Kinda futuristic, yeah, it's cool, we different
'Cause what I do's terrific, I'm just hopin' you can feel it
Yeah, so tell me if you can
Are you numb enough? Can you listen in?
I would lose it all to show 'em I'd get rich again
But matter fact, fuck that, 'cause I don't give a damn
You see it's simple when it's only cigarillos
In the world, no one should feel you, don't expect it from a little man
Fuck empty, my glass is filled
Countin' roses, daisies, and daffodils, chill

[Chorus]
Get your money, fuck 'em all
Everythin' could be gone tomorrow
What if it's gone tomorrow?
Get your money, fuck 'em all
Get your money, fuck 'em all
Everythin' could be gone tomorrow
Everythin' could be gone tomorrow
So get your money, fuck 'em all

[Verse 2]
I say my prayers, but I don't know who they to
Layin' on my back, lookin' through the roof
Just tell me, am I gettin' through to you?
Stickin' to it, super glue it, make it beautiful
Fuck, what am I missin'?
Speak to your soul, so shut up and listen
Gimme a reason to pop, gettin' me goin', ain't lettin' me stop
Head to the top, it's better they not, call me a phony, so they sendin' me shots
I, got a girl, we in love, she my money, she my drugs
This my pain, this my pleasure, last forever, keep me up
Late at night, tell me it's alright, I believe her
I don't question she who knows me best, I know you wouldn't either
Somethin' happen when I see her, it's right out of a fairy tale
Got some shit she goin' through, it's something that she handle well
Life a bitch but she my bitch
Gold rollie and it's timeless, yeah

[Chorus]
Get your money, fuck 'em all
Everythin' could be gone tomorrow
What if it's gone tomorrow?
Get your money, fuck 'em all
Get your money, fuck 'em all
Everythin' could be gone tomorrow
Everythin' could be gone tomorrow
So get your money, fuck 'em all

[Bridge]
We all wanna know
What to do in this world when it seems that there's nothing left
And we dream just to dream
But we don't know exactly how to get there yet
And we all wanna know
What to do in this world when it seems that there's nothing left
And we dream just to dream
But we don't know exactly how to get there yet

[Chorus]
Get your money, fuck 'em all
Everythin' could be gone tomorrow
What if it's gone tomorrow?
Get your money, fuck 'em all
Get your money, fuck 'em all
Everythin' could be gone tomorrow
Everythin' could be gone tomorrow
So get your money, fuck 'em all

You see, they all call me
By one thing

[Hook]
(Tyga Tyga)
At my shows and we roll and scream, people see him and say
(Tyga Tyga)
So nice, gotta repeat me twice, now everybody say

Yeah, I'm on my, on my way
Paragon Star, it's Tyga Tyga y'all

[Verse 1]
Both knuckles up, demos in the duffel, uh
Bad color Sepia, who said I ain't good for nothin'?
Respect my hustleness, madams get the mumbling
Cause I'm covered with color skin, ask her what my mama thinks
Along to my beats, these things compliments it's bad to see
Once laughed at me, cause I had a dream
Now they wanna relax, sit back with me
I recline, decline whenever they speak, no room to breathe
Look in my eyes, seen lies the truth defeat Gods who sized life
Knee-high, see y'all
One day after I die niggas, long ways
Got a strong case to demonstrate 'fore I elevate
As the swagger serenades, I see evil hate turn for great
Admission admire the non-fate, put the large cake on my plate
With a little bass, they scream and say

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
How many marksmen you know in the local projects?
How many niggas hold you down when the shit is started?
Been counted, that's why I ain't heavy mobbin'
Got a low-key crib, cause bitches retarded
Repeat in they head, they with you
On some all day shit, too much talkin'
They get me nauseous
Small apartment, do all your dirty laundry
Cause word spread to everybody and they aunties
No pretzels, but shit is salty
Can't even trust the modest, you might spot 'em
Gold Herringbone pop shit, stop it
My details illegal mosh-pit
Honest, this kid is

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
On my way to the penthouse, tend a little me-ha
Her friend like meet her, you don't know Tyga?
She don't really care 'bout neither
Either, I'm too far where her mind can't reach up
Or she don't like music making money niggas
I do know that I ain't got time I maneuvers
Like that, voodoo, like that, you knew
Me don't, I'm already high rap guru
Fume, flew right past you with something to mac in and marry Catholics
Accurate to its adjective
Average chicks think I ain't baggin' 'em
I still go in, I just love it when they call him

[Hook]

Young Mula Baby!

[Hook]
Never will I be the same
Since the money and cars came with the fame
We just party throwing parties cause I got a name
For them life is the same
But me, I will never be the same

[Verse 1]
As I hail Mary prayer, my way to the stage
Grab a hydro-oxygen, throw a little cool to face
Never afraid, lyrical grade A, MJ's win the game
Feeling like a mob wishing things now was like back in the day
Got a big break, seen a little cake
Now everybody and they momma wanna hate
Everybody and they momma wanna hate
But won't you wait
Sleeping on me, you won't wake
There's a killer looking in my eyes you will see thriller nigga

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Rolling down the window, on a new Benzo
Hollerin' at these bimbos, if my girl find out
No more bring your car out, for me
Shit I was only nineteen
Fuck that by the raise, spend this change on chains (for Last Kings)
More money, more money
Young money, your money
Others tell 'em fuck off
These new niggas all pause
What's a dog with a bark, to a tiger and a shark
And you wonder why I'm off the wall
Bitch, cause I'm bad, bad to the bone

[Hook]

You motherfuckers think you know me
You don't know shit, about me
See, cause I don't even know about me

[Verse 3]
High-rise standing on your suit and over-look Wiltshire
We don't gotta go into if what shit you ain't into, nigga
I be counting hunnids 'til I'm numb
Go to the bank cause it's fun
What you think cause I'm young saying coconut's to a drum that I'm dumb?
Tell that girl come get some
Two balls for the price of one
You can be my little soccer mom
When I'm done, take my kids, haha
Yeah you like that, yo keys in your lap
Don't get attached, close to the king
Had to get it tatted on my back

[Hook]

I will never be the same!

[Intro]
It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men, or more, could ever do
Just like the rain down in Africa
It's gonna take some time but I know you're worth fighting for
I'd fight for you
Hey ba bum ba eh ba bum ba eh eh ba bum ba eh (RedOne)
I'd fight for you
Hey ba bum ba eh ba bum ba eh eh ba bum ba eh
I'd fight for you

[Verse 1]
Friends are cool but we both know, they don't wanna see us together
Don't wanna lose what I live for, I'm willing to do whatever
'Cause I don't wanna see you cry, give our love another try
I bet we get it right this time, as long as you're prepared to fight

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't wanna live another day
Without your body next to me
I'm not gonna let them break us down
'Cause baby I know now

[Chorus]
It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you, I'd fight for you
There's nothing that a hundred men, or more could ever do, I'd fight for you
Just like the rain down in Africa, I'd fight for you
It's gonna take some time but I know you're worth fighting for (leggo)

[Verse 2]
What they say, It don't even matter, they don't really understand (woah)
Without each other, we are barely breathing, let's get air in these hearts again
'Cause I don't wanna see you cry, give our love another try
I bet we get it right this time, as long as you're prepared to fight, prepared to fight

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't wanna live another day (no)
Without your body next to me (no, oh)
I'm not gonna let them break us down
'Cause baby I know now, know now, know now

[Chorus]
It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you, I'd fight for you
There's nothing that a hundred men, or more could ever do, I'd fight for you
Just like the rain down in Africa, I'd fight for you (just like the rain, just like the rain, just like the rain)
It's gonna take some time but I know you're worth fighting for
I'd fight for you
Hey ba bum ba eh ba bum ba eh eh ba bum ba eh
I'd fight for you
Hey ba bum ba eh ba bum ba eh eh ba bum ba eh (sak pase)

[Bridge]
If you've got someone that's worth fighting for
Don't let nobody hold you down let me hear you say woah, oh, woah
Uh, if you've found someone (oh) that's worth dying for
The one you can't live without let me hear you say woah, oh, woah

[Chorus]
It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you, I'd fight for you
There's nothing that a hundred men, or more could ever do, I'd fight for you
Just like the rain down in Africa, I'd fight for you
It's gonna take some time but I know you're worth fighting for, woo
It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you, I'd fight for you
There's nothing that a hundred men, or more could ever do, I'd fight for you
Just like the rain down in Africa, I'd fight for you (just like the rain, just like the rain, just like the rain)
It's gonna take some time but I know you're worth fighting for (woah, woah, woah)

[Hook]
Open your eyes, in the dark
Clear your mind, feel your heart
To the sky, and beyond
You are now listening to Black Thoughts

[Verse 1]
Uh, middle finger fuck your life
Look in the mirror see your image twice
They turn my fog on, stage lights
What's about to go on, happens only tonight
Hoes psyched, to see him life-size
Niggas hating on it, that dick is close by
Echoed the lullabies, sing at your funeral
Send his mamma the bills, I'm reading my fan-mail
BBM'n bitches on my hand-held
So sick of lyrically murderin' tracks, roadkill
So ill, wear furs like Frank did
T-tell her lick my dick like powder lucas
Who knew this kid blow up to be this big
Pulling up in Benz looking at my crib
Might Twit-pic but no camera lens
I live in the moment, so I don't reminisce
Bitch

[Hook]
Open your eyes, in the dark
Clear your mind, feel your heart
To the sky, and beyond
You are now listening to Black Thoughts

[Intro]
I gotta make it
I gotta make it even if heaven or hell
I gotta make it
I gotta make it
I gotta make it

[Verse 1]
K-k-keep blinking as my mind flash
Right cash, pretty girls nice ass
This bitch is bad
I dream of pockets full of bands
But none at hand
Take pictures at the dealership
One day I'll buy that, bitch
Moving fast, girl get on my lap
Wish on a star on everything he asked
Whenever there's trouble, viola
Make the fingers snap
No magic out the hat
Tell baby bye bye, I'm never coming back

[Hook]
I gotta make it even if heaven or hell
I gotta make it even if heaven or hell
I gotta make it even if heaven or hell
I gotta make it
I gotta make it

[Verse 2]
Never stop seeing violence
Only stopping they'll do is for sirens
Loudmouths get silenced
I should riddle what I've seen
Community grief
For thinking you clean
They will drag you muddy from your feet
OGs mix Can coke with the Henny
OMG, put miles on caprice
So that their mouths could feed
They live through me
I'm the closest to TV
Who told you to change the channel?
I was watching, remote please
Niggas want what they can't have
This life will let you touch things that you can't grab
Explain it when you buried man
Until then, I take off and then I land
I'll be goddamned

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Heaven, hell
Is it really real?
Would you give your life for this life?

[Verse 3]
Time is ticking for you lab-rats
And I'm a chemist with this mental, this is not rap
Bitch, I don't even laugh
Bitch, you can miss me with that gavel-jab
All you judge jury niggas just a fake act
I'm somewhere getting my stage on
Black super shades on
Hey y'all, aye y'all
Someone turn they swag on
I'm off the wrong road
So don't follow me home
You gotta learn how to walk on your own

[Hook]

[Verse 1: Earl Sweatshirt]
Gorgeous, chrome-plated horse whip
Home, making paintings for poor-quality porn flicks
Court adjourned and the verdict's still saucy
Sack swinging like Dub-D40 on a door hinge
Good Lord, walk light like the floor slick
Look bored, hoard all mics in a force grip
Pro-abortion, endorsing his own importance
Or leaving opponents floating with paper and dirty porcelain
Pinnacle of titillating, crisp spit
Fist clenched, emulating '68 Olympics
Rock it from the cradle 'til he middle-age and limp-stick
Coughing from the stable probably indicating spliff's lit
Dismissed, feel it in that saturated cranium
Heavy as insurance off a spanking-new laser gun
Crazy heart, hazy lung, making art, raking funds
Crowd going dumb like Palin's son, ugh

[Hook: Frank Ocean]
And it always follows autumn
No home for the weak
No insurance for your pride
Jive
Jive
And it always follows autumn

[Verse 2: Earl Sweatshirt]
I sit in thought 'til the flow is right
Then throw some D onto all available open mics
Smoke it right, proposing these niggas over
Wipe more because I normally toilet-bowl with a broken pipe, tch
The former soloist who flow was sick
The token sober kid stressed, so the role was switched
Four Lokos down the hole and a loaded spliff
And who was useless as a broken wrist when tryna open shit
Nigga, cold is what you need to keep the poultry in
Resulting in me rolling slick as bottom of the bowling kicks
Early Man, you posers know me as the troll
Throwing moldy donut holes at your grody ho from his cronies' whip
Eating like the kids when you take ‘em off Ritalin
Throwing temper tantrums at the window of your whip again
Sweeping up the glass to use it as a garnish over tracks
Damaged like the leg he limping to the barn with
Chickenshits
Temper 'bout as thick as tips of pencils is
Missiles to the picket fence
Who spit as good as finger-lickin’, bitch?
Bet it's 36 fish netted like the hook was inefficient

[Hook: Frank Ocean]
And it always follows autumn
No home for the weak
No insurance for your pride
Jive
Jive
And it always follows autumn

[Verse]
Sting beats like bee-hives
Beats like these
Don't get caught on that East-side
L.A. in my G ride, A.C. on the dash
Black flame make my seat hot
On my way from picking cash
I ran into my ex
Best sex I ever had
Don't laugh
But that pussy fuck around and pass gas
Haha, quack quack, now duck-duck that ass
Shane baby (yeah)
Tyga man you know the name baby (uh-huh)
Money ain't a thing
To the Young Money gang baby
Our navy, our ate and leave and rape your lady
Or maybe take more whores, show me your titty
Uh, twenty town here I come
I coulda went lyrical on this beat but I don't
I won't cause you niggas do anything for a joke
L.M.A.O. to the bank I go (gone)

[Intro]
Well
Take your vitamins!

[Verse 1]
Well, I was on my way to meet up with this woman that I met
The other day while I was on my break to smoke cigarettes
I hit her up, she had some weed and told me, "Come through, we should smoke
Bring a pair of L's, don't bring no money, baby, I ain't broke"
So I'm walkin' up the stairs to the porch
Knocked against the door, heard some feet against the floor
The door had opened up and it was her
She told me, "Hurry, come right in
Leave your shoes up by the furnace, we just put new carpets in"
She asked me 'bout my day, then sat me down
Told me, "We should have some fun, there ain't nobody around"
She got this crazy pill the other day when she was on her way to work
Told me it would make my problems go away and fix the hurt
That I had, well, that don't sound bad
Down the hatch, kinda nervous, "Just relax," she said rubbin' on my back
Well, I ain't really into drugs, but fuck it
I'ma take a trip and I'ma love it (Love it)

[Chorus]
I don't know what happened to me
But as soon as it hit me, I was fuckin' free
It took me to somewhere off the map
And I don't think I'll ever find my way back, back

[Verse 2]
I left right after that and started drivin' to my house where I reside
I was high and possibly a little fuckin' out my mind
Can't remember where I live, it ain't like I just bought this house
I said, "Fuck it," took a breath, opened my door and just jumped out
And it's funny 'cause I didn't even hit against the road
I just went right through the ground and started floatin' on my own
I see colors, different colors like they glowin' and they're light
They was glowin' like they glowin' in the dark, but it was bright
That's alright, this shit crazy, what the fuck she had me take?
If this kill me, I'ma come back, haunt her every single day
As I wait, sittin' somewhere that I never seen
Feel like I forever dream, just imagine, set a scene
Power and imagination got all my surroundings changin'
Found a place to drown my brain in somethin' like it's outer space
But nothin' like the pictures from the astronauts
They showed me back at school
When they told me drugs were bad, oh man, oh man, they had me fooled

[Chorus]
I don't know what happened to me
But as soon as it hit me, I was fuckin' free
It took me to somewhere off the map
And I don't think I'll ever find my way back, back

[Outro]

[Action Bronson]

[coughs] Oh my god, this mothafuckin' sour is too good
I don’t even be fuckin' with that other shit
That shit hurts my throat man
I need that shit that tastes like fuckin', fuckin' soap
Joy, Ajax. Shit… ayo, this is what I be doin' on that…

[Verse 1]
Orlando Magic warm-up suits and black Shaqs
'95: younger Bronson on the fast track
To blast gat, now I'm looking past that
I want the cash stack higher than the NASDAQ
I put the work in, the downtime I'm cooking lamb
A thousand Dutches in the air like it's a reefer jam
Aretha jam, you better R-E-S-P-E-C-T me
Or risk the forest where the motherfucking rest your team be
Peking duck, and large liver, goose carver
Swiss Bally's, smoke cigar just like a new father
You know the motto, jacket to the knee
I can't help if I'm a fiend, I had to tap into the beat, Lord
Spark a seance, cause everybody lifted
I'm like the strainer with the fucking powder being sifted up
This is Queens Day, alleys where the fiends play
Yo cuff the Guess on the construction, take it easy

[Hook]
This for my people making sales until they back hurt
See the beast on the creep, they let the Mac squirt
Bitch on the backs, that do the dippies on the bikes, and
Loud pipes and rocking leathers like a wild Viking
My man who just came home, and some are going up
Fiends up in the alley, sippin Balley fucking throwing up
Keep your mind straight, focus on the prize
Always diving into thighs, blowing smoke into the skies

[Verse 2]
Bronsonelli the problem, we got the party reeking
Never see us starving, all my people hardly speaking
When it's time, though, we form into a single file
Spray the fucking ballcourt without hitting a single child
Hop in the Beamer, Pigeon popping the nina
Getting top in a steamer, scoping rock in a Tina
Hooker, that type of looker eat the pussy from the back
Take the children to the school, baking cookies, serving packs all day
Know the verbal, is Oscar-winning
You cop a squat to piss in, only focused on them rocks that glisten
Suppositories in the ass of you, the green Fila with a Horsey how this motherfucking bastard do
Bet the crib that you ain't fucking with this grown man
I'll E. Honda a thousand, slap you with the whole hand
Sex a dime, herbally, a blessed time
Check the rhyme motherfucker, better recognize

[Hook]
This for my people making sales until they back hurt
See the beast on the creep, they let the Mac squirt
Bitch on the backs, that do the dippies on the bikes, and
Loud pipes and rocking leathers like a wild Viking
My man who just came home, and some are going up
Fiends up in the alley, sippin Balley fucking throwing up
Keep your mind straight, focus on the prize
Always diving into thighs, blowing smoke into the skies

[Verse 3]
The eyes slanted from the origami, I roll a quarter of the water
Near the border, where you oughta find me
The Tamborine Man pumping while the Tyson burning
Air Tech Challenge, clay court, checks balance
Stay endorsing that weak shit, my team spit
That mean shit, like stepping in some fiend's shit
Now you sick to your stomach because you stunted
Word got fronted, another motherfucking jerk confronted
Post pattern, Lonnie threw the loaf at 'em
Flushing, motherfucker, keep a toast up by the gold Saturn
Little doulas on the block we tell 'em "go stab 'em"
Relieve him of his shoes, it's easier to toe tag 'em'
Carhartt sets and Horseys like the Preakness
Bronson love a freak bitch, dining on that Greek dish
That's the a-hole, all my people AWOL
Cash inside the case and now the judges want to play ball

[Hook]

[Intro]
Yeah
Uh, uh, uh
One time, one time, one time for your goddamn mind

[Chorus]
Walkin' through this world with J's on my feet
J-J's on my feet, J-J's on my feet
Walk-walkin' through this world with J's on my feet

Babes on my piece, sla-sla-slayin' the beats, yes (Ha, ayy, what's good, baby?)
Walkin' through this world with J's on my feet (Oh, you ain't never heard of me?)
J-J's on my feet, J-J-J's on my feet (Aight, yo)

[Verse 1]
'Cause it's a banger two, banger two (Uh-huh)
Type of shit on pay-per-view (Yessir)
Butt-naked she layin'-layin', 'cause you can't tame a zoo
She wild (Yep), she want my child, don't touch that dial
I whisper in her ear, it makes her smile (Haha)
Loud as I'm fuckin' her
Smooth like I'm in love with her
Tingles up my spine every time that I'm touchin' her (You know)
I love her like pussy, money, weed
When I'm hungry, I will feed
So for dinner, she cooks food with four different types of cheese
In the sheets, we have dessert until it hurts (Hurts)
Feelin' on her curves (Curves)
I pet up on that pussy 'til it purrs (Purrs)
Touch me, touch me, I'm sure it's her that loves me
'Cause I could make the Virgin Mary fuck me, trust me
Mac like Bernie, havin' sex like Will
Fuck a freaky circus bitch while she still wearin' stilts (Aha)
These J's on my feet and these babes on my piece
See, I have a different girl for every day of the week, like (You know)

[Chorus]
Walkin' through this world with J's on my feet (Uh)

J-J's on my feet, J-J-J's on my feet

[Verse 2]
Girl, MapQuest my address to access my mattress
I get girls straight outta the pageant (Ha)
No doubt that I'm smashin', I'm askin' her name (What's good, baby?)
You a masterpiece, girl, and that ass is just flame (Yep)
She knows that I'm a rapper and her dad is ashamed
Won't let her out the crib, boy, he's actin' insane (Actin' insane)
She got that cute smile and she laugh at my name (Laugh at my name)
But wanna roll with my peoples, let Mac get that brain (Get that brain)
Yeah, Mac has that game, so see how he plays it
I face piff, rap to a girl and leave her anxious
Girls wanted me when I was chubby with some braces
I bet they like me now 'cause I got money and I'm famous
The taste is delicious, her lips give me kisses (Yep)
Throw her in the kitchen and she's makin' me dishes
Her dinner ain't right, I'll admit it's smellin' awful
That girl can make a batch of Belgian waffles a jawful (Haha)

[Chorus]
Walkin' through this world with J's on my feet
J-J's on my feet, J-J's on my feet
Walk-walkin' through this world with J's on my feet
J-J's on my feet, J-J-J's on my feet

Walkin' through this world with J's on my feet
J-J's on my feet, J-J-J's on my feet

[Verse 3]
Grab a ounce or bigger, then I bounce like Tigger (Peace)
Count three dollars up and grab a pack of some Swishers
I'm feelin' stoned, I got my cigarillo rolled
Filled with green isle like an armadillo's nose (Nose)
I'm sniffin' out the hoes that light the piff and wanna throw
Then we spliffin' up the dro as I'm slippin' off her clothes
Not a player like pun, there's more flavors to come
No long-lastin' girls, they Life Savers, not gum
But I could use her beauty (Beauty)
They can take her to a movie
But that girl be gettin' more love than Lucy
So I can't complain (Complain), or contain these broads
I feel like I'm like the white Flavor Flav with broads
Shorty got a ass, a body, plus her face is bomb
They runnin' after me, yo, restrain 'em, dog
They gon' tackle me (Tackle me)
Rip clothes off and saddle me
Mac, wake ya ass up and hop into reality (Haha)
I guess hoes ain't here kissin' my feet
But I do got a fine new bitch every week (Haha, best believe)
I said I guess hoes ain't here kissin' feet
But I do got a fine new bitch every week, so don't sleep

[Chorus]
Walkin' through this world with J's on my feet

[Intro: Various Women & Mac Miller]
What are you afraid of?
What are you afraid of?
What are you afraid of?
ספר לי על הפחדים שלך
What are you afraid of? (Uh)
What are you afraid of?
What are you afraid of?
One-two, one-two, uh
Tell me your fears
Sometimes I see the... Is everything okay?
ספר לי על הפחדים שלך, uh
Tell me your fears

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Sometimes I see the world for how fucked up it really is
I tell myself I'll be the one to make a change in it
I could die tonight, not make it to the sunrise
Then I couldn't heal the pain in it
I'm gettin' high to forget about the lows, though
Get a pay check, spend it all on polo
Designer brands cover up my insecurities
Personally I ain't nothin' but an average Joe, though
Now I'm dressin' so expensive for no reason
Cold world we livin' in, it's below freezin'
I got some fam who can't afford a coat
So I leave a little paper there before I go
Spent a thousand on a hotel, they poor and broke
Made me wonder who I'm prayin' to before the show
This a letter to whoever, I'm just tryna set you free
Remember love if you can't remember me

[Chorus: Mac Miller]
Dear people on Earth after I die
What's the weather like?
One, two, three, four
Five, six, seven, eight
And I ain't perfect but I try
Hey, I wonder if I'll maybe
Get a second life
This time I'ma get it right

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
It's either God or the devil with these drugs I'm on
I don't know if we were meant to see it all like this
Still, plantin' seeds so my money long
Money addict, it's a habit that palms gon' itch
I wish we could just all get rich
Sometimes not havin' money is all I miss
And, yeah, these hoes are all up on my dick
The all American girl, that's just a blonde hair bitch
Am I supposed to have some thoughts like this?
Could we figure out what God might've miss?
It's funny that these questions never get an answer
Life a bitch sometimes, you gotta reprimand her
Never understand her, why should I even try?
Live forever then you'll never feel the need to die
This a letter, open it to set you free
Remember love and remember me

[Chorus: Mac Miller]
Dear people on Earth after I die
What's the weather like?
One, two, three, four
Five, six, seven, eight
And I ain't perfect but I try
Hey, I wonder if I'll maybe
Get a second life
This time I'ma get it right

[Outro: Mac Miller]
What does it mean to be a sensation?
Do you have to be sensational?
And how you know you made it?
When you're with Killa Cam watchin' Paid in Full, I
Never had good grades in school, but
Shock the world is what I came to do, I
Got a song I wanna play for you
So can you sing that back to me? I said
What does it mean to be a sensation?
Do you have to be sensational?
How you know you made it?
When you're with Killa Cam watchin' Paid in Full, I
Never had good grades in school, but
Shock the world is what I came to do, I
Got a song I wanna play for you
So can you sing that back to me?

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Ay, you know that work moving so that paper steady stacking
And niggas out here hating I done made it cuz I'm rapping
My chain is solid gold, man I said later for that platinum
And threw them yellow diamonds on that "P" and got it tatted
A lot of y'all just talk, I let em see I make it happen
Moving rhymes like weight, some mistake and think I'm trappin'
That heat I gotta pack it cuz they wait for me to slip
Let a hater go'on and trip, 32 off in that clip
I'm riding big shit, and I'm smoking even bigger
Your baby mama say she wanna fuck a young nigga
I took it from an eighth, and made it to a half
Now I'm working with a whole one, language do the math
And it ain't about your man, if it don't involve them presidents
Them dead white folk, all that other shit's irrelevant
Never said I'm first to put the Burgh up on the map
I'm more like Mike Tomlin, here to bring the Burgh back
Khalifa man

[Hook]
Now everywhere I go, at a club or a show
A broke nigga got something to say

I'm a hustler, I be stacking, I'm a hundred, y'all be acting
In the Burgh I get it smacking yeah I own it all day
And them hating niggas funny
Don't got no reason not to like me except I got some money
I turn a classy chick into a certified bussy
Not even the baddest bitch, couldn't get a dime from me
They see me and try and hug me, these haters try and plug me
I got a hundred real niggas, ray to fire for me
You waiting 'round for me, well I think I'll get it started
It's number 2, you act stupid my team'll get retarded... yeah

[Hook]
When they hatin' on ya, hatin' on ya, hatin' on ya
I turn around and put my shades on
When they hatin' on ya (put your shades on

[Verse 1]
Big money with the power
Killing haters off by the hour
Hop off the jet to the towers
Both top floors are ours
How could you?
Not love, love, love what you into
I'm in a magazine now it's an issue
Go cry baby here
Go a tissue, and go a tissue
Call me when you get through
Cause I be where the bars is low
Yellow charms and the cars is go
So onto the dawn, we toast
If they get too close
Just remember though

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Bow to what you now witness
Lyrical chemist, cage with the kitties
Can't get my name on my menace
If I said it, then I meant it
When you hear it, don't forget it
Hit it off Downtown in a Phantom
That's what I heard from a bird whisper
Ask him where the liquor
Getting at bitches, saying on Twitter
They see me from a distance (really)
Cause I be where the bars is low
Yellow charms and the cars is go
So onto the dawn, we toast
If they get too close
Just remember though

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Cartier
Gazelle
Louis V
RayBan
Porsche
(Gucci)

[Hook]

Put your shades on

[Verse 1: Tyga]
Life move fast, everyday flash
We like handbags, girls got to grab
Some say it's bad to love with a laugh
She smiles at me, don't even know who I am
But she with me, tonight to the A.M
Said I got to go, she like wait, when?
Wait, where's your friend?
Wait, I'm feeling him
I meant you (you was easier to get to)
Club lights leave the mind frozen
Never seen ice strike like good bowling
Pinned to the sofa, see it much closer
Big Moses, I slide in like loafers
Haha, shame like T say
She stay where we stay if we stay in every state
It's my nature that makes you naughty girl
I'm feeling you but sorry girl

[Hook]
I don't want no party girl, sleeping over time
Just need me someone who can cool it down
Make me feel like love is easy
If love is all you need, let me hear you say
I need it
I gotta have it
Can't play the game no more so I'm doing something about it
And I want it
Yeah, I'm on it
Searching far and wide to find the girl for me, yeah

[Verse 2: Lloyd]
See, I been so many places
And I can't find the one who's for me
When I fall in love I wonder (when I fall in love I wonder)
Experienced so many relations
But still I haven't found what I need
Feels like I'm going under
It's so hard to breathe
Lord I'm tired of losing
I pray you send an angel down
To come and change my life around
Love is so confusing
Can't seem to find a solid ground
Will somebody please show me how

[Hook]
I don't want no party girl, sneaking over town
Just need me someone who can cool it down
Make me feel like love is easy
If love is all you need, then let me hear you say
I'm with it
Can't live without it
Can't play the game no more so I'm doing something about it
And I want it
Yeah, I'm on it
Searching far and wide to find the girl for me, yeah

[Verse 2: Tyga]
It's times like this that make me really wonder
Who the real bitches and who the real fronters
Who the real image and who this blocked number
Who would I call on collect in the prison
For a one one, couldn't tell me nothing
Who is this mystery person I called on
Can't get calls, when your phone's off
And the bill's due, and the food gone
I need a shorty like Lee-Ray
Who could wheel big bodies on the freeways
New Mercedes, through the Palisades
Back to the pool palace where we can lay
Shrimp all day, shit, it's my place
Ain't never got to see a broke nigga face
When you feel alone, just think of me
Sing along girl, remember what the song sing

[Hook]
I don't want no party girl, sneaking over town
Just need me someone who can cool it down
Make me feel like love is easy
If love is all you need, then let me hear you say
I'm with it
Can't live without it
Can't play the game no more so I'm doing something about it
And I want it
Yeah, I'm on it
Searching far and wide to find the girl for me, yeah

[Hook]
I've been grinding since a day old
Now I'm older but my mama don't think so
My heart big but it beats slow
Can't trust everybody that you meet yo
I dreamt this my whole life
For you to take it, I don't think so
And see that you ain't right
Tryna take my right, I don't think so
I don't think so

[Verse 1]
Some say I'm so arrogant
Talking about every girl and the old ones I hit
Look, miss, whoever told you this ain't him
Dismiss, no time for you small-mind midgets
No offence to them, but giant is what I'm looking like
From short distance, prolific
Write or touch the paper airless nigga
You hearing this, nigga
Inattentive in attendance, listen
Checklist before the guest list
More trying to enter, but won't exist
Cause I'm what next is
Every grand kid expect this
Tyga for they breakfast
Now they want seconds
Damn, wait a second
Let me program
She obsessed with my stylish ass
I just sit back and I laugh
All these clowns tryna pay with my cash
Something they never had for me

[Hook]
I've been grinding since a day old
Now I'm older but my mama don't think so
My heart big but it beats slow
Can't trust everybody that you meet yo
I dreamt this my whole life
For you to take it, I don't think so
And see that you ain't right
Tryna take my right, I don't think so
I don't think so

[Verse 2]
So what's up, is you down with us?
Of course I'm just on my "what if"
Other shit I'd be getting without this
I don't need all these people
So I look with my ego would envy below
Can't see you, even if I try to
Those right beside you could be your misguidance
For now I say goodbye, boo
Maybe later down the line, we could be cool
Vibe like the magazine, do a movie or two
Review my latest news, interviews, Youtube
Like I got how many views?
You're so just like me
Between worlds, it's a lightning
How you become perfect timing
From far North to the islands
G.E.D they talking
But watch 'em, misery loves company
It's gettin' crowded

[Hook]
I've been grinding since a day old
Now I'm older but my mama don't think so
My heart big but it beats slow
Can't trust everybody that you meet yo
I dreamt this my whole life
For you to take it, I don't think so
And see that you ain't right
Tryna take my right, I don't think so
I don't think so

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
This a celebration, this is levitation
Look at how you winning now
This took dedication
This is medication, higher education
This the official, competitor elimination
I was taking trips, with Web to move weight
Came back to Queens, to hit up a new state
Bitches don't know the half like they flunked at math
Bitches ain't have cut up, crack up in the stash
50 Cent Italian, icy flow
This that: run and get a dollar for the ice-cream cone
'Cause they killed my little cousin Nicholas
But my memory's only happy images
This is for the hood, this is for the kids
This is for the single mothers, niggas doing bids
This one is for Tee-Tee, Tweety, Viola, Sharica
Candace, Thembi, Lauren, Aisha

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
It's a celebration (Put one in the air for the ghetto, ooh)
It's times like these (Ooh, ooh)
They know who we are by now (They know who we are)
Champion, the champions (Champion, champion)

[Verse 2: Drake]
Yeah, okay, we made it to America
I remember when I used to stay with Erykah
Label transferred 20 million to Comerica
It's fucking terrible, it's got me acting out of character
Young T.O. nigga, either riding range
Or Ferrari top down, screaming, "Money ain't a thang!"
Tell me when I change, girl, but only when I change
'Cause I live this shit for real, niggas know me in the game
They know!
Making hits in three acre cribs
Cooking up tryna eat niggas, steak and ribs
I made a couple stars outta basic chicks
Nowadays blow the candles out, don't even make a wish
Having good times, making good money
Lot of bad bitches, but they good to me
I make them do the splits for a rack
Wish you niggas good luck, tryna get where I'm at
Straight like that

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
It's a celebration (Put one in the air for the ghetto, ooh)
It's times like these (Ooh, ooh)
They know who we are by now (They know who we are)
Champion, the champions (Champion, champion)

[Verse 3: Young Jeezy]
Straight balling in this bitch, Jeremy Lin; 'Melo
Tell me one thing you won't do: settle
Give me one word for your chain: yellow
Pocket full of money, black cars; ghetto
Critics say I ain't in the game, A.I
Jeezy, how you deal with the fame? Stay high
Stay putting on for the town, may I?
What you call a crib in the sky? Play-high
Over a mil in three weeks, yeah, I did it like a champ
Momma taught me pride, yeah, she did it with the stamps
Wait a minute, everybody pause for the photo
Somebody tell these local hating niggas, I'm global
Tell me what I gotta do to get this champagne going
What I gotta do to get this coconut flowing?
Don’t let me hit up Shawn Carter, hundred bottles of the Ace
Let me hit up Sean Combs, hundred cases to my place, let's celebrate

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
It's a celebration (Put one in the air for the ghetto, ooh)
It's times like these (Ooh, ooh)
They know who we are by now (They know who we are)
Champion, the champions (Champion, champion)

[Verse 4: Nas]
What up, Nicki? It's Nasty, yeah
I saw my first two million dollars, I was 23
I'm barely a man, yet, I had some killers under me
This ain't rated PG, this rated PJ
'Cause that's where a nigga from; murder on replay
My 24th b-day, I'm sailing to Bermedy, you can see me on a yacht
Blasting Pac, little knot, I ain't greedy
I'm back to thugging, bitches
Back to making them kiss other bitches
My man sister like me, I don't fuck my brother sister
I just aspire your desire to be different
My ten year old plan just one year to finish
My list look like this, first thing you'll discover
The difference in pussy: white, black, Latin and other
Here's a man who clearly isn't basic
Waiting list, just to hear me or witness the greatness
Loud laughter, while writing my next chapter: Fast Cash Life
Happily ever after
Champions

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
It's a celebration (Put one in the air for the ghetto, ooh)
It's times like these (Ooh, ooh)
They know who we are by now (They know who we are)
Champion, the champions (Champion, champion)

[Intro: Bobby V]
Yeah
Bobby V
Yeah
DJ, turn me up
Don't you turn this down, no, no

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
I think I gave him a discrete name
He replied with a street name
P.R. at the heat game
No ball, but peep game
He addicted to hustle, I'm addicted to fame
Though he packin' that muscle, I'm addicted to brain
I'm addicted to chillin', make a hell of a killin'
Don't I stunt on these bitches?
Man, I'm bad as a villain
Get the gun, I'ma hunt 'em
When I'm done, I'm a don 'em
When we leavin' the lounge, I'ma keep it a hunnid
It went down, 'nuff said
Pull off in that thang, and it's blush red

[Chorus: Bobby V]
Sex in the lounge
Girl, I'm gon' ya down
I'm gon' you screaming, girl
They gonna hear the sound of our sex in the lounge
I can't believe this is happening to me, girl
Happening to me, girl, oh wow

[Verse 2: Bobby V]
So caught up in this girl
Shawty got me love trapped, now
Can't control myself, 'cause I'm so into her
Cause we doing it like nobody's around
And when we doing, I can hear her make a sound
Shawty was singing like me
Had that girl singing, singing like me
She be like, "Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh."
Oh, I, I, I, I-I-I, I, I, I (Oh, whoa)
She looking at me like she want it
Like, I'm over here (Oh, whoa)
She climbing on top of me
I'ma make her scream, her scream like

[Chorus: Bobby V]
Sex in the lounge
Girl, I'm gon' take ya down
I'm gon' have you screaming, girl
They gonna hear the sound of our sex in the lounge
I can't believe this is happening to me, girl
Happening to me, girl, oh wow

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Sit that pussy on my bottom lip
Then, after that, you know we gotta switch
My house so big that bitch came with a lobby
We didn't use a rubber, but I came on her body
I lay her down and kiss her neck and talk dirty to her
Like I get that pussy wetter than a dirty sewer
Fuck with me, turn around and bust it open for me
Get on that dick and get that money, go Oprah for me
All you girls don't like me, 'cause they know you love me
But if you scared, go to church, it's open Sunday
I-I dig in that pussy, guess what I find
Tunechi Lee and Nicki, sex in the lounge

[Chorus: Bobby V]
Sex in the lounge
Girl, I'm gon' take ya down
I'm gon' have you screaming, girl
They gonna hear the sound of our sex in the lounge
I can't believe this is happening to me, girl
Happening to me, girl, oh wow
Sex in the lounge
Girl, I'm gon' take ya down
I'm gon' have you screaming, girl
They gonna hear the sound of our sex in the lounge
I can't believe this is happening to me, girl
Happening to me, girl, oh wow

[Verse 1]
You shoulda left the other day
You let me beg for you to stay
This is a sickening joke that you play with my emotions
And so, I pray you burn in hell, and you never find the ocean

[Chorus]
I hope your fire, fire burns, baby
I hope your fire, fire burns, baby
I hope you lay down in your sleep, and you choke on every lie you told
And when you’re reaching out for me, you’ll see you reap everything you sow

[Verse 2]
You piece of shit, you broke me down
Thought you said you, would hold me down
But I could see it in your eyes that you're blinded by them flashing lights
And you's a stupid muthafucker for letting this thing pass you by

[Chorus]
I hope your fire, fire burns, baby
I hope your fire, fire burns, baby
I hope you lay down in your sleep, and you choke on every lie you told
And when you’re reaching out for me, you’ll see you reap everything you sow

[Outro]
(Burn, burn, burn...)

[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh
Come fill my glass up a little more
We 'bout to get up and burn this floor
You know we getting hotter, and hotter
Sexy, and hotter, let's shut it down
Uh!

[Verse 1]
Yo, what I gotta do to show these girls that I own 'em?
Some call me Nicki, and some call me Roman
Skeeza, pleeza, I'm in Ibiza (Whoo)
Giuseppe Zanotti, my own sneaker
Sexy, sexy that’s all I do
If you need a bad bitch, let me call a few
Pumps on, and the little mini-skirts is out
I see some good girls, I'ma turn 'em out
Okay, bottle, sip, bottle, guzzle
I'm a bad bitch, no muzzle, hey?
Bottle, sip, bottle, guzzle
I'm a bad bitch, no muzzle, let's go

[Pre-Chorus]
Music makes me high

[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh
Come fill my glass up a little more
We 'bout to get up and burn this floor
You know we getting hotter, and hotter
Sexy, and hotter, let's shut it down

[Drop]
Pound the alarm!
Pound the alarm!

[Verse 2]
I wanna do it for the night, night
So, get me now, and knock this over
I wanna do it like you like, like
Come get me, baby
We're not getting younger
I just want you tonight, night
Baby, we won't do it for life, life, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Music makes me high

[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh
Come fill my glass up a little more
We 'bout to get up and burn this floor
You know we getting hotter, and hotter
Sexy, and hotter, let's shut it down

[Drop]
Pound the alarm!
Pound the alarm!

[Breakdown]
Alarm!
Alarm!
Alarm!

[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh

We 'bout to get up and burn this floor
You know we getting hotter, and hotter
Sexy, and hotter, let's shut it down

[Verse 1]
Hey, you, jump in this ride
It's real nice, it's slippery inside
Wise guy, come get this pie
R-r-ride it, ride it in style
Said it a minute ago, I did it a minute ago
I drop it, I pick it up slow
I want it, I'm kicking it though
'Cause they know that I got that good shit
Said I'm bad, but I could be a good bitch

[Pre-Chorus]
Squeeze my body, rock my body
Boy, you make me go
“Na-na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na-na,” me go
Please my body, heal my body
Boy, you make me go
“Na-na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na-na,” me go
We gon'

[Chorus]
Hey, stranger over there
I'm really liking the way you whip it, whip it
Yeah, I want you every day
You're so right (So right)
You're so tight (So tight)
You got my world spinnin'
You got my world spinnin'
My head goes round and around, r-round and around
And I'm thinking if we could be
Stranger, what you say?
I'm really liking that way you whip it, whip it
Whip it, whip it, whip it, whip it (Uh!)

[Drop]
“Na-na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na-na,” me go
“Na-na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na-na,” me go

[Verse 2]
Woah
Is that my cue?
I'm lookin' for some brain to boost my IQ
I'm like 5'2
My SAT scores was high too
But I don't wanna brag, I Louis Vuitton bagged him
Hopped out the jag, proceeded to shag-shagged him
Slim, trim, also light skin
So Pe-Pe-Peter put the pipe in

[Pre-Chorus]
Squeeze my body, rock my body
Boy, you make me go
“Na-na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na-na,” me go
Please my body, heal my body
Boy, you make me go
“Na-na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na-na,” me go
We gon'

[Chorus]
Hey, stranger over there
I'm really liking the way you whip it, whip it
Yeah, I want you every day
You're so right (So right)
You're so tight (So tight)
You got my world spinnin'
You got my world spinnin'
My head goes round and around, r-round and around
And I'm thinking if we could be
Stranger, what you say?
I'm really liking that way you whip it, whip it
Whip it, whip it, whip it, whip it (Uh!)

[Drop]
“Na-na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na-na,” me go
“Na-na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na-na,” me go
“Na-na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na-na,” me go
“Na-na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na-na,” me go

[Verse 1]
Uh
I fuck around with amnesia, pour four inside of my liter
One day I'ma get it all cleaned up, right now I'ma dirty my jeans up
This what I do, start the day, picture bring back all the pain
All that shit that's hard to say, had a vision, lost its way
This planet different that we live in, yeah, I bet it is
Product of the new world, you stuck in Genesis
And I'm just tryna rep my city right like Bettis did
I got a crazy girl that's filled with all these fetishes

[Pre-Chorus]
Plus she can get me high when I'm feelin' low
Fill my cup with purple, baby, drink it slow
And I can take you anywhere you wanna go
Don't, don't be afraid
Don't be afraid

[Chorus]
I told her please don't take this back from me, this feelin' come so naturally
Exactly what I wanna do, I'm actin' so erratically
You get me high, hold me there, this is real, girl, don't be scared
It's only fair, I warned you that love a drug that can kill you
Got your open heart, I'd have it never, grow apart or last forever
Hopin' you'll remember what I tell you, lookin' in your eyes
Don't be afraid of what can get you high
Just hold me tight and watch the seconds fly
I, I, I, I

[Verse 2]
I wonder where will I meet the perfect girl that I dream of
And I don't need no huge tits, I'm cool with just a good B cup
Uh, you're now free to ball, build it up, then keep it all
She don't need to call, if love the landin', then we could fall
'Til we drop dead, say everything that we've not said
I'm tellin' you that you hard to trust, you sayin' I got a hard head
This forever, don't you ever think to let me go
And if I'm talkin' to the world, I need to let 'em know

[Pre-Chorus]
That she can get me high when I'm feelin' low
Fill my cup with purple, baby, drink it slow
And I can take you anywhere you wanna go
Don't, don't be afraid
Don't be afraid

[Chorus]
I told her please don't take this back from me, this feelin' come so naturally
Exactly what I wanna do, I'm actin' so erratically
You get me high, hold me there, this is real, girl, don't be scared
It's only fair, I warned you that love a drug that can kill you
Got your open heart, I'd have it never, grow apart or last forever
Hopin' you'll remember what I tell you, lookin' in your eyes
Don't be afraid of what can get you high
Just hold me tight and watch the seconds fly
I, I, I, I

[Intro: Mac Miller]
Uh (Uh)
Macadelic
America

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
I'm, in a room filled with holographic images
Path is limitless, death, well, that's ridiculous
I'ma live forever, 'cause a legend never die
See the world as simple, but complex in the design
I spent some time just thinkin'
Where did that get me? High, more drinkin'
Now my head empty, so can it last a couple minutes more?
Pain a funny thing when you can't figure out the source
Bear witness while I'm checkin' bitches off my hit list
Try to understand the fuckin' message I encrypted
Ancient, halucinatin' visions of utopia
Until I figure out that the perfect world a lonely one
Never hold my tongue, vocal as a loaded gun
And I'ma shoot somebody in the face if they too slow to run
Mac Miller, I'm the only one
But I'm the coldest one, this is pandemonium

[Chorus: Mac Miller]
Got my middle finger up with a cup and a dutch split (Uh)
Hand on my nuts when I'm wilin' out in public (Yeah)
Welcome to America (Uh)
Motherfucker, welcome to America (Yeah)
My middle finger up with a cup and a dutch split (Uh)
Hands on my nuts while I'm wilin' out in public (Yeah)
Welcome to America (Uh)
Motherfucker, welcome to America (Yeah)

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Still, in a room filled with holographic images
Crushin' information into powder, then I'm sniffin' it
Directly to my head, never sleep or use my bed
Iller than the future death of you ingestin' Sudafed
Might head to Budapest just to get a Gucci vest
Hop into a jet, get some rest to diffuse the stress (Uh)
See, this is what I do the best
Nothin' that you got except the bullet gettin' through my chest
Save hard, a Braveheart, a warrior
I take part to stay far from coroners
I heard some corny words said about my music though
Talkin' all that shit, sound exactly like a groupie ho
Most Dope, got you hooked, yellin', "Rufio"
First you lose your mind, then you lose your soul
So what you talkin' about? Thinkin' you out of options
American born, impeccable form
Above and beyond, never the norm

[Chorus: Mac Miller]
Got my middle finger up with a cup and a dutch split (Uh)
Hand on my nuts when I'm wilin' out in public (Yeah)
Welcome to America (Uh)
Motherfucker, welcome to America (Yeah)
My middle finger up with a cup and a dutch split (Uh)
Hands on my nuts while I'm wilin' out in public (Yeah)
Welcome to America (Uh)
Motherfucker, welcome to America (Yeah)

[Verse 3: Casey Veggies]
Yo chick live in Pittsburgh? Bet I steal her
Shout out my wigga Mac Miller, comin' up in a world full of killers
I'll be shaded up at the villa
With a girl that know what the deal is
Yeah, they know I come from the illest
City on the map, we don't know how to act, ah!
Realest young rap go-getters in America
Bad chicks get tossed around like the merry-go
CV and Mac Meezy takin' off on PJ's
We the future, so every night is a new day
Sittin' in the studio, chain on and my hat low
Young visionaries and we sellin' out the rap show
I can trigger the wave in my sleep
Name paved, I feel like I am engraved on the beat, ah!
Wake up shower, get paid and repeat
Spit one flow and got made on the streets
Welcome to the land where you never stay for free
Swag worth a mill, drop cast let it deal
Veggies

[Chorus: Mac Miller]
Got my middle finger up with a cup and a dutch split (Uh)
Hand on my nuts when I'm wilin' out in public (Yeah)
Welcome to America (Uh)
Motherfucker, welcome to America (Yeah)
My middle finger up with a cup and a dutch split (Uh)
Hands on my nuts while I'm wilin' out in public (Yeah)
Welcome to America (Uh)
Motherfucker, welcome to America (Yeah)

[Verse 4: Joey Bada$$]
'Bout to drop hot shit, runnin' out of patience, niggas not sick
Rollin' up the dankest loud, plane goin' Mach 6
Rise to the top and topics change
To Glocks and the Stock Exchange
Now watch the price of life on the block drop, insane
You can't stop this reign, don't name-drop in vain
Inhale toxic flames from tropic strains, it's awkward, strange
Last week he was nothin', boxers stain
Now everybody love him and chicks offer top for fame
To the top I aim, testin' waters, so I've been afloat
No deal but flow so real, he been in the scopes
Sun got shine, now they say he shady, but he never dippin' though
Still facin' L's, you would think a nigga wins was low
What you think I'm in this for?
Won't stop 'til the nigga who invented dope
End the flow or behind bars, droppin' prison soap
Beggin' for forgiveness, but it's business though
I'm record spittin' Guinness flows
Got it up in sources, now he in the store

[Outro]

[Intro: Mac Miller & Skyzoo]
Yo, P.A. to B.K
Skyzoo, Easy Mac, Pittsburgh to NYC
I love money, I love money (Yeah)

[?] you take a buck from me, you Doug Funnie (Y'all know what it is)
I said I love money, I love money (Listen, check it, one-two)
You take a buck from me, better duck, dummy (Yo) (What up, Mac?)

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
With my man Skyzoo (Yo,) it's the class clown of his high school
Drown you in typhoons, hittin' you with rhyme too (What's good?)
These haters keep they eyes glued, pound if you my dude (Yo, what up?)
We stay high like Einstein's IQ
And y'all ma'fuckers know where I'm comin from'
Chewin' cats up, like a lil' piece of bubblegum (Bubblegum)
Tryin' double sum's, hustle, wanna let my money run
I ain't even battlin' dude, I'm having fun with 'im (Haha)
Jokes make him feel wrong in his own skin
Sippin' gin from a bin that's makin' my dome spin (Dome spin)
And you the type to try and take from your own kin
Feel it close on your toes, hangin' by clothes pins
I'm spittin blades, Goddamn it, my tooth hurts
A mouth filled with a bunch of cancerous tumors
Yup, music's my baby, I ain't gon' lose her
So I stay with a radio, like Cuba Gooding Junior (You know)

[Scratches]
"Who you think could body me lyrically?"
"In the middle of Alaska I'll write a heater"
"My worst verse hot as your best rhyme, damn"
"The pen game insane"
"Who you think could body me lyrically?"
"In the middle of Alaska I'll write a heater"
"My worst verse hot as your best rhyme, damn"
"The pen game insane"

[Verse 2: Skyzoo]
I'm one drink away from everything you meant to say
Like I think he on the rise to what the kings made
And in the blink of an eye I'm on the king's page
But no album, this is all off of the mixtapes, and
In a different lane, no signs of road rage
'Cause ain't nobody over here to rage wit', there's no gains
No sleep, no retreat, no surrender
No apologies from me, I'm the penner of the penners
I mean what I speak, so if I givin' you a sentence
Then it be's what it be's, nothing hid on the agenda
You leave it up to me, and you can divy up your team
Put your pride in the air and I'm dismembering your members
The heart of the city, the startin' point guard
That can play up to the fall, so the parts is all gone
No room on the bench and I got a no trade clause
So I'm here, long haul, no switchin'

[Scratches]
"Who you think could body me lyrically?"
"In the middle of Alaska I'll write a heater"
"My worst verse hot as your best rhyme, damn"
"The pen game insane"
"Who you think could body me lyrically?"
"In the middle of Alaska I'll write a heater"
"My worst verse hot as your best rhyme, damn"
"The pen game insane"

[Verse 3: Mac Miller]
Yo, look, yo
I rip mics to pieces, cook 'em or eat 'em raw (Raw)
Was bustin' freestyles before I could read at all (Haha)
MCs just call me the monster in their mind
That'll haunt 'em all the time and they thought that if they rhyme
They could make the situation lil' different then the present (What?)
See, I fucked this track, worried that I got it pregnant
I'm haulin' ass, y'all is whack, taking out the garbage, trash
Duckin' from these sharks and crabs, givin' MCs heart attacks
It's your boy Mac, damn, I'm great
And you gets no love like a man with AIDS
I fill you dancin' gays with some hand grenades
Drop bombs, remove your hands and legs
And I pray; dear Lord please give me the strength
Not put these little snakes in the tank 'til they faint
Suffocating, now you choke, you a broke MC
And there ain't nothing left to do but just smoke up your weed like...

[Scratches]
"Who you think could body me lyrically?"
"In the middle of Alaska I'll write a heater"
"My worst verse hot as your best rhyme, damn"
"The pen game insane"
"Who you think could body me lyrically?"
"In the middle of Alaska I'll write a heater"
"My worst verse hot as your best rhyme, damn"
"The pen game insane"

[Intro]
Chin checker, chin checker
Chin checker, I'm the chin checker, nigga

[Verse 1]
It was a quarter past 3 when I ran into Rells
Didn't forget my keys, but my name ring bells
A little white tee, some Adidas with the shells
Turn in the coupe, oh shoot, broke a nail
Lemme lemme think what I gotta gotta do
Should I get the black or the chrome 22?
Cause if a bird try to get out of the cage
One bitch down, New York Times front page
I went to Starbucks, I wanted to get a frappe
Then had a Snapple, apple with the capple
That's Fendi, but that's irrelevant
Threw him a couple Benjis, now I'm the president
I'm Nicki, finicky, so picky
Slick like Ricky, flow be so icky
Now class is finished, you'll be home 'bout 3
Tell all them rap bitches whatchu know 'bout me, nigga

[Hook]
Whatchu know 'bout me, whatchu, whatchu know 'bout me
Whatchu know 'bout me, whatchu, whatchu know
They say that girl is a fool, the girl keep on boppin'
The girl get them girls and them girls get it poppin'
Whatchu know 'bout me, whatchu, whatchu know 'bout me
Whatchu know 'bout me, whatchu, whatchu know
They say that girl gettin' money, a lot of dirty money
I'll show you how to do it if you gettin' something for me

[Verse 2]
Got some nice titties, yes, they wild pretty
That's how I got the S, the five-fifty
That's cause I get, I get, I get busy
That's why I don't need you to come get me (no)
I'm badder than the dude at the Neverland
In the money green coupe with the Leprechaun
Holler at him, get a four-leaf-clover
Go a- go against me, guaranteed you're over
Look, all the kids sweat Nic like a Mexican (mira, mira)
Cause I got more kicks than a temper tan—
Trum-trum-trum, you slowpoke
Better rum, rum, rum a little coke
And-a S-M-I-the-L-E
And ain't one thing them could tell me
Cause I write, write, write my own shit
I'm the one, like I'm the culprit, nigga

[Hook]
Whatchu know 'bout me, whatchu, whatchu know 'bout me
Whatchu know' bout me, whatchu, whatchu know
They say that girl is a fool, the girl keep on boppin'
The girl get them girls and them girls get it poppin'
Whatchu know 'bout me, whatchu, whatchu know 'bout me
Whatchu know 'bout me, whatchu, whatchu know
They say that girl gettin' money, a lot of dirty money
I'll show you how to do it if you gettin' something for me

[Chorus]
I can't control the way I'm movin' my hips
Bet you never ever seen it like this
I'm a monster on the floor, I can't quit
Now, I know, it's automatic, it's automatic

[Verse 1]
It's automatic, I'm a runaway train
And it's likely that I tear up this place
When I go, I go hard
I'mma show you bizarre tonight, tonight (Ni-i-ight)
It's automatic, my condition's unknown
There's no remedy and no antidote
It's just the way that I am
Nicki, Nicki so bad tonight, tonight (Ni-i-ight)

[Chorus]
I can't control the way I'm movin' my hips
Bet you never ever seen it like this
I'm a monster on the floor, I can't quit
Now, I know, it's automatic, it's automatic
It's automatic
It's automatic

[Verse 2]
It's automatic, some might call it insane
I assure you, I'll be stuck on your brain
You'll be falling for me, boy
Yeah, just like a domino tonight, tonight (Ni-i-ight)
It's automatic when I'm rockin' the beat
Systematically, I'm droppin' your heat
It's just the way that I am
Nicki, Nicki so bad tonight, tonight (Ni-i-ight)

[Chorus]
I can't control the way I'm movin' my hips
Bet you never ever seen it like this
I'm a monster on the floor, I can't quit
Now, I know, it's automatic, it's automatic
It's automatic
It's automatic

[Bridge]
Press rewind, p-p-press rewind
It's automatic, I-I'm Einstein
I'm lookin' for that Einstein
Wales, London, Ireland
Scotland, I can idle in
South Africa and Brazil
Shut the club down, bring the bill
Bri-ri-ri-ri-ring the bill
Br-bri-bri-bri-bring the bill
Bri-bri-bring the bill
Shut the club down
Bring the bill

[Chorus]
I can't control the way I'm movin' my hips
Bet you never ever seen it like this
I'm a monster on the floor, I can't quit
Now, I know, it's automatic, it's automatic
It's automatic
It's automatic

[Intro]
South Africa is where I come from
Get me my banjo, get me my drum
Kidnap career, and don't take ransom
Don't let me come out of my dungeon
When mi did ah leave then take it down
True say mi come out of England and it done
True say the pattern come from Kingston
Trinidad, Trinidad, my island

[Verse 1]
I see you in here dancing
Your preview is quite romantic
I envy your perfect kind of life
Who knew you'd be so sexy?
I think you're quite fantastic
Screw your flaws, you're perfect in my eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
And maybe I'm naive for loving you
You're a cheating liar
But tonight, you're everything I desire

[Chorus]
You beautiful sinner
I love your wicked heart
Beautiful sinner
It's such a work of art
I didn't know that bad could look so good
You are the type of bad that feels so good
You beautiful sinner

[Verse 2]
I bet you're hard as stone
Living in your world alone
I hope you let me in tonight
They want me to beware
You're dangerous, but I don't care
I can't wait to have you in my arms

[Pre-Chorus]
And maybe I'm naive for loving you
You're a cheating liar
But tonight, you're everything I desire

[Chorus]
You beautiful sinner
I love your wicked heart
Beautiful sinner
It's such a work of art
I didn't know that bad could look so good
You are the type of bad that feels so good
You beautiful sinner

[Bridge]
Maybe you're the master of disguise
And you are puttin' on and you're really the saint, the good one
Are you here to save me from the crowd?
If you are, then baby, take me now

[Chorus]
Beautiful sinner
I love your wicked heart
Beautiful sinner
It's such a work of art
I didn't know that bad could look so good (Oh, I didn't know)
You are the type of bad that feels so good
You beautiful sinner

[Verse]
T-Killer
Motherfuck a spirit of Hitler
Scared hicka, you rap niggas
I'm master splinter
I turtle-shell niggas
In Harold and Bell, niggas
Eat you like lunch, before the bell
Welcome to hell, niggas
I rock bad bitches
I bed-rock bitches
Tyga IROC like Camaro 87 engines
The back lif' up
Black bat, your car's vision
The roof missing
Snapbacks, no fucking fitteds
My last dinner in a rapper's kitchen
Need a dentist after niggas leave you dental dinning
They call me hall pussy, I'm porky the pig with it
Leave a poker-face face even if a fan can get it
Okay I really got anger
Kids should never talk to strangers
Might get you flat-out hangered on a barb-wire hanger
I'm happy that I'm famous
Not a A-list
I'm ageless
Fresh out gorilla cages
When a train crush your fucking face, bitch
Poppy bangin', no rags just bloody statements
This music saved me, can help you nigga's times wasting
White faces, see me and say my charms racist
The ice layers remind 'em of a lemon cake, mm
Get in line, baby
Limited I'm baby
It's Young Money Hades
Home of the mic rabies
Mic crazy
Tyga man, I'm part Asian
Eyes never lazy
G.E.D-ing on the daily

[Verse 1]
Okay, I walk up in this bitch fresher than a motherfucker
Pocket full of money and my sneakers got blood on them
And bitches I ain't got no love for them
Just a bunch of swagger and a lil bit of drugs for them
Hey hater you can pull the plug on them
'Cause my neck be lightin' up just like a bulb on them
Bling bling, pockets on ching ching
You wifing everything you come across, ring king
Damn, nigga, you going ham, nigga
I fuck your bitch and kick her out like she's Pam nigga
Oh, that's your main ho? Well what you saying, nigga?
She said she you wasn't in the plan nigga
Pockets on bank roll, chain froze
Nigga, we don't even fuck the same hoes
Watching for the coppers in the plain clothes
'Cause I'm riding with a chopper in a Range Rove'

[Chorus]
I'm rolling, I'm rolling, I'm rolling, I'm rolling
With my nigga Takbar, I'm rolling
Bitch I'm rolling, I'm rolling, I'm rolling, I'm rolling
With this motherfucking 'Rari like it's stolen
And still, I'm gon' walk up in this bitch fresher than a motherfucker
Walk up in this bitch fresher than a motherfucker
Pocket full of money and my sneakers got blood on them
And bitches I ain't got no love for them

[Verse 2]
White girls, going wild
I murder that pussy now I'm on a trial
So wet, I need four towels
She sucking dick like she got four mouths
Old ho, she got whore miles
And y'all niggas hating got 4 fouls
Prolly foul out, I prolly wild out
Pull this heat out on you niggas, you'll dime out
Racks, pause on the pork
I be going ham nigga I don't need a fork
Ball so hard nigga I don't need a court
Purple label everything nigga I don't need a horse
I'm swagged out, maxed out
Bad bitch with me and her ass out
Rack up, rack out
And every time I’m in the building I'ma cash out

[Chorus]
I'm rolling, I'm rolling, I'm rolling, I'm rolling
With my nigga Takbar, I'm rolling
Bitch I'm rolling, I'm rolling, I'm rolling, I'm rolling
With this motherfucking 'Rari like it's stolen
And still, I'm gon' walk up in this bitch fresher than a motherfucker
Walk up in this bitch fresher than a motherfucker
Pocket full of money and my sneakers got blood on them
And bitches I ain't got no love for them

[Outro]
I got a bitch in the Bay, I got a bitch in the A
I got a bitch down in Philly that do whatever I say
I got a bitch in New York, I got a bitch MIA
I got a bitch down in Houston she wanna fuck e'ryday
And I be rolling, and she be rolling
She be fucking with the mollies really rolling
And I ain't fucking with the pills but I be rolling
It's ya nigga Meek Mill in this bitch and I'm...
And I roll up looking harder than a....bitch!
Damn a nigga never switch
You should get your cherry bust
Before you fuck around with this!
I buy some Rolexes and pass 'em out as gifts
And when they tell me that's too much
I'm like "No, fuck it, I insist!"
And then we light it up and reminisce
About the things that we would fix
How the fuck we got this rich?
This is just some inspiration
For young niggas on they shit!
This for my young niggas on they shit for real
This also for the hood stars that I created
Whose booking rate went up right after we dated
Girl you made it for real
Hosting parties with athletes or another rapper
Then they trying to fuck you after
Remember when you was my....bitch!?
My special friend with benefits
You remember how you got here?
Hope to God you ain't forget
But the look you're giving me tells me you did
Empty stares across the club
Like y'all don't recognize the kid
But damn, you know what it is
Cameras flashing over here, I know that's something
That you miss, yeah
It been bad, and it gets good
Drizzy Drake and the nigga Tim Westwood

[Intro: Posdnous]
One, two, one, two
A-yo, why we gotta say "one, two, one two"
Right before rhyme, like right before we jump in?
Psst, anyway
A-yo, here's a little something that must be told
About, 3 MC's with so much soul and clout
We here to turn it out
But first hit 'em, with the...

[Verse 1: Posdnous]
A-yo undress your dollar and sleeping with the scholars
In bed with good and bad biz for the quali-
Fication to have gems played on the FM
Sleeping on us is not possible, the metham-
Phetamine flow keep them narcolepts all on go
Green light and no smoking up that green hype
Keep all your thoughts on haze, the backbones for the sound
Well I don't sound back in the days
The Soul's never outdated
Or overexposed or classified as underrated
Though loved by the popular, worthy of the corn
And when the word drops the whole block will warn ya
Told Mac Mill, you 'bout to mack millions
Millions of tweeters follow ya
A million skeezers wanna swallow you whole
Just watch the game and make sure it doesn't swallow your soul

[Chorus: Mac Miller]
Got some soul like De La do, They say I'm new, it's nothin' but some déjà vu
Everywhere you go, these people hate on you
It's déjà vu, déjà vu (One time for the grind)
A little soul like De La do
They say I'm new, nothin' but some déjà vu
Everywhere I go, these people hate on you
Déjà vu, déjà vu

[Verse 2: Raekwon]
I love snowboarding, getting my dick washed, writing graffiti
Out in Whistler with a goose on a beanie
I'm mack iller, me and Mac Miller, we mack for realla
Don't make me go back and jab your gorilla
Smoke mad kush, always in fresh pairs
Favorite kickin' dunks and fresh airs
Coolin' under the trees with trees
You know the kid 4-5-6, dice rollers
Put your bitch on her knees
I'm stuck making paper, yo fuck what you want homie
The streets is hard luck we rolling with sharks only
Wu-Tang, the gang, the clique
Fucking with my favorite white boy will have your head hit a brick
Ayyo, it's Pittsburgh Shaolin, we keeping it realer
Just do the knowledge I'm a Pittsburgh Steeler
The hydrogen and oxygen crew
Body count never read, hear what I said
And let it do what it do

[Chorus: Mac Miller]
Got some soul like De La do
They say I'm new, it's nothin' but some déjà vu
Everywhere you go, these people hate on you
It's déjà vu, déjà vu
A little soul like De La do
They say I'm new, nothin' but some déjà vu
Everywhere I go, these people hate on you
Déjà vu, déjà vu

[Verse 3: Mac Miller]
Me, Pos and Rae and monopoly
Hit the lottery buying clothes losing closet space
Wu-Tang, De La, Most Dope
So cold, know I'm about blow, my flow's cold
Deliver the rapper sounds and bringing back to the golden age
So amazed how I go in focused, I can flow for days
Overcame a load of pain, smoking on that novocaine
Love and hate tend to fluctuate like it's Oprah's weight
Motivated off of loads of hatred, yeah, they mad at me
Game, set, match motherfucker, Mac Agassi
You ain’t in my tax bracket, homie, do work
Rapping as bad as Zack Galifianakis needs two ferns
All I need is some marley lean and the tallest trees
Let my dick show like I'm rocking Tally's jeans
That's something for the homies who won't follow me
Plus I'm on that Wu-Tang rocking these Wallabees
I bomb atomically but you already heard that
Wanna be like Killa in a mink coat and fur hat
Pure rap with a new way to be real
Word to Cypress Hill, new rappers don’t need deals
Fuck a gun bullet spray, my speech kill
Plus my money tall, just to reach it you need stilts
I was a youngin' coming through on a three-wheel
Now, I'm a motherfucking drug, here's a free pill
Go ahead try it out, have you crying loud
X-factor, I'm Simon Cowell, you Private Pal
So kill yourself boy you Vincent D'Onofrio
Full metal jacket bitch lock and load

[Verse]
Yessir!
Aye look, I took my rap money and I went and bought some kilo(s)
4th quarter, tie game, and one for the free throw
Letric bill audemar, lighting up like PEECO
Word to my homies locked, "free my nigga Reek" flow
We go, anywhere I wanna, it's my ego
Jewelry on and off, all I know is ball (ballin)
Glock 4pound'll put your brains on the wall
I'm trynna buy them hammers TIP had, you niggas at the mall
Let me tell you why they hatin', cause they dead pot
Aye weezy tell them niggas kill they self, head shot
Fred Flintstone ya bitch, I make her fuckin' bed rock
So much ice up in my Breitling made my fucking band pop
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe, pick a fucking rapper out
And I bet they ain't in to half that shit they say or rap about
I be really into that, flowing with my rachet out
Every time I'm in the club, know we bring them ladders out (ladders)
Don't you hate a rapping nigga screaming he ain't gotta rap?
Spitting all that bullshit you spiitin, (tsk) gotta trap
Watching for them boys in the khakis and the alphabet
Cause they don't wanna see a young nigga make it out the jack
Out the hood, out for good, hating nigga I been good
The coupe like the Bat Mobile, my bitch playin Robin Hood
Kobe told me "get 'em" and I told him that "I got 'em good"
You ain't never been there bitch, why you actin' hollywood?
Kerosene heater flow, swagger on a milli'n (swagger)
Every time I'm on some shit they be like "you killin' 'em"
He said I ain't on that shit, Black Eyed Peas "well Will I am"
5 percent on everything so you don't see what wheel I'm in
Or you don't see what bitch I got
Ice up in my wrist and watch
I'mma cloud hopper, prolly take me to the top
Drama, take me to my Glock so I can get strapper
And I be with that white boy, fucking with that Casper
Laughter, cause I can play around and shout you niggas down
Lawnmower with that semi, cut you niggas down, buck you niggas down
"Who you be with??" Talk about about me, when you see me it's the remix!
I said I'm fly as fuck, get that purple, light it up
Think it's sweet then try your luck. Need a murder? Hire us
Shooters, they always on deck. Just waitn' to fire up
Send them at you niggas, they gon' listen like I'm wired up
Tell that ho to get a grip, "bitch go pick them pliers up"
Catch me in an SRT, coolin burn them tires up
We banging that Flamerz 3, shut 'em down and light 'em up
I hear you niggas got that work, we call ya phone and line you up
Cash rules everything around me, and near me
Tell them hoes I don't do singles, they can share me
I don't wanna talk or do business if you scary
Lil niggas shoulda never watched Tom and Jerry (rat!)
Break a brick down, cop a whip, get my jewels up
Pay a couple bills, lay low, and then a crew cut
Catch me in the vip popping bottles with my tool tucked
Hating ass niggas make me sick, fuck my mood up
Swagger on a million, billion, trillion
Somewhere on an island like Gillagen
Wrist wear, lookin' like it's made from Jack & Jill and 'em
Whole band bust down, big rocks, killin em
My city I'm bigger than the mayor is
Ask the streets, say I'm everything I say I'm is
I went to jail, came back like A.I. did
And put my city on the map real rap! (Mr. Philadelphia)

[Verse 1: Tyga]
Rollin' with my "yeah so?" hat to the back
Oh, you ain't heard 'round town? Young nigga strapped
Well Mike, if you lose your life it's no coming back
I've seen lots of lies fake smiles behind my back
Bitch check your chitter-chat
Bruise blues and black
Never trust a loud-mouth, mama taught me that
Don't live the lifestyle, son, if you can't pay for that
But shit you got to spend the money to get money back
And I hurry to the cash, pictures snap
Sirens flash, fuck an officer with a badge
Let's see your license motherfucker that I don't have
Not even half of these niggas have had half of what I had
But I still wish that

[Hook]
If I can leave this place, and just get away
I want to get away (get away)
But I know I see better days
Better days
Better days

[Verse 2: Tyga]
After last weekend, I heard some nigga speaking
About some Tyga beef shit
Like oh, when I see him
I live a landslide occur when deers run
By in herds, bitches tweakin'
Forgetting the seasons
Lames not in my lane
Got heat for little Heathens
I rise over them like Christ in A.D
It's a prayer visual as I murder the spiritual
Walking in hell's kitchen
Slow bitches standing on they tippy-toes
Sounds like what great things should sound like
Tyga fly though with no kite, vanilla sky
Don't need a mask this is my disguise
Her eyes saying color is mine
I done seen water cry

[Hook]
If I can leave this place, and just get away
I want to get away (get away)
But I know I see better days
Better days
Better days

[Verse 3: Gudda Gudda]
Yeah, I'm in search for a better day
I put my mind in the clouds and try and get away
And I know I don't talk to the Lord much
Cause my mind racing thoughts moving like a tour bus
And niggas hatin', I try not to endure such
Cause the only thing I fear is me and the Lord trust
Everything I speak about, I really mean it nigga
I'm on my hustle I'm a Young Money greedy nigga
Believe it, nigga
It's a light at the end of the tunnel
If you don't see it take the scenic, nigga
I remember being broke on several days
Now I'm living out my dreams
Better days

[Hook]
If I can leave this place, and just get away
I want to get away (get away)
But I know I see better days
Better days
Better days

[Intro]
Many niggas gonna see I'm a G
Bet you bitches gon' remember me

[Verse 1]
Needs no muthafuckin' intro
As I walk with the swagga like I'm 6'4
Skinny nigga doe
Fresh like Mentos
Look at me real close
Rap nigga been in Vogue, ha
But I neva pose but I make hoes, Marilyne Monroe
Strip down, no clothes
Bring it back like six fo' Nintendo's
Blow! On my holy O' catch the holy ghost
Damn! Listen to the sound, metal rounds
Never play around
Kid, I'm no playground
Niggas puppy chow, eatin' with they face down
Niggas try to tell, one shot kill
Now who you gon' tell, nigga?

[Hook]
When the night comes and the sun falls
Bet you bitches gon' remember me
So turn the lights off then turn the lights on
Then you niggas gon' see I'm a G

[Verse 2]
I feel badder like I'm leather on Jackson
Red Devil Porche turn, sex on the beach burns
You can smell it like incense in the air
Air, I pronounce wor' and announce world
Like I'm teachers through yo speakers
You fuckin' with a Tiger, bite through first
Burberry hair, bird bath, blood now
It's a vampire shirt
Cough and cemetery the verse
Flow so sick that it hurts
Truth be told, wardrobe like movie clothes
My life front row and you sittin' too close

[Hook]
When the night comes and the sun falls
Bet you bitches gon' remember me
So turn the lights off then turn the lights on
Then you niggas gon' see I'm a G

[Verse 3]
Floss gettin' em like Denis where I'm from
Kick-backs ain't fun, when you gettin' kicked up
Sorry I got temper, hotter than magenta
Flame color menstrual, period, Redrum
Better pray like Nuns cause you don't want none
Buck! Buck! Two at pedestrians
I don't give a fuck, straight shit on a bum
What's up? My mind like a lugnut, don't fucking screw up!

[Hook]
When the night comes and the sun falls
Bet you bitches gon' remember me
So turn the lights off then turn the lights on
Then you niggas gon' see I'm a G

[Intro]
Fuckin' with the G code, money on the street, hoe
I just need a freak hoe, shout out to Sunny Diamonds

[Verse]
Young Lanez ridin' in the one lane
See you broke niggas ridin' on the one train
And all you rap niggas lookin' like a gun range
Fuck niggas wanna be the entree
Call up the kid side
Holla at a bitch, don't block like Chris Bosh
She can turn me down, don't talk that pish posh
Fly nigga here and they're like inside
I need the money A$AP Rocky
Before the money, Lanez act cocky
She wanna fuck a rap star nigga
Act hard like you ball, where your black card, nigga?

Come from the dot, kid flexin'
Phone check, this ill na na bitch textin'
No sweats if the Minaj gets naked
I was wet when I'm inside of the section
Niggas got 2 ex hoes, it's too stressful
Now a nigga flyer than a UFO
You be on the dick, let the truth get told
You can see my picture in the new Ecko
Ballin' niggas stunnin', hundred thousand in abundance
Honies love me 'cause this money but they act like it's because me
I'm a motherfuckin' essence, address me as the lesson
She interrupt my speech, she said she got a question
Like, "Why them bitches all up in your knapsack?"
Same reasons why you gotta fix your tracks back
Try to comb it out, girl, better scratch that
Forget about your weave, go and wear your snapback
Fly like woah
If I'm on the plane, gotta see me on top where the highlights go
Money here lookin' like a tide die, bro
I got a goldfish but it might die though
They don't have shit to do to have a nigga doodoo
All motherfuckers with a charm like voodoo
Ridin' in the coupe
And nigga jewels just fruity like some Fruit Loops, high, a nigga poof
SLS, countin' 100s, 100s
I let my bitch keep the 20s, 20s
I ain't frontin' 'cause a nigga got plenty
And gotta save me a dollar for Mellacar and Denny's
I'm wildin' out with the Bentley, smile out in the friendly
These niggas is hatin' on me, I'm hidin' out with the semi
Them bitches wanna holla, them bitches them niggas envy
Even in the Apolla, these niggas goin' think I'm heavy
Motherfuckers, I got your bitch, I don't trust her
Hell no, I never loved her, but she a dog
And the only thing that be missin' is the mustard
But we got Mustard on the beat, hoe

[Outro]
Yeah, I got your bitches in my knapsack
Sincerely Tory, March 26th, motherfuckers, go get that
Canada

[Intro]

Turn your body into switchelay
Fuck, don't hate, get a bitch billet
Lame niggas, you got a bitch to pay
I'm in shade, I lay it down
Say the words and they spray the round
Price tag up on the top
Guarantee to lay it down
I got more, I got more
Bad bitch like I got two
Nigga rhymes like auto-tune
On the table like I got you
Ridin' round and I'm gettin' it
Flyin' down when I'm hittin' it
Let me loose when I'll be on the Goose
Like a loose tooth, I don't spent it
Man I fucked your chick and I mean it
Yeah hit the bird, I'm badmittin' it
And they start strug, they they in it
And they class ,the foe be like ignant
I'm on websites, Mozilla, how to describe my money flow
Big green Godzilla, now to find I got 100 hoes
I'm TO 'til the death of me, real niggas, I'm the recipe
Big sister named Destiny, y'all bitch niggas ain't stressin' me
Shout out my nigga old dizzy, I got 450 and the hoes with me
In the Porsche ridin', she so with me
And the Jag boys, they so iffy, in the jet boys so they so iffy
I'm fuckin' hoes, I'm so tipsy, hustle hustle, I'm so Nipsy
Give me back low hand, like baby, get so lazy
Spicy with that see-saw, I ain't fuck, that's T's fault
All y'all niggas plain as fuck, but damn nigga, that's D's fault
Man, was that a subliminal nigga
Be hatin' the way that the paper been makin' like damn
Niggas invisible, help me, can see 'em
That nigga been keepin' everyone like man
Y'all should be waitin' for Sincerely Tory
I'm makin' my way so you don't work again
Gettin' this paper, I say fuck your man
Hold up, hold up, hold up and that money
Longer than a fuckin' fruit roll up
I'm a G, don't know what the F you see
Niggas told your man I'm ridin' in somethin' swavey
Look like a armerillo shell on your back
Gon' make you look like an armadillo
Lookin' like black and yellow, bitch nigga I'm a stiller
Nigga say they for real, my niggas they gorilla

[Interlude]
I'm gone, yo Cliff, I can't answer your phone, hold up

[Verse 2]
How do I need a two seater new need her
You fallin' in love with as soon as you need to
You hatin', I'm makin' this paper
You either get paper with me or you hatin' what we do
My niggas is cakin', makin' history
And make 'em Jamaican they way they be grindin'
Lame ass niggas be wastin' me time
Holdin' a pistol like aim with your mind
Fuck around with it, put niggas in line
And we gettin' them digits from bitches, it's mine
Me and my niggas from TO so shout out my vito
We keeped it on D low
My ego is bigger than me though, my nigga
My cheeto, we eatin', we jammin' that P
'Cause tell your bitch be quiet

[Outro]
And tell your motherfuckin' bitch shut up and be quiet, my nigga
Naw, I'm so serious, tell my bitches to shut up and be quiet before I come out the bullshit
My nigga, that's the last of the moterfuckin' deaf Warner brothers forever, nigga
It's Canada on your bitch ass
Swaved out 'til the motherfuckin' face out
And I'ma kill your bitch 'til I have to dig her grave out, you feel me?
Sunny D, what's poppin' my G?

[Verse 1: Tyga]
First of all I ain't feeling y’all
Feel the fucking heat defrost
Fill the spoon full of food
Ain't enough to feed the room
I don’t have to goon, twizla boy split you to
Cherry red Rover roof
Crips to confuse you
You can say I blue’s you
Better than I bruised you
All you niggas copycats doing shit I used to
Oh you tatted too, nigga fuck you
My bitch ain't got no tatts I hit her from the back
I spend south of France all that other shit is wack
Sling shot it in the ear than I let the shit collapse
Money is my pet peeve, give me hourly
If there is none at all, than I’m pissed off
I listen to Rick Ross and I know Ricky Ross
I’m Leonardo in Inception, reserve my section
I do dreams put you in a bubble, benz or Lexus
I Will Smith the necklace, I do it effortless
Bitch all eyes on me
The future’s in my eyes
Bitches, bitches bring lies
One nigga jealous than the muthafucker dies
Figure you ain't scary if you did the crime
Now prepare its dinnertime
Dimmer the lights, lemon with ice
Look it at twice its fizzling sprite
Brown do the belly nice
No coca cola, I don’t drink soda
Black beenie nigga, like a fucking smoker
They say I’m bout to blow up like super nova
Put your helmet on, the bulldozing dopest
How you shitting on ‘em and ain't got shit on ‘em
It kills me to know it, you Melanie Fiona
Ohhh, remove yourself from my scrotum
Ohhh, remove yourself, remove yourself
Ohhh, remove yourself from my scrotum
Pull your whole car I thought I told you

We can have discussions while we are playing wii

[Verse]
If I could take the time back, I would rewind back
The day my cousin asked my gran where his mom at
I want my aunt back and my dad too
They killed Shawty and Diddy that was sad too
I cut a couple homies off, shit I had to
Changed on me for the money, look what cash do
Thinking I’m rich, counting my money
Worrying bout mine, they should be counting it for me
I’m just adding up this paper subtracting my homies
Shawty be screaming how she love me, while bouncing it on me
She really don’t like me, she just attracted to money
She chasing the benjys, so that don’t offend me
Im just loading up my Glock, hoping that it defend me
When them haters try to kill me I’m clapping the semi
She giving me head, I’m grabbing her Remy
I just wanna B, like the back of the Bentley
Niggas say I’m Hollywood when I’m Hollyhood
Put my life on the line for them, shit I probably would
Switch that to probably woulda, They wit me probably coulda
Put'em on probably shoulda, but ain’t nobody realer
Niggas is so fake, I did my ID check
Kept It A Hunnit Wit Me ?, ain't met nobody yet
I treat them like the beat, cuz ima body that
Moving throughout these streets, that’s where you find me at
I ain’t gonna lie ----- saved my life
But you ain't gon be running round, like you made my life
I ain’t met a bitch yet, I would’ve made my wife
And I ain’t met a nigga yet I would’ve made my right
Hand, damn, never take the stand
Never tell them boys information on your fam
Never tell them niggas information where you stayin
Cuz they change like the weather, when you wake they're where you land
With that hammer in your face, askin for the cake
Ever seen one of your dogs transform into a snake
Ever seen one of them snakes transform into a rat
I be running through the jungle I could tell you bout that
I could tell you bout the drought, when the work got snapped
Whole hood started robbing, everybody got strapped
Whole team just was broke, everybody got back
I was selling Sour Diesel, everybody got crack
It’s obvious I’m hot, it’s obvious you cold
Presidential on my wrist, and it’s obvious its gold
Whole hood got your statements it’s obvious you told
Like a Lil Wayne album it’s obvious you sold
I’m on some shit, running neck and neck with Vick
Trying to bring my city back, take us to where we never been
I’m just in the studio working like a Mexican
And they tell me I’m a rookie doing it like a veteran
Yea, big dreams small city
Trying to come up on me, but would you fall with me?
Would you clutch that hammer and bust it off with me?
Hundred miles an hour running from the law with me?
I ain’t think so, I just blink slow
Million ways to get this money but we think snow
Every time I see a chick I just think ho
And every time I meet a nigga I just think Po’
Alpo ass niggas!
Moment for life, for life
I'mma keep it real for life
And I'mma keep getting money, fuckin' bitches for life, for life, for life
Yeah, yeah!

[Intro: Curren$y]
Set, where haven't we been yet
Jet Set, where haven't we been yet
Jet Set, where haven't we been yet
Jet Set, where haven't we been yet

[Hook]
Getting money all over the world, all over the world
(Toronto and Amsterdam, Brazil,Paris, France and Japan
Anything for the grands, yea)
Getting money all over the world, all over the world
(Germany to Italy, North South Pole, anywhere in between, anything for the green)

[Verse 1: Curren$y]
Spitta, spend yen on bape
Red carpet, yo bitch my date
She throwin' the Jets in every pic we take
I upload em with a song on Nah Right today
Those niggas is not like the planes
Them hoes don't digg em, they tryna' get on my team
And how can you blame, she know self preservation
The first rule, she know she'd die of boredom if she with you
While I'm sitting poolside looking real cool
With a Grape flavored 50 cent juice
Paid for one, the corner store lady gimme two
Nigga thats love, thats what I live on
Right before take off, twitter from the cell phone
Another show rock, more money got word to Chris and Neef
Can't stop won't stop, yea

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
C'mon, I go straight where the cash is
Heard about your last date being tragic
I know, my last tape was a classic
So all I hear now is paper or plastic?
Few Rosays, now you drunk saying boy
"why you in my face and you only want one thing?"
You wasting your time fucking lames
Only 2 things poppin, thats Jet Set and The Gang
Eating sushi, few groupies, new clothes and left over room keys
I want my good girl to smoke weed and love playing Nintendo Wii
And I got pictures in my cell phone, iChat
When I'm gone, land somewhere calling home
Put me right up where the best at
Nigga we Jet Set, so where haven't we been yet?
Yes

[Hook]

[Intro]
Smoking fucking thanksgiving turkey bags man
Surgical procedures
Ben Johnson
You already know

[Verse 1: Action Bronson]
Sign my name with the feather, tap dance under the full moon
Smoke and drinking liquor for the fam that left us too soon
Just keep it truckin', searching all the nooks and crannies
No english muffin, streets are filled with crooks and trannies
Bam bam got a shooter like Lagassee
Emerald green paper that I split up with my posse
One hand driving, 3 gram smoking
2 fiend sucking, tea bag soaking
Strength of a retard the drugs are even stronger
Shorty loved the longitude, dealer bring a quarter through
Over fishing make the snapper less affordable
I hate when stupid bitches ask me questions that's rhetorical
Like "do you want to have sex?", well bitch, it's obvious
Her name was Jeta from the former Yugoslavia
She grew a bush like a baby plant
Still I ate it, just think of it as bucatin' and razor clams
Smuggle cheeses in a baby bag
And then I serve at a private tasting
I got no time for wasting
Just dick is placed in the slit no type of conversation
And prime rib from LaFrieda carved at the blablablabla
Fuck, fucked my last word up cause I don't give a shit man
I meant to say prime rib carved at the fucking carving station but yo

[Verse 2: Action Bronson]
Yo my mind is locked up, my conscious rocked up
In an alley with a fiend getting his cock sucked
Plus she wearing a wedding dress a special day
She said she finally met a… Fuck
Yo, my mind is locked up, my conscious rocked up
In an alley with a fiend getting his cock sucked
And she wearing a wedding dress, a special day
She said she finally met a man to take her breath away
Well naturally I'm jealous, because I'm lonely
At times my only friends in life are drugs and the cannoli
My dad was right I shoulda listened when he told me
A walking contradiction wounds inflicted on me solely
Pain within running deeper than the ocean floor
Ocean-Bluh bluh bluh bluh bluh bluh yo
Pain within running deeper than the ocean floor
Ocean avenue, the family straight from Kosovo
That was years ago mum look how your son has bloomed
I hum a tune and then I'm hotter than the sun in June
And I'm just living my life but feel I'm drifting
Demons on the doorstep, lungs that feel constricted
Or maybe I should see a shrink and get prescripted
Or take the hand of God but shit I think i'll keep my distance
I think I'm frightened and I didn't even know it
But yo, that was a thought and I'm subconsciously a poet
It's perfect timing and I hope that I don't blow it
I pop the bottle of the moet, yo here's to me

[Bridge: Big Body Bes]

[Verse 3: Action Bronson]
Late nights I'm trying to stay up out of the orange skips
Great white sharks, the .38 with tarnished tip
27 years I never met an honest bitch
Slice their faces like Kitana and shit
Through my nasal blow the smoke
Basil on the boat
Hookers on the half shell, hundred dollar pants
Wind breaker jacket flapping like a falcon from a westward wind
Play the kitchen like a mexican, next of kin
Patrick Swayze… We out!

[Outro]

Scarface, all out, a-a-all I want in this world
I mean all I want for lunch, is a blunt, and your girl
It ain't nothin' to me but it's somethin' to you
Count money like it's somethin' to do
Summertime, I'm like, "Fuck the roof", winter time, I'm in 'Lo boots
And uh, it's nothin', I like bein' high because it's a better view
And, I told your ho my chain so cold, it's on Theraflu, uh

Mexicans, send 'em back over the border
Ride on home to Samoa
Or wherever they come from
They're takin' our jobs
Eatin' our hamburgers
Takin' our jobs
They takin' our jobs!
I see them in the field
I'm takin' their head off
I hate my job
And I hate my boss
But I love my country

[Bridge]
And I pray to God
That the Cowboys win
Fuck yeah Romo!
And the Cowboys win
That's right, that's right, that's right
C'mon, everybody
Just clap your hands
If you love our country
If you love our land
That's right
And if you're not clapping your hands
You're a terrorist
And you eat sand (sandwiches)

[Hook]
The day Bin Laden comes to town
I'mma drop a deuce
Wipe my poop with his towel
Mow my lawn
Sit on the couch
And I'mma watch some football
And I pray to the lord the Cowboys win
And beat the hell outta them damn Redskins
Call up the boys
Get drunk as shit
God damn right I'm American

[Verse 2]
I'm Ameri-fuckin-can
And John McCain and Sarah Palin
I know you lost out there
It was a tough one
But you're still two mavericks in my book
Don't worry about it
And listen Palin
I heard you like beer, me too
I don't have a 6 pack
But I got a beer bong in my pants
What do ya' say we go get shit faced
In a helicopter and kill a moose
America, the chosen, guns, explosions, McDonald's, bowling
You don't like it? We exploit you!
Pop a pill, get a boner!
Hell yeah
Tony Romo
Man that guy is so damn cute
I wanna sack his boner
And ride him broke back
All the way to Wyoming
No homo, sike!
Hey I said no homo
Fuck terrorists!
I mean like, I don't wanna fuck a terrorist
Guys I'm kidding!
I like Romo
I don't "like" Romo
I said, "Fuck terrorists"
Not, "I wanna fuck a terrorist"
You wouldn't? if you caught Bin Laden
You wouldn't give him one in the butt?
For America?
If you said "no homo" right after you did it?
It doesn't count if it's terrorists

[Bridge]
Hey little Aberdeen
Come in here
Yeah?
Hey come sing the national family anthem
Come on
USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA!
Hey hey!
USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA!
Hey hey!

[Outro]
That's right
I'm an American citizen
Aberdeen Washington
This is my country
And just because Barack Obama
Won the presidential election
Does not mean that half the country
Doesn't feel the same way I do
Man I came to America (yeah)
And I live in America (c'mon)
And I live in America

Lemme get em
And I live in America
Dad and I live in America
Shut up!
Little Aberdeen shut the fuck up!
My bad
Lemme tell 'em
That's right
I'm American

[Intro]
It's love, we just caught in the moment
Swavey, baby, yeah

[Verse 1]
Say you're frustrated, baby
Your main game, you do it right
I get so impatient, baby
Thinkin' 'bout you tonightt
Cock it back and lay your body on me
Squeeze like
I love it when you get trigger happy
With me tonight
I do what you want, girl
Yeah, you gon' be my tiger
And leave a lil some, girl
You know, you gotta do this

[Pre-Chorus]
I scream for you
Promise we'll be alright
Tonight you

[Chorus]
Bang like a shotgun
Bang, cock it low, cock it back, let it blow
Bang like a shotgun
Bang, cock it low, cock it back, let it blow

[Verse 2]
You say you're home waitin', baby
Shawty, please don't get me started now
I'm Mother Nature's baby
Get the key to my car and start it up
Load it, load it, load it, load it
So fast that we don't know where we are
I'll be there in a moment
You know everythin' I'm down for
Girl, we can do it where the wind blows
We can do it with your head up out the window
Anyway you like it, baby
I wanna make you scream
Oh, I wanna you scream
Oh, wanna make you shout

[Pre-Chorus]
I scream for you
Promise we'll be alright
Tonight you

[Chorus]
Bang like a shotgun
Bang, cock it low, cock it back, let it blow
Bang like a shotgun
Bang, cock it low, cock it back, let it blow
Bang, cock it low, cock it back, let it blow
Bang, cock it low, cock it back, let it blow

[Verse 1]
My life's these yellow lines, concrete, and parliament butts
Exhaust fumes and rest stops who drive hard for their bucks
Load in, sound check, play show, load out, let's go, next city, oh great, off day
Hangovers, hangups, dialbacks, running make up, apologies and promises
And nobody acknowledges that boys in bands got it so damn bad
But we love like the last cigarette we'll ever have
I'm putting miles on my body, bout due for a tune up and this gas station food ain't really helping but
I'm loving every minute, every road sign's a reminder of exactly why we did it to begin with

[Hook: William Beckett]
This is how it has to be
A kiss for luck, submerge myself
And in 7 weeks resurface
Even if we don't look back again
Tired boys and wired eyes
Exposing imperfections
To the public eye we're perfect
Even if we don't look back again

[Verse 2]
I like these hotels, passports, random bag checks, day dreams of love affairs that I haven't had yet
Touch down, baggage claim, new town, different dame, same clothes, 7 days, whew, damn I need to change
And it's a lifestyle that I wouldn't recommend
Wild 'N Out on a level Nick Cannon couldn't comprehend (fuck outta here)
We made a lot of friends and even more enemies
Some of which were genuine and others just pretend to be
It's all gravy baby, life's lovely
Even when the gray rain cloud's right above me
The girl's textin' me talkin' about gettin' all cuddly
Cause you paint a pretty picture but the frame is so ugly

[Hook: William Beckett]
This is how it has to be
A kiss for luck, submerge myself
And in 7 weeks resurface
Even if we don't look back again
Tired boys and wired eyes
Exposing imperfections
To the public eye we're perfect
Even if we don't look back again

[Verse 3]
And now it's back in a van with four of my mans
Until we catchin' a tan on the Florida sands
I feel like tourin' this land's made me more of a man
From killa California to the shores of Japan
Good times stayin' up late in Austin
Coast to coast VA to Chicago
To gettin' up with Johnny Cupcakes in Boston
And smokin' the most grade A in Colorado
Home ain't home no more
I hug the road and kiss the concrete and sometimes I even hear her heartbeat
No matter where we go or where we at
We carry upstate on our back, it's like that

[Hook: William Beckett x2]
This is how it has to be
A kiss for luck, submerge myself
And in 7 weeks resurface
Even if we don't look back again
Tired boys and wired eyes
Exposing imperfections
To the public eye we're perfect
Even if we don't look back again
This is how it has to be
A kiss for luck, submerge myself
And in 7 weeks resurface
Even if we don't look back again
Tired boys and wired eyes
Exposing imperfections
To the public eye we're perfect
Even if we don't look back again

[Outro]
"So a lot of you don't realize
There's a whole subculture of boys driving around in vans."
Even if we don't look back again
"Looking for your daughters, and your lottery tickets. Love it or leave it. I'm like this"
Even if we don't look back again
"I love my life. Bitches."
Even if we don't look back again
Even if we don't look back again

[Verse 1]
She's like a diamond in the rough, she's my passion
Supernova, the brightest star, the main attraction
Only she motivates my heart to beat like it's racing
So I put her up on a pedestal, all up under her like a basement, but I wonder if she notice me

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, that girl I see ya
And baby, I promise I will make you a believer tonight
This is an introduction, to your seduction
I promise you'll be alright

[Chorus]
You are, you're treating me like I'm see through
Just like I'm see through, my heart breaks like I'm made of glass
Girl, you are, you're treating me like I'm see through
Just like I'm see through, just want the adrenaline back

[Verse 2]
My desire, infrared on you, all I see is fire
And I just want to cool it down, baby, just hear me out, I think that she's looking right now
Baby, all I wanna do is save you and if this is a dream, don't wanna wake up
From there, come here, can you hear me? Can you see me, my dear?

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, that girl I see ya
And baby, I promise I will make you a believer tonight
This is an introduction, to your seduction
I promise you'll be alright (Yeah)

[Chorus]
You are, you're treating me like I'm see through
Just like I'm see through, my heart breaks like I'm made of glass (Ow!)
Girl, you are (Are), you're treating me like I'm see through (V.A., haha)
Just like I'm see through, just want the adrenaline back (Look, can't see me, what?)

[Verse 3]
What I gotta do for you to notice me?
I'm Breezy, ain't nobody cold as me
With all this ice on, I'm supposed to freeze
But I put that fur on, call me polar beast, yeah
E-A-R, she play hard
Worship her, she should play God
Fresh cut, I'm a king, call me Caesar
Need to listen up, H-E-A-R, ha
I could've picked her
But a nigga really wanted you
Only had one whip first
But fuck it, I don't mean to curse, now I got a few
A couple cribs, some bangin' views
The only thing missin' is me and you
And while I swim in, you could see the pool
But I live in glass house, I'm see through, ha

[Chorus]
You are, you're treating me like I'm see through
Just like I'm see through, my heart breaks like I'm made of glass
Girl, you are, you're treating me like I'm see through
Just like I'm see through, just want the adrenaline back

[Verse 3]
Fuck y'all, I come hard (Uh)
Like SpongeBob, my friends stars (Uh)
Like Friendster, nobody going to remember you (Woo!)
Whack dudes, they like you, but only for a day or two
They hated you from now on, like D-Money
Like Faison, I hate on that
Lame song they play on, that play on (Get 'em, get 'em, get 'em)
I can't take, royalty
On my shit, on my dick
I can't wait
Toe to toe, I bang shit (Uh)
Homophobes on gay shit (Uh)
You don't know the hoes I hang with
My bungalow's like Vegas
Had a couple million but I put them in her stomach (Ayy)
She like, "Oh my God, I'm coming" (Hehe)
I kiss her neck and she love it (Uh)
Yeah we got a safe word (Safe word), but we never use it
Man, I'm hidin' all these bruises (Bruises)
In a shirt I got from Houston (Houston)
Got her usin' the acoustics

[Intro]
(Smokin' weed with you
'Cause you’ve taught me to
Smokin' weed with you
'Cause you’ve taught me to)

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre & Kendrick Lamar]
Every morning when I wake up, uh
Money on my mind, good time to get caked up, uh
Sunshine coming through my blinds, I’m living, but
Really though, it's never enough, ten million, that's a must
Living in California, everybody wanna visit for
Women, weed and weather
They come for women, weed and weather
For the women, weed and weather
From all around the world for the women, weed and weather
These niggas'll kill for that, put it in your grill for that
Still everybody gotta build for that, me? I make mills off that
How the fuck y'all can't see I ride, when I drive
Down the block and you look outside
H-A-T-E in your eyes, I enter big money for the enterprise
It's a beautiful day, I guess, for a bitch to roll with Andre, I guess
Roll it up, baby, come and lift that dress
Then roll it up for me when I'm stressed

[Pre-Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
You might catch me in Atlanta looking like a boss
New Orleans and then Miami, party in New York
Texas, I be screwed up, Chi-Town, I be really pimpin'
But nothing like my hometown, I'm forever livin'

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar & Dr. Dre]
Women, weed and weather
They come for women, weed and weather
For the women, weed and weather
From all around the world for the women, weed and weather
Got that women, weed and weather
Don't it sound clever? Come and play
Wh-what more can I say? W-welcome to LA

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Uhh, my nigga said he wanna fly out to get him some
Three W's only for a three-day run, bitch
Take them mothafuckin' panties off, you ain't no nun, shit
I be living in the sky every time I ride by them hoes
"Ribbon In The Sky" on the radio 'cause Stevie know I control
Let it breathe, I control, California living 'til I am old
You want to be on to peak on the charts
So the peons can be gone and pee on their hearts
She in the coupe, she in the Neon
'Cause she on the BS before we can start
Fuck with a nigga, ride with a nigga
Let 'em know I'm priority, order me
Hennessy and, for my niggas, OG Killa
Call it Jason Voorhees, boy, he's on his job
Boy, he sure be having the marks on they mark
Pretty bitches and tire marks, let 'em inhale them pipe exhausts
Let 'em reveal how much it cost for this life, controlling my price?
No way, hell no, uh-uh
If I'm wrong, I don't wanna be right
We want to be on to peak on the charts
So the peons can be gone and pee on their hearts
Women, weed, weather, it's not my fault
That it's 82 degrees and my top peeled off

[Pre-Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
You might catch me in Atlanta looking like a boss
New Orleans and then Miami, party in New York
Texas, I be screwed up, Chi-Town, I be really pimpin'
But nothing like my hometown, I'm forever livin'

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar & Dr. Dre]
Women, weed and weather
They come for women, weed and weather
For the women, weed and weather
From all around the world for the women, weed and weather
Got that women, weed and weather
Don't it sound clever? Come and play
Wh-what more can I say? W-welcome to LA

[Verse 3: Dr. Dre]
Known for that homegrown where I come from
Smoke one, palm trees, double D's got 'em topless in the sun
I shall proceed, that's me, mothafuck your opinion
Huh, how many ways am I killing 'em? Shit, right around a billion
We on it, that mean we living for the moment
That mean she'll fuck 'til the morning, time and I got time
And I know that I'm in a position of controlling
Anything out by that ocean
I'm a boss, I'll buy that ocean, ain't nobody fucking with this

[Verse 4: Kendrick Lamar]
They want that shit, they often fiend
I give it to 'em, but in between
My time, I gotta tie shoestrings
Life's a trip when you want these things
I often slip and then I lean
Toward three W's in life
You know blow job need an application
Eating pussy make appetite
And yeah, my type, I like 'em brown
Just like my drink, the fuck you think?
I don't fuck with no hand-me-downs
See if you fuck, then it's after me
You know how much I'ma make it work?
You know her dress livin' in her purse
When you discuss your love for lust
Just make sure you visit here first: Cali

[Pre-Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
You might catch me in Atlanta looking like a boss
New Orleans and then Miami, party in New York
Texas, I be screwed up, Chi-Town, I be really pimpin'
But nothing like my hometown, I'm forever livin'

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar & Dr. Dre]
Women, weed and weather
They come for women, weed and weather
For the women, weed and weather
From all around the world for the women, weed and weather
Got that women, weed and weather
Don't it sound clever? Come and play
Wh-what more can I say? W-welcome to LA

[Outro]
(Smokin' weed with you
In the leaves, in the fall
I smoke with you
'Cause you’ve taught me to
Smokin' weed with you
In the leaves, in the fall
I smoke with you
'Cause you’ve taught me to
Smokin' weed with you
'Cause you’ve taught me to
Smokin' weed with you

Smokin' weed with you)

[Intro]
Hey, I know shit get kinda fucked up some times, you know
I know you can get carried away with yourself
But uh, why don't you be real with me
And be real with you at the same time?
You can't get what you get here nowhere else ma
Keep it real now

[Hook]
You know, you love
Bitch you know you love this life
Don't nobody do you like me
You know, you love
Bitch you know you love this life
Don't nobody do you like me
You know

[Verse 1]
Cavalli dress and high heels
And drop tops on hot wheels
We live how we wanna live cos we got mills
Them other niggas barely buy a hot meal
In VIP dem bottle popping do it B.I.G
Come get with T.I.P and be balling til you D.I.E
Invisible set bracelets see clearly
Take away your stress, mean that sincerely
Problem solve‘em, never mind that
Girlfriends see your bag, be like where you find that?
Plus, what the fuck's a prenup? You ain't gotta sign that
You nut up, take half, I'ma make it right back
I'm a motherfucking hustler to the heart, what's the
Sense in leaving me and be back fucking with them busters?
Bentley for your birthday, Goyard purse day
Filled with them stacks you know you gotta love that

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Man of respect, on a big jet
With a big dick and a big check
I pop big shit I'm good as it gets
You leave me, where else you think you can get this?
Girl you can get another guy to beat that pussy for you
Them niggas cowards though and I'd take a bullet for you
Mansions, jewelry, all I need's for you and me to
Have some understanding, have a couple candid conversations
Your frustrations, I take in considerations
I'm rough around the edges, don't bow with me and be patient
And you sadly mistaken if you think I'm into chasing
My heart is RSVP, I've extended an invitation
And don't go wasting your time with what they saying online
Your position's divine, don't believe? Look around
I got a strong mind and a kind heart
With a soft kiss, but I love hard

[Hook]

[Break]
Don't you love this life like I love you?
Anything you could ask, do it for you
Drop Jags, Birkin bags, Louboutin heels
Summer homes in Miami, Hollywood hills
Vacationin' in Monaco, Ibiza
On the French Riviera with our feet up
A lifestyle so rare
You know you ain't going nowhere

[Hook]

[Domo Genesis]
I'm still cruising, despite rumors of lane switching
I stay true to this music, when niggas ain't listing
While you losin', I'm movin', trust me I ain't tripping
Tryna run southern California like Lane Kiffin
I'm on mine, the same nigga with the same vision
A big rich and you stacking, we share the same difference
While niggas trippin', tryna kick it with the same bitches
I'm on a mission, my next steps I can't mention
To my divison the end, is what I'm loyal to
And a couple bro's outside, you know I'm supporting you
I ain't got to drop no names, know its the chosen few
To keep it real, that water fake shit is long overdue
I work hard so they can feel me flex
And the only question left is do they feel me yet?
And I ain't even here with nothing, but they share regrets
And when I'm making high moves they ain't feel these steps
Uh...and I be on some shit you can't understand now
Like how I play victim to the voice in my head now
So much pressure on my soul, I could lay it down
But I think on what this shit is missing so I stay around
And I ain't felt this confused in a minute
How they write us off? we better than half these niggas spittin'
I guess you ain't getting it unless you got a little gimmick
They don't want to see the story 'less you wrap and paint the premise
My life ain't sweet shit, my momma raised a warrior
Single parent, one autistic, guess I'm the courier
That's why I study raps in the tracks, John warm it up
Cause real cold hearts get you the prison or the coroner
This shit real... it's realer than it's ever been...
All this extra thinking got me floating on the medicine
Stunting all these niggas I be feeling like a veteran
Was in the tunnel, now I see the lights like Edison
Better win, I kick it with the peace I'm resting in
Cause waiting for these niggas to notice making me petulant
But they ain't ready for this shit they taken pre-requisites
Cause everything I'm putting in the streets is real definite
Definitely the nigga that don't wanna be reckoned with
I don't find so much in the piece, I be heaven sent
Man, do it for the nigga with long dreams
Show him how a real young nigga get long C.R.E.A.M
Keep your heart in your hustle and don't run with the wrong team
Nigga be yourself, and don't end up on the wrong seam
Sorry if I kick a little shit, but the flow mean
Still dropping real chill tracks for the dope fiends
By dope I mean weed, motherfucker, we grow green
And I be in the center of the bull like Joe King
I still leave 'em, broke dreams and regrets
Already feel at home and I'm just getting my feet wet
I work hard so they can feel me flex
And the only question left is do they feel me yet?

[Intro]
Don't live a lie
This is your one life, oh
Don't live it like you won't get lost
Just walk, just walk

[Interlude]
It's a liberty walk, it's a liberty walk
It's a liberty, liberty, liberty
It's a liberty walk, it's a liberty walk
It's a liberty, liberty, liberty

[Verse 1]
Here's to all the ones tryna hold you back
Tryna make you feel like you're less than that
Giving nothing more better than to make you crack
But really just trying to push your dreams off track
And you know in the end, it'll be okay
'Cause all that really matters are the steps you take
And everything else falls into place
There's no price to pay, I say

[Pre-Chorus]
We're alright (Alright)
Yeah, yeah (Yeah, yeah)
We gonna get it
When we live it, live it, oh
We're alright (Alright)
Yeah, yeah (Yeah, yeah)
We gonna get it
When we live it, walk, walk

[Chorus]
It's a liberty walk, walk
Say goodbye to the people who tied you up
It's a liberty walk, walk
Feeling your heart again, breathing new oxygen
It's a liberty walk, walk
Free yourself, slam the door, not a prisoner anymore
Liberty, liberty, li-li-liberty, liberty, li-li
It's a liberty walk, walk, walk

[Post-Chorus]
Don't stop
Keep on walking it, and
Don't stop
Keep on talking sh-
Don't stop
Keep on walking it
Walk, walk, walk, walk

[Verse 2]
Don't be afraid to make a move
It won't hurt you just do
What you were born to do
And everything works out right
Don't listen to all the people who hate
'Cause all they do is help make your mistakes for ya
Well, they don't own ya
I just told ya

[Pre-Chorus]
We're alright (Alright)
Yeah, yeah (Yeah, yeah)
We gonna get it
When we live it, live it, oh
We're alright (Alright)
Yeah, yeah (Yeah, yeah)
We gonna get it
When we live it, walk, walk

[Chorus]
It's a liberty walk, walk
Say goodbye to the people who tied you up
It's a liberty walk, walk
Feeling your heart again, breathing new oxygen
It's a liberty walk, walk
Free yourself, slam the door, not a prisoner anymore
Liberty, liberty, li-li-liberty, liberty, li-li
It's a liberty walk, walk, walk

[Post-Chorus]
Don't stop
Keep on walking it
Don't stop (Just walk this way)
Keep on talking sh-
Don't stop
Keep on walking it
Don't like, don't like, don't like, don't like

[Bridge]
Don't like what you do (Walk)
Don't take the abuse (Walk)
Move to the truth (Walk)
People, c'mon, that means you (Walk)

[Chorus]
It's a liberty walk, walk
Say goodbye to the people who tied you up
It's a liberty walk, walk
Feeling your heart again, breathing new oxygen
It's a liberty walk, walk
Free yourself, slam the door, not a prisoner anymore
Liberty, liberty, li-li-liberty, liberty, li-li
It's a liberty walk, walk, walk

[Post-Chorus]
Don't stop
Keep on walking it
Don't stop
Keep on talking sh-
Don't stop
Keep on walking it
Walk, walk, walk, walk
Don't stop
Keep on walking it
Don't stop
Keep on talking sh-
Don't stop
Keep on walking it
Walk, walk, walk, walk

[Verse 1: Miz-Korona (as Vanessa)]
Man, I'm gettin' so sick and tired of fuckin' with this steel
They only give us thirty minutes to eat lunch and chill
My body achin' just to get a buck
I’m sick of eatin' this shit off this fuckin' lunch truck
Nasty-ass food, I'm in a nasty-ass mood
I should've called in sick, shit, I had somethin' to do

[Verse 2: Xzibit (as Mike)]
I can't believe that I'm hearing all this ravin' and rantin'
From Vanessa up in here at the New Detroit stampin'
You need to get your food and take your ass back to work
You're dreamin' if you think them corny-ass raps'll work
Look at y'all standin' out here, freezin' like dumb fucks
Rappin' away for food off this raggedy lunch truck
Who want what? Who pumped up to get rolled up?
I spit venom in every direction, soak some up
Look at this fat-ass nigga, sloppy sucker
You're a ugly motherfucker, your pop should've wore a rubber
Stop rhymin', keep your day job, Vanessa
Next time, leave that bullshit home on the dresser
Speaking of dresses, take a look at Paul the fruitcake
When you travel, you pro'bly pack panties in your suitcase
Made out of lace from Victoria’s Secret
If ten men came in a cup, you’d pro'bly drink it

[Verse 3: Eminem (as Jimmy)]
Okay, folks, enough with the gay jokes
Especially from a gay broke bitch yourself, hey lo'
This style's doo-doo, you've worked here longer than me
And I get paid more than you do, dawg, take a seat
What's this guy standin' in line for? He ain’t got money to eat!
Check this out, yo, yo
This guy cashed his whole check and bought one ho-ho
Fuckin' homo! Little maggot
You can’t hack it; Paul's gay, you're a faggot
At least he admits it, don’t even risk it
This guy's starvin' to death, someone get him a biscuit!
I don’t know what they told you, Mike
You must had them cornrows rolled too tight
This job, you wanna quit, bu
