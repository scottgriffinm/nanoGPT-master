'll say
"Darling, I'm in love with you," it happens just that way
Time, there was a time you could talk to me without speaking
You would look at me, and I'd know all there is to know
Days I think of you, and remember the lies we told in the night
The love we knew, the things we shared, when our hearts were fitting together
Days that were so few, full of love and you
Gone,. the days are gone now, days that seem so wrong now
Life won't be the same without you, to hold again in my arms
To ease the pain and remember when our love was the reason for living
(instrumental)
Days that were so few, full of love and you
The game is over
I jumped off a boxcar down around Tennessee
I was cold tired and dirty hungry as I could be
But I had my guitar and a hundred railroad songs
So I asked the policeman
Can I stay here long
He said Mr. Hobo you got to go now
We don't want you around
See I'm trying to build a respectable town
And we don't need a hobo like you hanging around

So I left that town, Lord with my guitar in my hand
Still cold and tired, kinda mad at the man
But this life that I chose to live, sometime's strange
See I'm trying to learn about the old music from ridin' the train
I'm a hobo I know, but thta's the price I pay
Guess I'll write me another song while I'm on my way
Catch me another train and this is what I'll say
Mr Choo-choo train take me away

I'm goin' to ride this train Lord until I find out
What Jimmie Rogers and the Hag was all about
See I play this rock n roll and I think that's fine
But I wnta to go back a little further in time
I'm a hobo I know but that's the price I pay
Guess I'll write me another song while I'm on my way
Catch me another train and this is what I'll say
Mr Choo-choo train take me away
I have a girlfriend
She says I'm her only one
We wanna get married
But we're so young
So young
Can't marry no one
They say our love is
Just a teenage affection
But no one knows
Our hearts' direction

So young
Can't marry no one
I'm I'm I'm so young
I'm I'm I'm so young
I'm I'm I'm so young
Can't marry no one, no one

Pretty soon now
I'll go to sea
Their mother's baby
Will have seen the last of me
So young
Can't marry no one, no one
Can't marry no one
Can't marry no one
Can't marry no one
Can't marry no one
Can't marry no one
Can't marry no one
Well, I'm weary and tired, I've done my day's ridin'
Nighttime is rollin' my way
The sky's all on fire and the light's slowly fading
Peaceful and still ends the day
Out on the trail night birds are callin'
Singin' their wild melody
Down in the canyon cottonwood whispers
A Song of Wyoming for me

Well, I've wandered around the town and the city
Tried to figure the how and the why
Well, I've stopped all my schemin'
I'm just driftin' and dreamin'
Watching the river roll by
Here comes that big ole prairie moon risin'
Shinin' down bright as can be
Up on the hill there's a coyote singin'
A Song of Wyoming for me

Now it's whiskey and tobacco and bitter black coffee
A lonesome old dogie am I
But wakin' up on the range
Lord I feel like an angel
Free like I almost could fly
Drift like a cloud out over the badlands
Sing like a bird in the tree
The wind in the sage sounds like heaven singin'
A Song of Wyoming for me
A Song of Wyoming for me
The wheel is turning and you can't slow down
You can't let go and you can't hold on
You can't go back and you can't stand still
If the thunder don't get you then the lightning will

Won't you try just a little bit harder
Couldn't you try just a little bit more?
Won't you try just a little bit harder
Couldn't you try just a little bit more?

Round, round robin run round, got to get back to where you belong
Little bit harder, just a little bit more
A little bit further than you gone before

The wheel is turning and you can't slow down
You can't let go and you can't hold on
You can't go back and you can't stand still
If the thunder don't get you then the lightning will

Small wheel turn by the fire and rod
Big wheel turn by the grace of God
Every time that wheel turn 'round
Bound to cover just a little more ground
The wheel is turning and you can't slow down
You can't let go and you can't hold on
You can't go back and you can't stand still
If the thunder don't get you then the lightning will

Won't you try just a little bit harder
Couldn't you try just a little bit more?
Won't you try just a little bit harder
Couldn't you try just a little bit more?
There's a saying old says that love is blind
Still we're often told "seek and ye shall find"
So I'm going to seek a certain girl I've had in mind
Looking everywhere, haven't found her yet
She's the big affair I cannot forget
Only girl I ever think of will regret
Yeah uh
Nappy boy

Ahh man
(Sigh)
Aye, i know u think its gonna take 4 niggas star to respect
The blood and the tears and the sweat
And still don't ferget where the so called ideas came from
Or who they call for ideas when they ain't none

Who carry them on there shoulders when they can't run
Its hard work when u find out it ain't fun
But hard work will turn a man into a bitch
But hard work ain't shit compared to hard dicks, So

Ain't nobody fuck with me, im unfuckwitable
Record labels hit the ground when i hit the doe

Nappy boy!
Need someone's hand to lead me through the night
I need someone's arms to hold and squeeze me tight
Now, when the night begins, whoa, I'm at an end
Because I need your love so bad

I need some lips to feel next to mine
Need someone to stand up - to stand up and tell me when I'm lyin'
And when the lights are low - and it's time to go
That's when I need your love so bad

So why don't you give it up, baby and bring it home to me
Or write it on a piece of paper, woman - so it can be read to me
Tell me that you love me - and stop drivin' me mad
Whoa, because I - I need your love so bad

Need a soft voice - just to talk to me at night
Don't want you to worry, baby
I know we can make everything alright
Listen to my plea, baby, come on bring it to me
'Cause I need - your love so bad
Baby, I need, I need - woman, I need your love so bad
All the king's horses and all the king's men
Couldn't put me back together again
My heart lies in pieces all over the ground
Who's gonna help me when you're not around
And i know inside me ,that nobody cares
Whatever happens to me
I live my life as a plea

All the king's horses and all the king's men
Couldn't put me back together again
I was in love when i sat on my wall
No one could hurt me , no one at all
And i know that somewhere my love walked away
She threw my love to the sky
Nothing to do but to cry

All the king's horses and all the king's men
Couldn't put me back together again
All the king's horses , all the king's horses
All the king's horses , all the king's horses
Life on Earth is a bloody hazardous affair
As in the city, the republic was collapsing away
I think the brilliant crust's hiding sad realities to come
And there's a decisive battle that we all had that we lost

I don't care if the fascists have to win
I don't care democracy's being fucked
I don't care socialism's full of sin
The untenable system engenders rot

But what is exciting's the challenge and stimulation
That the tensions help keep the creative nerve so taut

The absence of profounder transformation in the country
Make their hopes turn sour, feelings of let down in irony
Obviously once more it could be called treachery
Rappel Ã  l'ordre, oh don't you get too revolutionary

I don't care if the fascists have to win
I don't care democracy's being fucked
I don't care socialism's full of sin
The untenable system engenders rot
But what is exciting's the challenge and stimulation
That the tensions help keep the creative nerve so taut

Life on Earth is a bloody hazardous affair
Impressive malleability of human identity
The horrors of the war were to be repeated anyway
It was like taking candy from a baby

We got to keep the lift, hope, and struggle
We got to keep the lift, hope, and struggle
Where is the lift, the hope, and the struggle?
We got to keep the lift, hope, and struggle

We got to keep the lift, hope, and struggle
Where is the lift, the hope, and the struggle?
We got to keep the lift, hope, and struggle
Where is the lift, the hope, and the struggle?

Give me the strength, the lift, hope, and struggle
We got to keep the lift, hope, and struggle
Where is the lift, the hope, and the struggle?
We got to keep the lift, hope, and struggle

We got to keep the lift, hope, and struggle
Where is the lift, the hope, and the struggle?
Give me the strength, the lift, hope, and struggle
Give me the strength, the lift, hope, and struggle
We got to keep the lift, hope, and struggle
Where is the lift, the hope, and the struggle?
Give me the strength, the lift, hope, and struggle
Give me the strength, the lift, hope, and struggle

Give me the strength, the lift, hope, and struggle
We got to keep the lift, hope, and struggle
Where is the lift, the hope, and the struggle?
We got to keep the lift, hope, and struggle

We got to keep the lift, hope, and struggle
Where is the lift, the hope, and the struggle?
We got to keep the lift, hope, and struggle
Where is the lift, the hope, and the struggle?

We got to keep the lift, hope, and struggle
We got to keep the lift, hope, and struggle
Where is the lift, the hope, and the struggle?
We got to keep the lift, hope, and struggle

(The following signal was recorded equally on both channels, but is out of phase...)
I sit right here baby, baby, and sit down on my knee

Part I: This Is How We Do

[Verse 1]
Sipping on RosÃ©
Silverlake sun coming up all lazy (This is how we do)
Slow cooking pancakes for my boy
Still up, still fresh as a daisy
Playing ping pong all night long
Everything's all neon and hazy (This is how we do)

Big hoops, and maroon lips
My clique hopping in my Maserati (This is how we...)
Santa Barbara-chic at La Super Rica
Grabbing tacos, checking out hotties
Now we talkinâ astrology
Getting our nails did all Japanese-y (This is how we do)
Day drinking at the Wildcat
Sucking real bad at Mariah Carey-oke

Part II: Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)

[Chorus]
Last Friday night
Yeah, we danced on tabletops
And we took too many shots
Think we kissed, but I forgot
Last Friday night
Yeah, we maxed our credit cards
And got kicked out of the bar, so we hit the boulevard
Last Friday night
We went streaking in the park
Skinny dipping in the dark, then had a mÃ©nage Ã  trois
Last Friday night
Yeah, I think we broke the law
Always say we're going to stop-op, oh woah
But this Friday night, do it all again

[Verse 1]
Sometimes I'm happy
Sometimes I'm sad
I lost my woman
I feel so bad
She was my first love
I needed her
But it's so bad
I'm on my own own own own
Yeah!

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2]
Now, I will sit here
Everyday
I loved that woman
And everyday
She was the first one
It felt so good
I didn't know what to say
I just can't go on on on on
Yeah!

[Guitar Solo]
Kneeling at the feet of the highness
Riveted by the weightlessness
They will follow, my way, the way of love
That wants to come to affection
When the shadow becomes giant
Looking for the beater to hold the rhythm
Standing in my way, the way of love
That wants to come to affection

The heart is the ruler, it is the trumpeter
Decider, celebrate, the drummer ultimate
Decider, celebrate, the drummer ultimate

When the shadow becomes giant
Looking for the beater to hold the rhythm
Standing in my way, the way of love
That wants to come to affection
Oh, by gosh, by golly
It's time for mistletoe and holly
Tasty pheasants, Christmas presents
Countrysides covered with snow

Oh, by gosh, by jingle
It's time for carols and Kris Kringle
Overeating, merry greeting
From relatives you don't know

Then comes that big night
Giving the tree the trim
You'll hear voices by starlight
Singing a yuletide hymn

Oh, by gosh, by golly
It's time for mistletoe and holly
Fancy ties and granny's pies
An' folks stealin' a kiss or two
As they whisper, "Merry Christmas" to you
Then comes that big night
Giving the tree the trim
You'll hear voices by starlight
Singing a yuletide hymn

Oh, by gosh, by golly
It's time for mistletoe and holly
Fancy ties and granny's pies
And folks stealin' a kiss or two
As they whisper, "Merry Christmas" to you
Softly the night wind singing
Tells me it's bringing my love to me
With every breath it's sending
Love never ending across the sea
My heart and I are trying
To keep from crying
But we are lonely
Fly little bird go winging
And please lead him home safely to me
Cucurrucucu Paloma
Cucurrucucu no llores
Las piedras jamas paloma
Que van a saber de amores
What good is my tomorrow
When filled with sorrow just like today
I need him here to hold me
Here to enfold me, always to stay
So little bird please find him
And then remind him I am so lonely
Fly little bird, go winging
And please lead him home safely to me
Cucurrucucu Paloma
Cucurrucucu no llores
Las piedras jamas paloma
Que van a saber de amores
Cucurrucucu
Cucurrucucu
Cucurrucucu
Paloma ya no lo llores
You'd be so easy to love
Easy to idolize all others above
So worth the yearning for
So swell to keep the home fire burning for

We'd be so grand at the game
So carefree together, that it does seem a shame
That you can't see your future with me
'Cause you'd be so easy to love
If our lives could lie before us like a straight and narrow highway
So that we could see forever, long before we took the ride
We would never look to heaven, make a wish or climb a mountain
'Cause we'd always know the answer what's on the other side

But life ain't no easy freeway, just some gravel on the ground
You pay for every mile you go to spread some dust around
Tho' we all have destinations , and the dust will settle down
This life ain't no easy freeway, just some gravel on the ground

So let's walk the road together
Who knows what we'll find tomorrow
Maybe good times, maybe sorrow will be waitin' round the bend
Given time, two hearts discover what they're feelin' for each other
At the best we'll end up lovers, at the least we'll make a friend

But life ain't no easy freeway, just some gravel on the ground
You pay for every mile you go to spread some dust around
Tho' we all have destinations , and the dust will settle down
But life ain't no easy freeway, just some gravel on the ground
You pay for every mile you go to spread some dust around
Tho' we all have destinations , and the dust will settle down
This life ain't no easy freeway, just some gravel on the ground

[Verse 1]
She's got everything she needs
She's an artist, she don't look back
She's got everything she needs
She's an artist, she don't look back
She takes the dark out of the nighttime
And paints the daytime black

You will start out standing, proud to steal her anything she sees
You will start out standing, proud to steal her anything she sees
You'll wind up peeking through a key hole, down upon your bended knees

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
She never stumbles, she's got no place to fall
She never stumbles, she's got no place to fall
She's nobody's child, the law can't touch her at all

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Bow down to her on Sunday, salute her when her birthday comes
Bow down to her on Sunday, salute her when her birthday comes
For Halloween, buy her a trumpet, Christmas, get her these drums

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 1 repeated]
She's got everything she needs
She's an artist, she don't look back
She's got everything she needs
She's an artist, she don't look back
She takes the dark out of the nighttime
Paints the daytime black
Oh, she takes the dark out of the nighttime
And paints the daytime black
I was born for roaming
Yes, I always will
I wonder if it's greener
On the far side of the hill

Hey Dan, Dan look down yonder
Why there's earth and there's green and sky
And I bet we could get down there
In the batting of an eye

And further west there's oceans
A miner he told me so
And the sun it shines so brightly
That it scares off the winters snow

And, you know, Dan, sometimes I'm tired
You know there's sometimes when I'm lonesome too
Sometimes I see a farmer
Walking slow when the day is through

And I know, I know he's got a woman
She's making supper for him every day
And I curse this wandering fever
That stole my love away
Yes, I was born for roaming
I guess I always will
I wonder could it be greener
On the far side of the hill
I wonder could it be greener
On the far side of the hill

[Verse 1]
Another day another reminder that your not here with me
I watch the snowflakes falling from the sky then I get lost in memories
The time we tried to build a snowman, the time we tried to count the stars
Its crazy how we didn't know that wed ever be apart

[Chorus]
I can hear the music playing
See the lights upon the tree
I can feel the joy in every soul
But for me its incomplete
And I try my best to play the part
But no matter what I do
No it just don't feel like Christmas, without you

[Verse 2]
Another tear, another regret boy, that your so far away
Can it be, that it was only last year we shared that Christmas day?
Remember when we took the sleigh ride, remember singing by the fire?
Theres to much that's in the daylight, I keep reliving you and I

[Chorus]
Time to try to build a snowman, the time we try to count the stars
Its crazy how we didn't know that wed ever be apart!
I can hear the music playing
See the lights upon the tree
I can feel the joy in every soul, but for me its incomplete
And I try my best to play the part
But no matter what I do
No it just don't feel like Christmas, no it just don't feel like Christmas, without you
See I tried but it just ain't right, without you

[verse 1]
The last kiss we shared, tasted like a wine
Sweet and bitter like, our memories
And i long for you to, come right back to me
Tomorrow the time will be the same as today
Nothing goes on in my heart except your memories
Where will you be, and who will you think of...!

[Chorus]
You were always gonna be my love
And you should know
Even if i fall in love with somebody else
I'll remember to love you taught me how
You were always gonna be the one
And for now, i'll still be singing this love song
For... somebody like you
My first love...

[verse 2]
Time after time, baby i tried to forget our life together
But the memories are so so hard to let go
Tomorrow the time will be the same as today
Trying to hold back the tears when thinking of you
All i want is to be with you once more...!

[Chorus 2]
You will always be inside my heart
And you should know
That i wish that i could ever let you go
I know that i love you 

[?]
Now and forever see the one
And for now, i'll still be singing this love song
For... somebody like you
My first love...

[Chorus]
You were always gonna be my love
And you should know
Even if i fall in love with somebody else
I'll remember to love you to hell
You were always gonna be the one
I'll still be singing this love song
For... somebody like you
My first love...
Oh, oh
Oh, oh

Her eyes were softer than the night
Her lips were honey and wine
And oh, I loved her more than life
I worshipped this love of mine

Oh, oh
Oh, oh

I worshipped her so blindly
Till I was told one day
For love of gold, my true love sold
Sold her heart away

Oh, oh
Oh, oh

The love that I had idolized
Has sold her heart away
Too late, too late, I realized
My idol had feet of clay
Oh, ooh
I can't believe you wanna leave
When you know that it'll hurt me so
And on bending knees
I beg you please not to go

Take a vow of the love we had
And all the fun that we had
And now you wanna leave
Don't you know that it'd drive me mad

My life, my heart
My love in your hands
And now you wanna leave me
You wanna leave me for another man

Take a vow of the love we had
And all the fun that we had
And now you wanna leave
Now, don't you know that would drive me mad

My heart, my love
My life is in your hands
And now you wanna leave me
You wanna leave me for another man
Take a vow of the love we had
And all the fun that we had
And now you wanna leave
Now, don't you know that would drive me mad

[Chorus]
Every day, and every night
Humpin' and bouncin' is all I wanna do
Every day, and every night
Humpin' and bouncin' is all I wanna do
Every day, and every night
Humpin' and bouncin' is all I wanna do
Every day, every night
Humpin' and bouncin' is all I wanna do
Every day, and every night
Humpin' and bouncin' is all I wanna do...
Can you hear me
Are you near me
Can you see me
See me at all
Do you know me
Can you show me
If you hear me
Don't let me fall
Is it raining in the sunshine
And the wind blows in my eyes
Lying face down to the hard ground
I can face the cloudy skies
And although I maybe dying I will bide my love
I'll be waiting , I'll be waiting
I'll be waiting , in the storm

You were my girl in the springtime
With the sunshine in my day
Your sweet lips, your fingertips
And you touch me but you won't stay
Is it raining in the sunshine
And the wind blows in my eyes
Lying face down to the hard ground
I can face the cloudy skies
And although I may be dying I will bide my love
I'll be waiting , I'll be waiting
I'll be waiting , in the storm
Can you hear me
Are you near me
In the storm
The moment has come, I hear a drum
Or is it my heart dear, beating this way
There's work to be done, done with a gun
There goes the bugle, I hear it say

It's the last call for love, time to say Fare thee well
Let the taps tell you all that my heart dare not tell

With your eyes in the stars of Old Glory
Can I help but be faithful to you
Till we meet on the day we're dreaming of
It's the last call for love

(repeat this chorus)
It's the last call for love, sweetheart
Frank:
Now here's a story with quite a moral
And all you gals, you gotta pay some mind
When you find a guy
Shelley Winters:

[yeah?]
Frank:
Worth keeping, be satisfied
Make sure you treat him very kind..
'Cause a good guy
Shelley Winters:

[Ow!]
Frank:
Is hard to find
You could always get the other kind
Shelley Winters:

[But when you think that you got her tied, you'll find her]
Frank:
Messing around with another guy
Then you rave and you'll even start to crave
Man, you want to see her lying deep down in the grave
So if the guy's nice, you better take my advice
You better love him in the morning, kiss him every night
Ooo, give him plenty of loving, treat him right
Because a good man nowadays is hard to find
Shelley Winters:

[Buster, you gotta be kidding, you see this little guy?]

[The one with the feeble mind, he always been, he moving time.]

[One fine day he dug another chick, she took all his loot and cut him quick.]

[Now, he's calling me back on the phone, he says]
Frank:
Baby, don't you go away, I'm coming right home
Shelley Winters:

[But if you wanna come back, come on in our little grass shack,]

[You gotta love me in the morning, kiss me in the night,]

[You give me lots of loving, treat me right,]

['Cause a good gal nowadays is hard to find.]

Frank:
Well, I went back, but I told this doll
I said: Woman, then is then, but now is now
If you want me to stay, there's just one but (what?)
Keep a smile on your face, and keep your big mouth shut
Well, we're back together, and everything is fine
Shelley Winters:

[I'm a-running the show, jack, you better stay in line.]

[Now you know what to do when the day is through.]
Frank:
I better love you in the AM
Shelley Winters:

[that's right!]
Frank:
Kiss you in the PM
Shelley Winters:

[what else?]
Frank:
Give plenty of loving
Shelley Winters:

[show me!]
Frank:
With all my mind
Shelley Winters:

[good boy!]

[For a good gal nowadays are hard to find.. Leroy!] Yes, ma'am!

[I am just .. you better keep those cotton picking hands off all those other dames or I'll]
Frank:
Or you'll what?
Shelley Winters:

[I'll fly over there and turn off all your lights.]
Frank:
Uh yeah, like I was saying, a good
Shelley Winters:

[Oh man, yes!]
You say you want to try again
Well you don't realize
That I have a better end in mind

It doesn't seem you really have to
Close your eyes to see
Though I hope you don't need me
You are so far from me

There was something I had caught inside
Screaming hard to make it go
And tied me down low
It doesn't seem you really have to
Close your eyes to see
You have been all you'll be
It's just you babe
And we can't relate at all

It doesn't seem you really have to
Close your eyes to see
Though I hope you don't need me
You are so far from me
This time's the last time i want to say so long
This song's my last song for you
There's just nothing here to hold on to babe
Nothing to hold on to

Spoonful

Could have been a spoonful of coffee
Could have been a spoonful of tea
Just a little spoon of your precious love is good enough for me
Man lies about that, man cries about that
Man dies about that, spoonful, spoonful, spoonful

Could have been a spoonful of water
Spread out on the desert sand
Just a little spoon fortifies, save you from another man
Man lies about that, man cries about that
Even dies about that, spoonful, spoonful, spoonful

Could have been a spoonful of diamonds
Could have been a spoonful of gold
Just a little spoon of your precious love to satisfy my soul

Everybody's talking about spoonful
Spoonful, spoonful, spoonful
Everybody's fighting about spoonful

[Chorus: Etta James]
Oh, sometimes
I get a good feeling, yeah
Get a feeling that I never, never, never, never had before, no no
I get a good feeling, yeah

[Chorus: Etta James]
Oh, sometimes
I get a good feeling, yeah
Get a feeling that I never, never, never, never had before, no no
I get a good feeling, yeah
Walk away, please go before you throw your life away
A life I could share for just a day
We could have met some years ago. For your sake I'll say
Walk away, just go, walk away and live a life that's full with no regret
Don't look back to me, just try to forget
Why build a dream that cannot come true, so be strong
Reach the stars now, walk away, walk on
If I heard your voice, I'll beg you to stay
So don't say a word, just run away
Goodbye, my love, my tears will fall now that you're gone
I can't help but cry but I must go on
I'm sad that after searching so long
Knew I love you but told you, walk away, walk on

[Verse 1]
Ah, the buzzard took a monkey for a ride in the air
The monkey thought that everything was on the square
The buzzard tried to throw the monkey off his back
The monkey grabbed his neck and said, "Now listen, Jack..."

[Chorus]
Straighten up and fly right
Straighten up and fly right
Straighten up and fly right
Oh, cool down, papa, don't you blow your top
Ain't no use in divin'
What's the use of jivin'?
Straighten up and fly right
Yeah, cool down, papa, don't you blow your top

[Bridge]
Well, the buzzard told the monkey, "You are chokin' me
Release your hold and I'll set you free"
The monkey looked the buzzard right dead in the eye and said
"Your story's so touching, but it sounds like a lie"

[Chorus]
Straighten up and fly right
Straighten up and fly right
Straighten up and fly right
Oh, cool down, papa, baby, cool down

[Bridge]
Well, the buzzard told the monkey, "You are chokin' me
Release your hold and I'll set you free"
The monkey looked the buzzard right dead in the eye and said
"Your story's so touching, but it sounds like a lie"

[Chorus]
Ooh, straighten up and fly right
Straighten up, straighten up, straighten up, fly right
Ah, cool down, papa, cool down
Straighten up and fly right
Straighten up and fly right
Straighten up and fly right
Oh, cool down, papa, don't you blow your top

[Outro]
And fly right

[Chorus]
The wheel is turning and you can't slow down
You can't let go and you can't hold on
You can't go back and you can't stand still
If the thunder don't get you, then the lightning will

[Post-Chorus]
Won't you try just a little bit harder?
Couldn't you try just a little bit more?
Won't you try just a little bit harder?
Couldn't you try just a little bit more?

[Verse 1]
'Round, 'round, robin run 'round
Got to get back to where you belong
Little bit harder, just a little bit more
A little bit further than you gone before

[Chorus]
The wheel is turning and you can't slow down
You can't let go and you can't hold on
You can't go back and you can't stand still
If the thunder don't get you, then the lightning will

[Verse 2]
Small wheel turn by the fire and rod
Big wheel turn by the grace of God
Every time that wheel turn 'round
Bound to cover just a little more ground

[Chorus]
The wheel is turning and you can't slow down
You can't let go and you can't hold on
You can't go back and you can't stand still
If the thunder don't get you, then the lightning will

[Post-Chorus]
Won't you try just a little bit harder?
Couldn't you try just a little bit more?
Won't you try just a little bit harder?
Couldn't you try just a little bit more?

[Verse 1]
Last night, all my attention
Squinting westward at the sunset
With a map and a compass
When a man reached up, said something
There, against the sky, a ball of light
Too invisible to give itself to the naked eye

[Verse 2]
On the shore, people yelling
In their eyes, a great reflection
In the grid where they're positioned
Unconcerned with intuition
There could never be no sympathy
From that wilderness, so let it be arrested

[Verse 3]
Swing low, oh Magellan
9 by 6 or 8 by 7
Post a sentinel at the border
Of what you attempt, what you ignore
I saw my frame in a pool of light
All drowned in doubt and shame
And I knew that I had lost my sight
In the name of love and life
Turn your face to the lonely night
But you're not alone when she calls you home
And this your world is on the edge
As good as lost but you know the way
Through this faceless town

And she pulls me down
I know the place and the time (of our lives)
So long ago
And all through the years (never dies)
All things must pass

Irresistible force meets an immovable object
And human animal madness and blood starts to flow
Invisible fingers and indescribable pleasure
I got to find my personal god
I got to find my personal god

God of love, god of gold
Ring of fire in the days of old
It's what I'm living for
And love's the only law
So answer Mayday, S.O.S
Search me North, East, South and West
It's all I miss, just the one last kiss

This is goodbye to the days (of our lives)
My fair-weathered friend
I feel your sorrow and tears (They are mine)
I share to the end

Irresistible force meets an immovable object
And human animal magic
How far can you go?

The rolling of thunder and
You decide what you're after
I get to find my personal god
I get to find my personal god

I surrenderAll or nothing
You must spread your wings and fly
I know the place and the time (of our lives)
My fair-weathered friend
I feel your sorrow and tears (They are mine)
We share to the end

When an irresistible force meets an immovable object
Human animal madness and blood starts to flow
There's bound to be heartbreak
You make it the hard way
I surrenderAll or nothing
You must spread your wings and fly
I'm gonna be 'round my vegetables
I'm gonna chow down my vegetables
I love you most of all
My favor-ripe Vega-Table
(Run 'em all around, dig a hole in the ground)

If you brought a big, brown bag of them home
I'd jump up and down and hope you'd toss me a carrot

Tripped on a cornucopia
Stripped a stalk green and I hope ya
Like me the most of all
My favor-ripe Vega-Table
(All those buttons flew off of my shirt)

I tried to kick the ball but my tennie flew right off
I'm red as a beet 'cause I got so flustered
Stark naked in front of my mirror
A pudgy person somehow did appear
Seems lately all I've eaten sugar and fat
It's getting obvious that's not where it's at
A big pot and tripley chin
Oh what condition my condition was in
Laughing at myself at what a crying shame
What ever happened to my Greek godly frame

Cyclamates juicy steaks, sweet things too
Aren't always good as they seem
Doughy lumps, stomach pumps, enemas too
That's what you get when you eat that way

I read a book on organic foods
Jumped on a health food kick
Put me in the mood
You may not get to perfect overnight
But on the way you're feelin' clean out of sight
We ate tonight at Fairfax and 3rd
We're gonna spread the news and give you the word
We hope that soon you'll eat like we did today
We're mighty thankful now that H.E.L.P.'s on its way
Salad with a special knock you right off your seat
With carrot juice to wash it all down
Yummy carob cookies are an organic treat
And H.E.L.P. has got the best food in town
H.-E.-L.-P
H.E.L.P. your education creates much benefit and peace

Hamburgers and hot dogs throw 'em all out
You'll feel so good you'll jump up and shout
If you haven't why don't you go shopping today
And 'member now that H.E.L.P. 's on its way

H.-E.-L.-P
Radiant Radish is gonna be on Fairfax and 3rd
Sansasanth and Melrose 40452
Oooh, get yourself in for a snack
Yeah, but stop by the Radiant Radish
Oh Peanut, we love you, baby
Oh Peanut, we love you, baby

Oh Peanut, we love you, baby
Oh Peanut, we love you, baby
Oh Peanut, we love you, baby

[Verse 1]
Girl you're so sad
He was the very first love you had
But he hurt your heart real bad
He just let your feelings a stray
And on a holiday
Go ahead and cry
Let me clear each tear from your eye
And maybe sing you a lullaby
Let my heart beat be your guide
To a cure inside
I know that it's oh so hard to let go
Give yourself time to heal take it slow
Let's talk as the rainbow colored lights make the tree glow
I'm your friend
I will be here for you till the end
'Cause I don't want wanna see you hurt again
I can be the key for your heart to mend

[Chorus]
'Cause baby you're not alone
The pain in your heart is strong
Baby let me hold you in my arms
Let me be your protector from harm
'Cause no one should be alone
On Christmas

[Verse 2]
How could he do
Such a thing to one as good as you?
Gave him your all
And I know that it's true
Had a gem and didn't know what to do
But baby I'm here to tell you that
I'm yours if you want me
These feelings I've held in too long
You've been on my mind
Girl you know I'll never lie
Love is so kind
I opened a prayer
That by the Lord's grace you would come my way
And receive love that won't go away
Celebrate this occasion
With gifts of joy on his birthday
On this night
I'll fill all your empty spaces inside
As the snow falls I'll make it alright
'Cause this day is for sharing
And no one should be without someone caring

[Chorus]
'Cause baby you're not alone
The pain in your heart is strong
Baby let me hold you in my arms
Let me be your protector from harm
'Cause no one should be alone
On Christmas

[Interlude: Mike]
Girl this Christmas you won't be alone
You don't have to cry
You don't have to worry about a thing
All the gifts that you wanted this year
Are your's
You don't have to worry about him no more
'Cause he's gone
Don't live in the past baby
I'm your future
All the feelings that I have
Are here for you
Anything that I can do
To take away any problem
That you may have or have had
I'm here
Just say Michael
And this Christmas is your's

[Chorus]
'Cause baby you're not alone
The pain in your heart is strong
Baby let me hold you in my arms
Let me be your protector from harm
'Cause no one should be alone

The pain in your heart is strong
Baby let me hold you in my arms
Let me be your protector from harm
'Cause no one should be alone
On Christmas
All of her days have gone soft and cloudy
All of her dreams have gone dry
All of her nights have gone sad and shady
She's gettin' ready to fly

Fly away (mmmm)
Fly away (mmmm...Fly away)

Life in the city can make you crazy
The sounds of the sand and the sea (I love the sea)
Life in a highrise can make you hungry
The things that you can't even see

Fly away (mmmm)
Fly away (mmmm...Fly away)

In this whole world there's nobody as lonely as she (Nobody as lonely as me)
There's nowhere to go and there's nowhere that she'd rather be (I'd rather be)

She's looking for lovers and children playing
She's looking for signs of the spring (Where is the spring?)
She listens for laughter and sounds of dancing
She listens for any old thing
Fly away (mmmm)
Fly away (mmmm...Fly away)

In this whole world there's nobody as lonely as she (There's nobody as lonely as me)
There's nowhere to go and there's nowhere that she'd rather be (I'd rather be)

All of her days have gone soft and cloudy
All of her dreams have gone dry (Where are my days?)
All of her nights have gone sad and shady
She's gettin' ready to fly

Fly away (mmmm)
Fly away (mmmm)
Fly away (mmmm...Fly away)

(Where are my days?)
(Where are my nights?)
(Where is the springtime?)
(I wanna fly...)
(I wanna fly...)
(I wanna fly...)
Where there is sunrise, there is Barbara, only Barbara clothes that way
Where there is laughter, there is Barbara, always Barbara warm and gay
And when there's music, she is the song, the song I'm singing my whole life long
There's no one just like her, like Barbara, only Barbara is so rare
Wherever she is, I'll be there
There's no one just like her, like Barbara, only Barbara, she's so rare
Wherever she is, I'll be there

[Verse 1]
5 foot 9
She's got legs for days (For days)
Green eyes that cut like a knife
And her own little sexy sway
No, she don't waste no time
Moving to the floor (To the floor)
And when she starts to move
She have you calling your mama saying "You wanna go home"

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, tell me
Why can't I have you?
Why you running girl?
I just wanted to love you

[Chorus]
I love you, baby
I love you
I love you, baby
I love you
But I guess you don't have time for me
I want you, baby
I want you
I want you, baby
I want you
But I guess love don't love me, no

[Verse 2]
It's OK to be scared
'Cause this girl is super bad (Yeah, yeah)
She will probably be the best thing that you never had
(The best thing that you never had)
Don't waste no time (Waste your time)
Trying to make her your own (Yeah, yeah)
'Cause what she says goes
And like Boyz II Men said, this is the end of the road

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, tell me (Tell me)
Why can't I have you? (Why can't I have you?)
Why you running, girl? (Why you running, girl?)
I just wanted to love you

[Chorus]
I love you, baby
I love you
I love you, baby
I love you
But I guess you don't have time for me
(Don't have the time for me, yeah)
I want you, baby
I want you
I want you, baby
I want you
But I guess love don't love me, no

[Bridge]
Baby, you said you loved me (You said you loved me)
But you led me on
Left me feeling strong (Feeling so strong about...)
About you
But I can't take no more, so I'm gonna leave you alone
Girl, I'm gone; girl, I'm gone, OH!

What's it gonna take to get you to love me, baby?
'Cause I can't take it anymore (Take it no more!)
You're gonna be mine for sure, ya know (Hey, hey, yeah)
What's it gonna take to get you to love me, baby?
(Baby, what's it gonna take?)
'Cause I can't take it anymore
(Can't take it no more!)
You're gonna be mine for sure, ya know

[Chorus]
I love you, baby
I love you (Love you)
I love you, baby
I love you (Said I love you)
But I guess you don't have time for me
(Guess you ain't interested in me, yeah)
I want you, baby
I want you (Said I want you)
I want you, baby
I want you (Come on)
But I guess love don't love me, no
(Baby, what's so bad about me? Yes!)
I love you, baby
I love you
I love you, baby
I love you
But I guess you don't have time for me
I want you, baby
I want you
I want you, baby
I want you
But I guess love don't love me, no

I love you, baby
I love you
I love you, baby
I love you
But I guess you don't have time for me
(Guess you just don't want me, baby)
I want you, baby
I want you
I want you, baby
I want you
But I guess love don't love me, no
(Guess you don't want me, baby)

I love you, baby (Love you)
I love you (Love you)
I love you, baby
I love you
But I guess you don't have time for me
I want you, baby
I want you
(You know what?! Screw you!)
But I guess love don't love me

S' posing I should fall in love with you
Do you think that you could love me too?
S' posing I should hold you and caress you
Would it impress you, or distress you?
S' posing I should say "for you I yearn,"
Would you think I'm speaking out of turn?
And s' posing I declare it
Would you take my love and share it?
I'm not s' posing I'm in love with you

[Part III: The White Rider (1:52 - 9:16)]

[1:52 - 2:34 - Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
When he rides
My fears subside
For darkness turns once more to light
Through the skies
His white horse flies
To find a land beyond the night

[2:58 - 5:43 - Instrumental]

[Verse 2]
Once he wore grey
He fell and slipped away
From everybody's sight
The wizard of them all
Came back from his fall
This time wearing white

[Verse 3]
He has a certain air
As if he's never there
But somehow far away
And though he seems afar
Like a distant star
His warmth he can convey

[Instrumental]

[Intro: Mike Shinoda]
It goes a one, two, three...

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
I was born with the hunger of a lion, the strength of a sun
I donât need to sweat it when a competition come
Original style like an 808 drum
So I donât run the track, no, I make the track run
My mama taught me words, my daddy built rockets
I put âem both together, now tell me what I got
It's a pretty smart weapon, I can shoot it, I can drop it
But learn to respect it âcause you clearly canât stop it like that

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
It ain't over âcause the sharks on the left side, the snakes on the right
And anything you do, they wanna get a little bite
It really doesnât matter if youâre wrong or if youâre right
âCause once you get the teeth in, nothing really fights
And as for me, I do it like I got nothing to lose
And you can run your mouth like you could try to fill my shoes
But steady little soldier, I ainât standing next to you
Iâd be laying on the ground before youâre even in my view, like that
I've been in this town so long that back in the city
I've been taken for lost and gone
And unknown for a long, long time

Fell in love years ago with an innocent girl
From the Spanish and Indian home
Of the heroes and villains

Once at night Catillian squared the fight
And she was right in the rain of the bullets
That eventually brought her down

But she's still dancing in the night
Unafraid of what a dude'll do
In a town full of heroes and villains

Heroes and villains
Just see what you've done

Heroes and villains
Just see what you've done
Stand or fall I know there shall be peace in the valley
And it's all an affair
Of my life with the heroes and villains

In the Catina
Margareta keeps the spirit high
There I watched her
She spun around and whilst (ha-ha-ha)
She kept the warmth in her body and the flame of the dance

Dance Margareta
Don't you know that I'm in love with you

You're under arrest!

My children were raised
You know they suddenly rise
They started slow long ago
Head to toe, healthy, wealthy, and wise

I've been in this town so long
So long to the city
I'm fit with the stuff
To ride in the rough
And sunny down snuff I'm all right
By the heroes and
Heroes and villains
Just see what you've done

Heroes and villains
Just see what you've done
We're together again (oh darlin')
We're together again (oh darlin')
Out of all the times you made me cry
Out of all the times you made me sigh
Still we're together again (we're together again)
We're together again (we're together again)

I didn't want ever want you to go
Darlin' I can't help but let the whole world know
That we're together again (we're together again)
We're together, together again

I didn't mean to ever leave you alone
I didn't mean to ever do you wrong
Now that you're back where you belong
I'm gonna love you all night long

We're together again (oh darlin')
We're together again (we're together again)
We're together again (we're together again)
We're together again (we're together again)
We're together again (we're together again)
Darlin'
We're together again
We're together again
We're together again
We're together again
Sometimes it is half full
Or sometimes half empty
For some it is theory
But for who is concerned it's truly a pity
A pity

Under the ocean night of deep sorrows
And quietly he misses you
The harm is visible in the water and
Ingested, how will it show later?

In the water, our child suffers
By your absence, he suffers

[Verse 1]
It really hurts to say this yes it does
But after a while sweet love just ain't enough
So many settle for less just because
Maybe I'm more in love with what it was
But what's gets so confusing baby
You and me
It's been so much confusion lately
You couldn't see that you were losing me

[Chorus]
Well I'm alone now but I ain't lonely
I'm on my own now
But I ain't the only
Honestly I'm fine
I'll take this time to concentrate on me
And I got possibility to keep me company

[Verse 2]
Won't you just assume he doesn't care
To internalize it all isn't fare
So I address the problem so that he's aware
But I still feel all alone even when he's there
Maybe we can fix it baby
I know we can
If I make you miss it baby
Then maybe you will understand

[Chorus]
That I'm alone now but I ain't lonely
I'm on my own now
But I ain't the only
Honestly I'm fine
I'll take this time to concentrate on me
And I got possibility to keep me company

[Chorus]
Well I'm alone now but I ain't lonely
I'm on my own now
But I ain't the only
Honestly I'm fine
I'll take this time to concentrate on me
And I got possibility to keep me company

[Verse 1]
Turning and turning within the widening gyre
The falcon cannot hear the falconer
Things fall apart, the centre cannot hold
And a blood-dimmed tide is loosed upon the world

[Verse 2]
Nothing is sacred, the ceremony sinks
Innocence is drowned in anarchy
The best lack conviction, given some time to think
And the worst are full of passion without mercy

[Chorus]
Surely some revelation is at hand
Surely it's the second coming and the wrath has finally taken form
For what is this rough beast, its hour come at last
Slouching towards Bethlehem to be born
Slouching towards Bethlehem to be born
Oh, oh, to be born

[Verse 3]
Hoping and hoping, as if with my weak faith
The spirit of this world would heal and rise
Vast are the shadows that straddle and strafe
And struggle in the darkness, troubling my eyes

[Verse 4]
Shaped like a lion, it has the head of a man
With a gaze as blank and pitiless as the sun
As it's moving its slow thighs across the desert sands
Through dark indignant reeling falcons

[Chorus]
Surely some revelation is at hand
Surely it's the second coming and the wrath has finally taken form
For what is this rough beast, its hour come at last
Slouching towards Bethlehem to be born
Slouching towards Bethlehem to be born
Oh, oh, to be born
Head of a man, shape of a lion

[Verse 5]
Raging and raging, it rises from the deep
Opening its eyes after twenty centuries
Vexed to a nightmare out of a stony sleep
By a rocking cradle by the Sea of Galilee

[Chorus]
Surely some revelation is at hand
Surely it's the second coming and the wrath has finally taken form
For what is this rough beast, its hour come at last
Slouching towards Bethlehem to be born
Slouching towards Bethlehem to be born
Oh, oh, to be born
Head of a man, shape of a lion
To be born
Head of a man, shape of a lion
Shape of a lion
Head of a man, shape of a lion

[Chorus]
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night

[Verse 1]
Bruce Berry was a workin' man (Tonight)
He used to load that Econoline van
A sparkle was in his eye
But his life was in his hand
And people let me tell you
Late at night when the people were gone
He used to pick up my guitar
And sing a song in a shaky voice
That was real as the day is long

[Chorus]
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night

[Verse 2]
Well, early in the mornin' at the break of day
He used to sleep until the afternoon
If you never heard him sing
I guess you won't too soon
'Cause people let me tell you
It sent a chill up and down my spine
When I picked up the telephone
And heard that he died out on the mainline

[Chorus]
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night (Tonight's the night)
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night

[Verse 3]
Bruce Berry was a workin' man
He used to load that Econoline van
And early in the mornin' about the break of day
He used to sleep until the afternoon

[Outro]
Tonight's the night
Tonight
Night
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night
Tonight (Tonight's the night)
Tonight's the night
Tonight
Tonight
Woah
Maybe I don't wanna know the reason why
But lately you don't talk to me
And darling I can't see me in your eyes
I hold you near, but you're so far away
But let your love flow back to me
How can you leave and let this feeling die
(You alone)You alone are the living thing that keeps me alive
And tomorrow (tomorrow) if I'm here without your love
You know I can't survive
(Only my love)Only my love can raise you high above it all
Don't throw it all away, our love, our love
Don't throw it all away, our love
Don't throw it all away, our love, our love
Don't throw it all away, our love
We can take the darkness and make it full of light
But let your love flow back to me
How can you leave and let this feeling die?
(Happy room) This happy room would be a lonely place when you are gone
(And I)And I won't even have your shoulder for the crying on
(No other love) no other woman's love could be as true
I'm begging you
Don't throw it all away, our love, our love
Don't throw it all away, our love
Don't throw it all away, our love, our love
Don't throw it all away, our love
We changed the world we made
It ours to hold but dreams are made for those who really
Try This losing you is real but I still feel you here
Inside
Don't throw it all away, our love, our love
Don't throw it all away, our love(x6)
---
.
Well, I don't know why I love you like I do
Nobody in the world can get along with you
You got the ways of a devil sleeping in a lion's den
I come home last night, you wouldn't even let me in

Well, sometimes you're as sweet as anybody want to be
When you get a crazy notion jumpin' all over me
Well, you give me the blues, I guess you're satisfied
An' you give me the blues, I wanna lay down and die

I helped you when you had no shoes on your feet, pretty mama
I helped you when you had no food to eat
You're the kind of woman I just don't understand
You're takin' all my money and give it to another man

Well, you're the kinda woman makes a man lose his brains
You're the kinda woman drives a man insane
You give me the blues, I guess you're satisfied
You give me the blues, I wanna lay down and die
Well, you give me the blues, I wanna lay down and die
What're you doing on your back?
What're you doing on your back?
You should be dancing, yeah
Dancing, yeah

My baby moves at midnight
Goes right on till the dawn
My woman takes me higher
My woman keeps me warm

What're you doing on your back?
What're you doing on your back?
You should be dancing, yeah
Dancing, yeah

She's juicy and she's trouble
She gets it to me good
My woman gives me power
Goes right down to my blood

What you doing on your back?
What you doing on your back?
You should be dancing, yeah
Dancing, yeah
What you doing on your back, aah?
What you doing on your back, aah?
You should be dancing, yeah

You should be dancing, yeah
You should be dancing, yeah
You should be dancing, yeah
You should be dancing, yeah
You should be dancing, yeah...
When I believed in nothing I called her name
Trapped in a high-dollar joint in some place I called her name
And though my days were slipping by
And nights so cruel I thought I'd die
She danced her little dance 'till it made me cry
She was shakin' like this honey doing that

When I needed soul revival I called your name
When I was falling to pieces I screamed in pain

Your soothing hand that turned me round
A love so real swept over me
You danced your little dance 'till it made me cry
You were shakin' like this honey doing that

Never let me down
She never let me down
Never let me down
She never let me down

When all your faith is failing Call my name
When you've got nothing coming Call my name
I'll be strong for all it takes
I'll cover your head till the bad stuff breaks
I'll dance my little dance till it makes you smile
Shaking like this honey doing that

Never let you down
I'll never let you down
I'll never let you down
I'll never let you down
Oh no

I had an Uncle name of Matthew
He was his father's only boy
Born just south of Colby, Kansas
He was his mother's pride and joy

Yes, and joy was just a thing that he was raised on
Love was just a way to live and die
Gold was just a windy Kansas wheatfield
Blue was just a Kansas summer sky

All the stories that he told me
Back when I was just a lad
All the memories that he gave me
All the good times that he had

Growin' up a Kansas farmboy
Life was mostly havin' fun
Ridin' on his Daddy's shoulders
Behind a mule beneath the sun

Yes, and joy was just a thing that he was raised on
Love was just a way to live and die
Gold was just a windy Kansas wheatfield
Blue was just a Kansas summer sky
Well, I guess there were some hard times
And I'm told some years were lean
They had a storm in forty-seven
A twister came and stripped 'em clean

He lost the farm and lost his family
He lost the wheat and lost his home
But he found the family Bible
A faith as solid as a stone

Yes, and joy was just a thing that he was raised on
Love was just a way to live and die
Gold was just a windy Kansas wheatfield
Blue was just a Kansas summer sky

And so he came to live at our house
And he came to work the land
He came to ease my daddy's burden
And he came to be my friend

And so I wrote this down for Matthew
And it's for him this song is sung
Ridin' on his Daddy's shoulders
Behind a mule beneath the sun

Yes, and joy was just a thing that he was raised on
Love was just a way to live and die
Gold was just a windy Kansas wheatfield
Blue was just a Kansas summer sky
Yes, and joy was just a thing that he was raised on
Love was just a way to live and die
Gold was just a windy Kansas wheatfield
Blue was just a Kansas summer sky
How low can you go? (x8)
How low can you go? (x8)

Luda!
She could go lower than I ever really thought she could
Face down, ass up!
The top of your booty jiggling out your jeans
Baby, pull your pants up
I like it when I see you do it
Better than I've ever seen it done before
A lot of women drop it to the ground
But how low can you go?
Lower than your mama's ever seen it in her lifetime
Never would've imagined did not even in her right mind
Practice in front of that mirror
Now you doing it on the dance floor
Mad 'cause I can't get wit ya chick just show me how to dance (OH!)
I may not wanna get low so I post it up kinda like a playa do
But if you come to the crib
Then I might show you girls a thang or two
Yeah, I think you a superstar wit a ass like that you gotta blow
Before you make it big
There's just one thing that I gotta know
How low can you go? (x8)
Go low, (Go low) lower than you know (x4)

I be like Nick-nac-paddywac
Oh where my kitty cat give a dog a bone
How many licks does it takes till I get to the center and let a realer nigga take you home
I could make me show stop
Soon as you hear this flow pop
From A-T-L-A-N-T-A and all the way down to your drop
Put the needle on a record and I make her get lower than a Lamborghini
And if she really gettin low then Ima shoot a video and put it all on TV
'Cause I like that French vanilla and the caramel
But when it comes to chocolate
I know that very well
Asian persuasion
No discrimination
I love how they seem to please us
I wanna taste them butterican pecan peanut buttercups like Reese's Pieces
'Cause I think you a superstar
With a ass like that you gotta blow
Before you make it big
Well there just one thing that I gotta know

How low can you go? (x8)
Go low, (Go low) lower than you know (x4)
Drop it, hit it, dump it, split it
Don't stop (Get it, get it)
Put it on reverse just to back it up
Let me put some Luda in it
Show me what you workin wit
I'll show you some of this bank roll
Yea you a superstar there's just one thing I gotta know so

How low can you go? (x8)
Go low, (Go low) lower than you know (x4)

[Verse 1]
Rousseau walks on trumpet paths
Safaris to the heart of all that jazz
Through I-bars and girders, through wires and pipes
The mathematic circuits of the modern nights
Through huts, through Harlem, through jails and gospel pews
Through the class on Park and the trash on Vine
Through Europe and the deep, deep heart of Dixie blue
Through savage progress cuts the jungle line

[Verse 2]
In a low-cut blouse she brings the beer
Rousseau paints a jungle flower behind her ear
Those cannibals of shuck and jive
They'll eat a working girl like her alive
With his hard-edged eye and his steady hand
He paints the cellar full of ferns and orchid vines
And he hangs a moon above a five-piece band
He hangs it up above the jungle line

[Verse 3]
The jungle line, the jungle line
Screaming in a ritual of sound and time
Floating, drifting on the air-conditioned wind
And drooling for a taste of something smuggled in
Pretty women funneled through valves and smoke
Coy and bitchy, wild and fine
And charging elephants and chanting slaving boats
Charging, chanting down the jungle line

[Verse 4]
There's a poppy wreath on a soldier's tomb
There's a poppy snake in a dressing room
Poppy poison, poppy tourniquet
It slithers away on brass like mouthpiece spit
And metal skin and ivory birds
Go steaming up to Rousseau's vines
They go steaming up to Brooklyn Bridge
Steaming, steaming, steaming up the jungle line
Well, I had to move fast
And I couldn't with you around my neck
I said I'd send for you and I did
What did you expect?
My hands are sweating
And we haven't even started yet
I'll go along with the charade
Until I can think my way out
I know it was all a big joke
Whatever it was about
Someday maybe
I'll remember to forget

I'm gonna get my coat
I feel the breath of a storm
There's something I've got to do tonight
You go inside and stay warm

Has anybody seen my love
Has anybody seen my love
Has anybody seen my love
I don't know
Has anybody seen my love?
You want to talk to me
Go ahead and talk
Whatever you got to say to me
Won't come as any shock
I must be guilty of something
You just whisper it into my ear
Madame Butterfly
She lulled me to sleep
In a town without pity
Where the water runs deep
She said, "Be easy, baby
There ain't nothin' worth stealin' in here."

You're the one I've been looking for
You're the one that's got the key
But I can't figure out whether I'm too good for you
Or you're too good for me

Has anybody seen my love
Has anybody seen my love
Has anybody seen my love
I don't know
Has anybody seen my love?

Well, they're not showing any lights tonight
And there's no moon
There's just a hot-blooded singer
Singing "Memphis in June,"
While they're beatin' the devil out of a guy
Who's wearing a powder-blue wig
Later he'll be shot
For resisting arrest
I can still hear his voice crying
In the wilderness
What looks large from a distance
Close up ain't never that big
Never could learn to drink that blood
And call it wine
Never could learn to hold you, love
And call you mine
You simply can't forget her
The moment you have met her
Your heart will never ever be the same
Tina, Tina, nobody else but Tina
That's the little lady's name

And once you've gone and kissed her
Give up you can't resist her
Your thoughts will wear her picture like a frame
Tina, Tina, nobody quite like Tina
That's the little lady's name

She'll merely smile and in a twinkling
You'll swear that smile contains a star
Before that smile you had no inkling
How much in love you really are

Let others look for angels
I have no time for angels
I've found someone more than just divine
Tina, Tina, no sir you can't have Tina
Tina is mine all mine, Tina is mine all mine
Throw that bundle out before they get here
Let some shark drag the thing away
I can see the headlights drawing very near
Let me do the talking now just in case fix you face
We can make the border by tomorrow
If your brilliant young Madonna doesn't do us in
We should have given her the shot that you took
And put her away

Gimme the goods and half of the action
You get the dame and get away
For me it's too late
But you can go straight back to the East Bay
Outta here

Oakland California 1948
Stella promised Blackie she was going straight
Now Blackie my main man he takes the major leagues
He could sell Geronimo a string of beads
But Stella could sell Blackie almost anything
He's lucky she ain't yet sold him up the stream
Just one more job could put us back on Easy Street
C'mon baby
Gimme the goods and half of the action
You get the dame and get away
For me it's too late
But you can go straight back to the East Bay
Outta here

I said Blackie you can't listen to the dame
She's gone back on her promise now it's a losing game
But we pulled off the job anyway
And she cursed the day we met
And Blackie took a slug or two he won't forget
By now the kerbs were shining with the falling rain
And I kept dousing Blackie just to keep him sane
I'm wondering if it's over now or just my fevered brain

Gimme the goods and half of the action
You get the dame and get away
For me it's too late
But you can go straight back to the East Bay
Outta here

Gimme the goods and half of the action
You get the dame and get away
For me it's too late
But you can go straight back to the East Bay
Outta here
Gimme the goods and half of the action
You get the dame and get away
For me it's too late
But you can go straight back to the East Bay
Outta here

Gimme the goods and half of the action
You get the dame and get away
For me it's too late
But you can go straight back to the East Bay
Outta here
Standing on the crosswalk
Wonder which direction to go
Listen to the small talk
Claiming how they told me so

I improvise
Have to keep going for the song and the road
A lonely rise
Now I'm relying on a song of my own

Early on detected
Trouble had divided in two
Acting unaffected
Reflecting on the things I do

A solo rise
Have to keep going for the song and the road
Temptation sighs
Leave us a memory we've loved and known

Fighting the lead
I was so confused
Feeling so accused
A solo rise
Have to keep going for the song and the road
Temptation sighs
Leave us a memory we've loved and known
What can I do?

[Verse 1: Ronald Isley]
Lyin' beside you
Baby come closer, baby come closer
Touchin' your body
Baby come closer, baby come closer

[Chorus: Ronald Isley]
Oh, let's make love tonight
Love me by candlelight, turn off the lights
Oh, let's make love tonight
Love me by candlelight, turn off the lights, baby

I'm caught in your passion
Nothin' feels better, it feels so right, baby
Feel me inside you
Nothin' feels better, ah baby

Oh, let's make love tonight
Love me by candlelight, turn off the lights, baby
Oh, let's make love tonight
Love me by candlelight, ooh baby

[Bridge: Ronald Isley, The Isley Brothers]
Ooh, love shadows in the night
Reflects our moods, oh, you're so sexy, woman
(So good to me)
Love so intense, so full of life
Oh, you just lose me within the fragrance of your body
(You're so good to me)
Woo, let's take our time tonight
And I'll love you tender, oh, you know that, baby
(You're so good to me)
Ooh, so come with me tonight
Oh, it's alright, woo hoo, ooh

Stay with me, baby
Turn off the lights, don't you go nowhere
(You feel good to me)
Hmm ah (giggle)

Gather round all you people
Watch me while you can
I've been trawling too long
I've been losing out strong
For the strength of another man

I've been hasty, wasty
Sitting on the backstep
Waiting for the phone to ring]
This semi-acoustic love affair
Is driving me to the brink

I'm just looking for a friend
I'm just looking for a friend
You don't have to be a big wheel
You don't have to be the end
I'm just looking for
Looking for a friend
God help all you ladies
May the devil take all you men
You're far too busy having babies
To help yourselves to a friend

You're lazy, crazy
Hung upon the insane
Standing with your back to the wall]
My pretty has a picture, oh-so nice
Hoping that you might call

I'm just looking for a friend
I'm just looking for a friend
You don't have to be a big wheel
You don't have to be the end
I'm just looking for
Looking for a friend

Hey
Hey looking

I'm just looking for a friend
I'm just looking for a friend
Oh, you don't have to be a big wheel
You don't have to be the end
I'm just looking for
Looking for a friend
Looking
Just a-cruising
Vulgar
Just looking (giggle)

Don't have to be a big wheel
Don't have to be the end
I'm just looking for
Looking for a friend

Oh yeah (etc.)
Hope they never end this song
This could take us all night long
I looked at the moon and I felt blue
Then I looked again and I saw you
Eyes like fire in the night
Bridges burning with their light
Now I want to spend the whole night through
And Honey, Yes, I'd like to spend it all on you

Love, look what you've done to me
Never thought I'd fall again so easily
Oh, love, you wouldn't lie to me
Leading me to feel this way...

They might fade and turn to stone
Let's get crazy all alone
Hold me closer than you'd ever dare
Close your eyes and I'll be there
After all is said and done
After all you are the one
Take me up your stairs and through the door
Take me where we don't care anymore...
Love, look what you've done to me
Never thought I'd fall again so easily
Oh, love, you wouldn't lie to me... would you
Leading me to feel this way...

Love, look what you've done to me
Never thought I'd fall again so easily
Oh, love, you wouldn't lie to me
Leading me to feel this way...

[Verse 1]
Ooh, words seem to fail me
Whenever you are near
I've gotta get myself together
(Gotta get myself together)
And tell you just how much I care
'Cause when you look at me
I get weak in my knees
My heart won't let me be
Won't you help me, please
I really love you

[Chorus]
Darling, you're wonderful (Wonderful)
Darling, you're wonderful (Wonderful)
You are so divine (So divine)
You're my heavenly dream, oh yeah

[Verse 2]
You're a cool, cool breeze
That caress me on a hot and summer night
I suffer so much, baby
When you're out of my sight
So baby come to my arms
Let me thrill to your charms
So I won't be alone
You'll be the queen of my throne, hey baby, mhm

[Outro]
Darling, you're wonderful (Wonderful)
Darling, you're wonderful (Wonderful)
The Spinners would say:
You're a sweet thing, baby (Sweet thing)
Ooh, you're a sweet, sweet thing (Sweet thing)
Stevie Wonder would say:
You are uptight (Uptight and out of sight)
Oh baby, clean out of sight (Uptight and out of sight)
Sam Cooke would say:
I know, I know, I know, I know (Wonderful)
You know that I know you're wonderful (Wonderful)
From the little town I ran from
To the city where I strayed
There's been some good time living
And some good music played
And some good loving made
I like it
I like it just that way

I wanna roll roll roll forever
I wanna feel the beat go on
I wanna roll roll roll forever
I wanna feel it till it's gone
I wanna roll roll roll forever
And live from song to song
Right there in the music
Is right where I belong

When I meet my Maker
With my music in my hand
He'll smile down when He sees me
And ask about the band
I know He'll understand
He knows life
And life can be so grand
I wanna roll roll roll forever
I wanna feel the beat go on
I wanna roll roll roll forever
I wanna feel it till it's gone
I wanna roll roll roll forever
And live from song to song
Right there in the music
Is right where I belong
Baby, if you can't do no better
I think I'd better get me a woman that can
Well, if you can't do no better, woman
I think I'd better get me a babe that can
Yes, you're goin' around cheatin' and lyin'
You ain't doin' nothin' but losin' a good man

Well, life is too short to be worryin', woman
Babe and you're old enough to understand
Yes, life is too short to be worryin', woman
And you're old enough to understand
Baby, if you can't do no better, baby
I think I'd better get me a woman that can

Oh, if I never said hello to you, woman
Than I wouldn't be sayin' goodbye
Oh, I've got my bags already packed, woman
I'm so hurt I wanna cry
Yes, what makes, what makes you treat me like you do, baby?
Yes I wanna know, tell me why
"Gentlemen, let's broaden our minds! Lawrence!"

Oh, yeah yeah!
All hail the new king in town
Young and old, gather 'round (Yeah)

[Verse 1]
Five o'clock in the morning I hear the phone ringing
Yo, what up Dunn?
What up son? Sorry were you sleeping?
Nah, just finished reading this ill ass novel
Not the one about the girl who left her family up in Kabul?
That's the one, that shit was sad had me crying on the pages
Yo, I read that mother fucker had me sad as fuck for ages
Yo! We should start a book club!
Yo, son I hear you talking, how about Sunday afternoons right after speed walking?
That's a date, but I know that ain't the reason for your calling
No doubt, you're so observant, must of noticed I was stalling
Yo, best friends gotta tell each other their secrets
I just came from Pam's work and she dipped my heart in shit
Yo what, that's Baskin Robbins
Yo, yo, you know the spot where you order frozen treats and they rip your heart apart
Yo, I got what you need at the house, you cool to drive?
I'm pretty broken up I might not make it there alive
Don't talk like that, now you're making me want to cry
Yo, it's cool son, I'm fine, I'll be over there in five

[Chorus]
Ay yo it's ill when I'm heated
Now my heart stay cold
Now my heart stay cold
Now my heart stay cold
Ay yo it's ill when I'm heated
Now my heart stay cold
Now my heart stay cold
Now my heart stay cold

[Verse 2]
Yo son, your house looks beautiful did you redecorate?
Nah kid the French lighting really opens up the place
Well it feels so spacious
It's an optical illusion
You didn't knock down a wall?
Nah son, its light diffusion
My girlfriend Pam and I were planning on doing some home remodeling
Yeah, she borrowed all my copies of Better Homes and Gardening
Yo, I mean ex girlfriend, can't believe this shit is happening
Yo have this cup of tea
Man you'll never see those magazines
This tea is delicious what did you say it was?
Chamomile mother fucker!
Is it caffeinated cuz?
Nah I'm trying to cut down
Me and Pam were gonna too, thought we'd always be a couple, not the one but the two
No doubt son, even when I was in my abusive relationship
I would look to you and Pam and know that true love could exist
You for real guy, I never knew you felt like that
No doubt Dunny, I thought you were a perfect match

[Chorus]
Ay yo it's ill when I'm heated
Now my heart stay cold
Now my heart stay cold
Now my heart stay cold
Ay yo it's ill when I'm heated
Now my heart stay cold
Now my heart stay cold
Now my heart stay cold

[Verse 3]
Yo kid, this red wine has got me feeling fucked up
Watch out Dunny, you just knocked some right out of my cup
Oh fuck, that's my bad it's all over your slacks
No doubt son I'm soaked from the front to the back
Oh shit, you're getting naked!
Of course I am, bet, we gotta get these in the wash before the stain sets
Ah fuck man, you just get wine all over my vest
Yo take your shirt off real quick before it seeps down to your chest
Yo kid we're both buck naked. Are you uncomfortable?
Nah kid, we're two grown men and we're both heterosexual
Word up son!
Hold on yo, did you just hear something?
Goddman, it's fucking Pam, she must've let herself in
What up Pam, how's it going? What an awkward situation
Yo, if you didn't know better this might look incriminating
Yo, what wacky circumstances to lead all of this to happen
Yo, just like on fucking Seinfeld or Curb Your Enthusiasm
Yo, those were both by Larry David
No doubt, Dunny that's true
Wait Pam don't go, if you leave now we're through
Yo, I'm sorry son, damn, what a tragic way to end
The important thing now is that we're naked and we're friends
May God bless and keep you always
May your wishes all come true
May you always do for others
And let others do for you
May you build a ladder to the stars
And climb on every rung
May you stay forever young
Forever young, forever young
May you stay forever young

May you grow up to be righteous
May you grow up to be true
May you always know the truth
And see the lights surrounding you
May you always be courageous
Stand upright and be strong
May you stay forever young
Forever young, forever young
May you stay forever young

May your hands always be busy
May your feet always be swift
May you have a strong foundation
When the winds of changes shift
May your heart always be joyful
May your song always be sung
May you stay forever young
Forever young, forever young
May you stay forever young
Oh my god... What chu doin to me?
Only if you knew, listen
I ain't even gonna tell you listen...

[Chorus:]
I like the way you do it
I like the way you move it
I like the way you pump
Baby work it for me
(Yeah! Come on!)
(Work baby Work!)
I like the way you do it
I like the way you move it

Baby work it for me
(Baby doll, listen to Mark)
See the week is here

Cash, gold, diamonds and pearls
Anything to make you mine
See I really can\'t seem to get you off my mind

[Chorus:]
I like the way you do it

Sendin chills up an down me
Girl I don\'t know what to do
But all I know is I wanna get get next to you
So ya know the next time I catch you makin eyes at me
I guess I\'ll have to satisfy my curiosity
Or maybe I\'ll drop a line
Or maybe I'll just get cha with some nursery crimes and
Work! Baby work!
Til it hurts! Til it hurts baby!
There\'s no game without pain
So girl I ain't the type to stand up for
Those cuddle or show the world girl

[Chorus: 2X]
I like the way you do it
I like the way you move it
I like the way you pump
Baby work it for meh

(Rap)
Now honey
I wi
You painted your lips baby
And you painted your eyes too
Its gettin' to the place now woman
Till I can't hardly recognize you
If that's what it takes to be hip baby
Oh, I want you to be a square
I don't want you messing around baby
Oh, I don't want you cutting of your hair

I didn't say nothing to you baby
When you were wearing bikinis for close
Oh I even stood around baby
I watched you paint your toes
If that's what it takes to be hip baby
Oh, I want you to be a square
I don't want you messing up woman
Oh, I don't want you cutting of your hair

There's something about your girlfriend baby
I swear I can't understand
She got her hair cutt off the other day
And now she looks just like a man
If that's what it takes to be hip baby
Oh, I want you to be a square
I don't want you messing up baby
Oh, I don't want you cutting of your hair

[Intro]
Baby, I'm so glad you're here
So many things I wanna tell you
So many things I wanna talk to you about
'Cause you are the strength that I hold on to
And I hope that I am the strength that you hold on to
So we can strive together and be perfect
'Til death do us part

[Verse 1]
The night is gone, the morning's here
And soon it's time to talk about
Where we stand and where we plan to be
Our life long years, I need to know
I keep crying tears of joy
I guess that's what you're put here for
To change these tears of pain to tears of happiness

[Chorus]
In my trying times
Trying to get the best of me
I'm still finding time to show I care
With my crying eyes
I see contentment because of you

[Verse 2]
Trials and tribulations
Build up walls in front of our faces
Made of stone
Yet we stand strong enough
To break the walls down to journey on
But I know if we just bond our hearts
There will be nothing that will stand in our way
And we'll be together forever and a day

[Chorus]
In my trying times
Trying to get the best of me
I'm still finding time to show I care
With my crying eyes
I see contentment because of you
In my trying times
Trying to get the best of me
I'm still finding time to show I care
With my crying eyes
I see contentment because of you

[Outro]
Through the trying times
Trying to get the best of me
I'm still finding time to show I care
With my crying eyes
I see contentment because of you
Through the trying times
They trying to get the best of me
I'm still finding time to show I care
With my crying eyes
I see contentment because of you
Through the trying times
They trying to get the best of me
I'm still finding time to show I care
With my crying eyes
I see contentment because of you
Every time i look down on this timeless town
Whether blue or gray be her skies
Whether loud be her cheers, or whether soft be her tears
More and more do I realize that...

I love Paris in the spring time
I love Paris in the fall
I love Paris in the summer when it sizzles
I love Paris in the winter when it drizzles

I love Paris every moment
Every moment of the year
I love Paris, why oh why do I love Paris
Because my love is here

You never seem to want my romancing
The only time you hold me is when we're dancing

I don't know why I love you like I do
I don't know why, but I do

[Instrumental-first four lines]

You never seem to want my romancing
The only time you hold me is when we're dancing

[Intro]
Higher, higher
Fire

[Verse 1]
Don't change your style now that you've reached the top
Don't choose your friends by what they've got
Remember beneath the glitter and gleam
Like everyday people you're just a human being

[Bridge]
Superstar, good God
Enjoy your champagne and caviar
And your chauffeur driven fancy car
But remember how you got where you are
Oh ho ho, 'cause the same folks that made you
Mhm, you better believe they can break you

[Verse 2]
No, you didn't make it all by yourself
You had help from somebody else
The truth is the light, don't let it depress you
You just be thankful that the good Lord made you

[Chorus]
Superstar, ah, do you know who your real friends are?
I'm talkin' to you
Superstar, remember how you got where you are

[Bridge]
Ah ah, down, down, down, down
Drummer keep it going, going
Horns starts blowin'
Right on time, blow my mind
Higher, higher, higher, higher

[Verse 3]
It's easy for you to look down
Turn up your nose and frown
Now that you're on top (Top)
(Bright lights)
Don't let the bright lights blind you
(Bridges)
Don't burn 'em behind you

[Chorus]
Superstar, good God, do you know who your real friends are?
I'm talkin' to you
Superstar, remember how you got where you are

[Outro]
Don't change your style now that you've reached the top
Don't choose your friends by what they've got
Remember beneath the glitter and gleam
Like everyday people you're just a human being
Superstar, good God, do you know who your real friends are?
I'm talkin' to you
Superstar, remember how you got where you are

[Verse 1]
She took off her dress, and I took a peek
While thunder storm played hide and seek
I begged for a kiss, she gave me seven
Our lips touched and it feel like heaven

[Chorus]
Everything I want is what she does to me
She don't blush 'cause she's so damned free
When she makin' love it's like surgery
And she say, ooh
I love you in me

[Verse 2]
I promised myself not to come until she does
And she took both hands and a liar I was
No man in this world could ever hope to last
When my baby down shifts
And starts pumpin' fast

[Chorus]
Everything I want is what she does to me
She don't blush 'cause she's so damned free
When she makin' love it's like surgery
And she say, ooh
I love you in me

[Bridge]
I love you, I love you, in me

[Verse 3]
Our bodies sink in a pool of sweat
It's the kind of love that you never forget (Never forget)
With you honey, I'm the richest in the world (So rich)
I don't need money 'cause you're my girl
(Need money cause you're my girl)

[Chorus]
Everything I want is what she does to me
She don't blush 'cause she's so damned free
When she makin' love it's like surgery
And she say, ooh
I love you in me

[Modified Chorus]
Everything I want is what she does to me
Ou don't blush 'cause she's so damned free (So free)
When we makin' love it's like surgery (Yeah)
And she say, ooh
I love you in me
Oh, I have seen
Such madness in the air
Just like a dream
It makes no sense anywhere

Hopes have shattered
Shattered like broken glass
I believed
It was just too good to last

(It seemed to me it was too good to last)

So now you're saying you've been wrong
And you want to come back home
You know I've known all along
That you had a heart of stone

And now you want to change your song
You're tired of living alone
You know I've known all along
That you had a heart made of stone
But don't you remember
Those days of cold delight
When we knew that together
We could make it all right

It seems so long ago
Oh, maybe it was yesterday
Where did the time go?
I guess it just slipped away

(Seemed like the time was slipping away)

So now you're saying you've been wrong
And you want to come back home
You know I've known all along
That you had a heart of stone

And now you want to change your song
You're tired of living alone
You know I've known all along
That you had a heart made of stone

You're never too old to learn
You're never too young to pray
It's never too late to learn
And hope for better days
You're never too old to learn
You're never too young to pray
It's never too late to learn
And hope for better days

So now you're saying you've been wrong
And you want to come back home
You know I've known all along
That you had a heart of stone

And now you want to change your song
You're tired of living alone
You know I've known all along
That you had a heart made of stone

So now you're saying you've been wrong
And you want to come back home
You know I've known all along
That you had a heart of stone
I touch your hand
And my arms grow strong
Like a pair of birds
That burst with song
My eyes look down
At your lovely face
And I hold the world
In my embrace

Younger than springtime are you
Softer than starlight are you;
Warmer than winds of June are the gentle lips you gave me
Gayer than laughter are you
Sweeter than music are you;
Angel and lover, heaven and earth
Are you to me

And when your youth and joy invade my arms
And fill my heart, as now they do
Then younger than springtime am I
Gayer than laughter am I
Angel and lover, heaven and earth
Am I with you
Thank you so much, we thank you

Thank you ladies and gentlemen
Right here we're going all back to the begun
All we go to the very beginnin'
Before we made this and very few people knew about, B.B. King

We go all back this time
You remind and go back one time, do you?
Sometimes you feel good go back and start all over again
Oh boy!
You show so good to me, I will tell that
That you are

Now here it is, three o'clock in the morning
Oh can't even close my eyes
Oh yes
It's three o'clock in the morning baby
Oh, I can't even close my eyes
Well, you know I can't find my baby
Keep on lookin' be satisfied
I've looked around me, people
Hey, and my baby she knows she can't be found
Looked all around me, people
Oh, my baby, she can't be found
Well, you know if I don't find my baby
People, I'm going down to the Golden Ground

That's where the fellows hang out down there
They shoot pool, you know

Goodbye, everybody
Oh, I do believe this is the end
Oh, oh, goodbye everybody
Oh I do believe that this is the end
Oh I want you to tell my baby
Oh, to forgive me for my sins

A guy feels lonely then, when you hear something like that
You can't do whatever you wanna do
Because your mind is on the person you know
You figure something you've done
You don't know what it is because she won't tell you
But every time you look at her, she just starts to crying and won't say nothing
Then you say to yourself

It's my own fault, baby
Treat me the way you wanna do
Oh, yes, my own fault, baby
Treat me the way you wanna do
Because when you would love me, baby
Oh, a good time looked down
That wouldn't be true
I go up on my feet and I had a lot of friends
Now bad luck has hit me people
And now I'm down again
Oh, I wonder why?
Why does everything have to happen to me?
I'm blue and I'm lonesome, people
My heart is filled with misery

Once I had a lotta money
They say the greatest man until
But bad luck has hit me now
Pain has got me down
Yes, I wonder why, people
Why does everything have to happen to me?
I say I'm blue and I'm lonesome, people
My heart is filled with misery
I was born in Georgia 27 years ago
Yes I was
I was born down in Georgia, people let me tell you, 27 years ago
Augusta Georgia, thatâs what Iâm talkinâ about
Iâve had heartaches and misery
And I ainât got no place to go

Have you ever seen a man, with tears rolling down his face
Good God, all-mighty, you know what Iâm talking about
Have you ever seen a man, with tears rolling down his face
You know what Iâm talking about
They say that a man, a man ainât supposed to cry
But somebody tell me what else can I do?
But my little girl has walked out on me

Mama, ooh mama mama
Can you hear your little boy calling your name
Yeah yeah
Ooh mama mama mama can you hear your little boy calling your name
The blues has got me, and Iâm in so much misery and pain
Somebody, somebody listen to what I got to say
I need a little help, I need a little help right now
Lord I need I need a helping hand
Good God almighty
I said I need a little help right now, Lord I need a helping hand
My life, my life just ainât no good
And Iâm living in the world, without a helping hand
Somebody come on and help me out here
Come on, come on and help me out right now

So long, everybody
Lord I donât see no reason to stay around
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Let me say it again
I said so long, goodbye everybody
Lord I donât see no reason to stay around
Well now, the little girl that I love has gone and left me
And all my friends, all my friends have put me down
All my friends have put me down

[Verse 1]
Save your fragile mama's heart
And while she will come for you
But I wander

[Chorus]
And I wonder just how far will you need to be
For shaking talk so easily
For hours on end, I wander
Still I don't even know her

[Verse 2]
Feel just like I need to be
Back where I was before
I couldn't go back
But I wander

[Chorus]
And I wonder just how far will you need to be
For shaking talk so easily
For hours on end, I wander
Still I don't even know

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Bridge]
How it keeps a lid on me
How it keeps a lid on me (How)
How it keeps a lid on me
How it keeps a lid on me (How)

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
And I wonder
Just how far will you need to be
For shaking tough so easily
For hours on end, I wander
(Ooh)

[Outro]
How it keeps a lid on me
How it keeps a lid on me (And I wonder)
How it keeps a lid on me (Just how far will you need to be)
How it keeps a lid on me (For shaking tough so easily)
How it keeps a lid on me (For hours on end I wonder)
How it keeps a lid on me
How it keeps a lid on me
How it keeps a lid on me

[Studio banter:]
Jay: What were you saying?
Kevin: (Laughing) That was like, the worst cymbal ever
Jay: What's upâWell, I don't understand what you're trying to tell me
Kevin: Sounds like... human hair
Jay: (Laughing) You could have waited!
(Jay plays loud drum fill)
Kevin: What, Gumby?
Jay: I said, I'm sick of you taking over
Kevin: Oh, aw
Jay: I want to record the drums on all our albums, alright?
Kevin: (Laughing)
Jay: Modular? Hear that?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I was a sailor, I was lost in sea
I was under the waves, before love rescued me
I was a fighter I could turn on a threat
Now I stand accused of the things I've said

When love comes to town
I'm gonna jump that train
When love comes to town
I'm gonna catch that flame
Maybe I was wrong to ever let you down
But I did what I did before love came to town

Used to make love under a red sunset
I was making promises I was soon to forget
She was pale as the lace of her wedding gown
But I left her standing before love came to town

Ran into a juke joint when I heard a guitar scream
The notes were turning blue when I fell into a dream
As the music played I saw my life turn around
That was the day before love came to town
Love comes to town
I'm gonna jump that train
When love comes to town
I'm gonna catch that flame
Maybe I was wrong to ever let you down
But I did what I did before love came to town

I was there when they crucified my lord
I held the scabbard when the soldier drew his sword
I threw the dice when they pierced his side
But I've seen love conquer the great divide

Yeah, Yeah, Yeah...

[Verse 1: Harry Belafonte]
She does not lazy dance
Her hands on me
She does not talk, no pretty talk
She pleasures silently
But with her, I am summer
I warm easy to her heat
She fill me full, she fill me full
She make me complete

[Chorus: Harry Belafonte, Jennifer Warnes]
Skin to skin
Skin to skin
No cold wind blow on me
No cold wind blow on me
Skin to skin
Skin to skin
The light, it shine on me
The light, it shine on me

[Verse 2: Jennifer Warnes]
He is a secret soldier
With pieces inside broke
He hides in his own darkness
His fire has no smoke
And when my body song begins
When he holds me tight
He chases all my shadows
And I burn so bright

[Chorus: Harry Belafonte, with Jennifer Warnes]
Skin to skin
Skin to skin
No cold wind blow on me
No cold wind blow on me
Skin to skin
Skin to skin
The light, it shine on me
The light, it shine on me

[Bridge: Harry Belafonte, Jennifer Warnes]
Winter inside of me
Ice to fight the storm
She cannot see what I hide in me
I can't be strong beside her warm

[Outro: Harry Belafonte, Jennifer Warnes]
Skin to skin (She's too close)
Skin to skin (Much too close)
No cold wind blow on me (She's got a hold on me)
No cold wind blow on me (She's got a hold on me)
Skin to skin (She touches soft)
Skin to skin (Ah, much too soft)
The light, it shines on me (Her fire is burning me)
The light, it shines on me (Her fire is burning me)
Skin to skin (She's too close)
Skin to skin (Ah, much too close)
No cold wind blow on me (She's got a hold on me)
No cold wind blow on me (She's got a hold on me)
Skin to skin (She touches soft)
Skin to skin (Much too soft)
The light, it shines on me (Her fire is burning on me)
The light, it shines on me (Her fire is burning on me)

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Though this world's essentially an absurd place to be living in
It doesn't call for bubble withdrawal
I've been told it's a fact of life, men have to kill one another
Well I say there are still things worth fighting for
La resistance!

[Verse 2]
Though this world's essentially an absurd place to be living in
It doesn't call for bubble withdrawal
It's said human existence is pointless
As acts of rebellious solidarity can bring sense in this world
La resistance!
La resistance!

[Outro]
Oh Death, where is thy sting?
Oh Grave, where is they victory?
Oh Life, you are a shining path
And hope springs eternal, just over the rise
When I see my redeemer beckoning me

Oh row my ship over the waves of your sea
Let me find a safe port now and then
Don't let the dark one in your sanctuary
Until it's time to pack it in

Oh, row, row my ship
With the fire of your breath
And don't lay a broadside on your ship as yet
Blow ye warm winds
When it's chilly and wet
And don't come to soon yet
For collecting my debt

Oh Death, where is thy sting?
Oh Grave, where is they victory?
Oh Life, you are a shining path
And hope springs eternal, just over the rise
When I see my redeemer beckoning me
Oh let me sail on
With my ship to the East
And keep my eye on the North Star
When the journey is no good for man or for beast
I'll be safe wherever you are

Just let me sail into your harbor of lights
And there and forever to cast out my night
Give me my task
And let me do it right
And do it with all of my might

Oh Death, where is thy sting?
Oh Grave, where is they victory?
Oh Life, you are a shining path
And hope springs eternal, just over the rise
When I see my redeemer beckoning me
After words
And long goodbyes
Tears and lies
At the end of the day

An early night
And madness rains
The moon pulls your dreams
And the pressure fades

And now
The final encore
A last farewell
The fantasy is over
The spirit flies away
I wonder what he'll think of me
I guess he'll call me the "old man"
I guess he'll think I can lick
Ev'ry other feller's father
Well, I can!
I bet that he'll turn out to be
The spittin' image of his dad
But he'll have more common sense
Than his puddin-headed father ever had
I'll teach him to wrassle
And dive through a wave
When we go in the mornin's for our swim
His mother can teach him
The way to behave
But she won't make a sissy out o' him
Not him! Not my boy! Not Bill!
Bill. I will see that he is named after me, I will
My boy, Bill! He'll be tall
And tough as a tree, will Bill!
Like a tree he'll grow
With his head held high
And his feet planted firm on the ground
And you won't see nobody dare to try
To boss or toss him around!
No pot-bellied, baggy-eyed bully'll toss him around
I don't give a damn what he does
As long as he does what he likes!
He can sit on his tail
Or work on a rail
With a hammer, hammering spikes!
He can ferry a boat on a river
Or peddle a pack on his back
Or work up and down
The streets of a town
With a whip and a horse and a hack
He can haul a scow along a canal
Run a cow around a corral
Or maybe bark for a carousel
Of course it takes talent to do that well
He might be a champ of theheavyweights
Or a feller that sells you glue
Or President of the United States
That'd be all right, too
His mother would like that
But he wouldn't be President unless he wanted to be
Not Bill!
My boy, Bill! He'll be tall
And as tough as a tree, will Bill
Like a tree he'll grow
With his head held high
And his feet planted firm on the ground
And you won't see nobody dare to try
To boss or toss him around!
No fat-bottomed, flabby-faced, pot-bellied, baggy-eyed bastard'll boss
Him around
And I'll be damned if he'll marry the boss' daughter
A skinny-lipped virgin with blood like water
Who'll give him a peck
And call it a kiss
And look in his eyes through a lorgnet
Say, why am I talkin' on like this?
My kid ain't even been born, yet!
I can see him when he's seventeen or so
And startin' to go with a girl
I can give him lots of pointers, very sound
On the way to get 'round any girl
I can tell him ...
Wait a minute!
Could it be?
What the hell!
What if he is a girl?
What would I do with her?
What could I do for her?
A bum with no money!
You can have fun with a son
But you got to be a father to a girl
She mighn't be so bad at that
A kid with ribbons in her hair!
A kind o' neat and petite
Little tin-type of her mother!
What a pair!
I can just hear myself bragging about her!
My little girl
Pink and white
As peaches and cream is she
My little girl
Is half again as bright
As girls are meant to be!
Dozens of boys pursue her
Many a likely lad does what he can to woo her
From her faithful dad
She has a few
Pink and white young fellers of two and three
But my little girl
Gets hungry ev'ry night and she come home to me!
My little girl, my little girl!
I got to get ready before she comes!
I got to make certain that she
Won't be dragged up in slums
With a lot o' bums like me
She's got to be sheltered
And be dressed in the best money can buy!
I never knew how to get money
But, I'll try, by God! I'll try!
I'll go out and make it or steal it
Or take it or die!
Wayne's world
Party time
Excellent!
MTV! hahaha
When your in Wayne's world man, you gotta understand man. Nah, for real, fuck my world man, you gotta know how to survive in the belly of the beast, man. So this what I, I'll relate it to some shit like this. I say man, if I go on a nigga bus, know what I'm saying, he a rapper. And I'm with my nigga Boo, and he going I'm with my man Spitta, and he gon' holla at one of his homies or something on they bus. And I ain't feelin the music that he playing, know what I mean. I ain't gon' go on the mans bus and be like, man this is whack. Imma be like fuck, alright, bob my fucking head stomp my feet. When I get off that bus Imma tell Spitta "boy this here was the wackest shit I ever heard." I'm gon' respect my situation man, respect something that's higher than me, man. And you ain't gotta put nobody higher, but you gotta respect your situation man

[Verse 1: Brian May]
A hand above the water
An angel reachin' for the sky
Is it raining in Heaven?
Do you want us to cry?
And everywhere the brokenhearted
On every lonely avenue
No-one could reach them
No-one but you

[Chorus: Brian May]
One by one
Only the good die young
They're only flyin' too close to the sun
And life goes on
Without you...

[Verse 2: Roger Taylor]
Another tricky situation
I get to drownin' in the blues
And I find myself thinkin'
Well, what would you do?
Yes, it was such an operation
Forever payin' every due
Hell, you made a sensation
You found a way through

[Chorus: Roger Taylor]
One by one
Only the good die young
They're only flyin' too close to the sun
We'll remember
Forever...

[Verse 3: Brian May]
And now the party must be over
I guess we'll never understand
The sense of your leavin'
Was in the way it was planned
And so we grace another table
And raise our glasses one more time
There's a face at the window
And I ain't never, never sayin' goodbye...

[Chorus]
And it's one by one
Only the good die young
They're only flyin' too close to the sun

[Outro: Brian May & Roger Taylor]
Cryin' for nothin'
Cryin' for no-one
No-one but you
I used to rule the world
Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own

I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
"Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!"

One minute I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field

For some reason I can't explain
Once you go there was never
Never an honest word
And that was when I ruled the world
It was the wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become

Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Oh who would ever want to be king?

I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field

For some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world

I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field

For some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world
Everybody knows that they're guilty
Everybody knows that they've lied
Everybody knows that they're guilty
Resting on their conscious eating their insides
Its Freedom
Said, its Freedom Time now
Its Freedom
Said its Freedom Time now
Time to get free
Oh, give yourselves up now
Its Freedom

Said, its freedom time yall
There's a war in the mind
For the territory over dominion
Who will dominate opinions
Schizims and isms
Keeping us in forms of religion
Conforming our vision
To the world church's decision
Trapped in a section
Submitted to committee elections
Moral infection
Epidemic Lies and deception
Insurrection
Of the higest possible order
Distorting our tape recorders
From hearing like under water
Beyond the borders
Finding sin in disorder
Bound by the strategy
And systemic depravity
Heavy as gravity
Head first in the cavity
Without a bottom
A fate worse than Sodom
What's got 'em drunk off the spirit?
Truth comes and we can't hear it
And you've been programmed to fear it
I had a vision
I was falling in indecision
Appalling
Calling religion some program on television
How can dominant wisdom
Be recognized in a system
Of anti-christs and majority rules
Intelligent Fools
PhDs of ilusions
Masters of mass confusion
Bachelors of Past illusions
Now, who you choosing?
The head or the tail?
The Bloodshed or the Male?
Or confidence in the veil?
Conferences at Yale
Discussing Doctrines at Baal (pronounced Bale)
Causing People to Fail
Keeping A third in jail
His word is nailed, everything to the tree
Severing all the me
From all I used to be
Formless and void
Totally paranoid
Enjoyed darkness as lord
Keeping me from the sword
Blocked from mercy
Bitter than Ceres
Hungry and thirsty
For good meat, we would eat
And still dine at the table of deceit
How incomplete
From confrontation to retreat
We belong to true enemy's defeat
Destitute a necessity
Causing desperation to get the best of me
Punishment 'till there was nothing left of me
Realizing the inescapable death of me
No options in the valley of decision
The only option supernatural circumcision
Inwardly
Only water can purge the hearts from words
The firey darts
Thrown by the workers of the arts
Iniquity
Shaping in
There's no escaping when
Your whole philosiphy is paper thin
In vanity
The wide road is insanity
Can it be all of humanity
Picture that
Scripture that
The origin of man's heart is black
How can we show up for
An invisible war
Preoccupied with a shadow
Making love with a whore
Aching in sores
Babylon the great mystery
Mother of human history
System of social socercery
Our present condition needs serious recongnition
Where's there's no repentance there can be no remission
And that sentence more serious than Vietnam
The atom bomb and Sudam and Minister Farakhan
What's going on
What's a priority to you
By what authority do we
Majority hasn't a clue
We majored in curses
Search the chapters check the verses
Recapture the land remove the mark off our hands
So we can stand
In agreement with his commands
Everything else is damned
Let them with ears understand
Everything else is damned
Let them with ears understand

I'm a be who I am
Its freedom time
Said, its freedom time
Everybody knows that they lied
Everybody knows they perpertrated inside
Everybody knows that thier guilt is
Resting on their conscious eating thier insides
Get free
Be who you're supposed to be
Freedom
Said its freedom time now
Freedom
Said its freedom time
Freedom
Freedom time now...
While in that gay tropic isle
I first saw that maiden smile
Though I had failed in the past
I said, "This is true love at last"
But then she whispered to me
That our love never could be

Destiny, oh, when will I see the day?
Hopelessly, I've wandered so long this way
"This could never be", she said pleadingly
Don't ever love me, I'm just fancy-free
"This could never be", she said pleadingly
Don't ever love me

My love was motion and grace
The moonlight soft on her face
I held her close in my arms
My heart was quick to her charms
But then I saw in her glance
It was just an evening's romance
Destiny, oh, when will I see the day?
Hopelessly, I've wandered so long this way
"This could never be", she said pleadingly
Don't ever love me, I'm just fancy-free
"This could never be", she said pleadingly
Don't ever love me
"This could never be" she said pleadingly
Don't ever love me
There is someone walking behind you
Turn around, look at me
There is someone watching your footsteps
Turn around, look at me

There is someone tells you love you
It's my heart, it's my heart
Turn around, look at me, at the start

There is someone standing beside you
Turn around (turn around), look at me (look at me)
There is someone to love and guide you
Turn around (turn around), look at me (look at me)

I'll be waiting for now and forever
For you to come to me
Turn around, look at me
Turn around, look at me

I'll be waiting for now and forever
For you to come to me
Turn around, look at me
Turn around (turn around), look at me

[Verse 1]
The ground is full of broken stones
The last leaf has fallen
I have nowhere to turn now
Not east not west
North or south
And all that's ahead of me
And everything I know
I know nothing so
So bring me home

[Verse 2]
Put me on a plate with petals and a fire
And send me out to sea
Turn my angry sword against my heart
And let me free
The dawn holds the heaviness of the night
I've heard the restless sighs and lovers lies
The brook, the beach and seen the devil's eyes
So bring me home

[Verse 3]
I've cried for the lives I've lost
Like a child in need of love
I've been so close but far away from God
My tears flow like a child's in need of love
I've cried the tears
So let the tide take me
I won't fight
I've cried the tears

[Verse 4]
The small step I need to take is a mountain
Stretched out like a lazy dog
Send me to slaughter
Lay me on the railway line
I'm far away from God
My tears flow like a child's in need of love
I've cried the tears
So build the fire and light the flame
Bring me home

[Intro]
You're in the middle of June in the summer of '59, I was young and cool, shot a bad game of pool, and I hustled all the chumps I could find. Now they call me the swan cause I wave my magic wand and I loved all the women to death. I partied hard, packed a mean rod, and I'll knock you out with a right or left

[Verse 1]
Nevermind the Pack Jam
Nevermind the Gap Band
Nevermind the Zapp Band
Nevermind the funk scam

[Chorus]
'Cause we're Red Hot Chili Peppers

[Verse 2]
Nevermind the British bands
Nevermind the synth funk bands
Nevermind the Wham Wham band
Nevermind Duran Duran

[Chorus]
'Cause we're Red Hot Chili Peppers

[Verse 3]
Nevermind the Soft Cell shit
That's strictly for the twits
Nevermind the Men At Work
Those tunes are for the jerks

[Chorus]
'Cause we're Red Hot Chili Peppers

[Verse 4]
Nevermind Hall and Oates
Those guys are a couple of goats
Nevermind the Culture Club
That jive's just one big flub

[Chorus]
'Cause we're Red Hot Chili Peppers

[Intro: Man & Boyz II Men]
One, two, one, two, three
Ba-dum-ba-dum-dum-bop-boo-be-doo
Ba-do-ah, ba-do-ah, ba-do-ooh, ooh
Yo fellas?
Yo, yo what's happenin'
Yo, man, why don't we do something for the jeeps you know?
Yeah, like what though? (That's cool)
Like some harmony over the hip-hop tracks?
Yeah (Oh yeah), I'm with that, I'm with it, I'm with it
Here check this out
Wait a minute, wait a minute, now
Come on, girl
Come on, girl
Come on, girl

[Verse 1]
There's a girl I know who look so fine
She really turns me on
My friends said I should
But it's takin' me too long
Every time I get the nerve to call
She is never home
I leave another message
And I sit here all alone
She's got me

[Chorus]
Under pressure (You know what I'm saying?)
And the feelin' is killin' me
Under pressure
Why is it, oh, so strong?
I don't wanna be alone

[Verse 2]
So I got a chance to talk to her
To see just where we stand
If she felt the same about me
Could I be her only man?
I tried to write it out
That we could have some fun
But before I got an answer
She said she had to run, it's got me

[Chorus]
Under pressure (Woah)
And the feelin' is killin' me
Under pressure
Oh, I don't wanna be alone, alone
Under pressure (Under pressure)
The feelin' is killin' me, oh
Under pressure
Why is it, oh, so strong?

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Under pressure (You know what I'm saying?)
Under pressure
Under pressure
And the feelin' is killin' me
Under pressure
I need you (Under pressure)
I want you (Under pressure)
Under pressure
Under pressure
Under pressure (Just let me play, baby)

[Outro]
Oh, Lord

[Verse 1]
The things I once thought exciting
They've all grown tiresome and old
Here's a fool, learned a lesson
Love is more precious than gold
You may give her furs and jewels
But they, they will only grow old
Here's a fool, learned a lesson
Love is more precious than gold

[Bridge]
I once made a decision in my life
A long, long, long time ago
I went for money instead of love
Now I'm so blue and it only goes to show

[Verse 2]
The things I once thought exciting
They've all grown tiresome and old
Here's a fool, learned a lesson
Love, love, it's more precious than gold

[Outro]
You won't need no money
It's more precious than jewels
Get your hands on some lovin'
You won't need no money
It's more precious than gold
More precious, it's more precious than gold
You say that you love me anyway
But I know it's not in your eyes
You say you can take it night and day
But I know it's an alibi

Dejon where did we go wrong
You said that you'd be mine
Till the end of time
Love me tomorrow
Love me tomorrow
Love me tomorrow
Love me tomorrow

I say it's a sad sort of play
When you never get to my lines
You say that I'm better off this way
But I know it's all in your mind

Dejon where did we go wrong
You said that you'd be mine
Till the end of time
Love me tomorrow
Love me tomorrow
Forget all your sorrow
Love me tomorrow
Dejon where did we go wrong
You said that you'd be mine
Till the end of time
Love me tomorrow
Love me tomorrow
Forget all your sorrow
Love me tomorrow
Oh I need you baby
Yes I need you baby
Oh I need you baby
Come on back home to me
I'll make it all up to you, woman
Just you wait around and see

I was wrong baby
I thought I was having fun
I know I was wrong baby
I thought I was having fun
Yes I was young and foolish
I didn't know you was the one

Now I've settled down baby
And I know I'll treat you right
Oh I've settled down baby
And I know I'll treat you right
Yes, come on home now baby
I want you to come on home tonight
Oh I need you baby
Yes I need you baby
Well I need you woman
I need a good woman around
Every night about this time baby
My love comes tumbling down
Blue river blues
I'd rather be outside
Here I am inside
Watching it rain

Blue river blues
I'd rather be somewhere
Here I am nowhere
Watching it rain

One, two, three, four!

Some people like that downhill stuff
They like it fast and breezy
Some people walk on the other side
They like it slow and easy

Some people run on a mountain trail
Some like it wild and rough
Some like to fly and some like to sail
And some like the downhill stuff
There's work in what we practice
Work in the things we say
Sometimes we work just to try to make a living
Or we're workin' just to make it pay

Sometimes we're tryin' to work our will
But that won't work anyway
I only know that I'm workin' still
Just to get another chance to play

Some people like that downhill stuff
They like it fast and breezy
Some people walk on the other side
They like it slow and easy

Some people run on a mountain trail
Some like it wild and rough
Some like to fly and some like to sail
And some like the downhill stuff

Keep movin' in a forward direction
Like a river rollin' down to the sea
If you wanna make a different selection
Honey, let yourself go with gravity

Everybody's lookin' for heaven
Everybody's lookin' for home
Everybody's lookin' for higher and higher
But nobody wants to be lookin' alone
Everybody's tryin' to get down to it
Everybody's tryin' to sing
Whatever it is we're all gonna do it
But whatever we do we gotta do our own thing

Some people like that downhill stuff
They like it fast and breezy
Some people walk on the other side
They like it slow and easy

Some people run on a mountain trail
Some like it wild and rough
Some like to fly and some like to sail
Some like the downhill stuff
I like the downhill stuff
Let me slide down that downhill stuff
Oh, honey give me some downhill stuff
So pull me out of this dream
Turn off the television
Put on a romantic vinyl
And come to bed again
Please be my next morning flower
But don't be there all the time
Leave me a couple of hours
Then bring me food and wine

[Chorus]
Play with me, play with me
Don't tell me how it feels
Don't let it be for real
Don't tell me how you feel

I'll make this week disappear
Like I've erased several months
It's turning into a year now
And I'm still a manikin
You're so poetic when you're sad
So tiring when you cry
We could fly out and get married
I think I love you now

[Chorus]
Play with me, play with me
Don't tell me how it feels
Don't let it be for real
Don't tell me how you feel
Play with me, play with
Don't tell me how it feels
Don't let it be for real
Don't tell me how you feel
I know you're pleased with all the presents
That you found lying under the tree
I can tell it brought some gladness to your heart
But on this yuletide holiday
Would you pause and give a little thought to me
And we can share the most important gift of all

Cause we know Love comes with Christmas
And goes with every other day of the year
We know that Love comes with Christmas
And goes with every other day of the year

I know the wine, roasting holly
Will grace the table with all the trimmings on that day
As we wish each other's families peace and joy
And mistletoe and all it's splendor
May be seen hanging from each welcome door
But we feel the same way we felt the day before

Cause we know Love comes with Christmas
And goes with every other day of the year
We know that Love comes with Christmas
And goes with every other day of the year
It's a happy time whether rain, snow, or sunshine
The world is slow, it's cold, we celebrate
With kisses warm, I'll give you one for every season
And renew the vows we made our wedding day

So let the bells bring down the children
Leave the beds with the coming of the dawn
To see that Santa kept his promise and came to call
While we both watch them in satisfaction
When we have each other Summer, Spring or Fall

We know that Love comes with Christmas
And goes with every other day of the year
We know that Love comes with Christmas
And goes with every other day of the year
You're nobody till somebody loves you
You're nobody till somebody cares
You might be king, you might possess, the world and its gold
But gold won't bring you happiness, when you're growing old

The world still is the same
You'll never change it
As sure as the stars shine above
You're nobody till somebody loves you
So find yourself somebody to love
Imagine there's no heaven
It's easy if you try
No hell below us
Above us only sky
Imagine all the people
Living for today

Imagine there's no countries
It isn't hard to do
Nothing to kill or die for
And no religion too
Imagine all the people
Living life in peace

You, you may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope some day you'll join us
And the world will live as one

Imagine no possessions
I wonder if you can
No need for greed or hunger
A brotherhood of man
Imagine all the people
Sharing all the world
You, you may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope some day you'll join us
And the world will live as one
Peaceful valleys, animals and children asking me
Tell the story that you told of sailors drinking tea
Tell the one about the man who saddled up the wind
Pegasus and flying fish and woodsmen made of tin

A kid knows what he wants to be before he's nine or ten
Cowboys, clowns, and men of war and someone else's friend
But nine grows into big boys' pants and then to scars and pain
Twenty's fast and hard as nails but doesn't come again

There's days to fall and days to rise and days for making haste
Days for seeking out yourself but no days you can waste
Nighttimes filled with love so good it aches to rest it down
Endless hallways dark with sleep and rivers dark with sound

Peaceful valleys, animals and children asking me
Tell the story that you told of sailors drinking tea
Tell the one about the man who saddled up the wind
Pegasus and flying fish and woodsmen made of tin

Children climbing on my arms and pigeons on my head
Get thee up my little man and dream a dream instead
Dream a dream of rocking chairs and flying through the night
Dream until the morning's gone and turned the dark to light
Then come and get your daddy if he hasn't blown away
Rock him in your children's hands and help him find his way
Take him to your hiding place and let him come inside
He'll never tell your secret, cross my heart and hope to die

Peaceful valleys, animals and children asking me
Tell the story that you told of sailors drinking tea
Tell the one about the man who saddled up the wind
Pegasus and flying fish and woodsmen made of tin

Indiscreet - it's indiscreet
To gaze at you - each time we meet
I've told my eyes - they must disguise - this yearning

Yes it's indiscreet - quite indiscreet
To find your touch - so bitter sweet
You're close to me and suddenly I'm burning

While I ask myself: "Where is your pride?"
Irresistibly I'm drawn to your side

And (Yes) it's indiscreet - so indiscreet
But love is swift - and time is sweet
And oh my dear - I crave the nearness of you

To love you is why my heart must be
So love me - it can't be indiscreet
Maybe I didn't love you
Quite as often as I should have
Maybe I didn't treat you
Quite as good as I could have
If I made you feel second best
Girl, I'm so sorry I was blind

You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind

Maybe I didn't hold you
All those lonely, lonely times
And I guess I never told you
Girl, I'm so happy that you're mine

Little things I should have said and done
I just never took the time

You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind
Tell me, tell me that your sweet love hasn't died
Give me, give me one more chance
To satisfy, I'll keep you satisfied

Tell me, tell me that your sweet love hasn't died
Give me, give me one more chance
To keep you satisfied, I'll keep you satisfied

[Spoken Intro]
I'm just bein' real, you know
I'm like the sun, I'm tryin' to shine on everybody
You know what I'm sayin'
But it's like situation after situation, you know
So I write about it to get it off my chest, you heard

[Verse 1]
Dear mama, you wouldn't believe what I'm goin' through
But still I got my head up just like I promised you
Ever since you left, your baby boy's been dealin' with
Problem after problem, tell me, what am I supposed to do?
See, I get lost sometimes, don't understand this place
Look in the mirror sometimes and see a troubled face
And then my tears roll down and hit the sink
Then I hold my head up high
I hope the Man upstairs can hear my cry
All these questions deep inside my mind
Like, if Jesus loved me, why He leave my side, mama?
I'm still tryin' to get the answer why
You were young, 45, and you had to die
I'm always tryin' to help people out
And it's them same people tryin' to take food out my mouth
(For real tho') It seems like the more money I make
(For real tho') The more drama y'all try to create
(For real tho') And through I try to move into the positive
(For real tho') The more y'all don't wanna let me live
When will you realize that I don't owe you nothin'
Need to get up off your butt and go get your own somethin'
I'm pullin' on my hair to keep from snappin' off
Fools ride up in my camp and be yappin' off
Somebody out there please pray on what I'm talkin' 'bout
Still young tryin' to figure it out

[Chorus]
Heaven, I need a hug
Is there anybody out there willin' to embrace a thug?
Feelin' like a change of heart
And all I really need is a sign or a word from God
So shower down on me, wet me with your love
I need you to take me, and lift me up, oh yeah

[Verse 2]
I gave 13 years of my life to this industry
Hit song or not, I've given all of me
You smile in my face and tell me that you love
But then before you know the truth, you're so quick to judge me
That's alright, go ahead, keep talkin' ('Cause...)
'Cause I'ma hold my head up high and keep walkin'
And reach for the sky, focus on the plan
Rescue the ghetto with his paper and pen
And this is for the homies that we lost
Yo, we cannot forget y'all, so the hats come off
We pour a little liquor out for the memories
I know y'all up there sittin' on chrome in them pearly streets
The street survivors, be careful, stay alive
I'm prayin' for your families, I hope you pray for mine
(For real tho') Used to be a time you wished me well
(For real tho') It hurts to know you wanna see me fail
(For real tho') And don't forget I kept you out of jail
(For real tho') Where's my arms when you needed to be held
They turned they backs on you, who was there believin'?
Who said your troubles were only for a season?
In church together tryin' to pick up all the pieces
And now you betray me, I bind you in the name of Jesus
Somebody please pray on what I'm talkin' 'bout
Still young tryin' to figure it all out

[Chorus]
Heaven, I need a hug
Is there anybody out there willin' to embrace a thug?
Feelin' like a change of heart
And all I really need is a sign or a word from God
(Please shower down)
So shower down on me, wet me with your love (Yeah)
I need you to take me, and lift me up (Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 3]
Man, I tell you it's enough to make you wanna give it up
Thank God for my fans 'cause through it all they show me love
To my sister and two brothers
Tell me why can't we just try to get along with one another?
Instead of hurtin' one another, fightin' one another
Man, I pray to God He get my family back together
Let me see what wanna I see, just to blind me
All of these luxuries, wine and dine and me
And then You push me out in front to get behind me
Then You sat me up by blessin' me to bind me
I'm a grown man with kids now, stakes are higher
Gotta go to church now to avoid the fire
Frankly, y'all, to keep it real, I'm just tired
Dreams of bein' dead, but the devil is a liar
(For real tho') Church folks, you need to stop judgin'
(For real tho') Or you will be the first to be judged
(For real tho') And women stop dependin' on us men
(For real tho') And start dependin' on the Man above, feel me
And as for Robert, here's what I need to do
Get rid of them clowns and get myself a whole 'nother crew
And media, do your job
But please just don't make my job so hard
Somebody please pray on what I'm talkin' 'bout
I'm still young tryin' to figure it all out

[Chorus]
Heaven, I need a hug
Is there anybody out there willin' to embrace a thug?
(Embrace me)
Feelin' like a change of heart
And all I really need is a sign or a word from God
So shower down on me, wet me with your love
(Shower down on me now)
I need you to take me (Please) and lift me up, yeah, yeah
(Said I'm callin' on...)
Heaven, I need a hug
Is there anybody out there willin' to embrace a thug?
(Embrace me, yeah)
Feelin' like a change of heart
And all I really need is a sign or a word from God
So shower down on me, wet me with your love
I need you to take me, and lift me up (Lift me up)
Yeah, yeah (Heaven, I need)
Heaven, I need a hug (Ooh, yeah, yeah)
Is there anybody out there willin' to embrace a thug?
Said I'm feelin' like a change of heart (Hey)
And all I really need is a sign or a word from God (Ooh, yeah)
So shower down on me, wet me with your love
I need you to take me and lift me up, yeah, yeah
One day as I walked with my son hand in hand
He said, there are things that I don't understand
How high is the sky? what makes it so blue?
And tell me, dad, what does God look like to you?
I said, He looks like a rainbow, just after the rain
He's as golden as wheat dancing over the plain
He looks like the star when the night's crystal clear
He looks like a baby when mother is near
His face is the moonlight reflected on snow
His hair like garden where all flowers grow
He's heavenly eyes are as true as the sea
My son, that's what God really looks like
His heart like a mountain so vast and so strong
That's why all his children have room to belong
His smile is the morning we waken to see
But you, my son, you are what God really looks like to me
Give me a T for Texas, give me a T for Tennessee
Give me a T for Texas, give me a T for Tennessee
Give me a T for Thelma, woman made a fool out of me
If you don't want me baby, mama you sure don't got to stall
If you don't want me baby, mama you sure don't got to stall
I've had more pretty women than a passenger train can haul
I'm gonna buy myself a shotgun, one with a long shiny barrel
I'm gonna buy myself a shotgun, one with a long shiny barrel
I'm gonna shoot myself a rounder, oh that stole away my gal
I'd rather drink your muddy water, sleep down in a hollow log
I'd rather drink your muddy water, sleep down in a hollow log
Than to be in Atlanta Georgia, treat me like a dirty dog
I don't have to go for that
If you don't want me baby, mama you sure don't got to stall
If you don't want me baby, mama you sure don't got to stall
Well I've had more pretty women than a passenger train can haul
That ain't all
I'd rather drink your muddy water, sleep down in a hollow log
I'd rather drink your muddy water, sleep down in a hollow log
Log, log log yeah
Than to be in Atlanta Georgia, treated like a dirty dog
Oh give me a T for Texas, give me a T for Tennessee
Give me a T for Thelma, woman made a fool out of me
Give me a T for Texas, give me that T for Tennessee
Give me a T for Thelma, woman made a fool out of me
One more time
Give me a T for Thelma, oh that woman made a fool
I said said oh, that woman made a fool out of me, yeah
It's a loaded dice, that you throw this time
If you turn the Ace, it'll turn out fine
When you spin the wheel, and you get your call
South of the line, well the loser gets it all

One too many days, one too many nights
You cried too many tears, had too many fights
And you know it's a bad time, Bad time to lose

God knows there's no good time

Too many days, and too many nights
You cried too many tears, had too many fights
And you know it's a bad time, Bad time to lose
Yeah, yeah, Bad time to lose

[Intro]
Remember

[Verse 1]
If we could remember
The moment of our birth
We give our voice
To songs and whispers
And know what life is worth

[Chorus]
Remember (Remember)

[Verse 2]
Suddenly there's beauty
In peace there's all the past
And sorrow clings to angry questions
The days of dust at last

[Bridge]
And morning holds us
When worlds come tumbling down
A dance of ghosts and ragged dreams
Spinning 'round (Spinning 'round)
Spinning 'round (Spinning 'round)
Spinning 'round

[Chorus]
I remember, mhm
Remember (Remember)
Remember (Remember)

[Verse 3]
If we could remember
The power of the light
That cripple prayers
Are sometimes answered
And hope survives the night
And hope survives the night
The night

[Outro]
I remember, mhm
I remember, remember, remember
Remember

[Verse 1]
I remember times, my love, when we really had it all
You were always there to make me smile, help me when I fall
Ooh, I can't believe you're leaving me
When there's so much more to say

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't let you go
Ooh, every time I look at you, I still can feel the glow
Let it be, let it grow

[Chorus]
Ooh, love me please, just a little bit longer
Together, we can make it
Our love is much too young to break it
Love me please, just a little bit harder

[Verse 2]
All I ever wanted was to have you to myself
Then I see you standing there in the arms of someone else
You know a man can stand so much
And it's more than I can bear

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't let you go
Ooh, every time I look at you, I still can feel the glow
Let it be, let it grow

[Chorus]
Ooh, love me please, just a little bit longer
Together, we can make it
Our love is much too young to break it
Love me please, just a little bit harder

[Bridge]
Never even try to see things her way
It's hard on a woman when love ain't no love at all
And when she walks away (No, no)
And she probably will
You're gonna be sorry, begging her, "Please"

[Chorus]
Love me please, just a little bit longer
Together, we can make it
Our love is much too young to break it
Love me please, just a little bit harder

[Bridge]
I think I can work it out
I can't get enough, I want you tomorrow

[Chorus]
Love me please, just a little bit longer
Together, we can make it
Our love is much too young to break it
Love me please, just a little bit longer
Together, we can make it
Our love is much too young to break it
Love me please, just a little bit longer
Together, we can make it
Our love is much too young to break it
Love me please, just a little bit longer
Together, we can make it
Are we locked up to each other
Must we stir through the ashes
Stir through the ashes of the past
For a time it was tough to survive
But it's time to get on with our lives

And now you've gotta do a mental shakedown
What is it gonna take your sanity's at stake
Shakedown

Yeah yeah

There's a cold wind off the border tonight
As we take to the ridges
Burning our bridges to the past
And the cry rises from the west
We are not each others to possess

Now you've gotta do a mental shakedown
What is it gonna take your sanity's at stake
Shakedown
Now you've gotta do a mental shakedown
What is it gonna take your sanity's at stake
Shakedown

You've got you've got
Now you've got to do your mental shakedown

What is it gonna take
You're sanity's at stake
Shakedown

Yeah

Now you've got to do a mental shakedown
What's it gonna take

Shakedown

Yeah you've got to do your mental shakedown
What is it gonna take
You're sanity's at stake

Shakedown
I don't need no fortune
I'll tell you the reason why
I've got more than anything
Money can buy
I've got your love love love
That's more than anything
Money can buy

'Cause money can't buy that kind of love no

I was lost
I was drifting
That I won't deny
Till you gave your heart to me
Said let's give love a try
I've got your love love love
Here to hold me
Against the tide

You know a man sworn to nothing
Can make you wanna cry
I came to my senses
Baby dry your eyes
I've got your love love love
That's more than anything
Any old anything
Mmmmm
I was lost
I was drifting
That I won't deny
Till you gave your heart to me
Saying let's give love a try
I've got your love love love
Here to hold me
Against the tide
Against the tide
Against the tide

Got love
Got love more than anything
Hey hey hey hey
Money can buy
Hey money can buy
Old Watertown
Nothing much happenin'
Down on Main
'Cept a little rain
Old Watertown
Everyone knows
The perfect crime
Killin' time
And no one's goin' anywhere
Livin's much too easy there
It can never be a lonely place
When there's the shelter of familiar faces
Who can say
It's not that way
Old Watertown
So much excitement
To be found
Hangin' round
There's someone standing in the rain
Waiting for the morning train
It's gonna be a lonely place
Without the look of familiar faces
But who can say
It's not that way

[Verse 1]
Aye, get ready to feel teddy pain
He back rapping again
And best believe he still here
The fucking nappys his friend
See i done snapped back the gat clapping again
Niggas in ATL gon ask me whats happenin then
But im just feel like its about that time of the day
To keep it moving so i write and keep rhyming again
Im coming back to the basics
Cause in a way its the way shit gotta go down in different cases
See when pain starting sang-in
Niggas was like "you r&b? thats gay, man"
So in a sense I was feeling bad
Nobody would get behind me - not even NappyHeadz
So I was really mad
But I said fuck it let them talk shit
And in a year everybody gonna be on my dick
Rap album had them thug songs on them
And i showed them what an album could do with all the club songs on it

[Hook]
I'm an R to the A to the P, P, A
To the T to the E to the R, N, T
S to the A to the N to the G to the A
I'm a rappa ternt sanga
I'm an R to the A to the P, P, A
To the T to the E to the R, N, T
S to the A to the N to the G to the A
I'm a rappa ternt sanga

[Verse 2]
My nigga J Lyriq put the stamp on it
Said it was cool
Forget that rap shit nigga
Go and do what you do
He helped a nigga with his harmony and how to 

[?]
So in a sense, you can say that nigga made T-Pain
But I stuck with it, had to fuck with it
He was real
Only nigga I respected and he didn't have a deal
Plus I saw them two fuck niggas leave over there
And he saw what I was going through with the rest of the Headz
But now he with a real nigga named T
And you guessed it dog
That nigga named T is me
And now that nigga T done put all type of shit around his wrist
Got him all iced out throwing ice out bling lights out
And if a fight starts he going for broke
And if a nigga touch t his fucking nose will go broke
So, T got his back to this day
And if a nigga gotta ask this is what im gonna say

[Hook]
I'm an R to the A to the P, P, A
To the T to the E to the R, N, T
S to the A to the N to the G to the A
I'm a rappa ternt sanga
I'm an R to the A to the P, P, A
To the T to the E to the R, N, T
S to the A to the N to the G to the A
I'm a rappa ternt sanga

(Ronnie VanZant -- Gary Rossington)

Why are you praying, my sweet morning dove
You're so afraid, but so hungry for love
Well I can give you love baby
Hugs and kisses, I can give you everything that you been missing
Just don't be afraid, oh
Sweet little missy

She's twenty years old and a full grown woman
Sure enough
I'm the one that wants her
Are you ready for love
Well I'm the one that wants you forever and a day
Come on baby, what'd you say
Just don't be afraid, oh
Sweet little missy

Sweet little missy
She's saving her love
But givin' us hope like the Lord up above
This ain't the worst thing she'll ever do
'Cause like a dollar bill you can't take it with you
Well I'm the one that wants you forever and a day
Come on baby, what'd you say
Just don't be afraid, oh
Sweet little missy

She's so damn pretty, I can't take it no more
You and me babe, giving my soul for sure
Well I can give you love baby
Hugs and kisses, I can give you everything that you been missing
Just don't be afraid, oh
Sweet little missy

Sweet little missy
She's saving her love
But givin' us hope like the Lord up above
This ain't the worst thing you'll ever do
'Cause like a dollar bill you can't take it with you
What's the story, Mr. Blue
Did she pull the rug from under you
Did she chop your dreams up two by two
And kick them out the door
I could sympathize you, son
But pity words stick to my tongue
And sorry words have all been sung
So many times before

Oh, Mr. Blue, you blew your chances long ago
Oh, Mr. Blue, you're through
Quit acting like you didn't know

Hang on one more day or two
Then I promise I'll be laying you
Odds that she's found someone new
While you stand around and rust
She don't need no part-time man
With no part-time answer understand
She don't want an hour's fall of sand
For a lifetime full of dust
Oh, Mr. Blue, you blew your chances long ago
Oh, Mr. Blue, you're through
Quit acting like you didn't know

Mr. Blue, you missed the shot
Didn't turn out quite the way you thought
It would, I'll bet, cause you got caught
Out playing Donald Juan
She's got polish, she's got class
And someday when on the street you pass her house
You'll wonder why the grass
Looks greener on her lawn

Oh, Mr. Blue, you blew your chances long ago
Oh, Mr. Blue, you're through
Quit acting like it isn't so
(PIANO)
WHOOAOO

WHOOAOO

Sometimes I feel WHOAOAO

A long...a looong wayee from home
C'mon, C'mon
Whos Got A Shoulder When I need to cry
I feel restless and I don't know why
Cry for help, but still feel alone
Like A motherless child along way from home
Lord I'm lost I can't find my way
I'm Dealin With The Struglles in my day to day
My Soul Is Weak and I wanna be strong
I try to run away but I've been running to long

I've been running to long...
I've Been running to long

HEEY

Whos Got A Shoulder When I Need To Cry
I feel restless and I don't know why
Cry for help, but I still feel alone
Like A motherless child along way from home
Lord I'm lost I can't find my way
I'm Dealin With The Struglles in my day to day
My Soul Is Weak and I wanna be strong
I try to run away but I've been running to long

I've been running to long...
I've Been running to long
Like A Motherless Child (X4)
So Lost And so long
Like a motherless Child

[Instrumental]
The band marched beneath a banner that read welcome home soldier
City streets were littered with cheering crowds entangled in the paper streamers that filled the air
Hailed for his 'unquestioned patriotism' and 'heroic bravery'
Nude was unable to respond. The tidal wave of publicity that engulfed his life had a devastating effect after 29 years alone
Oh

I wanna know your name
You just kill me, could you at least do that?
I wanna know your name
Or better yet, stand there
Just do that

I wanna know your name
Your name
You just kill me, could you at least do that?
I wanna know your name
Your name
Or better yet, stand there
Just do that

Hey yeah

I wanna know your name...
Know your name...
I wanna know your name...
Know your name...
Uh!
Oh yeah

I wanna know your name
You just kill me, could you at least do that?
I wanna know your name
Know your name
Or better yet, stand there
Just do that

Hey yeah!
Oh yeah!

I wanna know your name...
Know your name...
I wanna know your name...
Know your name...

Uh
I wonder why, why my baby won't treat me right
I wonder why, why my baby won't treat me right
She go off every day and she won't come home 'till night

"I'll be home" well, last week that's what she said
"I'll be home" well, last week that's what she said
She don't care if I don't eat
'Cos she don't know how the rent is paid

She's a gamblin' woman, she chases men in between
She's a gamblin' girl, she chases men in between
She mistreats me and she cheats me
Meanest woman I ever seen

The kid's in bed, I lay awake 'till broad daylight
The kid's in bed, I lay awake 'till broad daylight
Every now and then I wonder will my baby be home tonight

[Verse 1]
Although I speak in tongues of men and angels
I'm just sounding brass and tinkling cymbals without love
Love suffers long, love is kind
Enduring all things, hoping all things, love has no evil in mind

[Verse 2]
If I had the gift of prophecy
And all the knowledge and the faith to move the mountains
Even if I understood all of the mysteries
If I didn't have love, I'd be nothing

[Verse 3]
Love never looks for love
Love's not puffed up or envious or touchy
Because it rejoices in the truth, not in iniquity
Love sees like a child sees

[Verse 4]
As a child I spoke as a child
I thought and I understood as a child
But when I became a woman, I put away childish things
And began to see through a glass darkly

[Verse 5]
Where as a child I saw it face to face
Now I only know it in part
Fractions in me of faith and hope and love
And of these great three, love's the greatest beauty

[Outro]
Love
Love
Love
She's gone
I'm a victim of love
And I reach for her cry
There's no perception of time
She's out of my world and I'm alone
The city sleeps , she comes and she goes
She loves another one
And I got no chance, no time
Ain't nothing stops the rain but the sunshine
I can see nobody , tell me where my angel goes
I say the devil knows

I'm lost
No sky above me
No earth below me
Show me where tomorrow is and teach me to see
Someone else may cry for me , could be
Show me where tomorrow is 'cos I don't know
Show me where tomorrow is 'cos I don't know
Show me where tomorrow is
Suspicion
The lies on your lips and your tenderness
I lie in wait for the gift of her pain
She'll never be mine and I'm all alone
And through a stranger, lives can change
And hearts can overcome
But I need her face , so young
Ain't nothing stops the fire and it burns on
Too late now she tells me
We cannot live this lie
She came home to say goodbye

I'm lost
No sky above me
No earth below me
Show me where tomorrow is and teach me to see
Someone else may cry for me, could be
Show me where tomorrow is , 'cos I don't know
Show me , I must go on
Whatever the heart must take
I'll keep my love alive
And all you got is freedom
It ain't enough

I'm lost
No sky above me
No earth below me
Show me where tomorrow is and teach me to see
Someone else may cry for me , could be
Show me where tomorrow is , 'cos I don't know
Show me
If I leave here tomorrow
Would you still remember me?
For I must be travelling on now
There's just too many places I've got to see

But if I stay here with you, girl
Things just couldn't be the same
'Cause I'm as free as a bird now
And this bird you cannot change
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

And this bird you cannot change
And this bird you cannot change
Lord knows I can't change

Bye bye, baby, it's been a sweet love yeah, yeah
And though this feeling I can't change
But please don't take this so badly
'Cause Lord knows I'm to blame

But if I stay here with you, girl
Things just couldn't be the same
'Cause I'm as free as a bird now
And this bird you cannot change
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
And this bird you cannot change
And this bird you cannot change
Lord knows I can't change
Lord, help me, I can't change

Lord, I can't change
Won't you fly high free bird?
Yeah
Okay, so your heart is broken
You're sitting around mopin', cryin', cryin'
You say you even think about dying
Well, before you do anything rash, baby, dig this

Everybody plays the fool, sometime
There's no exception to the rule, listen baby
It may be factual, it may be cruel, I ain't lying
Everybody plays the fool

Fallin' in love is such an easy thing to do
But there's no guarantee that the one you love, is gonna love you
Oh, loving eyes, they cannot see a certain person could never be
Love runs deeper than any ocean, it clouds your mind with emotion

Everybody plays the fool, sometime
There's no exception to the rule, listen baby
It may be factual, it may be cruel, I ain't lying
Everybody plays the fool

How can you help it, when the music starts to play
And your ability to reason, is swept away
Oh, heaven on earth is all you see, you're out of touch with reality
And now you cry, but when you do, next time around someone cries for you
Hey, everybody plays the fool, sometime
Use your heart just like a tool, listen baby
They never tell you so in school, I wanna say it again
Everybody plays the fool

Everybody plays the fool, sometime
There's no exception to the rule, listen baby
It may be factual, it may be cruel, I ain't lying
Everybody plays the fool

Every plays the fool, sometime
There's no exception to the rule, listen baby
It may be factual, it may be cruel, I wanna say it again
Everybody plays the fool

[Chorus]
One cup of coffee, then I'll go;
Though I just dropped by to let you know
That I'm leaving you tomorrow;
I'll cause you no more sorrow:
One cup of coffee, then I'll go

[Verse 1]
I brought the money like the lawyer said to do
But it won't replace the heartache I caused you;
It won't take the place of lovin' you, I know
So one cup of coffee, then I'll go

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
Tell the kids I came last night
And kissed them while they slept;
Make my coffee sweet and warm
Just the way you used to lie in my arms

[Verse 2]
I brought the money like the lawyer said to do
But it won't replace the 'eartache I caused you;
It won't take the place of lovin' you, I know

[Outro]
So one cup of coffee, then I'll go;
One cup of coffee, then I'll go;
One cup of coffee, then I'll go
It don't matter who you are
Anyone can be a star
Brighter than the lightning
You go as far as you go
You got to be what you know

There may be somebody out to get the better of you
You need the one good woman to keep you alive
Don't let the pressure beat a hole in your head
Remember nobody left you on the railway line
And if the one shoe fits you've got a chance this time

Breakout
Ain't no one gonna break your heart
You'll never do it if you never start
You be there
Breakout now
You gotta be a story told
And baby , no one gonna steal your soul
You be there
If you believe in tomorrow and you wait all night
You've got it all and then you're lost in flight
There are diamonds in the street
But you don't get enough to eat
Walking on a wire
There is a future unknown
Nobody does it alone

And maybe you can be the thunder
If you follow your dream
There must be one good woman to show you the way
Don't let them make you feel you're less than you are
Remember , somebody calls you on the telephone line
And all the world gets crazy and you win this time

Breakout
Ain't no one gonna break your heart
You'll never do it if you never start
You be there
Breakout now
You gotta be the story told
And baby , no one's gonna steal your soul
You be there
If you believe in tomorrow and you wait all night
You've got it all and then you're lost in flight

Breakout now
Ain't no one gonna break your heart
You'll never do it if you never start
You be there
Breakout now
You gotta be the story told
And baby , no one's gonna steal your soul
You be there
If you believe in tomorrow and you wait all night
Breakout now
You gotta be the story told
And baby , no one's gonna steal your soul
You be there
If you believe in tomorrow and you wait all night

[Verse 1]
The Undertaker
Put away the guns for future's sake
Don't you be another number for the undertaker
Put away the guns for future's sake
Don't you be another number for the undertaker

[Refrain]
Mercy
Calling mercy

[Verse 2]
Turn off the violence, there's children watching
Listen to the silence, it's a better box to be in
Turn off the violence, there's children watching
Listen to the silence, it's a better box to be in

[Refrain]
Mercy
Calling mercy

[Ad Lib]
Here come The Undertaker

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Don't go with the crack
Might never come back
Don't go with the crack
You might never come back

[Chorus]
Don't let the devil make you
Dance with the undertaker
Don't let the devil make you
Dance with the undertaker
Don't do it

People stared at the makeup on his face
Laughed at his long black hair, his animal grace
The boy in the bright blue jeans
Jumped up on the stage
And lady stardust sang his songs
Of darkness and disgrace

And he was alright, the band was altogether
Yes he was alright, the song went on forever
And he was awful nice
Really quite out of sight (second time: really quite paradise)
And he sang all night long

Femme fatales emerged from shadows
To watch this creature fair
Boys stood upon their chairs
To make their point of view
I smiled sadly for a love I could not obey
Lady stardust sang his songs
Of darkness and dismay
And he was alright, the band was altogether
Yes he was alright, the song went on forever
And he was awful nice
Really quite out of sight (second time: really quite paradise)
And he sang all night long

Oh how I sighed when they asked if I knew his name

And he was alright, the band was altogether
Yes he was alright, the song went on forever
And he was awful nice
Really quite out of sight (second time: really quite paradise)
And he sang all night long

Now deep in the heart of a lonely kid
Who suffered so much for what he did
They gave this ploughboy his fortune and fame
Since that day he ain't been the same

See the man with the stage fright
Just standin' up there to give it all his might
And he got caught in the spotlight
But when we get to the end
He wants to start all over again

I've got fire water right on my breath
And the doctor warned me I might catch a death
Said, "You can make it in your disguise
Just never show the fear that's in your eyes"

See the man with the stage fright
Just standin' up there to give it all his might
He got caught in the spotlight
But when we get to the end
He wants to start all over again
Now if he says that he's afraid
Take him at his word
And for the price that the poor boy has paid
He gets to sing just like a bird, oh, ooh ooh ooh

Your brow is sweatin' and your mouth gets dry
Fancy people go driftin' by
The moment of truth is right at hand
Just one more nightmare you can stand

See the man with the stage fright
Just standin' up there to give it all his might
And he got caught in the spotlight
But when we get to the end
He wants to start all over again, hmm hmm
You wanna try it once again, hmm hmm
Please don't make him stop, hmm hmm
Let him take it from the top, hmm hmm
Let him start all over again
You and me are molded by things
Well beyond our acknowledgment
You and me are molded by things
Well beyond our acknowledgment
You and me are molded by things
Well beyond our acknowledgment
You and me are molded by things
Well beyond our acknowledgment

You and me are shaped by some things
Well beyond our acknowledgment
You and me are shaped by some things
Well beyond our acknowledgment

You and me are molded by things
Well beyond our acknowledgment
You and me are molded by things
Well beyond our acknowledgment

You and me are shaped by some things
Well beyond our acknowledgment
You and me are shaped by some things
Well beyond our acknowledgment

[Verse 1]
Thank you, baby
For the years you've given me
For each beat of my heart
For every breath I breathe
Thank you, sweetie
For the best times of my life
Through the good, through the bad
You were always by my side

[Pre-Chorus]
I never thought I'd meet someone
Who loves unselfishly
But I appreciate the way you loved
And sacrificed for me

[Chorus]
I can't hold back these tears
Let me cry
(Although a man's not suppose to cry, baby)
If I hold back my tears
I'll just die
(You've given so much to my life)

[Verse 2]
Thank you, lady
For the joy you bring to life
When I thought all was lost and gone
You brought hope back in sight
Thank you, honey
For being my best friend
When I thought no one understood
You would always understand
I used to think that I knew love
And what true love would mean
Now I know that I didn't know much
'Cause you taught me everything

[Chorus]
I can't hold back these tears
Let me cry
(Although a man's not suppose to cry)
If I hold back my tears
I'll just die
(You've given so much to my life)

[Bridge]
Oh, God so loved the world
That He blessed us all with you
And then he gave me a heart
Now I'm giving it to you, baby
And these tears I cry are tears of joy
My happiness, I do rejoice
In the love you give unselfishly
Your constant sacrifice for me

[Chorus]
I can't hold back these tears
Let me cry
(Although a man's not suppose to cry)
If I hold back my tears
I'll just die
(You, you, you've given so much to my life)
I can't hold back these tears
Let me cry
(Although a man's not suppose to cry)
If I hold back my tears
I'll just die
(Oh, you've given so much, so much, so much to my life, baby)
I can't hold back these tears
Let me cry
(Oh, let me cry, baby)
If I hold back my tears
I'll just die
(Oh, don't let me, don't, don't, don't let me)

[Outro]
I can't hold back these tears
(Yeah, I'll just die, oh, oh, oh)
Oh yeah, all right
I do believe in you more than myself
I can depend on you when I need help
So when I tell you, please understand
That I do love you, love you man to man

Oh yeah, all right
I remember oh so well when the times were bad
If I needed anything, you'd give me all you had
And when the troubles came you were by my side
You said use God as your guide my son don't you know
He's alive, he's alive

Oh yeah
But now you have gone and I'm on my own
But I realize one thing, one man is never alone
But I wish that you were here right by my side
I would love to tell you that I know
He's alive
Oh yeah, all right
Everytime i
Close my eyes
(2x)

Listen girl
I don't know where to start
But every word i say
Is straight from the heart
I've been so wrong
Never meant to hurt you
Oh girl, i'm sorry
Of what i put you through

Girl i'd do anything for one more chance
(one more chance)
I want you back again
(want you back again)

Chorus:
'cuz everytime i close my eyes
I see your face
And i wonder
When you close your eyes
Do you think about me
Now that i realize
I want you girl, and no other
Everytime i close my eyes
You're all that i see
You and i shared it all together
Each other, with all we'd ever need (all we ever need)
I thought that you would stay
With me forever
But it took for granted
The love you gave to me
I keep on trying, keep on trying
'til the end, 'til the end
Baby i need you right here with me
I need you here

Chorus

Girl i'm going out of my mind
I miss you so much
I don't know what to do (what to do)
Please stay
It's just a matter of time
'til i feel your touch
'til you let me come back to you

Think about you girl
Every day and night i'm in love
And it feels so right, i'd never meant to hurt you
Or caused you pain
I was just callin' up
In that lying game
But now those days are over
I've changed our ways
And now i'm counting the minute
I'm counting the days
'til you let me come back
Till you let me start
To find a new way
To get back into your heart
Girl i'd do anything for one more chance (one more chance)
'cuz i want you, i want you back again

Chorus
A-one, two, three four

Bubbles, bubbles
I wish my name was bubbles, bubbles
I wish my friends were bubbles, bubbles
I ride my car on bubbles, bubbles
I go real far on bubbles
On bubbles

Bubbles, bubbles
I blow a lot of bubbles, bubbles
I show a lot of bubbles, bubbles
I ride a plane on bubbles, bubbles
I go insane on bubbles
On bubbles

Cause it's a B and a U
And a B and a B and an L
And an E and an S

It's a B and a U
And a B and a B and an L
And an E and an S
And an S
Oh bubbles, oh bubbles
I wish my name was bubbles, bubbles
I wish my friends were bubbles, and bubbles
I drive my car on bubbles, on bubbles
I go real far on bubbles
On bubbles, yeah
I saw a pearl of wisdom
In the spirit of a man
As he saved
The day he lost

Time will say I told you so
If we look back in regret
Never give a day away
It won't return the same again

Nothing can last
There are no second chances
Never give a day away
Always live for today
You can't let it get you down
No no no no no
No no no no no
No no oh no no
Don't let it get you down

Just when everything seems to be going alright
Some unexpected news free enter your life
Then you ask your self how could this be wondering why
I've been there
You see your whole world come crashing down
All at one time
Your bodies weak from all the worrying
Your slow as you mind
Your walking down that rocky road
But things will get better
Cause trouble won't last forever

You can't let it get you down
Not down
I come to far to turn around
You gotta walk with your up high
Believe if you could reach the sky
You can't let it get you down
Have you ever felt the need to get away from it all
The person that you care about the most just broke your heart
Just to be in the same room with them

You can't stand the thought
I've been there
You don't know if your relationship is worth holdin on
How much longer can you take being treated so wrong
You're confused on what to do
But no matter what you do
You're gonna make it through

Oh, take it from me
The only thing you need a little faith
The size of a mustard seed
You may cry through the night but hold
Cause joy comes in the morning

In the morning
Joy comes in the morning
Have a little faith
Just a little faith
And you can make it
So don't you give up

Don't you let nobody turn you around
Don't you let nobody turn you around
Keep your head up to the sky
Believe in yourself
On the day when I was born Daddy sat down and cried
I had the mark just as plain as day; which could not be denied
They say that Cain caught Abel rollin' loaded dice;
Ace of Spades behind his ear and him not thinkin' twice

Halfstep, Mississippi uptown toodeloo Hello, baby, I'm gone, good-bye
Half a cup of Rock and Rye. Farewell to you old Southern skies
I'm on my way, on my way

If all you got to live for is what you left behind
Get yourself a powder charge and seal that silver mine
Lost my boots in transit, baby, pile of smokin' leather
I nailed a retread to my feet and prayed for better weather

Halfstep, Mississippi uptown toodeloo Hello, baby, I'm gone, good-bye
Half a cup of Rock and Rye. Farewell to you old Southern skies
I'm on my way, on my way

They say that when your ship comes in, the first man takes the sails;
The second takes the after deck, the third the planks and rails
What's the point of callin' shots; this cue ain't straight in line
Cue ball's made of Styrofoam and no one's got the time
Halfstep, Mississippi uptown toodeloo Hello, baby, I'm gone, good-bye
Half a cup of Rock and Rye. Farewell to you old Southern skies
I'm on my way, on my way

Across the Rio Grandeeo, Across the lazy river
As a tot, when I trotted in little velvet panties
I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's

So my dear I swore
"Never, never more!"
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my!
How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine
And some thrills I can't define
Listen, sweet, I repeat
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt
Finding another world
Kiss me once, then once more
What a dunce I was before
What a break!
For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?

Dear, when in your arms I creep
That divine rendezvous
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep
Let me dream that it's true!

Kiss me twice, then once more
That makes thrice, let's make it four!
What a break!
For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?
How long has this, been going on?
I love you
I love you
(Woah, I love you)
And I need you baby (and you need me too)

So no matter where your love goes
And though she doesn't care
(She knows I'm there)
'Cause I know how much my baby needs me
Share me
(Oh believe, ah sugar)

(But she needs me)
Ooh my sugar
I guess it isn't very smart of me
Following you, tagging along
But right or wrong
I'll take care of you, I'm here
I'm with you baby

Forever I will be your friend
Or your lover
Because my one ambition is
To (wake up)
Oh wake up
And make her discover
She needs me (3x)
So I will go where she leads me
And I'll always be there
Tend to your every care
Long as she needs
Needs me

Ooh my sugar, oh my sugar
Oh, oh
Hey, I see you're undercover like a C.I.A
Snatch a little wig from another?
That's french
I guess a man is only good for a rainy day
Or maybe you're just another bearded lady at the cabaret!
Ray Charles even saw you in the past before he saw me
'Cause nothing like you ever last for eternity
I got the receipt baby
But where's the guarantee
I forgot, you're fake as a Christmas tree
I wish I never kissed your lips, bearded lady
Oh, wee, Baby
I wish I never kissed your l, aaah!
Doesn't erase the memory
Slippery lips of da bourgeoisie
Everybody step right up, come and see
The bearded lady take me up to G!
Yesterday you was kicking it with another girl
You was all wrapped up around her waist
Last time I checked, you said you left the dirty world
Well, it appears that wasn't the case
Hey, I see you're undercover like a C.I.A
Oh, no more rainy days
Just another bearded lady at the cabaret
Just another bearded lady at the cabaret
Just another bearded lady at the cabaret
Yesterday I had a dream about dying
About laying to rest and then flying
How the moment at hand is the only thing
We really own

And I lay in my bed and I wonder
After all has been said and is done for
Why is it thus we are here
And so soon we are gone

Is this life just a path to the place
That we all have come from
Does the heart know the way
And if not, can it ever be found
In a smile or a tear or a prayer
Or a sigh or a song

And if so, then I sing for my father
And in truth you must know I would rather
He were here by my side
We could fly on the wings of a dream
To a place where the spirit would find us
And the joy and surrender would bind us
We are one anyway
Anyway we are more than we seem
There are those who will lead us
Protect us each step of the way
From beginning to end
For each moment forever each day
Such a gift has been given
It can never be taken away

Though the body in passing must leave us
There is one who remains to receive us
There are those in this life
Who are friends from our heavenly home
So I listen to the voices inside me
For I know they are there just to guide me
And my faith will proclaim it is so
We are never alone

From the life to the light
From the dark of the night to the dawn
He is so in my heart
He is here he could never be gone
Though the singer is silent
There still is the truth of the song
In the song

Yesterday I had a dream about dying
About laying to rest and then flying
How the moment at hand is the only thing
We really own
And I lay in my bed and I wonder
After all has been said and is done for
Why is it thus we are here
And so soon we are gone
Oh, why is it thus we are here
And so soon we are gone
She said, "What went wrong?"
I said, "I loved you all along."
She said, "How could you love me and hurt me like you do?"
Oh, no. I said, "Don't say good-bye. Don't go. Please don't let us die."
This is the noment we could close the door
Or hold on and fight for the chance at something more
This is the moment, and if we hang in
It's when we'll really begin
She said, "I'm so scared."
I said, "Just think of what we've had."
She said, "That was then, how can I feel that again?"
Oh, no. I said, "Don't walk away. Don't go, it's hard as hell to stay
But I know, you'll understand someday, in times like this
We find out what we're about."
This is the moment we could close the door
Or hold on and fight for a chance at something more
This is the moment we've got to hang in
That's when love really begins
Oh, help me, please help me, hold us together
I promise that we can still have forever
Oh, no. I said, "Don't say good-bye. Don't go. Please don't let us die."
This is the moment we could close the door
Or hold on and fight for the chance at something more
This is the moment we've got to hang in
It's when we really begin
This is the moment we could close the door
Or hold on and fight for the chance at something more
This is the moment we've got to hang in
It's when we really begin
This is the moment we could close the door
Or hold on and fight for the chance at something more
This is the moment we've got to hang in
It's when we really begin
Lover here is something
To last you through the night
I'll make it clear
I'll make you hear
And I'll make it.. all right

Lover.. lover lover
Love her all the time
Some love burns
And some returns
But love come what may

All our sorrows pass away
Its all tomorrow anyway
All that's wrong
Makes loves sad song
Love anyway hey

Hmmmmmm

All our sorrows pass away
Its all tomorrow anyway
All that's wrong
Makes loves sad song
Gone tomorrow and here today
And nothing ever comes to stay
Love.. love love anyway
Hmmmmmm

Gone tomorrow here today
Nothing ever comes to stay
Take love come what may
Take it everyday
Love.. love.. love
Love.. anyway

[Intro]
Ooh, la, la, la, la
Ooh, la, la, la, la

[Verse 1]
I did you wrong
My heart went out to play
In the game I lost you
What a price to pay
(What a price to pay)
I'm cryin'

[Chorus]
Ooo, baby, baby
Ooo, baby, baby

[Verse 2]
These days
I know I made you feel bad
But I'm only human
(But I'm only human)
You've made mistakes, too
I'm cryin'

[Chorus]
Ooo, baby, baby
Ooo, baby, baby

[Bridge]
And I'm just about at (I'm just about at)
The end of my rope (The end of my rope)
But I can't stop tryin'
And I can't give up hope (I just can't give up hope)
'Cause dear, someday I'll hold you near
(Someday, I know I'll hold you near)
Whisper, "I still love you" (I still love you)
Until that day is here (Until that day is here)
Oh, oh, baby

[Chorus]
Ooo, baby, baby
Ooo, baby, baby
Oh, oh, oh
Ooo, baby, baby
Ooo, baby, baby
Ooo, baby, baby
Ooo, baby, baby

[Outro]
I did you wrong, I can't come home
Went out to play, what a price to pay
I made mistakes, you made them, too
What are we doing? What are we supposed to do?
Ooo, baby, baby
Ooo, baby, baby
Ooo, baby, baby
Ooo, baby, baby
Ooo, baby, baby
Ooo, baby, baby
Heaven please send to all mankind
Understanding and peace of mind
But, if it's not asking too much
Please send me someone to love
Show the world how to get along
Peace will enter when hate is gone
But, if it's not asking too much
Please send me someone to love
I lay awake night and ponder world troubles
My answer is always the same
That unless men put an end to all of this
Hate will put the world in a flame, oh what a shame
Just because I'm in misery
I'm not begging for no sympathy
But if it's not asking too much
Just send me someone to love
Someone to love
Heaven please send to all mankind
Understanding and peace of mind
But, if it's not asking too much
Please send me someone to love
I know all about you
They call you Mr. T
You are a barber's son
You've got the rope, feel me
You use, you use rope that you believe
Oh, oh, I tell you

Have you made any more pork pies for me?
Hangman, says you make a very nice cup of tea, oh yes you do

Hangman, hangman, waiting for me
Hang that rope from the highest tree
I don't want to beg for mercy
Hangman, hang me, hangman, hang me

I know all about you
They call you, they call you Mr. C
You did a very good job
Oh, you'll go down, you'll go down, go down in history
Baby, baby, I'm telling you
Have you made any more pies for me?
Hangman, says they're very nice, they're very nice for me, oh yes they are nice

Hangman, hangman, waiting for me
Hang that rope from the highest tree
I don't want to beg for mercy
Hangman, hang me, hang me
Oooh

Hangman, why do you keep calling, why do you keep calling
Why do you keep calling me, oooh, why
You'll go down, you'll go down, down and down in history
Baby, baby, I'm telling you, ooooh

Oh, let me die, please don't cry, don't cry
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Ohhh
Many a tear has to fall
But It's All In The Game
All in the wonderful game
That we know as love
You have words with him
And your future's looking dim
But these things your hearts can rise above

Once in a while he won't call
But It's All In The Game
Soon he'll be there at your side
With a sweet refrain
And he'll kiss your lips
And caress your waking fingertips
And your hearts will fly away

And he'll kiss your lips
And caress your waking fingertips
And your hearts will fly away
And your hearts will fly away
And your hearts will fly
And your hearts will fly
Five foot nine
She's got legs for days
Green eyes that cut like a knife
And her own little s*** sway, oh

She don't waste no time
Moving to the floor
And when she starts to move
She'll have ya calling your momma sayin you wanna go home

Baby, tell me, why can't I have you
Why you running girl

I love you
But I guess you don't have time for me

But I guess love don't love me, no
It's ok to be scared
Cause this girl is super bad
She will probably be
The best thing that you never had

Don't waste no time
Trying to make her your own
Cause what she says goes
And like boyz ii men said this is the end of the road

Baby, tell me, why can't I have you
Why you running girl

Incident'ly there should some changes made
You've got to work if you should have to save
An apple is a fool but lemons never do forget
You've got to play it cool before they come and throw the net

Wait a while and straighten out the tie you wear
You've got to take it easy if you dare
An apple is a fool but lemons never do forget
You've got to play it cool before they come and throw the net

Don't be blind you've got a thinking mind
Stop the bells that ring so loud
Don't nod your head you'll draw a crowd
Just think of ev'rything you've worked so hard to bring
The lemon sings my song; he's known it all along

[Verse 1]
So you wanna stay down, you refuse to be happy, yeah
You wanna go back on your word 'cause it just got turned around
Oh, keep on dreamin', yeah baby
But nevertheless you can still be safe and sound
You wanna stay down, you refuse to be happy, yeah
Oh, you wanna go back to your friends on the other side
But keep on dreamin', yeah baby

[Bridge]
Ah, just remember that I love you
And I wouldn't have it any other way, yeah
Get a little stronger in your spirit
And all of your fears will truly go away, yeah
Go away, 'way, hey

[Verse 2]
So you wanna stay down, you refuse to be happy, yeah
To them you look roped and tied but you're still runnin' fast and free
Oh, keep on dreamin', yeah baby
Ah, your motivation in somethin' hard to see
You wanna stay down, you refuse to be happy, yeah
Well, whatever happens to you, I know that you're one of a kind
Just keep on dreamin', yeah baby

[Bridge]
Ah, sometimes you find disappointment
But never forget what you truly believe, yeah
People see you crawlin' but you're gettin' closer
Now ask yourself, can you get off your knees
Get off your knees, hoo, hoo, hoo

[Verse 3]
So you wanna stay down, you refuse to be happy, yeah
You wanna go back on your word 'cause it just got turned around
Oh, keep on dreamin', yeah baby
Nevertheless you can still be safe and sound
You wanna stay down, you refuse to be happy, yeah
Oh, whatever happens to you, I know that you're one of a kind
Oh, keep on dreamin', yeah baby, hey

[Outro]
You wanna, know you wanna stay down, girl
Just remember, well, remember that I love you, girl
Tell me why you wanna, hey, you wanna stay down, girl
Tell me why you wanna, you wanna stay down, girl
Turn around, turn around, turn around, turn around
Tell me why you wanna, hey, you wanna stay down, girl
Tell me why you wanna, you wanna stay down, girl
Tell me why you wanna, you wanna stay down, girl
Tell me why you wanna, yeah, you wanna stay down, girl, ha
Turn around, turn around, turn around, turn around
Tell me why you wanna, yeah, you wanna stay down, girl

[Verse 1: Paul Williams]
For once in my life
I have someone who needs me
Someone I needed so long
For once unafraid
I can go where life leads me
Somehow I know I'll be strong
For once I can touch
What my heart used to dream of
Long before I knew
Ah, someone like you
Would make my dream come true

[Verse 2: Paul WIlliams]
For once in my life
I won't let sorrow hurt me
Not like it's hurt me before
For once I have something
I know won't desert me
I'm not alone anymore
For once I can say
This is mine, you can't take it
As long as I know
I have love I can make it
For once in my life
I have someone who needs me

[Outro: Paul Williams & The Temptations]
For once I can say
This is mine, you can't take it
Long as I know
I have love I can make it
For once I can feel
That somebody heard my plea
For once in my life
I have someone who needs me
For once in my life
In my life
In the sad town
Cold iron hands clap
The party of clowns outside
Rain falls in gray far away
Please, please, Baby Lemonade

In the evening sun going down
When the earth streams in, in the morning
Send a cage through the post
Make your name like a ghost
Please, please, Baby Lemonade

I'm screaming, I met you this way
You're nice to me like ice
In the clock they sent through a washing machine
Come around, make it soon, so alone...
Please, please, Baby Lemonade

In the sad town
Cold iron hands clap
The party of clowns outside
Rain falls in gray far away
Please, please, Baby Lemonade
In the evening sun going down
When the earth streams in, in the morning
Send a cage through the post
Make your name like a ghost
Please, please, Baby Lemonade
I was cutting the rug
Down at place called The Jug
With a girl named Linda Lou
When in walked a man
With a gun in his hand
And he was looking for you know who
He said, "Hey there, fellow
With the hair colored yellow
Whatcha tryin' to prove?
'Cause that's my woman there
And I'm a man who cares
And this might be all for you"
I said, "Excuse me"

I was scared and fearing for my life
I was shaking like a leaf on a tree
'Cause he was lean, mean
Big and bad, Lord
Pointin' that gun on me
"Oh, wait a minute, mister
I didn't even kiss her
Don't want no trouble with you
And I know you don't owe me
But I wish you'd let me
Ask one favor from you"
"Oh, won't you
Gimme three steps, gimme three steps, mister
Gimme three steps toward the door?
Gimme three steps, gimme three steps, mister
And you'll never see me no more"

For, sure

Well the crowd cleared away
And I began to pray
And the water fell on the floor
And I'm telling you, son
Well, it ain't no fun
Staring straight down a forty-four
Well, he turned and screamed at Linda Lou
And that's the break I was looking for
Well, you could hear me screaming a mile away
I was headed out toward the door

"Oh, won't you
Gimme three steps, gimme three steps, mister
Gimme three steps toward the door?
Gimme three steps, gimme three steps, mister
And you'll never see me no more"

Show me the back door

[Chorus]
Take me, far away, anywhere
As long as it's fun, fun, fun, fun, fun, fun, fun
I wanna go!

[Verse 1]
The school bell ring is what I've been waiting for
When we just scream, and run for the door
Hey, it's summer mom
Hey, it's summer dad
Man, it's been so long
Since the children had
A good time!

Hey, maybe it all probably takes it's toll?
Hey, but didn't I make honor roll?
Either way, eat your words
It's our time, we deserve
Oh, to have a good time!

[Chorus]
Take me, far away, anywhere
As long as it's fun, fun, fun, fun, fun, fun, fun
I wanna go!

[Verse 2]
No more teachers and principals
A good behavior, insensible (?)
Let's do everything
Till the summer's done
It's the greatest time
For us to be young
And have a good time!

Hey, maybe it all probably takes it's toll?
Hey, but didn't I make honor roll?
Either way, eat your words
It's our time, we deserve
Oh, to have a good time!

[Chorus]
Take me, far away, anywhere
As long as it's fun, fun, fun, fun, fun, fun, fun
I wanna go!

[Verse 3]
No more homework or PTA
No more lunch food, it's toxic waste
Let's eat MickyD's
As a matter fact
Let's get happy meals
Want a sundae, man? (yeah)
What a good time!
Hey, maybe it all probably takes it's toll?
Hey, but didn't I make honor roll?
Either way, eat your words
It's our time, we deserve
Oh, to have a good time!
That old black magic has me in it's spell
That old black magic that you weave so well
Those icy fingers up and down my spine
The same old witchcraft when your eyes meet mine
The same old tingle that I feel inside
And then that elevator starts it's slide
Down and down I go
Round and round I go
Like a leaf that's caught in the tide
I should stay away but what can I do

I hear your name, and I'm aflame
A flame with such a burning desire
That only your kiss can put out the fire
'cause you're the lover I have waited for
The mate that fate had me created for
And every time your lips meet mine
Darling, down and down I go
Round and round I go
In that spin of love that I am in
Under that old black of love

[Verse 1]
I heard it in the wind last night, it sounded like applause
Did you get a round resounding for you way up here?
It seems like many dim years ago since I heard that face to face
Or seen you face to face, though tonight I can feel you here

[Chorus 1]
I get these notes
On butterflies and lilac sprays
From girls who just have to tell me
They saw you somewhere

[Verse 2]
In some office sits a poet and he trembles as he sings
And he asks some guy to circulate his soul around
On your mark red ribbon runner, the caressing rev of motors
Finely tuned like fancy women in thirties evening gowns

[Chorus 2]
Up the charts, off to the airport
Your name's in the news, everything's first class
The lights go down and it's just you up there
Getting them to feel like that

[Verse 3]
Remember the days when you used to sit and make up your tunes for love
And pour your simple sorrow to the sound hole and your knee
And now you're seen on giant screens and at parties for the press
And for people who have slices of you from the company

[Chorus 3]
They toss around your latest golden egg
Speculation, well who's to know
If the next one in the nest
Will glitter for them so?

[Verse 4]
I guess I seem ungrateful with my teeth sunk in the hand
That brings me things I really can't give up just yet
Now I sit up here the critic and they introduce some band
But they seem so much confetti looking at them on my TV set

[Chorus 4]
Oh the power and the glory
Just when you're getting a taste for worship
They start bringing out the hammers
And the boards and the nails

[Verse 5]
I heard it in the wind last night, it sounded like applause
Chilly now, end of summer, no more shiny hot nights
It was just the arbutus rustling and the bumping of the logs
And the moon swept down black water like an empty spotlight

[Intro]
For all you've done, thank You

[Verse 1]
With my hands, I applaud the Maker of creation, Holy Father
With my mouth, I extol, shouts of jubilation, Hallelujah
(You satisfy my heart's desire) With many good things
I gotta thank ya
(You redeemed my very life) To You my heart sings

[Chorus]
With everything, I lift You up high
Let everything within praise Your holy name
(With everything I)
With everything, I (Lift You up, Lord) lift You up high
(Everything within me)
Let everything within praise Your name

[Verse 2]
With the dance, I will praise, rejoicing in my Savior
Oh Lord, You've been good
For Your everlasting love and unmerited favor
Grace and mercy to me
(The Glory of Your majesty)
Even the skies have to display, yeah, yeah
(Day and night, and night and day) You're worthy of praise

[Chorus]
With everything, I (I lift You) lift You up high
(Oh Lord, I thank You)
Let everything within praise Your holy name
(I gotta praise Your Holy name)
With everything, I (I lift You, Lord) lift You up high
(So wonderful)
Let everything within (I gotta) praise Your name
(Everything I do)
With everything, I (I wanna do it all for You)
Lift You up high
(Let me be found when I'm there)
Let everything within praise Your holy name
(Praising Your Holy name)
With everything, I (I wanna lift You up so high)
Lift You up high
(So wonderful)
Let everything within praise Your name

[Bridge]
I lift my hands, my hands I raise
To give You glory, to give You praise
I wanna live, so I can give
All of my service unto You
Because You are worthy Oh Lord you're worthy
Oh yes, You're worthy, worthy of the praise
And the honor and the glory
And all majesty belongs to You, You

[Chorus]
With everything, I (With everything I do)
Lift You up high (Everywhere I go)
Let everything within praise Your holy name
(I gotta tell everybody about Your goodness)
With everything, I (About Your goodness) lift You up high
(About Your goodness)
Let everything within (Oh yeah) praise Your name
(Yeah, You've been good, Lord)
With everything, I (You've been good, Lord)
Lift You up high (You've been good, Lord)
Let everything within praise Your holy name
(You've been good, Lord, better to me)
With everything, I (Better to me)
Lift You up high
(Better to me than I could ever be to myself)
Let everything within praise Your name
With everything, I (You've been good, Lord) lift You up high
(That's why I thank You)
Let everything within praise Your holy name
(That's why I praise You, hey, my hands are lifted)
With everything, I (My voice is raised) lift You up high
(To give You glory)
Let everything within (To give you praise) praise Your name
(Hey, I praise Ya)
With everything, I (Huh, huh, praise Ya) lift You up high
(Oh, I praise Ya)
Let everything within praise Your holy name
(Oh, I praise Ya, oh, only You, Lord)
With everything, I (Only You, Lord) lift You up high
(Only You are worthy of the glory)
Let everything within praise Your name
(You are worthy of the honor)
With everything, I (Of the honor) lift You up high
(You are worthy, worthy, worthy, worthy, worthy)
Let everything within praise Your holy name
(I praise Ya)
With everything, I (I lift Ya) lift You up high
(Magnify Ya)
Let everything within praise Your name
(Because You are worthy of the praise)
Well, I wish I was a catfish
Swimmin' in the deep blue sea
I'd have all you women
Fishin' after me
Fishin' after me
Fishin' after me

Well, I'm broke and I'm hungry
Ragged and I'm dirty too
Well, if I clean up, baby, can I
Stay home with you
Stay home with you
Stay home with you

If I can't, can't come in
Let me sit down front of your door
I'll leave so early, your
Mom won't know
Won't never know
Won't never know
Oh, I know, know my baby
Well, she's going to jump and shout
When my train pulls in and I
I come walkin' out
Come walkin' out
Come walkin' out

Yes, I'm goin', babe I'm goin'
And your crying won't make me stay
Oh, the more that you cry, baby
More I'll go away
More I'll go away
More I'll go away

Well now I know, I know you don't want me
Why in the world won't you tell me so?
Then I won't be caught, baby, 'round
Your house no more
Your house no more
Your house no more
At the end of the rainbow there's happiness
And to find it often I've tried
But my life is a race, just a wild goose chase
And my dreams have all been denied
Why have I always been a failure?
What can the reason be?
I wonder if the world's to blame
I wonder if it could be me

I'm always chasing rainbows
Watching clouds drifting by
My schemes are just like all my dreams
Ending in the sky
Some fellows look and find the sunshine
I always look and find the rain
Some fellows make a winning sometime
But I never even make a gain, believe me
I'm always chasing rainbows
Waiting to find a little bluebird in vain
We began by sharing more together
Black against white made it alright
But things are different now, we've grown apart
So it's ok, call it a day
What can I say
Let's just remember what we had
Keep on looking for that rainbow
Rainbow's end
And when you find that rainbow
Start again

I know now that it all seems wrong
But we had no choice
Change is a thing we can't avoid
And even though we're singing different songs
Love still lasts, time will pass
You and I will always get by
So keep on looking for that rainbow
Rainbow's end
And when you find the rainbow
Start again
So keep on looking for that rainbow
Start again
I hope you find the rainbow
Rainbow's end
When the night has come
And the land is dark
And the moon is the only light we'll see
No, I won't be afraid
No, I won't be afraid
Just as long as you stand
Stand by me

So darling, darling
Stand by me
Oh, stand by me
Oh, stand
Stand by me
Stand by me

If the sky that we look upon
Should tumble and fall
Or the mountains should crumble in the sea
I won't be afraid
I won't be afraid
Just as long as you stand
Stand by me
So darling, darling
Stand by me
Oh, stand by me
Oh, stand
Stand by me
Stand by me
Etc....
Once upon a time you dressed so fine
You threw the bums a dime in your prime
Didn't you?
People'd call, say "Beware doll, you're
Bound to fall";
You thought they were all kiddin' you
You used to laugh about
Everybody that was hangin' out
Now you don't walk so proud
Now you don't talk so loud
Now you don't seem so proud
About having to be scrounging for your
Next meal

How does it feel
How does it feel
To be without a home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone?

You've gone to the finest school all right
Miss Lonely
But you know you only used to get juiced
In it
And nobody has ever taught you how to
Live on the street
And now you find out you're gonna have
To get used to it
You said you'd never compromise
With the mystery trend, but now you
Realize
He's not selling any alibis
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
And ask him do you want to make a deal?
How does it feel
How does it feel
To be on your own
With no direction home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone?

You never turned around to see the frowns
On the jugglers and the clowns
When they all come down and did tricks
For you
You never understood that it ain't no good
You shouldn't let other people get your
Kicks for you
You used to ride on chrome horse with
Your diplomat
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat
Ain't it hard when you discover that
He really wasn't where it's at
After he took from you everything he could
Steal

How does it feel
How does it feel
To be on your own
With no direction home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone?
Princess on the steeple and all the pretty
People
They're drinkin', thinkin' that they got it
Made
Exchanging all kinds of precious gifts and
Things
But you'd better lift your diamond ring
You'd better pawn it babe
You used to be so amused
At Napoleon in rags and the language that
He used
Go to him now, he calls you, you can't
Refuse
When you got nothing, you got nothing to
Lose
You're invisible now, you got no secrets to
Conceal

How does it feel
How does it feel
To be on your own
With no direction home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone?
Yeah, Louie's rap - take 1
We got a funky one

Take me out 2 the ballpark - strike 1!
Louie Louie in the house
Come on y'all, get some
I'm the designated hitter in the house
So don't play the hold out
Tell 'em what I'm talkin?about
Set it up - swingin?- strike 2!
Whole house swingin?
People screamin' - ears ringin?
With the sound that I'm throwin?down
Strike 3 - U're out!
Dropped it in the first round

CHORUS:
Hey, Louie Louie (Go, go, go, go, go, go Louie, go)
Aw yeah
Hey, Louie Louie (Go, go, go, go, go, go Louie, go)
Game 1 of a 7 games series
Who's up 2 bat? L-O-U-I-E
Now freeze, can everybody hear me?
Mic check - 1 2 3 - Ahem! Cool!
Now let me resume, make room
As I zoom 2 the charts with a hype tune
Step if U wanna with the squeeze play fly
But before U know it - another R.B.I
Yeah

CHORUS

Time 2 switch - here comes a change-up
I'm kicking it at the park with an All-star line up
Comin?with the new gears
Sure 2 hit the kind of record these execs are sure 2 benefit from
Yo, hold up P, gimme some
Put some more kick in that bass drum - boom!
This version makes me wanna get dumb
U got me juiced and I'm lookin' 4 the home run
Yeah

Hey Louie Louis (Go, go, go, go, go, go Louie, go)
Who's in the house?
Hey Louie Louis (Go, go, go, go, go, go Louie, go)
Slide in with attention
I'm scoring a run, 4 which there is no prevention
Home field advantage don't mean a thing
As long as U bring your swing with soul and feeling
Dig down deep - reach a little farther
Come correct, or don't even bother
Sooner than later everybody will know my name
Louie Louie's headed 4 the Hall of Fame - yeah!

CHORUS

Yo ladies, what's the call?
Louie Louis's in the house with the party y'all (Oh!)
Oh! Rollin?up hard - this time flexin?
5-deep sitting in my Benz
4 those who diss and dismiss me
Try 2 write me off and say that I'm history
Before I even start, they said I'm through bookin?
Boy, I'm like Ball Park Franks - I'm plump when I'm cookin'

CHORUS
I've got a roof over my head
I've got a warm place to sleep
Some nights I lie awake counting gifts
Instead of counting sheep

I've got a heart that can hold love
I've got a mind that can think
There may be times when I lose the light
And let my spirits sink
But I can't stay depressed
When I remember how I'm blessed

Grateful, grateful
Truly grateful I am
Grateful, grateful
Truly blessed
And duly grateful

In a city of strangers
I got a family of friends
No matter what rocks and brambles fill the way
I know that they will stay until the end
I feel a hand holding my hand
It's not a hand you can see
But on the road to the promised land
This hand will shepherd me
Through delight and despair
Holding tight and always there

Grateful, grateful
Truly grateful I am
Grateful, grateful
Truly blessed
And duly grateful

It's not that I don't want a lot
Or hope for more, or dream of more
But giving thanks for what I've got
Makes me happier than keeping score

In a world that can bring pain
I will still take each chance
For I believe that whatever the terrain
Our feet can learn to dance
Whatever stone life may sling
We can moan or we can sing

Grateful, grateful
Truly grateful I am
Grateful, grateful
Truly blessed
And duly grateful
Truly blessed
And duly grateful
Now you're moving on up, pretty baby
You're leaving me behind
Everybody seems to love you
Ooh, you're doing just fine, fine, fine

Take away your good looks
And all your fancy clothes
I bet you want to try it baby
And you'll see
That nobody loves you but me
Now what do you think about that?

Hey, Melvin
Now you tell me that you so busy
Ooh, baby you ain't got much time
Oh, how will I remember, babe
When all your time was mine, mine, mine

Well move on back cross the track
Yeah, where you came from
Yeah, why don't you just try it baby
And you'll see
Nobody loves you but me
Yeah, nobody but me
Try it
If you think I'm lying
Try it
Try it baby

Ooh, well move on back cross the track, baby
Yeah, where you came from
Come on and try, try it honey, try it baby, try it sweet
And you'll see
Nobody loves you but me
Nobody loves you but me

Listen, I really want to hold you, pretty baby
In my arms again
But I can't get close to you
For all your love afraid
But take your name from the bad list
And tear me your arms through
Come on and try it baby
I'm gonna try it sweetheart
Try it honey
You'll see, nobody loves you but me
Nobody but me

[Intro]
Hahaha! Yeah, you know what it is!
Upstate New York's finest, baby (Upstate berserkers in the building!)
Mad 

[?], how you feeling? You ready? I am
Let's go!

[Hook]
Ooh (hey!), well I'll be damned
I've been around the world and I'm back again
From Japan to Amsterdam, with a ticket in my hand
Saying catch me if you can, catch, catch me if you can
Ooh (yeah!), well I'll be damned
I've been around the world and I'm back again
From Japan to Amsterdam, with a ticket in my hand
Saying catch me if you can, catch, catch me if you can (ay!)

[Verse 1]
What type of fuckery has been required lately?
It seems like these MC's heads need deflating
And imma play the pin because I've been waiting
Now make my mark on pop culture for my generation
80's babies from the age of Nintendo
Transformers, Ninja Turtles, Hungry Hippos
G.I. Joes, Phot, can't forget the clothes
Kangaroos with the zippers, had a couple those
Breaking 2 had me spinning on my elbows
Couldn't get me out my shell toes if hell froze
R.I.P JF, Jayzia, Jeraldine, Monique, Auntie Annie, Grandma Christine, Uncle Bobs, Mickey, Sharron and Tito
You know I miss you more then Shaq miss free-throws (That's a lot)
You put it back in the air, when the wee's gone
Reminiscing 'bout when we were young, but now we've grown

[Hook]
Ooh (hey!), well I'll be damned
I've been around the world and I'm back again
From Japan to Amsterdam, with a ticket in my hand
Saying catch me if you can, catch, catch me if you can
Ooh (yeah!), well I'll be damned
I've been around the world and I'm back again
From Japan to Amsterdam, with a ticket in my hand
Saying catch me if you can, catch, catch me if you can (ay!)

[Verse 2]
Let's talk about the scene for a minute (yes)
I know we ain't been seen in a minute (nope)
We left before a minute now we all up in it
Baby boy, if you got them big dreams, go and get it
Never been the type with tight jeans I won't fit it
When I see them scene girls that they all gonna get it
And I'm living clean now, a lotta y'all won't get it
No, it's me, but I don't give a damn if you all don't get it
So fresh and so clean, in my Eugene fitted
While I'm laughing at the baby, y'all crying at the clinic
I read a couple blogs and they had my ass livid
But now I got my own, the world gotta live with it
Never played basketball, but I could show you how to pivot
Making moves in that black hatchback Honda Civic
Like I did in high school, wishin' I could relive it
But I can't, so let's go on and give the hook a revisit

[Hook]
Ooh (hey!), well I'll be damned
I've been around the world and I'm back again
From Japan to Amsterdam, with a ticket in my hand
Saying catch me if you can, catch, catch me if you can
Ooh (yeah!), well I'll be damned
I've been around the world and I'm back again
From Japan to Amsterdam, with a ticket in my hand
Saying catch me if you can, catch, catch me if you can

[Bridge]
Maybe I'm wrong
But after 26 years I feel I've paid my dues
So when you play this song
Just know that I live my life the way I choose
And now I stand here proudly in L.A
For a sold out crowd
And when no one's around, I refuse
To be inferior to you

[Hook]
Ooh (hey!), well I'll be damned
I've been around the world and I'm back again
From Japan to Amsterdam, with a ticket in my hand
Saying catch me if you can, catch, catch me if you can
Ooh (yeah!), well I'll be damned
I've been around the world and I'm back again
From Japan to Amsterdam, with a ticket in my hand
Saying catch me if you can, catch, catch me if you can (ay!)
Ooh (hey!), well I'll be damned
I've been around the world and I'm back again
From Japan to Amsterdam, with a ticket in my hand
Saying catch me if you can, catch, catch me if you can
Ooh (yeah!), well I'll be damned
I've been around the world and I'm back again
From Japan to Amsterdam, with a ticket in my hand
Saying catch me if you can, catch, catch me if you can (ay!)

[Outro]
Ooh (hey!)
Ha, ha, ha, yeah
Ha, ha, ha, ay
Someday they won't let you, now you must agree
The times they are a-telling, and the changing isn't free
You've read it in the tea leaves, the tracks are on tv
Beware the savage jaw
Of 1984

They'll break your pretty cranium, and fill it full of air
And tell you that you're eighty, but lover you won't care
You'll be shooting up this huge world, like tomorrow's wasn't there
Beware the savage jaw
Of 1984

(come see, come see, remember me? )
We played out an all night movie role
You said it would last, but I guess we've grown
In 1984 (who could ask for more)
1984 (who could ask for more)

Now we can talk in confidence
Did you guess that we've been done wrong
Lies jumped the queue to be first in line
Such a shameless design
He thinks he's well screened from the man at the top
It's a shame that his children disagree
They cooly decide to sell him down the line
Daddy's brainwashing time

He's a do do, no no didn't hear it from me
He's a do do, no no didn't hear it from me

She doesn't recall her blessed childhood out of yore
When a unit was a figure not a she
When lovers chose each other seems the perk's are due
Another memo to screw

She's a do do, no no didn't hear it from me
She's a do do, no no didn't hear it from me

Can you wipe your nose my child without them slotting in your file a photograph
Will you sleep in fear tonight wake to find the scorching light of neighbour jim
Come to, turn you in

But the do do, no no, didn't hear it from me
Another do do, no no, didn't hear it from me
Another do do, no no, didn't hear it from me
Another do do, no no, didn't hear from me

Come see, come see, remember me?
We played out an all night movie role
You said it would last, but I guess we enrolled
In 1984 (who could ask for more)
1984 (who could ask for mor-or-or-or-ore)
(mor-or-or-or-ore)
198 4
1984
1984 (mor-or-or-or-ore)

1984 (mor-or-or-or-ore)
An old cowboy went riding out one dark and windy day
Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way
When all at once a mighty herd of red eyed cows he saw
A-plowing through the ragged sky and up the cloudy draw

Their brands were still on fire and their hooves were made of steel
Their horns were black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky
For he saw the Riders coming hard and he heard their mournful cry

Yippie yi ooh
Yippie yi yay
Ghost Riders in the sky

Their faces gaunt, their eyes were blurred, their shirts all soaked with sweat
He's riding hard to catch that herd, but he ain't caught 'em yet
Cause they've got to ride forever on that range up in the sky
On horses snorting fire
As they ride on hear their cry

As the riders loped on by him he heard one call his name
If you want to save your soul from Hell a-riding on our range
Then cowboy change your ways today or with us you will ride
Trying to catch the Devil's herd, across these endless skies
Yippie yi ooh
Yippie yi yay

Ghost Riders in the sky
Ghost Riders in the sky
Ghost Riders in the sky

[Verse]
I know that the damage is already done
There's no going back
I would have never guessed we'd come to this

[Chorus]
I know that it hurt to turn you away
And I know all that I was wrong
You're raging inside and then being denied
Waited too long for the feeling to die
Is something this broken ever gonna fix?
If you asked me this question, I would ever have guessed

[Chorus]
I know that it hurt to turn you away
And I know all that I was wrong
You're raging inside and then being denied
Waited too long for the feeling to die
Is something this broken ever gonna fix?
If you asked me this question, I would ever have guessed

[Intro]
Oooh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
You're taking all the sunshine away
And making out like you're the main line, I knew that

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you're a cool cat
Tapping on the toe with a new hat
Ooh, just cruising
Driving along with the swing king
Feeling the beat of my heart, uh-huh
Feeling the beat of my heart

[Chorus]
Ooh, you're a cool cat
Coming on strong with all the chit chat
Ooh, you're alright
Hanging out and stealing all the limelight
Messing with the beat of my heart
Ooh, messing with the beat of my heart

[Bridge]
Ooh, you used to be a mean kid
Mm, making such a deal of life
Ooh, you were wishing and hoping and waiting
To really hit the big time
But did it happen, happen?
No, you're speeding too fast
Slow down, slow down, you'd better slow down
Slow down

[Verse 2]
You really know how to set the mood
And you really get inside the groove, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Cool cat
Tapping on the toe with a new hat
Ooh, just cruising
Driving along like the swing king
Feeling the beat of my heart
Feeling the beat of my heart, yeah, yeah

[Outro]
Feeling the beat of my heart
Can you feel it?
Feeling the beat of my heart, yeah, yeah
Feeling the beat of my heart
Wooh-ooh
Feelin', feelin', feelin' it, honey
Feeling
Right now, right now, now, baby
Right now, right now's the time
Right now, right now, darlin'
I can change my mind
Right now, I'm realin' and rockin'
I'm spinnin' just like a queen
You'd better have me right now
I don't know how I'll feel
Right now, right now, right now
Right now, right now's the time
You right now, right now, darlin'
I can change my mind
Six month, six month same old sentence
Twelve month won't be long time
To get what you want to me
Have to do I to 99
Right now, right now, right now
Right now, right now's the time
Right now, right now, baby
Don't you know Brownie can change my mind
Right now, my card's on the table
I maybe playin' a loosin' hand
But I'd rather drink muddy water
T' see you with another man
Right now, right now, right now
Right now, darlin', here's the time
Right now, right now
Baby, I can change my mind
Right now, right now, my cup runs over
Well, the whole lotta love for you
Right now, if I was in your shoes
I'd do anything you want me to
Right now, right now, now, baby
Right now, right now's the time
Right now, you'd better have me
Cause I can change my mind
Right now, let's go out together, right now

[Verse 1]
I know I'm not gonna sleep tonight
'Cause you're not by my side, and that ain't right
I thought that we bought this bed for two, baby
But what good is it if I'm not with you, child?

[Chorus]
Gimme a page on my two-way
I'll hit you back with no delay
When you hear all I've got to say
You're gonna see me
Whether in person or the phone
I've got to get you all alone
And when I do, baby, it's on
You're gonna see me
You're gonna see me

[Verse 2]
There's never a minute that I find, baby
That you don't ever cross my mind, darlin'
If you could just hold me tight you'd see, darlin'
There's nothing, there's nothing harder for you than me, baby

[Chorus]
Gimme a page on my two-way
I'll hit you back with no delay
When you hear all I've got to say
You're gonna see me
Whether in person or the phone
I've got to get you all alone
And when I do, baby, it's on
You're gonna see me
You're gonna see me

[Bridge]
You're the reason I took a rope and lassoed the moon
To prove that when it comes to you
There's nothing I won't do
I'd stare into the sun if you would be mine
It's not so great a leap, since to all others I am blind

[Verse 3]
I know that I'm not gonna sleep tonight
'Cause you're not by my side, and that ain't right

[Chorus]
Gimme a page on my two-way
I'll hit you back with no delay
When you hear all I've got to say
You're gonna see me
Whether in person or the phone
(Or the phone)
I've got to get you all alone
And when I do, baby, it's on
You're gonna see me
Gimme a page on my two-way
I'll hit you back with no delay
When you hear all I've got to say
You're gonna see me
Whether in person or the phone
I've got to get you all alone
And when I do, baby, it's on
You're gonna see me
You're gonna see me
See me, see me, baby
You're gonna see me
You got to, you got to
You're gonna see me

Where are you
Cherry red , sweeter than the honeycomb
Sweeter still when we're alone
Cherry red, my cherry red

Turquoise green , greener than the deeper sea
Greener still when she's with me
Cherry red , my cherry red

I wonder why (wonder why)
The stars that night shine big and bright for me
I wonder why (wonder why)
She's true to me the way that she will always be

Cherry red , sweeter than the honeycomb
Sweeter still when we're alone
Cherry red , my cherry red

I wonder why (wonder why)
The stars that night shine big and bright for me
I wonder why (wonder why)
She's true to me the way that she will always be
Cherry red , sweeter than the honeycomb
Sweeter still when we're alone
Cherry red, my cherry red
Hey baby I'm sorry
I never meant to hurt you
Please don't go
Slowly my eyes began to see
That I need you near and with me at all times, yeah
My feelings are so deep for you
That I won't let go, oooh no, of you

Bridge:
I can't let this love (Slip away)
And I can't turn it around (Can't you see)
And only then.....

Chorus:
Please don't go away from me
( I'll be there for you)
When you call my name (call my name)
I'll reach out my hand to you
(And I Welcome you ) To my hearth (my future my hearth)
Please don't go away from me
We can work it out
Whatever it may be girl
Please don't go(no,no,no,no,no,please don't go)
You know, It's not often that we see each other
That's why I cherish every moment that we spent each other
When you're away, Temptation may come
But when I get caught up (by you) (3x) , I let go
Thinking about you these day
I feel (I love you and I never let go) your love makes my head spin
Round and round in a daze , yeah oh baby
Bridge
Chorus 2X
Please don't go away
Shum,dum,dum
Dum(9x)
I'll be there, I'll be right there (7x)
She broke down and let me in
Made me see where I've been

Been down one time
Been down two times
I'm never going back again

You don't know what it means to win
Come down and see me again

Been down one time
Been down two times
I'm never going back again
Hey brother! There's an endless road to rediscover
Hey sister! Know the water's sweet but blood is thicker
Oh, if the sky comes falling down, for you
There's nothing in this world I wouldn't do
Hey brother! Do you still believe in one another?
Hey sister! Do you still believe in love? I wonder
Oh, if the sky comes falling down, for you
There's nothing in this world I wouldn't do
What if I'm far from home?
Oh brother, I will hear you call!
What if I lose it all?
Oh sister, I will help you hang on!
Oh, if the sky comes falling down, for you
There's nothing in this world I wouldn't do
Hey brother! There's an endless road to rediscover
Hey sister! Do you still believe in love? I wonder

There's nothing in this world I wouldn't do
What if I'm far from home?
Oh brother, I will hear you call!
What if I lose it all?
Oh sister, I will help you hang on!
Oh, if the sky comes falling down, for you
There's nothing in this world I wouldn't do
Late at night when the wind is still
I'll come flying through your door
And you'll know what love is for
I'm a bluebird
(I'm a bluebird, I'm a bluebird, I'm a bluebird)
Yeah yeah yeah
(I'm a bluebird, I'm a bluebird, I'm a bluebird)

Bluebird (bluebird)
All alone on a desert island
We're living in the trees
And we're flying in the breeze
We're the bluebirds
(We're the bluebirds, we're the bluebirds, we're the bluebirds)
Singing bluebird (bluebird), uh huh
Bluebird (bluebird), uh huh
Bluebird (bluebird, bluebird)
Mo-mo-mo-money rules the world
It's still the same old greed
Just if you got some in your pocket
You'll find relief
So stack the cash, my friend, and fly high
But don't you ever take a slice of my pie

Money is the kind of stuff
Makes everybody bitch on it
Bitch and bitch, try to get rich on it
Some people say it's the root of all evil today
But if you ask for some help
They'll give none away

(Money, money, money)
(Money, money, money)

Money can buy me diamonds
Money can buy me rings and friends

Money rules the world
And don't you love that cash?
Grab it with your greedy hands
You start a stash
Money is the word
It's got that magic touch
Can't live without it
You need the stuff too much
(Money)
(Money)
(Money)
(Money)

Mo-mo-mo-money stinks
But don't you love that cash?
Grab it with both hands
And make a stash
May you give some to the poor
It would be so fine
Share it fairly
But keep your hands off of mine

Money is the word
It's got that magic touch
You can't live without it
You need it too much
But don't you never
No, never ever ask for it
'Cause ain't nobody gonna give you
Just a bit of that shit

Money can buy me diamonds
Money can buy me rings and friends
(Money, money, money)
(Money, money, money)
Money rules the world
And don't you love that cash?
Grab it with your greedy hands
You start a stash
Money is the word
Its got that magic touch
Can't live without it
You need the stuff too much

(Money)
(Money)
(Money, money, money)
(Money, money, money)

[Verse 1]
Bright night, street lights in a city that never sleeps
Loud music and in talks with people where all the party sings
I saw a girl and I notice that she noticed me
We set mojitos then she told me all about her dreams

[Pre-Chorus]
Then we made love in a Taxi Cab
It reminded me of a dream I had
Now the memory's like a photograph
And I can't get her out of my head

[Chorus]
We made love in a Taxi Cab, Taxi Cab, Taxi Cab
We made love in a Taxi Cab, Taxi Cab, Taxi Cab
We made love in a Taxi Cab, Taxi Cab, Taxi Cab
And the shorty know she's bad

[Verse 2]
Looking at the rear view she said to me "Let go and be free"
Then she told the driver mind his business
And then went down on me
Then I told her "We're just 15 minutes from my home"
But she didn't stop, she kept saying it feels so incredible wrong

[Pre-Chorus]
Then we made love in a Taxi Cab
It reminded me of a dream I had
Now the memory's like a photograph
Oh babygirl and I can't get her out of my head

[Chorus]
(Last night) We made love in a Taxi Cab, Taxi Cab, Taxi Cab
(Last night) We made love in a Taxi Cab, Taxi Cab, Taxi Cab
(Last night ) We made love in a Taxi Cab, Taxi Cab, Taxi Cab
And the shorty know she's bad

[Bridge]
And it all happened so soon (Girl)
I didn't even get her name (She took control and had her way)
It was like a hotel room, yea
We're taking a gamble but people love the bet

[Pre-Chorus]
Then we made love in a Taxi Cab (Baby we made love)
It reminded me of a dream I had (It reminded me of a dream I had)
Now the memory's like a photograph (Photograph baby)
And I can't get her out of my head

[Chorus]
(That night) We made love in a Taxi Cab, Taxi Cab, Taxi Cab
(That night) We made love in a Taxi Cab, Taxi Cab, Taxi Cab
(That night ) We made love in a Taxi Cab, Taxi Cab, Taxi Cab
And the shorty know she's bad

[Verse 3]
Think I love her
The girl's bad for me
The sex is good to me
Pretty stranger, pretty stranger

[Pre-Chorus]
Then we made love in a Taxi Cab
It reminded me of a dream I had
Now the memory's like a photograph
And I can't get her out of my head
This is what it's like falling out of love
This is the way you lose your very best friend
This is how it feels when it's all over
This is just the way true love ends

First of all there's no one to talk to
When there is they just don't seem to hear
Words don't seem to matter much anyway
They can't describe the pain
They can't explain the fear

Then the nights grow cold and hard to live through
Still you hate to see the morning come
Somehow tomorrow doesn't matter much anymore
The future holds no promise
Your life's already done

This is what it's like falling out of love
This is the way you lose your very best friend
This is how it feels when it's all over
This is just the way true love ends
The you find your heart no longer flutters
You no longer look through a lover's eyes
What's to see when the world falls down around you
You simply can't believe it
But it comes as no surprise

This is what it's like falling out of love
This is the way you lose your very best friend
This is how it feels when it's all over
This is just the way true love ends

What's the sense of failure
It's such an incredible loss
It's all the things you'll never do
And all the dreams that will never come true

This is what it's like falling out of love
This is the way you lose your very best friend
This is how it feels when it's all over
This is just the way true love ends
Oh this is just the way a true love ends
I don't believe a true love ever ends
Buddy miles is goin' to do something he wrote called 'them changes'

Well my mind is goin' through them changes
I feel just like I'm in the time
Every time you see me goin' some where
I feel like I'm going out of my mind, yeah
Oh, my baby she left me the other day
And we were have so much fun yeah, yeah
Oh, my baby she stepped out on me
And that's the reason why she had to part
It's alright yeah yeah
It's alright
What I say
It's alright
Ooo hooo
Well my mind is goin' through them changes
I think I'm goin' out of my mind
Every time you see me goin' some where
I think I could commit a crime know
She had me runnin'
She had me cryin'
She had me runnin'
She had me had me had me cryin'
She had me runnin'
She had me cryin'
She had me runnin'
Had me cryin'
It's alright yeah yeah
It's alright
Clap your hands
Go clap your hands
Can you clap a little louder
It's alright
It's alright
Everything goin' to be alright
It's alright x5
Yeah, yeah, everybody yeah
Yeah x12
Oh no
I want my love x3
It's alright
Whaa
It's alright he he
It's alright
Buddy miles there
Miles to go but how could you know
How far we've gone, how far we've gone
All it would take to keep me awake
Is a different song or someone to sing along

The radio promised to take me through the night
Its intentions are good but I doubt that it can
As far as I know there's no rule of the road
The wheel has to feel the same two hands

So why don't you drive for awhile
I've been crossing lines for miles
Why don't you drive for awhile
If I had only known
I'd be traveling alone
I would've stayed home
So why don't you drive for awhile

Sooner than later I could drift away
With the lights in my eyes and the hum at my feet
I think that we're lost but just of reach
Is a handfull of maps folded under your seat
So why don't you drive for awhile
I've been crossing lines for miles
Why don't you drive for awhile
If I had only known
I'd be traveling alone
I would've stayed home
So why don't you drive for awhile

It's my turn to ride

So why don't you drive for awhile
I've been crossing lines for miles
Why don't you drive for awhile
If I had only known
I'd be traveling alone
I would've stayed home
So why don't you drive for awhile
Gazing at the fire, burning by the water
Before he speaks the world around us quiets
With eyes as sharp as arrows and turning to the fire
He clears the air and cuts it with a feather
Many in a circle slowly 'round the fire
When he is gone I want to know him better
No one is forsaken, no one is a liar
He plants the tree of life on our foreheads with water
He hums, there are drums, four winds, rising suns
We are singing and playing, I her him saying
I remember breezes from winds inside your body
Keep me high, like I told you, I'll sing to them this story and know why
You know there's that distance
That you took from me
There has to be a reason
A time change given

I will never understand
Why'd you have these theories
Take it from my side
Are you proving anything

Your thinking slanted
Your thinking slanted

That's my life, (Kiss me)
Hanging from a tendon (Why don't you try to save me?)
You still can't get enough
You don't know (Reach out to me)
What you've taken

That's my life
Hanging from a tendon (Why don't you try to save me)
Why don't you try
You could reach out (You mean nothing to me)
And show your hands (You mean nothing to me)
Yeah you've got a brainchild in your arms
But it's so drained and worn out from bad handling

Yeah you've got a brainchild in you arms
But it's so drained and worn out from bad handling

Why don't you try and save me
(Yeah you've got a brainchild in your arms)
Why Don't you try and save me

Why don't you try and save me
(But it's so drained and worn out)
Why don't you try and save me

Why don't you try and save me
(But it's so drained and worn out)
Why don't you try and save me

Why don't you try and save me
(But it's so drained and worn out)
Why don't you try and save me
What good would a rose be if the raindrops didn't fall?
What good is a telephone if there's no one to call?
What good is a wedding if no one says, "I do"?
Tell me, baby, what good am I without you?
What good is a flier if he don't have a plane?
What good is a doctor if he can't cure the pain?
Tell me, what good is a sweetheart
Who proves to be untrue?
What good, baby, am I without you?
I'm no good without you and there's one thing I know
I just got to have you, darling, 'cause I love you so
What good is living without the one you love?
And what good is the heavens
Without the stars above?
What good is a true heart
That proves to be broken in two?
What good, baby, am I without you?
What good, baby, am I without you?
What good, baby, am I without you?
When I'm five
I will wash my face and hands all by myself
When I'm five
I will chew and spit tobacco like my grandfather Jones
'Cause I'm only four and five is far away

When I'm five
I will read the magazines in mummy's drawer
When I'm five
I will walk behind the soldiers in the May Day parade
'Cause I'm only four and grown-ups walk too fast

Yesterday was horrid day, 'cause Raymond kicked my shin
And mummy says if I am good, she'll let me go to school in August
Daddy shouted loud at mummy and I dropped my toast at breakfast
And I laughed when Bonzo licked my face, because it tickled
I wonder why my daddy cries and how I wish that I was nearly five

When I'm five
I will catch a butterfly and eat it and I won't be sick
When I'm five
I will jump in puddles, laugh in church and marry my mum
And I'll let my daddy do the washing-up
If I close one eye, the people on that side can't see me
I get headaches in the morning and I rode on Freddie's tri-cy-cle
And everywhere was funny, when I ran down to the sweetshop
Then I fell and bleeded-up my knee and everybody soppied me

I saw a photograph of Jesus and I asked him if he'd make me five
I saw a photograph of Jesus and I asked him if he'd make me five
When I'm five
When I'm five
When I'm oah
Just say hello to a brand new world, the world outside your door
Say hello to a singing bird, like no bird you heard before
It's all there, go and grab your share, life is a great big show
So go and introduce yourself, say hello, say hello
Say howdy do to a brand new man who's just begun to live
Howdy do to a brand new man with lots of love to give
Shake my hand, watch my chest expand
You, you wanna see me close and simply introduce yourself
Say hello, say hello
Let me repeat, from a front row seat, your eyes can see it all
Yea I repeat, there's lots of hight to beat, and as a slice a very small
Life, I mean, can be seen seeking you, you are in charge, you know
So introduce yourself to life, say hello, just just say hello

[Chorus]
Swing low, sweet chariot
Coming to carry me home
Swing low, sweet chariot
Coming to carry me home

[Verse 1]
I looked over Jordan, and what did I see?
Coming to carry me home
A band of angels coming after me
Coming to carry me home

[Chorus]
Swing low, sweet chariot
Coming for to carry me home
Swing low, sweet chariot
Coming for to carry me home

[Verse 2]
If you get there before I do
Coming to carry me home
Tell all my friends I'm coming, too
Coming to carry me home

[Chorus]
Swing low, sweet chariot
Coming to carry me home
Swing low, sweet chariot
Coming to carry me home

The stars fill the sky, so in love with you am I
Even without you, my arms fold about you
You know darling why, so in love with you am I
In love with the night mysterious, the night when you first were there
In love with my joy delirious, when I knew that you could care
So taunt me, and hurt me, deceive me, desert me
I'm yours till I die, so in love, so in love so in love with you, my love, am I
When love breaks up
When the dawn lights wakes up
A new life is born
There's no waters blowing down
There's no rain into the sea
Get lonely
Dee-dee-dee
Dah, day, dah
Dee-dee-dee, by the sea
Ooh, there's muddy waters
In my hands
Across the (ad-libbed)
Dah, dah, dah

Well, if you don't believe me
Baby, just lay your ring down

Yes, you may need money, baby
On your ring some day
Yes, you may need money, baby
On your ring some day
Well, you can't ever tell
What bad luck may come your way
If you disrespect everybody that you'd run into
How in the world do you think anybody suppose to respect you?
If you don't give a heck about the man with a Bible in his hand
Just get out of the way and let the gentleman do his thing

You're the kind of gentleman, want everything your way
Take the sheet off your face, boy, it's a brand new day

And respect yourself, respect yourself
If you don't respect yourself
Ain't nobody gonna give a good 

[Incomprehensible]
Respect yourself, baby

If you're walking around thinking that the world owes you
Something 'cause you're here
You're going out the world backward like you did when you
First came here
Keep talking about the president won't stop air pollution
Put your hand over your mouth when you cough, that'll help the solution

You cuss around women folk, don't even know their name
Then you're dumb enough to think that'll make you a big ol' man
Respect yourself, respect yourself
If you don't respect yourself
Ain't nobody gonna give a good 

[Incomprehensible]
Respect yourself, baby, respect yourself

Respect yourself, baby, respect yourself
Respect yourself, respect yourself, baby
Respect yourself, you got to respect yourself

Oh give to me a winding stream it must not be too wide
Where waving leaves from maple trees meet from either side
The water must be deep enough to float our small canoe
With no one else but you

Oh do not disturb my waking dream
And the splendor of my winding stream
Flower in my canoe her eyes they looked me through
My maiden fair with golden hair is very much like you

The sparkling trout beneath the bank does leave his hiding place
Kingfisher there from the bough above so eager to give chase
The spreading branches overhead the sunlight peeping through
When looking down at you

Oh do not disturb my waking dream
And the splendor of that winding stream
Oh flower in my canoe her eyes they looked me through
A maiden fair with golden hair is very much like you
A maiden fair with golden hair is very much like you
I don't hurt anymore;
All my teardrops are dry
No more walking the floor
With that burning inside

Just to think it could be;
Time has opened the door
And at last I am free
I don't hurt anymore

Oh, you still deny
I wanted to die
The day taht you said we were through
But now that I find
You're out of my mind
I can't believe that it's true

I forgot it somehow
That I cancelled before
And it's wonderful now
I don't hurt anymore
No use to deny
I wanted to die
The day that you said we were through
But now that I find
You're out of my mind
I can't believe that it's true

I forgot it somehow
That I cancelled before
And it's wonderful now
I don't hurt anymore

[Verse 1]
I stepped outside to breathe the air
And stare up at the stars
Big dipper hanging there
Over the rented car

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Over the rented car, I'm a runaway from the record biz
From the hoods in the hood and the whiny white kids
Boring, the old man is snoring
And I'm taming the tiger (You can't tame the tiger)

[Chorus]
Tiger, tiger burning bright
Nice kitty kitty
Tiger, tiger burning bright

[Verse 2]
Sophia says it's hard to catch
And harder still to ride
The time to watch the beast the best
Is when it's purring at your side

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Purring at your side, accolades and honors
One false move and you're a goner
Boring, the old man is snoring
And I'm taming the tiger (You can't tame the tiger)

[Chorus]
Tiger, tiger burning bright
Nice kitty kitty
Tiger, tiger burning bright
In the forest of the night

[Verse 3]
The moon shed light on my hopeless plight
As the radio blared so bland
Every disc a poker chip
Every song just a one night stand

[Verse 4]
Formula music, girly guile
Genuine junk food for juveniles
Up and down the dial
Mercenary style

[Verse 5]
I watched the stars chuck down their spears
And a plane went blinking by
And I thought of Anna, wild and dear
Like fireworks in the sky

[Pre-Chorus 3]
Fireworks in the sky, I'm so sick of this game
It's hip, it's hot, life's too short, the whole thing's gotten
Boring, the old man is snoring
And I'm taming the tiger (You can't tame the tiger)

[Chorus]
Tiger, tiger burning bright
Nice kitty kitty (Boring)
Tiger, tiger burning bright (You can't tame the tiger)
Oh be nice, kitty kitty (Boring)

[Chorus]
Tiger, tiger burning bright
Nice kitty kitty (Boring, boring)
Tiger, tiger burning bright (Fight to the light, fight to the light)
In the forest of the night
When the night has come
And the land is dark
And the moon is the only
Light we'll see

No I won't be afraid
No I won't be afraid
Just as long as you stand
Stand by me

Refrain:

So darlin', darlin'
Stand by me
Oh, stand by me
Oh, stand
Stand by me
Stand by me

If the sky we look upon
Should trumble and fall
Or the mountain should crumble
To the sea
I won't cry, I won't cry
No I won't she'd a tear
Just as long as you stand
Stand by me

Refrain (2x)
Love woke me up this morning feelin' fine
I had you on my mind, oh oh
Love woke me up this morning
And I haven't had a heartache today
All my little tears are gone away
Skies are blue because I have you, I love you

Love woke me up this morning, oh yes indeed
Thinkin' of last night
You know, you made me feel all right, oh
Love woke me up this morning
I'm so glad, yes I am
Because of you, happiness is mine
All my cloudy days are all behind

Baby, every place I see your face
And now I smile, you made my life worthwhile
Yes you did

I haven't had a heartache today
And all my little tears are gone away
Happiness is really mine
And all my cloudy days are all behind

[Spoken Word: Lil Wayne]
I spent about a hundred million dollaz, hundred million dollaz, hundred million dollaz
5 Star Stunna in stores now, you bitch, you
Go get that
And like I said, this the Sucka Free mixtape
Miss Nicki Minaj
Young Money, Dirty Money, bitch, holla at me
You dig?
Sweet dreams are made of this
Who am I to disagree?
I travel the world and the seven seas
Everybody's looking for something
(2x)

Some of them want to use you
Some of them want to get used by you
Some of them want to abuse you
Some of them want to be abused

Sweet dreams are made of this
Who am I to disagree?
I travel the world and the seven seas
Everybody's looking for something

Some of them want to use you
Some of them want to get used by you
Some of them want to abuse you

Some of them want to be abused
Sweet dreams are made of this (3x)
Who am I to disagree?
I travel the world and the seven seas
Everybody's looking for something

Sweet dreams are made of this
Who am I to disagree?

Oh, smokestack lightnin', shinin' just like gold
Why can't you hear me cryin'? Ooooo
Oh, stop your train, let a hobo ride
Why can't you hear me cryin'? Ooooo

Oh, fare you well, I never see you no more
Why can't you hear me cryin'? Ooooo

Oh, stop your train, let a poor boy ride, callin' yes I do
Let a poor boy ride, let his foot step on

Oh, who've been you baby, since I've been gone
I hear that train a-coming, it's coming round the bend
I ain't seen the sunshine since I don't know when
But I'm stuck in Folsom Prison, time keeps dragging on
And that train keeps on rolling down to San Antone

When I was just a baby my mamma told me; "Son
Always be a good boy, don't fool around with guns"
But I shot a man in Reno just to watch him die
When I hear that whistle blowing I hang my head and cry

I bet there's rich folks eating in fancy dining cars
I bet they're drinking coffee and smoking big cigars
I'm stuck in Folsom Prison, I know I can't be free
But those people keep a-moving, and that's what torture me

Well if they'd free me from this prison, if that railroad train was mine
You bet I moved it on down, a little further down the line
Far from Folsom Prison that's where I wanna stay
And I'd let that lonesome whistle blow my blues away
He lives in an old lighthouse on the Essex
Marshes, caring for the wild birds. Rhayader

He lives in an old lighthouse on the Essex
Marshes, caring for the wild birds
Sing a song of sad young men
Glasses full of rye
All the news is bad again
Kiss your dreams goodbye

All the sad young men
Sitting in the bars
Knowing neon lights
And missing all the stars

All the sad young men
Drifting through the town
Drinking up the night
Trying not to drown

All the sad young men
Singing in the cold
Trying to forget
That they're growing old

All the sad young men
Choking on their youth
Trying to be brave
Running from the truth
Autumn turns the leaves to gold
Slowly dies the heart
Sad young men are growing old
That's the cruelest part

All the sad young men
Seek a certain smile
Someone they can hold
For a little while

Tired little girl
Does the best she can
Trying to be gay
For a sad young man

While the grimy moon
Watches from above
All the sad young men
Play at making love

Misbegotten moon
Shine for sad young men
Let your gentle light
Guide them home tonight
All the sad young men

[Verse 1]
Well baby used to stay out all night long
She made me cry, she done me wrong
Hurt, my eyes open, baby that's no lie
Tables turning now, it's her turn to cry

[Chorus]
Because I used to love her
But it's all over now
Yes, I used to love her
But it's all over now

[Verse 2]
Well, I used to wake in the morning get my breakfast in bed
When I got worried she would ease my aching head
Well now, she's here and there with every man in town
Still trying to take me for that same old clown

[Chorus]
Because I used to love her
But it's all over now
Yes, I used to love her
But it's all over now

[Verse 3]
Well, she used to run around with every man in town
Spending all my money playing her high class game
Put me out, it was a pity how I cried
Tables turning, now it's her turn to cry

[Chorus]
Because I used to love her
But it's all over now
Yes, I used to love her
But it's all over now

[Verse 4]
Well, baby used to stay out all night long
She made me cry, she done me wrong
Hurt, my eyes open, baby, that's no lie
Tables turning, now it's her turn to cry

[Chorus]
Because I used to love her
But it's all over now
Yes, I used to love her
But it's all over now
I've got a right to love my baby
She treats me just like a king
I've got a right to love my woman
She treats me just like a king
Yes, she's my mind, body and soul
Yes, my baby, she can do 'most anything

Yes, she's my doctor when I'm sick, people
She's my all-around standby
Oh, she's my lawyer when I'm in trouble, people
She's my mother when I wanna cry
Yes, I've got a right to love my baby
Oh, can't you see the reason why?

Oh, that gives me the right to love my woman
She's always here by my side
Oh, my sweet understanding baby
She makes my temperature rise
Yes and when it comes to kind treating people
My baby's an angel in disguise
Oh, when I'm sick she is my doctor
When I'm well she's my pride and joy
Yes, when I'm cold she's my cover
Yes, she calls me her little baby boy
Yes, when I'm tired and wanna play, people
It's my baby that's my toy
They paved paradise, put up a parking lot
With a pink hotel, a boutique, and a swingin' hotspot
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got till it's gone?
They paved paradise, put up a parking lot
(Shoo-bop-bop-bop-bop, shoo-bop-bop-bop-bop)

They took all the trees, put them in a tree museum
And they charged the people
A dollar and a half just to see 'em
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got till it's gone?
They paved paradise, put up a parking lot
(Shoo-bop-bop-bop-bop, shoo-bop-bop-bop-bop)

Hey farmer, farmer, put away the DDT now
Give me spots on my apples
But leave me the birds and the bees, please
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got till it's gone?
They paved paradise, put up a parking lot
(Shoo-bop-bop-bop-bop, shoo-bop-bop-bop-bop)
Late last night, I heard the screen door slam
And a big yellow taxi took away my old man
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got till it's gone?
They paved paradise, put up a parking lot
(Shoo-bop-bop-bop-bop)

I said, don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got till it's gone?
They paved paradise, put up a parking lot
(Shoo-bop-bop-bop-bop)

They paved paradise, put up a parking lot
(Shoo-bop-bop-bop-bop)

They paved paradise, put up a parking lot
Ah ha ha ha

[Verse 1]
If you're driving into town with a dark cloud above you
Dial in the number who's bound to love you

[Chorus 1]
Oh honey, you turn me on, I'm a radio
I'm a country station, I'm a little bit corny
I'm a wildwood flower waving for you
I'm a broadcasting tower waving for you

[Verse 2]
And I'm sending you out this signal here
I hope you can pick it up loud and clear

[Chorus 2]
I know you don't like weak women, you get bored so quick
And you don't like strong women 'cause they're hip to your tricks
It's been dirty for dirty down the line
But you know I come when you whistle when you're loving and kind

[Verse 3]
But if you've got too many doubts
If there's no good reception for me then tune me out

[Chorus 3]
'Cause honey, who needs the static, it hurts the head
And you wind up cracking and the day goes dismal
From "Breakfast Barney" to the sign-off prayer
What a sorry face you get to wear
I'm going to tell you again now if you're still listening there

[Outro]
If you're driving into town with a dark cloud above you
Dial in the number who's bound to love you
If you're lying on the beach with the transistor going
Kick off the sandflies, honey, the love's still flowing
If your head says forget it but your heart's still smoking
Call me at the station, the lines are open
Fresh to def she is
From her steps to her set she is
So death might not let me live
Ya dig
Fresh
Yes she is
Had a feeling
That it would be a day like this
The orchestra in my mind
Don't play like this
Naw
But I'm prepared for it
Got a little rare for it
Brushed off my Airs
Even
Cut my hair for it
Cause normally I don't care for it
Don't even be lookin for light like that
Then there it go
Yeah
Right over there
So I prepared to pour it
Little scared
My stare lowered
Momma said have no fear
Plus I'm already outta my chair
Gathered up my airs
On my square
From here for it
Its nothing, right?
So here go it
Whispered in her ear
It was crowded in here
Would she care to blow it
She said yeah
*You're my sunshine*
*(you're my sunshine)*
*You're my moonlight*
*(you're my moonlight)*
*You're the starry skies above me*
*Won't you please come down and hug me*
*Think I found love in this club tonight*

Never met her before
But I think I like her like a metaphor
Hard to get
In the
Car we sit
From the intro
She rolled down the window
Just in case I was a skitzo
I compliment on her common sense
I'm calm
A little more confident
Uh huh
And then we lose consciousness
...
She says that I've been waitin for you
And I know that you've been chasing me too
Since they kidnapped me from my castle
I've been thinking of you
I told a fire breathin dragon he bet not harm me
Or be sorry
When he meets my for my one man army
And thou has come to rescue me
My knight in shining armor
Yes you be
Woken up by the horn of a SUV
I said see
Too beautiful to let you sleep
You're my sunshine
*You're my sunshine*
*(you're my sunshine)*
*You're my moonlight*
*(you're my moonlight)*
*You're the starry skies above me*
*Won't you please come down and hug me*
*Think I found love in this club tonight*

Relationship is just 30 minutes long
Its kinda heavy
Maybe a little strong
Goin take much more than once
Can't trust what each of us say
At least for a month
Or two
Before I bid you adieu
Do this one thing for me
Out of the trillions of #s that's in the world
Just leave me a few
They'll lead to you
Won't be long and
I'll see you in the morning
Cool

You're my sunshine
(you're my sunshine)
You're my moonlight
(you're my moonlight)
You're the starry skies above me
Won't you please come down and hug me
Think I found love in this club tonight
You're my sunshine
You're my moonlight...

[Verse 1]
You have reached R. Kelly
Unfortunately, I'm sleep
Been out partying all night
And I'm blasted off that Hennessy
I hopped to hotel lobbies
Going to them after-parties
Throwing up and carrying on
'Bout to have somebody drive me home
I get through the door, fall on the floor
Get up, I'm staggering
Look upstairs, shit is blurry because I'm real bent
And now I don't know whether I'm coming or going
And this goes out to all of my honeys that's calling

[Chorus]
Leave your name right after the beep
And I'm sure to get back with you
If I'm not asleep or
Smoking on some trees or
Having a little sex or
If I'm not faded or
Making a baby
(Would you please, yeah)
Leave your name right after the beep
And I'm sure to get back with you
If I'm not asleep or (Said if)
Blowing on trees (I'm not)
Having some sex (Having sex, yeah)
If I'm not faded or
Making a baby

[Verse 2]
Drinking Belvedere, 7-Up, and gin
I told myself "never again"
Sleeping while the club is crunk
Don't make no sense to be that drunk
Arguing through the night
Pushing on people and starting fights
I was fucked up, I confess
People saying "Kellz is a hot mess"
Even after that, I was taking shots
Shot after shot, shot after shot, then...
I couldn't even open the door to my Benz
Dropped off and I get in the door now
Lying on the stairs snoring now
While you're calling me, calling me, calling me
Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up, Kellz
While you calling me, calling me, calling me
Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up
But I'm knocked out sleep

[Chorus]
So leave your name (please leave your name) right after the beep
And I'm sure to get back with you
If I'm not asleep or
Smoking on some trees or
Having a little sex or (in the middle of having sex)
If I'm not faded or
Making a baby
(Won't you please) Leave your name right after the beep
And I'm sure to get back with you
If I'm not asleep or (call you back)
Blowing on trees (promise I'll call you back)
Having some sex (I'll call you back)
If I'm not faded or (I'll call you back)
Making a baby

[Bridge]
When the morning comes and I'm sober
And everything is cool
I'll check my message
And I promise to get right back with you
And if you think I'm screening calls
You're muthafuckin' right
That's for the haters
I return calls to all the girls I like

[Chorus]
So leave your name right after the beep (leave your name)
And I'm sure to get back with you
If I'm not asleep or
Smoking on some trees or
Having a little sex or
If I'm not faded or
Making a baby
(Just leave your name, yeah)
Leave your name right after the beep
And I'm sure to get back with you
If I'm not asleep or (call you back)
Blowing on trees (promise I'll call you back)
Having some sex or (I'll call you back)
If I'm not faded or (I'll call you back)
Making a baby
Leave your name right after the beep
And I'm sure to get back with you
If I'm not asleep or
Smoking on some trees or
Having a little sex or
If I'm not faded or
Making a baby
Leave your name right after the beep...

Damn, 200 missed calls...
In the deep rolling hills of old Virginia
There's a place that I love so well
Where I spent many days of my childhood
In the cabin where we loved to dwell
White dove will mourn in sorrow
The willows will hang their heads
I'll live my life in sorrow
Since mother and daddy are dead
We were all so happy there together
In our peaceful little mountain home
But the Savior needs angels up in heaven
Now they sing around the great white throne
As the years roll by I often wonder
If we will all be together someday
And each night as I wander through the graveyard
Darkness finds me as I kneel to pray

[Spoken Intro]
Oh, I remember back in the day, Terry
Ah, you feel that too, huh?
That soul music, baby, woo
Ha ha ha, yeah
Warms your soul, huh?
You know, we can't be the only ones that's feeling this
I know, it's time to ressurect that 'cause there's nothing out there
There's nothing like that right now
That's right
Come on, Terry, break it down now

[Verse 1]
Back in the day when I was a child
I remember the songs that I heard
Dad would sit back and listen
He would rarely say a word (Rarely say a word)
Mama came home from another day of work
Talkin' 'bout Marvin Gaye
And the song that she heard on the radio
On her way home today
Talkin' 'bout

[Chorus]
Soul music
(The kind of music you make love to)
(I wanna hear) Soul music
(Yeah, what I wanna hear, what I wanna hear)
(I wanna hear) Soul music
(It made us feel good about ourselves)
Soul music
(Yeah, yeah)
What I wanna hear, what I wanna hear
(Wanna hear soul)

[Verse 2]
I remember every Saturday
We would sit down and watch TV
Every Saturday at 1 o'clock
Was a favorite time for me, yes it was
I couldn't wait to see the Soul Train comin' down the road
(Choo choo)
I couldn't wait to hear Don say "Love, peace, and soul"

[Chorus]
Soul music
(The kind of music we made love to)
(I wanna hear) Soul music
(Huh, is what I wanna hear, what I wanna hear)
(I wanna hear) Soul music
(It made us feel good about ourselves)
(I wanna hear) Soul music
What I wanna hear, what I wanna hear

[Bridge]
Those are the days I dreamed about
When music made us scream and shout (Oh yeah)
Took us away from our everyday life
And made us feel sanctified
Oh, we laughed and danced the night away
We didn't worry about work the next day
All we did was live
For a moment, nothing else mattered

[Chorus]
Soul music
(Ah, the kind of music you make love to)
(I wanna hear) Soul music
(What I wanna hear, what I wanna hear)
(I wanna hear) Soul music
(Oh, it made us feel good about ourselves)
(I wanna hear) Soul music
(Do you remember?)
What I wanna hear, what I wanna hear

[Bridge]
Come on
That's right
Oh-oh-oh (Ooh, woo, oh oh oh oh)

[Chorus]
Soul music
(Oh, the kind of music you make love to)
(I wanna hear) Soul music
(Huh, what I wanna hear, what I wanna hear)
(I wanna hear) Soul music
(Oh, it made us feel good about ourselves)
(I wanna hear) Soul music
What I wanna hear, what I wanna hear
Soul music
(Some kind of love, some kind of love)
(I wanna hear) Soul music
(Talkin' 'bout what I wanna hear)
Soul music
(What I wanna hear, what I wanna hear)
(The kind of music you make love to)
(I wanna hear) Soul music
(What I wanna hear)
What I wanna hear, what I wanna hear
(Sam Cooke, The Supremes)
Soul music
(Always made me feel good, yes it did)
(I wanna hear) Soul music
What I wanna hear, what I wanna hear

[Verse 1: R. Kelly]
I can see the colors of the rainbow
And I can feel the sun on my face
I see the light at the end of the tunnel
And I can feel heaven in its place

[Chorus]
And that's the sign of a victory
That's the sign of a victory

[Verse 2]
I can feel the spirit of the nations
And I can feel my wings riding the winds, yeah
I see the finish line just up ahead now
And I can feel it rising deep within

[Chorus]
That's the sign of a victory
That's the sign of a victory

[Verse 3]
Now I can see the distance of your journey
And how you fought with all your might
You open your eyes to global warming
And through it all, you sacrificed your life

[Chorus]
That's the sign of a victory, hey
That's the sign of a victory

[Bridge]
Oh, if we believe, we can achieve anything
Including the impossible, this I know
So let's lift up our heads, yeah, and raise the flag, yeah
And scream like you want to win, now let the games begin

[Chorus]
That's the sign of a victory, yeah
That's the sign of a victory, yeah
That's the sign of a victory, oh
That's the sign of a victory, yeah

[Outro]
That's it, when you keep on fighting
After you lost your strength
That's the sign of a victory
When darkness is all around you
You still find your way
That's the sign of a victory
Oh, you got the victory, sing
Come on and sing
Lift up your voice and sing
Stand up, oh yeah, stand up
Common goal, sign of a victory
Oh, that's the sign of a victory

[Verse 1]
Me and all my friends
We're all misunderstood
They say we stand for nothing
And there's no way we ever could
Now we see everything that's going wrong
With the world and those who lead it
We just feel like we don't have the means
To rise above and beat it

[Chorus]
So we keep waiting
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting
Waiting on the world to change
It's hard to beat the system
When we're standing at a distance
So we keep waiting
Waiting on the world to change

[Verse 2]
Now, if we had the power
To bring our neighbors home from war
They would have never missed a Christmas
No more ribbons on their door
And when you trust your television
What you get is what you got
'Cause when they own the information
They can bend it all they want

[Chorus]
That's why we're waiting
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting
Waiting on the world to change
It's not that we don't care
We just know that the fight ain't fair
So we keep on waiting
Waiting on the world to change

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
We're still waiting
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting
Waiting on the world to change
One day our generation
Is gonna rule the population

[Outro]
So we keep on waiting
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting
Waiting on the world to change
Waiting on the world to change
Waiting on the world to change
Waiting on the world to change

Drive me wild, drive me wild
When I was young I dreamed of you
Far and away, my dreams come true
Now I know what love has done
Children of mine, we all are one

When I was young I looked to you
You were the world I never knew
Through the years we all have grown
Knowing your love forever strong

Would you walk away if I raised my voice?
Do you think I taught you well?
Time after time after time

In younger days I felt for you
With all the pain that we went through
We believe the one above
Father and Son, forever love

Hand in hand, the future's here
Now that we crossed the bridge of tears
Finding truth and facing fears
We can walk on, the road is clear
Walk across the bridge
Take my hand
Walk across the bridge
Come to me

Would you walk away if I raised my voice?
Do you think I taught you well?
Time after time after time

Walk across the bridge
Come to me
Walk across the bridge

You'll never be far away
You'll never be far away
You'll never be far away
Meet me in the trial !
Its goin down !
Meet me in the mall !
Its goin down !
Meet me in the club !
Its goin down !
Anywhere ya meet me garenteed its goin down !

[Chorus]
You are the sunshine of my life
That's why I'll always be around
You are the apple of my eye
Forever you'll stay in my heart

[Verse 1]
I feel like this is the beginning
Though I loved you for one million years
If I thought our love was ending
I'd find myself drowning in my own tears

[Chorus]
You are the sunshine of my life
That's why I'll always be around
You are the apple of my eye
Forever you'll stay in my heart

[Verse 2]
You must have known that I was lonely
Because you came to my rescue
And though I know that this must be heaven
How could so much love be inside of you

[Chorus]
You are the sunshine of my life
That's why I'll always be around
You are the apple of my eye
Forever you'll stay in my heart

[Outro]
'Cause you are
The sunshine of my life

Light my fire, light my fire, light my fire
I'm feeling low, mighty low, I wonder why
I wonder why, why am I such a lonely guy?
A man's a fool to be alone when the sun goes down
You need a woman of your own when the sun goes down

If there's a gal in your arms, one you can love
Someone who loves only you
Then you'll never ever roam when the sun goes down
You'll always want to hurry home when the sun goes down

(A man's a fool to be alone when the sun goes down)
(You need a woman of your own when the sun goes down)

If there's a gal in your arms, one you can love
Someone who loves only you
Then you'll never ever roam when the sun goes down
You'll always wanna hurry home when the sun goes down

I got my home, I got my horse and he's my pal
But what's it mean, all of it mean without a gal?
I got my horse and he's my pal but I got no gal

[Intro: Melvin Franklin]
Lonely, I'm so lonely
Lonely, I'm so lonely

[Verse 1: Paul Williams]
Lonely, lonely man am I
As I sit here in my lonely room
People now, nothing seems the same since you said to me we're all through
Now, my telephone never rings anymore
And no one ever knocks on my door
Lonely, lonely man am I

[Verse 2: Paul Williams]
Now people, sometimes I sit and I stare at her picture all day long
Wondering how could a woman that I treated so good just do me so wrong
Now, no sense in me denying
Ever since she's been gone I've been crying
Lonely, lonely man am I

[Verse 3: Paul Williams]
Now I, haven't been able to be all right
She said to me to try to sleep at night
Everywhere I look, our picture lies a-face
I'm just a lonely man with a tear-stained face
Lonely, lonely man am I

[Outro: Paul Williams]
I'm so lonely, so lonely (lonely, lonely)
I'm so lonely, lonely
I'm so lonely, so lonely (lonely, lonely)

[Alicia Keys]
John and I are both deeply inspired by the music of the 1960s
We stand in the shadow of timeless and monumental artists like the Beatles and Stevie Wonder, Bob Dylan, Marvin Gaye, Aretha Franklin
The forever changed what popular music could say and what it could mean

[John Legend]
The masterpiece we're about to play tonight was written by Paul just as the Beatles were breaking up. Paul dreamt of his mother Mary, who he lost when he was 15, comforting him and telling him everything was gonna be ok.  It's a song that comforted generations with its beauty and its message


When I find myself in times of trouble
Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be
And in my hour of darkness
She is standing right in front of me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be
When the brokenhearted people
Living in the world agree
There will be an answer, let it be
For though they may be parted
There is still a chance that they will see
There will be an answer, let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Yeah, there will be an answer, let it be
Let it be, let it be now, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
There will be an answer, let it be
When the night is cloudy
There is still a light that shines on me
Shine until tomorrow, let it be
I wake up to the sound of music
Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be
Oh, let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
There will be an answer, let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be
Oh, now let it be
The night time, the moon light
And here am I again
Living through every moment
Of how we used to be, yeah, yeah
The night time, the moon light
Is breaking through my pain
Leaving me where I'm happy
And keeping me in a dream
Like a wounded bird in the lonely sky
I just can't forget that I used to fly
Take me back, take me back, to the moon of dreams
Bring me back, bring me back to the moon of dreams
Like a frozen tear on a shaking lip
Left alone with fear and it hurts so deep
Take me back, take me back, to the moon of dreams
Bring me back, bring me back to the moon of dreams
Uh, wings, dreams
Take me back, take me back, to the moon of dreams
Bring me back, bring me back to the moon of dreams
The sunrise, a new day
I'm waking up again
All alone with my memories
I keep thinking about you
The sunrise, a new day
It's nothing else but pain
I will wait for the sunset
To talk to you, in my dreams
Like a wounded bird in the lonely sky
I just can't forget that I used to fly
Take me back, take me back, to the moon of dreams
Bring me back, bring me back to the moon of dreams
Like a frozen tear on a shaking lip
Left alone with fear and it hurts so deep
Take me back, take me back, to the moon of dreams
Bring me back, bring me back to the moon of dreams
Daytime, the sunlight, I will never love again
We try to work it out, so many different ways but
We can never be friends
When the sun goes down and I think about you
How we used to be, then it rises again
And I loose a friend, and here I am again
Waiting on the moon of dreams
Take, take me back, take, take me back
Bring, bring me back, bring, bring me back
Like a wounded bird in the lonely sky
I just can't forget that I used to fly
Take me back, take me back, to the moon of dreams
Bring me back, bring me back to the moon of dreams
Like a frozen tear on a shaking lip
Left alone with fear and it hurts so deep
Take me back, take me back, to the moon of dreams
Bring me back, bring me back to the moon of dreams
You got me running, you got me hiding
You got me running, hiding, hiding, running
Anywhere you want it, let it roll, yeah, yeah, yeah
Hey, you got me where you want me, baby doing what you want me to do
Going up, going down, going up, down, down, up
Anyway you want it, let it roll, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, you got me where you want me, baby doing what you want me to do
I say, honey baby, honey you don't have to go
I'm going to pack my bag, baby, down that road I go
Roll on, roll on baby, honey what is wrong with you?
Now baby, baby, baby,...
Oh baby, honey what is wrong with you?
You don't treat your baby, treat me like you used to do

[Verse 1: Dennis Edwards & (Melvin Franklin)]
Sick minds, sad sights
Neverending sleepless nights have been accepted as an everyday thing
Wiretapping, kidnapping
(Will the Russians push the button?)
I tell you, people, our thoughts and values have got to change
They say love is the strongest force on this earth
Uh, but to me, peace among people surpasses love in worth
People jobs don`t come no bigger than the one we`ve got to do
If we don`t give peace a chance, what do you think is gonna happen to me and you?
(Think about it)
That`s why I am reaching out my hand to be your friend
This unrest between races has got to come to an end
Don`t let the color of my skin confuse you
I swear on a stack of Bibles I won`t misuse you
So put your hand in mine
Huh, we're gonna form a human chain, mightier than a hurricane

[Chorus: Dennis Edwards & The Temptations]
And walk this land, hand in hand, day and night, black and white
We gotta unite the world
Walk this land, day and night, hand in hand, black and white
Come on and sing it, sing it, sing it, sing it, sing it
We got to unite the world
Walk this land, day and night, hand in hand, black and white
Come on and sing it, sing it, sing it, sing it, sing it with me
We got to unite the world
Walk this land, day and night, ahnd in hand, black and white
God almighty, sing it, sing it, sing it
Ah, unite the world
Come on, come on, come on, ah

[Verse 2: Dennis Edwards]
Oh, ding-dong-ding let the freedom bell ring
The good Lord made you and me, what he wanted us to be
Free all those people you got chained up in your mind
Now there`s truth in what I`m saying
We gotta stop the games we`re playing
Two wrongs ain`t never made a right (Right)
Hung up, tripped out, whatever you may be
Now is the time to set yourself free
Put your hand in mine, huh, come on
Oh, and let`s walk
Oh, we gonna...

[Chorus: Dennis Edwards & The Temptations]
Walk this land, day and night, hand in hand, black and white
Sing it with me now
Walk this land, day and night, hand in hand, black and white
Raise your voices and sing along
Come on, we gonna unite the world
Walk this land, day and night, hand in hand, black and white
We gonna put an end to this insanity
Walk this land, day and night, hand in hand, black and white
We gonna unite the world
Walk this land, day and night, hand in hand, black and white
Sing it, sing it, sing it, sing it, sing it
Aw, come on, come on, come on, come on

[Outro: The Temptations]
Walk this land, day and night, hand in hand, black and white
Walk this land, day and night, hand in hand, black and white
Walk this land, day and night, hand in hand, black and white
Honey, your love is gone, I know your love is gone
It's a desperate situation
Now I'm all alone, I'm all alone
It's a desperate situation

I'm without happiness, without tenderness
Without the love we used to share
I spend eternity reliving memories
'cause the truth is just too much to bear

Now that you don't love me, you love someone new
Death could be no worse than what I've been going through
Girl, this life of mine is just a waste of time
It's a desperate situation

Oh, it's a lonely world without your loving, girl
It's a desperate situation

I'm a dreamer now, just a dreamer now
'cause it hurts so much when I awake
But in dreams of you, girl there's no-one new
I'm still the only man you take
Night after night I lay staring at the ceiling
Wondering where you are, who you're with and what you're feeling
Oh, I've been forgotten, Lord knows I can't forget
It's a desperate situation

Oh, this foolish heart of mine still loves you, yeah
It's a desperate situation
Oh, come back, baby
Come save me, baby

Night after night I lay staring at the ceiling
Wondering where you are, who you're with and what you're feeling
Oh, I've been forgotten, Lord knows I can't forget
It's a desperate situation

Oh, this foolish heart of mine still loves you, yeah
It's a desperate situation
Oh, this life of mine is just a waste of time
It's a desperate situation

[Verse 1]
Hey Mister, walkin' with the blues, yeah
Hey sister, payin' heavy dues, well
Havin' troubles, and it ain't so hard to find, yeah
When you're ridin' double now, and you're running out of time, yeah

[Chorus]
No need to feel that you lack the spirit
Within your body, ha, but it's in your soul
If you wanna be loved, then let somebody hear it
Might as well face the facts, no need to be holdin' back
Need a little taste of love
Need a little taste
Need a little taste of love
I need a little, little taste

[Verse 2]
Hey mister (Need a little taste), tell me how long has it been, ooh
Hey sister (Need a little taste), so happy to pretend, well
Why keep the sorrow (Need a little taste), oh, where it don't belong, no, no, no
Well, come tomorrow (You need a little taste), oh, help me sing the song
Help me

[Chorus]
No need to feel that you lack the spirit
Within your body, ha, but it's in your soul
If you wanna be loved, then let somebody hear it
Might as well face the facts, no need to be holdin' back
Need a little taste of love

[Bridge]
(I need it, you need it) Hoo
(I need it, you need it) Hey, hey

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
Ooh, I know what you need
(Need a little taste of love)
I know what you need, yeah
(Need a little taste of love)
I know what you need
(Need a little taste of love)
I know what you need
(Need a little taste of love)
I know what you need, hey
(Need a little taste of love)
I know what you need
(Need a little taste of love)
I know what you need, well
(Need a little taste of love)
I know what you need
(Need a little taste of love)
I feel the trembling tingle of a sleepless night
Creep through my fingers and the moon is bright
Beams of blue come flickering through my window pane
Like gypsy moths that dance around a candle flame

And I wonder if you know
That I never understood
That although you said you'd go
Until you did I never thought you would

Moonlight used to bathe the contours of your face
While chestnut hair fell all around the pillow case
The fragrance of your body rests beneath my head
A sympathy bouquet left with the love that's dead

And I wonder if you know
That I never understood
That although you said you'd go
Until you did I never thought you would

Never thought the words you said were true
Never thought you said just what you meant
Never knew how much I needed you
Never thought you'd leave until you went
Morning comes and morning goes with no regret
And evening brings the memories I can't forget
Empty rooms that echo as I climb the stairs
And empty clothes that drape and fall on empty chairs

And I wonder if you know
That I never understood
That although you said you'd go
Until you did I never thought you would
Artist - somebody didn't hear me
(What'd he say?)
Artist - formerly known as Prince
You gotta get your peace on
Peace, whoa oh
Peace
That's what we're here for
And not to war

When the war upon people of color thru needles
Designed to disease instead of relieve
When it ceases
I'll be a man of peace
(Say what)
When this mask of vendetta
Like tears on the face of Coretta
Roll down and go away
I'll be happier
(Happier)
I'll be a man of peace
Everybody say!
Peace, whoa oh
Peace
That's what we're here for
(That's what we're here for)
And not to war

When the time that we spend
Watching TV depends on
Whether or not it destroy or transcend
Then I won't need
(I won't, I won't)
Won't need a warranty
When the power of the hour is not yours but is ours
And the faces we see reflect all that we be indeed
There'll be a jubilee

Everybody say
Peace, whoa oh
Peace
That's what we're here for
(That's what we're here for)
And not to war
Bass

(Talkin' about freedom)
The rewards that we share will be based on what's fair
And not the curliness or the thick of our hair
Real competition, if you dare!
Music is our middle name
And we don't wanna play your game
So when the mergers you make are with us
And you take a fair slice of the cake
That we bake then you break
That would be real cool
But y'all wanna act like fools!
(What's up with that?)
Can't we all just get along?
And have peace, whoa oh
Peace
That's what we're here for
And not to war
Peace
Peace
Peace, whoa oh
Peace
That's what we're here for
And not to war
In case some of y'all didn't hear it right
I didn't call him, his name wasn't the artist
Artist, Artist
Artist - every syllable must be heard
Artist - formerly known as Prince
You got to get your peace in
Y'all tryin' to start something up in here

[Verse 1]
He bought her a diamond for her throat
He put her in a ranch house on a hill
She could see the valley barbecues
From her window sill
See the blue pools in the squinting sun
Hear the hissing of summer lawns

[Verse 2]
He put up a barbed wire fence
To keep out the unknown
And on every metal thorn
Just a little blood of his own
She patrols that fence of his to a Latin drum
And the hissing of summer lawns

[Chorus]
Darkness, wonder makes it easy
Darkness, with a joyful mask
Darkness, tube's gone, darkness, darkness, darkness
No color, no contrast

[Verse 3]
A diamond dog carrying a cup and a cane
Looking through a double glass
Looking at too much pride and too much shame
There's a black fly buzzing
There's a heat wave burning in her master's voice
Hissing summer lawns

[Verse 4]
He gave her his darkness to regret
And good reason to quit him
He gave her a roomful of Chippendale that nobody sits in
Still she stays with a love of some kind
It's the lady's choice
The hissing of summer lawns

[Outro]
Darkness
Darkness
Darkness
Darkness

[Verse 1]
Many nights I sit here
With memories by the score
Thinking of the nights I spent
With the girl I still adore

[Chorus]
So I'm going back to see her
Before my days are done
Going back to see her in the land of the sea and sun

[Verse 2]
Once I had a notion
'Bout this Bajin girl
I put my thoughts in motion
And found my heart in a whirl

[Chorus]
So I'm going back to see her
Before my days are done
Going back to see her in the land of the sea and sun

[Verse 3]
Ever since I left here
Nothing's been the same
Think I'll pull up anchor, yes
Going back and give her my name

[Chorus]
Going back to see her
Before my days are done
Going back to see her in the land of the sea and sun

[Outro]
Yes, I'm going back to see her
Before my days are done
Going back to see her in the land of the sea and sun
When I first met you, baby
Baby, you were just sweet sixteen
When I first met you, baby
Baby, you were just sweet sixteen
You just left your home then, woman
Ah, the sweetest thing I'd ever seen

But you wouldn't do nothing, baby
You wouldn't do anything I asked to
You wouldn't do nothing for me, baby
You wouldn't do anything I asked to
You know you ran away from your home, baby
And now you wanna run away from old B. too

You know I loved you, baby
I loved you before I could call your name
You know I loved you, baby
Baby I loved you, I love you before I could call your name
Well, it seems like everything I do now baby
Everything I do is in vain
My brother's in Korea, baby
My sister's down in New Orleans
Brother's in Korea baby
My sister's down in New Orleans
You know I'm having so much trouble woman
Baby, I wonder, what in the world is gonna happen to me

You know I love you
And I'll do anything you tell me to
You know I love you
And I'll do anything you tell me to
Well, there ain't nothing in the world, woman
Babe, it ain't nothing
Nothing in the world I wouldn't do it for you

You can treat me mean, baby
But I'll keep on loving you just the same
You can treat me mean baby
But I'll keep on loving you just the same
But one of these days, baby
You're gonna give a lot of money
To hear someone call my name

Yes, sweet sixteen baby... sweet sixteen...
Yes, the sweetest thing baby
The sweetest thing I ever seen
You know I'm having so much trouble, woman
Baby I wonder
Yes I wonder
Baby I wonder
Oh, I wonder what in the world's gonna happen to me
Somewhere along the way I found the meaning
Woke up dreamin' along the way
Never quite seems the same when you awakin'
And makin' up for the time you've such a price to pay
And then they take the dream away, and it just ain't fair

Help me thru the night Mama, help me to ease the pain
Tell me it's alright, help me thru the night once again

That's the danger in petending
Trying to defend yourself from someone else's war
Don't know what they're fighting for
And they just don't care

(Guitar Solo)

So help me see the light mama, open my eyes again
Tell me it's alright, help me thru the night once again

(Ooos and Aaahs)
Would ya help me
Would ya help me
Lady, are you crying, do the tears belong to me
Did you think our time together was all gone
Lady, you've been dreaming, I'm as close as I can be
And I swear to you our time has just begun
Close your eyes and rest your weary mind
I promise I will stay right here beside you
Today our lives were joined, became entwined
I wish that you could know how much I love you
Lady, are you happy, do you feel the way I do
Are there meanings that you've never seen before
Lady, my sweet lady, I just can't believe it's true
And it's like I've never, ever loved before

(Chorus) Lady, are you crying, do the tears belong to me
Did you think our time together was all gone
Lady, my sweet lady, I'm as close as I can be
And I swear to you our time has just begun
Done laid around and stayed around
This old town too long
Summer's almost gone
Summer's almost gone

Done laid around and stayed around
This old town too long
And I feel like I want to travel on

I've waited here for almost a year
Waitin' for the sun to shine
Waitin' for the sun to shine
Hopin' you'd change your mind

Waited here for almost a year
Hoping you'd change your mind
Now I feel like I want to travel on

Well, the chili wind will soon begin
I'll be on my way
Gone a lonesome day
Going home to stay
Chili wind will soon begin
I'll be on my way
Because I feel like I want to travel on

Done laid around and stayed around
This old town too long
Summer's almost gone
Summer's almost gone

Done laid around and stayed around
This old town too long
And I feel like I want to travel on
Can't stop thinking about, stop thinking -
I can't stop thinking about you
Can't stop thinking about, stop thinking -
I can't stop thinking about you
Been looking at the things that you got there
You make me wanna draw pictures of you everywhere
You're kinda funny, but you think that I'm a bad girl
Such a hottie hottie stuck inside a cold world
I can't stop thinking about, stop thinking -
I can't stop thinking about you
Can't stop thinking about, stop thinking -
I can't stop thinking about you
You always seem to like a little hide and seek
You keep me guess, so I can play a game of double jeopardy
You got me wondering if you ever gonna make a move
If you would ask me, I would tell you that it's over, dude
Sometimes I just lie awake
And I rewind and replay everything that you say
I can't stop thinking about, stop thinking -
I can't stop thinking about you
Can't stop thinking about, stop thinking -
I can't stop thinking about you
It's like living on a dream
Running circles in the street
You can call it A.D.D
If you want to
I can't stop thinking about, stop thinking -
I can't stop thinking about you
I promise I don't need to geek out
But if I ever got you home
I'd tell you baby, I would freak out
I can't stop thinking about, stop thinking -
I can't stop thinking about you
Can't stop thinking about, stop thinking -
I can't stop thinking about -
Stuck inside a cold world
I can't stop thinking about, stop thinking -
I can't stop thinking about you
Can't stop thinking about, stop thinking -
I can't stop thinking about you
It's like living on a dream
Running circles in the street
You can call it A.D.D
If you want to
I can't stop thinking about, stop thinking -
I can't stop thinking about you
I try but I can't seem to get myself to think of
Anything but you
Your breath on my face, your warm gentle kiss
I taste the truth, I taste the truth
You know what I came here for, so I won't ask for more

I wanna be with you, if only for a night
To be the one who's in your arms, who holds you tight
I wanna be with you there's nothing more to say
There's nothing else I want more than to feel this way

I wanna be with you

So I'll hold you tonight like I would if you were mine
To hold forever more
And I'll savor each touch that I wanted so much
To feel before, to feel before
How beautiful it is just to be like this

I wanna be with you, if only for a night
To be the one who's in your arms, who holds you tight
I wanna be with you there's nothing more to say
There's nothing else I want more than to feel this way
I wanna be with you
(I wanna be with you)
I wanna be with you

Oh, baby, I can't fight this feeling anymore
It drives me crazy when I try to
So call my name, take my hand
Can you make my wish, baby, your command

I wanna be with you there's nothing more to say
There's nothing else I want more than to feel this way

I wanna be with you
(I wanna be with you)
I wanna be with you
I wanna be with you, yeah
(I wanna be with you)

I wanna be, I wanna be with you
I wanna be, I wanna be, I wanna be

I wanna be, I wanna be, I wanna be
I wanna be with you, I wanna be with you, I wanna be
(I wanna be with you)
I wanna be with you, I wanna be with you
I try but I can't seem to get myself to think of
Anything but you
Your breath on my face, your warm gentle kiss
I taste the truth, I taste the truth
You know what I came here for, so I won't ask for more

I wanna be with you, if only for a night
To be the one who's in your arms, who holds you tight
I wanna be with you there's nothing more to say
There's nothing else I want more than to feel this way

I wanna be with you

So I'll hold you tonight like I would if you were mine
To hold forever more
And I'll savor each touch that I wanted so much
To feel before, to feel before
How beautiful it is just to be like this

To be the one who's in your arms, who holds you tight
I wanna be with you there's nothing more to say
There's nothing else I want more than to feel this way

I wanna be with you
(I wanna be with you)
I wanna be with you
Oh, baby, I can't fight this feeling anymore
It drives me crazy when I try to
So call my name, take my hand
Can you make my wish, baby, your command

[Intro]
First of all, you gotta understand
This album is not about
Me trying to show somebody I can do Reggae music
Or I'm Reggae or anything like that
This song is about is about reaching the masses
You know what I sayin?
As a matter of fact
The whole MVProject is really about
It's not about R. Kelly shinin'
It's about me shinin' the light
On my people in Jamaica with my music
'Cause I got fans there and they love me
You know what I mean?

[Verse 1]
Don't like confrontation
Don't like inconsideration
Don't like false accusations
Can't stand victimization
Don't like starvation
Oh, I never liked discrimination
It's not all about separation
It's about healing the nations

[Chorus]
I like love
I'm all about that thing called love
Throw your hands up if you know about that thing called love
I like love
I'm all about that thing called love
Throw your hands up if you know about that thing called love
I like love
I'm all about that thing called love
Throw your hands up if you know about that thing called love
I like love
I'm all about that thing called love
Throw your hands up if you know about that thing called love

[Verse 2]
I don't like aggravation
Don't like humiliation
And I can't stand defamation
And I really don't like temptation
Don't like exploitation
I don't like decimation
It's not about tribulations
It's all about salvation

[Chorus]
I like love
I'm all about that thing called love
Throw your hands up if you know about that thing called love
I like love
I'm all about that thing called love
Throw your hands up if you know about that thing called love
I like love
I'm all about that thing called love
Throw your hands up if you know about that thing called love
I like love
I'm all about that thing called love
Throw your hands up if you know about that thing called love

[Bridge]
It's all about love
No matter where I go there's this one thing I know, yeah
It's all about love
City to city when I'm up in the club, yeah
It's all about love
Oh block to block, all around the world, holla
It's all about love
And if you feel me, real people, then put your hands up

[Chorus]
I like love
I'm all about that thing called love
Throw your hands up if you know about that thing called love
I like love
I'm all about that thing called love
Throw your hands up if you know about that thing called love
I like love
I'm all about that thing called love
Throw your hands up if you know about that thing called love
I like love
I'm all about that thing called love
Throw your hands up if you know about that thing called love

[Outro]
Yeah, I hope y'all understand, you know what I'm sayin'
Because there's people out there that
You know, fans out there that'll probably never get to see me
I'll probably never get to see them
But I want them to know that I love 'em
I appreciate them for supporting R. Kelly, you know what I'm sayin'
In different countries, all different cultures, the world
Y'all made me who I am
And I just wanna take this song to say "thank you"
God bless you and your families
Peace
What does she get for all the love she gave you
There on the ladder of regrets?
(Ahh) Mighty river, give her all she gets

What does she get for all the love she gave you
There on the ladder of regrets?
Daytime nighttime suffering is all she gets

Where all the prizes for the games she entered
With little chance of much success?
Daytime nightime suffering is all she gets

Come on, river, overflow
Let your love of you people show
Come on, river, flow through me
Let your love of your people be
You are the river, I am the stream
Flow mighty river through me

What does it pay to play the leading lady
When the like the damsel in distress
Daytime nightime suffering is all she gets?
No less (no less), no more (no more)
No sea (no sea), no shore (no shore)
No sand (no sand), no pail (no pail)
No fairy tale anymore

Come on, river, flow through me
Don't be stopped by insanity
Come on, river, overflow
Let your love for your neighbours grow

You are the river, I am the stream
Flow, mighty river, through me

Daytime nightime suffering is all she gets, woah
Daytime nightime suffering is all she gets, woah woah
Daytime nightime suffering is all she gets (she gets)
What does she get for all the love she gave you?
I do not hate nor do I love bourgeois people who fool themselves
They're so surprised that what they thought was a key
To their happiness was in fact not

Guilty, ill, out of comfort
Bourgeoisie, they told themselves
"That's it, we've got it" with happiness and they never
Were so stressed out and unhappy

Guilty, ill, out of comfort
Bourgeoisie, they told themselves
"That's it, we've got it" with happiness and they never
Were so stressed out and unhappy
I've had fame and fortune
Women come knock on my door
I've lived to the limit
And maybe a little bit more

There are so many stories
Of how I got out of control
Some say it's a woman
Some say it's my troubled soul

I'm like a crazy old soldier
Fighting a war all my own
Just me and the whiskey
And the bottles are ten thousand strong

You'd think I'd give up
As many times I've been hit
But like a crazy old soldier
I just dont know when to quit

Barrooms and bedrooms
Are just faces and places and names
Once for the pleasure
And Lord knows, once for the pain
I've tried to forget her
And all of the things that we've done
But as long as there are memories
I'll never hang up my gun

I'm like a crazy old soldier
Fighting a war all my own
Just me and the whiskey
And the bottles are ten thousand strong

(Oh, sing ya) You'd think I'd give up
As many times I've been hit, never
But like a crazy old soldier
I just dont know when to quit
I'll never die
And you know that it's no Joke
Woo oooh
I'll let you know
And in that you'll never know
Woo oooh

And it hurts and I cry
And you're leaving with my heart
I can live but you know
I'll obey the original
I got to know the creation
I got a single question

Believe in love
Don't you know that is no joke
Ooooh
I've got to learn
But you know that is no joke
Oooh
I, I, I, I

I'll never die
And you know that it's no joke
Woo oooh
I'll let you know
And in that you'll never know
Woo oooh

Mend my heart I can live
But you never let you go
I'll go look all over
But you never let me know
I got the love connection
You got a single question

Believe in love
Don't you know that is no joke
Ooooh
I've got to learn
But you know that is no joke
Oooh

I, I, I, I

Don't you know
I'm alright
I could never let you go
I'm alright
Its not my fault
You know it
Eeehh
I got to see you Honey
Believe in love
But you know that is no joke
I've got to learn
But you know that its no joke 

[x2]

Oooh

You can't run, you can't hide

[Intro]
Slave
Slave
Slave
Slave
Slave
Slave, yeah
Slave, yeah

[Verse 2]
Slave to the system here before I was born
Slave to the master, workin' me till I'm worn
The only penthouse I can count on's a big black ball and chain
Slave to the system, the future's all arranged

[Chorus]
Oh, you better fetch that water, boy
Oh, you better fetch that water, boy

[Interlude]
Slave
Slave to the system
Slave

[Verse 2]
Thompson's my last name, but my daddy's name is Lloyd
The farther back I trace it, the more it becomes null and void
All my life I've struggled just to be called a boy
Slave to the system, oh what a joy

[Chorus]
Oh, you better fetch that water, boy
Hell if I do!
Oh, you better fetch that water, boy
Oh, I'm just a slave to the system

[Outro]
Here before I was born
Slave to the master, workin' me till I'm worn
Slave
Slave to the system
Slave
Slave
Slave
Sometimes her hand warm from dreaming
Finds it's way to my side of the morning
And in between waking and sleeping
We make love, we make love
Sometimes she's quietly busy
And I smile away all her intensions
And among her forgotten excuses
We make love, we make love
Sometimes we just make love
Sometimes we just make love
Wo wo wo
Sometimes in a room full of strangers
In the distance of laughter and small talk
With a look that takes only a moment
We make love, we make love
And after a moment of difference
In the quiet of dying confusions
On a blanket of gentle forgiving
We make love, we make love
Sometimes we just make love
Sometimes we just make love
Wo wo wo, we make love

[Hook]
You told me it's the truth but I'm still afraid
I'm not the one who would jump the gun
If I had proof, I'd take off my shades
And be blinded by the sun

[Verse 1]
One lie, two lies, I shoulda said shoe flies
Shame on me, I usually see through lies
Said you loved me, yeah right, I thought we were air tight
You were playing foul, It was far from a fair fight
I hung onto your every word, sweetest shit I ever heard
I even made you pinky swear just so I was reassured
The rumors started gettin back, that so and so was hittin' that
Silly me for being such a 'natic for that kitty cat

[Hook]
You told me it's the truth but I'm still afraid
I'm not the one who would jump the gun
If I had proof, I'd take off my shades
And be blinded by the sun
You said you were in love but the games you played
I hope that you're having fun
You see I need you to take off my shades
And be blinded by the sun

[Verse 2]
Three lies, four lies, you shoulda been a tour guide
The way you led me on, knowing I was one of four guys
Said you loved me, okay, where were you the other day?
Your car was parked at 38th but you were at your mothers place?
Your mother lives on Broadway, I followed you all day
I called but you ignored it when you kissed him in the hallway
Call me crazy, call me odd, call me what you want to
But Karma is a bitch, I pray to God she always haunts you

[Hook]
You told me it's the truth but I'm still afraid
I'm not the one who would jump the gun
If I had proof, I'd take off my shades
And be blinded by the sun
You said you were in love but the games you played
I hope that you're having fun
You see I need you to take off my shades
And be blinded by the sun

[Bridge]
I wear my sunglasses at night
So I can, so I can
I wear my sunglasses at night
So I can, so I can
I wear my sunglasses at night
So I can, so I can
I wear my sunglasses at night
So I can, so I can
I wear my sunglasses at night
So I can, so I can

[Hook]
You told me it's the truth but I'm still afraid
I'm not the one who would jump the gun
If I had proof, I'd take off my shades
And be blinded by the sun
You said you were in love but the games you played
I hope that you're having fun
You see I need you to take off my shades
And be blinded by the sun
Well I had a woman
She was nice, kind and loving to me in every way
Oh I had a woman
She was nice, kind and loving to me in every way
Oh she used to love me
And bring my breakfast to my bed every day

For ten long years
She was my pride and joy
Oh for ten long years
She was my pride and joy
And I used to call her my little girl
Oh she used to call me
She used to call me her little boy

Oh it's all over baby
You know I'm all alone
It's all over baby
Damn you know I'm all alone
Well the reason you hear me singing the blues baby
Yeah you know my baby's gone
She's gone she's gone
All he can do
Is turn the other way
Although he'd love to love you

Your eyes deceive
Your lovers leave
And you go crawling again
Into your shadows and then

Run away
Why don't you just run off
And hide once again
In your damned illusion

Nights so sweet
The perfume beats
Into your veins and then
It's all insane again

Feelings burn
The blues return
Those lips are calling
And you go falling and falling and falling
Run away
Why don't you just run off
And hide once again
In your damned illusion.. yeah

Run away
Why don't you just run off
And hide once again
In your damned illusion

You can run off baby but you know that
You just can't hide no more
From your lowdown ways
Can't get away from your damned illusions
Ooh ain't it hard babe just to get through the night
When you can't see the light for your damned illusion

You can run off babe
Once again your fooling around
In your damned illusion.. yeah.. yeah

Once again you will fall into you damned illusion

10. *Follow That Man
(Boz Scaggs)
You take one part Buddha
And two parts cat
Run them through your computer
And that's where he's at
Some say he's ruthless
And some say he's a saint
They tell you he's innocent
I tell you he ain't

I hear him think
I follow his flight
I'd know that footstep
In the darkest of nights

I follow that man

He's a creature of stealth
Don't run with the mob
Won't stop at nothing
Till he finishes the job

I hear him out there laughing
When he knows I'm closing in
I feel the desperation
Of the fool within
He's like your shadow
You can stop it dead
But when you go to take him
He's a step ahead
I follow that man

(I follow from a distance
As he appears
Between the darkness and the light
Meeted curtains part
He takes a drink
He takes a smoke
Takes a paper
He takes me along for the ride
I snatch his bag
We go deeper
Into the quarter
Through a rain slaked dampness into an alley
The smell of garbage and perfume
Brick by brick
His woman meets me
But it doesn't matter
Anyway, whose chasing who
I'm just holding the bag)

I hear him out there laughing
When he knows I'm closing in
I feel the desperation
I hear him think
I follow his flight
I'd know that footstep
In the darkest of nights

I follow that man
I follow that man

I watch him smoke
I watch him drink
I follow that man
I follow that man
London by night is a wonderful sight
There is magic abroad in the air
I'm often told that the streets turn into gold
When the moon shines on Circus and Square

Deep in the dark that envelops the park
There's romance in each cigarette's glow
Down by the Thames, lights that sparkle like gems
Seem to wink at each girl and her beau

Up comes the moon when the city's asleep
He's not alone, for it seems
Somewhere up there stands an angel to keep
Her watch while each Londoner dreams

My love and I saw the sun leave the sky
Then we kissed in the fast-fading light
Most people say they love London by day
But lovers love London by night
Sometime I wonder, just what I'm prayin' for?
I win the battle but I always lose the war
I just keep right on stumblin' in this no-man land out there
But I know, yes I know
There must be a better world somewhere
Flyin' high, some joker clips my wings
Just because he gets a kick out of doing those kind of things
I keep on fallin' in space or just hangin' in mid-air
But I know, yes, I know
There must be a better world somewhere
Everybody I know, only love themselves
Every woman I love, loves somebody else
Every woman got a license to break my heart
Every love affair is over before it gets a chance to start
Everybody I know, only love themselves
Every woman I love, loves somebody else
Every woman got a license to break my heart
Every love affair is over before it gets a chance to start
If it ain't here, maybe in a year after
Instead of tears, I'll learn all about laughter
Meanwhile I'm stuck right here, Lord knows it just ain't fair
But I know, yes I know
There must be a better world somewhere
I know, I know, yes
(I know)
There's gotta be a better world somewhere
(Better world somewhere)
I know, you know, they know
(I know, yes I do)
How come everybody else don't know?
There's got to be a better world
No, there's got to be a better world somewhere
Look in the mirror that's held out
See the spot that concerns us all
The universal place
Common ground, common space

Have to go through so much violence
To get to that forsaken place
Via this paradox
That space can be attained

Gone the torments, uncertainties
Place where we finally
Agree
I never dreamed, I never dreamed before I started
That I'd chosen such a hard, hard road to choose
Farewell sweet dreams but now it seems

That I will forever sing the blues
Hey, that I will forever sing the blues

Hey, lookin' back, it could have been predicted
Yes, lookin' back, it could easily have been foretold
Oh, but we were blind and who at that time

Who was worried 'bout the winter and cold
Who was worried 'bout the winter and the cold
Well, alright

Well, excuse me if you catch me feelin' sorry
If my smile gets hidden behind last night's headlines
Well, it's not good news but I'll sing the blues
Life keeps getting harder all the time

Yes, life keeps getting harder all the time
Yes, life keeps getting harder all the time
All the time, yeah
Whoah, all the time

Yeah, just keep on, yeah
Just keep on, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
All the time, all the time

It just keeps on, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
All the time, all the time
Whoah, alright, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Alright, yeah

I never been 1 2 hide my feelings
Baby, u blow my mind
I painted your face upon my ceiling
I stare at it all the time

I imagine myself inside your bedroom
Oh I imagine myself in your sky
(U) U are the reason there's bass in my boom
(Oh u) U are the reason I'm high
If u and I were just ten feet closer
Then i'd make u understand
That everything i wanna do 2 your body, baby
I would do 2 your head
Then u'd be hip 2 the deep rush
Deeper than the boom of the bass
With every other flick of the pink plush
The closer we get 2 the space (The closer we get 2 the space)

(The space)
(The space)
(The space)
Don't u want 2 go? (The space)
Where the souls go (The space)
Where the tears flow (The space)
Where the love grows
Do u want 2 go?

I never been 1 4 this thing obsession
But just keep your eye on my hips
The circles they may be my confession
Just say the word and I'll strip

I've had dreams of us cuddling on the planet mars
Then when i wake up, I'm all covered in sex
With eyes that fall somewhere between rubies and stars
Don't look at me baby or I'll flex
If u and I were just ten feet closer
Then I'd make u understand
That everything I wanna do 2 your body, baby
I would do 2 your head
Then u'd be hip 2 the deep rush
Deeper than the boom of the bass
With every other flick of the pink plush
The closer we get 2 the space

Do u want 2 go?

[Verse 1]
He's always laughing
And flirting with me
And you act like you don't even care
As a matter of fact
You've been real distant lately
Acting like I'm not even there
He says that you
Don't deserve a girl like me
I'm starting to think that he's right
Baby

[Chorus]
If you let him take me from you
I guess I finally see
If you let him take me from you
You never wanted me
Let this happen and it proves
That your love was never true
If you let him take me from you (Baby)
If you let him take me from you

[Verse 2]
Why is that when we go out
Out together as one big crew
I try to chill with you
Dance or whatever
And your homeboy's more interested than you?
He pays more attention to me than you lately
I'm tempted to pay attention too
Baby

[Chorus]
If you let him take me from you
I guess I finally see
If you let him take me from you
You never wanted me
Let this happen and it proves
That your love was never true
If you let him take me from you (Baby)
If you let him take me from you

[Bridge]
Boy, when I try to show some affection to you
You act like you got better things to do
When you want some loving
That's when its cool
But baby boy, I'm not a fool

[Chorus]
If you let him take me from you
I guess I finally see
If you let him take me from you
You never wanted me (Wanted me)
Let this happen and it proves (No, no)
That your love was never true (No, no)
If you let him take me from you
(How could you let him take your woman?)
If you let him take me from you
If you let him take me from you
I guess I finally see
If you let him take me from you
You never wanted me
Let this happen and it proves (Just let me go)
That your love was never true (Let me go)
If you let him take me from you (Just let me know)
If you let him take me from you
If you let him take me from you
Someone cries, a sound across the room
Words that fall, you've heard them all
It's nothing new
Everyone tries to give you their advice
But nothing seems to change
Days go by, you sleep in separate rooms
It's nowhere with no one to tell your troubles to
Maybe time will take away the pain
But how long can you wait?
Slow Breakup
You're left with no direction
Slow Breakup
You're longing for affection
Slow Breakup
You cry on your own shoulder
Spend the night, you're talking with a stranger
You're at home in a bar then you go so far
Away from your home
Maybe it's wrong, this isn't someone like her
But it's someone all the same
Slow Breakup
All lonely inside
Slow Breakup
You lost your pride
Slow Breakup
Cry on your own shoulder
But nobody knows what's the right thing to do
Then it happens to you
Then it happens...
Slow Breakup
Cry on your own shoulder
Slow Breakup
On your own
Slow Breakup
Left with no direction
Slow Breakup
Longing for affection
I've been in this town so long that back in the city
I've been taken for lost and gone
And unknown for a long, long time

Fell in love years ago with an innocent girl
From the Spanish and Indian home
Of the heroes and villains

Once at night Catillian squared the fight
And she was right in the rain of the bullets
That eventually brought her down

But she's still dancing in the night
Unafraid of what a dude'll do
In a town full of heroes and villains

Heroes and villains
Just see what you've done

Heroes and villains
Just see what you've done
Stand or fall I know there shall be peace in the valley
And it's all an affair
Of my life with the heroes and villains

In the Catina
Margareta keeps the spirit high
There I watched her
She spun around and whilst (ha-ha-ha)
She kept the warmth in her body and the flame of the dance

Dance Margareta
Don't you know that I'm in love with you

You're under arrest!

My children were raised
You know they suddenly rise
They started slow long ago
Head to toe, healthy, wealthy, and wise

I've been in this town so long
So long to the city
I'm fit with the stuff
To ride in the rough
And sunny down snuff I'm all right
By the heroes and
Heroes and villains
Just see what you've done

Heroes and villains
Just see what you've done
It's been so long since I've been gone
Another day might be too long for me
Traveling around I've had my fill
Of broken dreams and dirty deals
A concrete jungle surrounding me
Many nights I've slept out in the streets
I paid my dues and I changed my style
Seen hard times. All over now

I want to come home. It's been so long since I've been away
And please, don't blame me 'cause I've tried
I'll be coming home soon to your love to stay

I miss old friends that I once had
Times they changed and I'll be glad when I go home
I don't know why this all came to me
But why I'm here I really can't see. And now...

I want to come home. It's been so long since I've been away
And please, don't blame me 'cause I've tried
I'll be coming home soon to your love to stay
Coming home to stay
Coming home to your love, mama
I've seen better days
I miss old friends that I once had
Times ain't changed and I'll be glad when I go home
I don't know why the thought came to me
But why I'm here I really can't see. And now...

I want to come home. It's been so long since I've been away
And please, don't blame me 'cause I've tried
I'll be coming home soon to your love to stay
Coming home to stay
Coming home to your love, mama
I've seen better days
D.j. doc you know he's down with us
D-square, he's down with us
Keyboard money mike, is down with us
I.c.u., you know he's down with us
D-nice and mcboo, they're down with us
Ms. melodie, she's down with us
Just-ice and dmx, they're down with us
My manager moe, he's down with us
Castle-d boy, he's down with us
D.j. red alert, he's down with us
Robocop boy, he's down with us
Makin' funky music is a must
I'm number one
People still takin' rappin' for a joke
A passing hope or a phase with a rope
Sometimes I choke and try to believe
When I get challenged by a million mcs
I try to tell them, we're all in this together
My album was raw because no-one would ever
Think like I think and do what I do
I stole the show, and then I leave without a clue
What do you think makes up a krs?
Concisive teaching, or very clear speaking?
Ridiculous bass, aggravating treble
Rebel, renegade, must stay paid
Not by financial aid, but a raid of hits
Causing me to take long trips
I'm the original teacher of this type of style
Rockin' off-beat with a smile
Or smirk or chuckle, yes some are not up to
Bdp posse so I love to
Step in the jam and slam
I'm not superman, because anybody can
Or should be able to rock off turntables
Grab the mic, plug it in and begin
But here's where the problem starts, no heart
Because of that a lot of groups fell apart
Rap is still an art, and no-one's from the old school
'Cause rap is still a brand-new tool
I say no-one's from the old school 'cause rap on a whole
Isn't even twenty years old
Fifty years down the line, you can start this
'Cause we'll be the old school artists
And even in that time, I'll say a rhyme
A brand-new style, ruthless and wild
Runnin' around spendin' money, havin' fun
'Cause even then, I'm still number one
Blastmaster krs-one of course
Comes to express with style the lost
Ways of rhyming, old and new, past and present
Knock, knock, who is it?
A brand-new style, hup, time to change
People talk about me when they see me on stage
Live in action, guaranteed raw
I hang with the rich and I work for the poor
Now tomorrow you can say you saw
Krs-one stompin' once more
I play by ear, I love to steer
The alfa romeo from here to there
I grab the beer, but not in the ride
'Cause I'm not stupid, I don't drink and drive
I'm not a beginner, amateur or local
My album is sellin' because of my vocals
You know what you need to learn?
Old school artists don't always burn
You're just another rapper who's had his turn
Now it's my turn, and I am concerned
About idiots posing as kings
What are we here to rule?
I thought we were supposed to sing
And if we oughta sing, then let us begin to teach
Many of you are educated, open your mouth and speak
Krs-one is something like a total renegade
Except I don't steal, I rhyme to get paid
Airplanes flyin', overseas people dyin'
Politicians lyin', I'm tryin'
Not to escape, but hit the problem head-on
By bringin' out the truth in a song
So bdp, short for boogie down productions
Made a little noise 'cause the crew was sayin' somethin'
People have the nerve to take me for a gangster
An ignorant one, something closer to a prankster
Doin' petty crimes, goin' straight to penitentiary
But in a scale of crime that's really elementary
This beat is now compelling me to explain in silence
Why my last jam was so violent
It's simple bdp will teach reality
No beatin' around the bush, straight up, just like the p is free
So now you know, a poet's job is never done
But I'm never overworked, 'cause I'm still number one
Kool moe dee, he's down with us
Eric b. and rakim, they're down with us
Stetsasonic, they're down with us
Dana dane, he's down with us
Sleeping bag records, they're down with us
My lawyer jay, he's down with us
Jive/rca is down with us
Makin' funky music is a must
I'm number one

[Verse 1]
Daylight falls upon the path, the forest falls behind
Today I am not prey to dark uncertainty
The shadow trembles in its wrath, I've robbed its blackness blind
And tasted sunlight as my fear came clear to me

[Chorus]
I think I understand
Fear is like a wilderland
Stepping stones or sinking sand

[Verse 2]
Now the way leads to the hills above the steeple's chime
Below me sleepy rooftops round the harbor
It's there I'll take my thirsty fill of friendship over wine
Forgetting fear but never disregarding her

[Chorus]
Oh, I think I understand
Fear is like a wilderland
Stepping stones and sinking sand

[Verse 3]
Sometime voices in the night will call me back again
Back along the pathway of a troubled mind
When forests rise to block the light that keeps a traveler sane
I'll challenge them with flashes from a brighter time

[Chorus]
Oh, I think I understand
Fear is like a wilderland
Stepping stones or sinking sand
All week long we've been looking at
Horizons and it's hard on the brain
Sometimes I wonder is it the car or the
Highway that rolls through the rain
This day has no number
This day has no name
But it's time for the weekend all the same

Why don't you put on your Saturday Suit
Let's fly away
We can find ourselves a little cafe
Where the street people come to play
And let the wine and the sunshine
Blow our minds away
Saturday Suit me fine...today

All week long we've been sitting on our
Islands looking within
Sometimes I know it must seem like
We'll never be happy again
Put on your makeup
And I'll shine my shoes
I know that it's Monday, but I'm
Bored with the blues
Why don't you put on your Saturday Suit
Let's fly away
We can find ourselves a little cafe
Where the street people come to play
And let the wine and the sunshine
Blow our minds away
Saturday Suit me fine today
Baby won't you Saturday Suit me fine today
Baby won't you Saturday Suit me fine today

[Verse 1]
I could aim
But I could not fire
Got a bullet to spare
To kill my desire

[Bridge]
Who's calling the shots?
One of us must make the peace
To have or to have not
The fire has got to cease

[Verse 2]
I'm loaded
Don't know where to point this thing
It's a sin
How we hit where it hurts

[Bridge]
Who's calling the shots?
One of us (One of us) must end this masquerade
To have or to have not
Let's heal the wounds that we've made

[Chorus]
It's a war of the hearts (It's a war of the hearts)
It's a war of the hearts

[Bridge]
Got a bullet to spare
Don't wanna send it your way

Who's calling the shots?
One of us (One of us) must make the peace
To have or to have not
The fire has got to cease

[Chorus]
It's a war of the hearts (It's a war of the hearts)
It's a war of the hearts

[Verse 3]
I'm loaded
Don't know where to point this thing
(It's a sin) It's a sin
How we hit where it hurts (How we hit where it hurts)

[Bridge]
One of us (One of us)
Got to end this masquerade
Got to heal the wounds that we've made
I've got a bullet to spare
Don't wanna send it your way
If you wanna end it
If you wanna end it, just say

[Chorus]
It's a war of the hearts (It's a war of the hearts)
It's a war of the hearts
(Got to end this masquerade)

[Verse 4]
I've got a bullet to spare
And we don't wanna send it your way
If you wanna end it
(It's a war of the hearts)
If you wanna end it, just say

[Outro]
It's a war of the hearts
It's a war of the hearts
It's a war of the hearts

[Kanye West]
There's only one girl on my agenda
(You talking bout Brenda?)
Naw I'm talking bout Linda, from last September
Now Linda love lace like Linda love lace
LaFace says she like +Mase+ but she love +Face+
And I know that Linda was a hip-hop-head
And I know that Linda gave Hip-Hop head
But I feel I could convert her
Cuz I ain't here to hurt her mayn
And she was messin wit me when I was still at Burger King
She ain't hop in my bed cuz of the whips and cream
Cuz when I had her in bed I had whip cream
Shakespearian midsummer night dream
I unzip things and pull out big things
They was flashin gr-green, she was like "ch-ching"
Got em, but she know a rreeal nigga when she, spot him
So now she's pickin dresses from Veroraiyn
Scratchin out her maiden and here's my name
Now I'm sittin at the bar wit all my guys
They sayin "Cheers to you for your future years of pain"
Like "Dog you ready to give all this shit up?
The summer's on its way and these hoes doin sit-ups
And when they see the way the G-5 lights lit up
Your gonna wanna have two like John Ritter"
But naww, I bought her a brand new BM
He said "Dog, slow down like Brand Nubian now"

[Consequence]
I just feel the need to purge my soul from the work load
Couldn't watch another nigga get burnt slow
She said her man was busy, always bored her with work load
Never takes her out and falls asleep in his work clothes
She needs some excitement, which leads to this indictment
Believe what you like kid, according to her
When we recorded with her, Linda changed her name to Nicky
Sang along to Darlin Nicky, co-star of my quickies
That foot is so pretty, but I'm sure you recognize
That bra holds titties, those are her titties
Solar's so pretty, but not to rub it in
But that white Russian did make her lonely like the wind
So the over right that's in, on the over night depends
If you take heed the game, and please keep ya name, word

[Kanye West]
Cuz she's just a playa playa
That's playin games wit me

[John Legend]
I can't see myself getting out the game, no time soon
Ooooh, as I continue as I, Ooooh, as I continue as I
Oooh, Oooh
Can't see myself getting out the game, no time soon
Ooooh, as I continue as I, Ooooh, as I continue as I
Oooh, Oooh
I ask you where you're goin'
And you tell me where you been
I can tell you been doin' me wrong, baby
From the shape you're in
You better open up you're eyes baby
Cause fools do get wise

Your late up and sleep all day
You jumb and you ramble all night
Well the fool that I am baby
I can tell you ain't doin' me right
You better wake up and realize
That fools do get wise

Yeah, when the cat's away
I know the rat 's gonna play
But I can't tell what you're puttin' down
Woman you play when the cat 's around
You better try this one on for size
I tell you fools do get wise
I'm through being you're fool baby
I ain't gonna give you another red cent
Gonna tell the rentman to padlock the door
Cause I ain't gonna pay your rent no more
You better open up you're eyes woman
Fools do get wise

[Spoken Intro]
Close your eyes
Now relax your mind
Now I want you to picture yourself far, far away
(Put all your thoughts aside, girl, we're about to take a ride)
And I don't want you to have a care in the world right now
(Let it go, let it go, let it go)
It's just you and me in this moment
Quiet...listen...

[Verse 1]
Baby, take your mind into a zone
Imagine that we're all alone
Two way's off and our friends are gone
Now picture you and me getting it on
Take my hand and come with me
Let's indulge in fantasies
Cast your cares and worries
And slowly fall into this ecstasy
I'm gonna rub your body, so baby, just relax
You've been pouring out your loving
And now it's time to pour it back
Imagine that

[Chorus]
(Imagine that, imagine that, imagine that, imagine, imagine that)
All night long, me stroking your body, imagine that
(Imagine that, imagine that, imagine that, imagine, imagine that)
Whipped cream and strawberries, know what I mean
(Imagine that, imagine that, imagine that, imagine, imagine that)
Candles and oils surrounding the bed
(Imagine that, imagine that, imagine that, imagine, imagine that)
And me kissing your body from feet to head

[Verse 2]
Imagine that
We don't have to talk
Lay your body here and watch my fingers walk
Take a second, and imagine the opportunity
You and me sharing sexual energy
Now girl just mediate on you being in this chair
Now close your eyes and act like we're not even here
Girl, I'm gonna rub your body, so baby just relax
You've been pouring out your loving
And now it's time to pour it back

[Chorus]
Imagine
(Imagine that, imagine that, imagine that, imagine, imagine that)
Me stroking your body
Imagine that
(Imagine that, imagine that, imagine that, imagine, imagine that)
Strawberries and whipped cream, you know what I mean
(Imagine that, imagine that, imagine that, imagine, imagine that)
Candles and oils surrounding the bed
(Imagine that, imagine that, imagine that, imagine, imagine that)
Me kissing you from feet to head

[Bridge]
Yeah, ooh-aah, ooh-aah
You like that? Yeah, I like that...

[Chorus]
(Imagine that, imagine that, imagine that, imagine, imagine that)
Baby, that I'm stroking your body, imagine that
(Imagine that, imagine that, imagine that, imagine, imagine that)
Strawberries and whipped cream, imagine that
(Imagine that, imagine that, imagine that, imagine, imagine that)
Ooh baby, candles and oils surrounding the bed
(Imagine that, imagine that, imagine that, imagine, imagine that)

[Outro]
Imagine, I'm taking off my clothes, baby
(Imagine that) Hey
Do it, baby
Take off all your clothes baby
(Imagine that)
Hey, 'cause you want me, baby
And I want you, baby
So let it take control
(Imagine that)
Hey, baby, let it take control
(Imagine that)
Oh, imagine that, I'm kissing you
(Imagine that)
From feet to head
It's you and me, in our bed
You're screaming, baby
(Imagine that)
Say my name, say my name, say my name, say my name
(Imagine that)
Say my name...OW!
To dream the impossible dream
To fight the unbeatable foe
To bear with unbearable sorrow
To run where the brave dare not go

To right the unrightable wrong
(*)To be better far than you are(*)
To try when your arms are too weary
To reach the unreachable star

This is my quest, to follow that star
No matter how hopeless, no matter how far
(**)To be willing to give when there's no more to give (**)
(***)To be willing to die so that honor and justice may live (***)
And I know if I'll only be true to this glorious quest
That my heart will lie peaceful and calm when I'm laid to my rest

And the world will be better for this
That one man, scorned and covered with scars
Still strove with his last ounce of courage
To reach the unreachable star
There's a few more lonesome cities that I'd like to see
While the wine of wondering is still inside of me
There's a few more pretty women that I'd like to know
Bridge or two I'd like to cross, a few more oats to sow
Maybe when I've done it all, seen all there is to see
I'll find out I still cannot run away from me
But as long as trains keep running, restless man I'll be
And there's a few more lonesome cities that I've yet to see
Maybe when I've done it all, seen all there is to see
I'll find out I still cannot run away from me
But as long as trains keep running, restless man I'll be
And there's a few more lonesome cities that I've yet to see
One or two more lonesome cities that I've yet to see
So hard to answer future's riddle
When ahead is seeming so far behind
So hard to laugh a child-like giggle
When the tears start to torture my mind
So hard to shed the life of before
To let my soul automatically soar

But I hit hard at the battle that's confronting me, yeah
Knock down all the road blocks a-stumbling me
Throw off all the shackles that are binding me down

Sew up the wounds of evolution
And the now starts to get in my way
So what if life's a revelation
If the mind speaks of only today
So real, the pain of growing in soul
Of climbing up to reality's goal

But I hit hard at the battle that's confronting me, yeah
Knock down all the road blocks a-stumbling me
Throw off all the shackles that are binding me down
Long promised road
Trail starts at dawn
Carries on to the season's ending
Long promised road
Flows to the source, gentle force, never ending, never ending

So hard to lift the jeweled sceptre
When the weight turns a smile to a frown
So hard to drink of passion nectar
When the taste of life's holding me down
So hard to plant the seed of reform
To set my sights on defeating the storm

So I hit hard at the battle that's confronting me, yeah
Knock down all the road blocks a-stumbling me
Throw off all the shackles that are binding me down

Oh, yeah-eah-eah-eah

Hit hard at the battle that's confronting me, yeah
Knock down all the road blocks a-stumbling me
Throw off all the shackles that are binding me down

Oh, yeah-eah-eah-eah

Hit hard at the battle that's confronting me, yeah
Knock down all the road blocks a-stumbling me
Throw off all the shackles that are binding me down
I'd love to see you
I'd love to see you
I'd love to see you
I'd love to see you
I'd love to see you
I love you girl, with all my heart and soul
I can't understand why you treat me cold
Your every wish, girl, is my command
And that's why I can't seem to understand why
Girl, girl, girl, why you wanna make me blue?
I'm askin' you girl, girl, girl, why you wanna make me blue?
One day you say you love me too
The next day you tell me that we are through
My love for you is just a game
But each time we play, girl, my heart feels the pain
Girl, girl, girl, why you wanna make me blue?
Oh, girl, girl, girl, why you wanna make me blue, so blue?
Girl, girl, girl, why you wanna make me blue?
Oh girl, oh girl, oh girl, tell me why can't you be true?
The way you treat me it just isn't fair
You make it so plain you just don't care
You have a ball around my time
Sleepless nights are getting me tired
Girl, girl, girl, why you wanna make me blue?
I'm askin' you girl, girl, girl, why you wanna make me blue, baby?
Girl, girl, girl, why you wanna make me blue?
There are those who can leave love or take it
Love to them is just what they make it
I wish that I were the same
But love is my fav'rite game

I fall in love too easily
I fall in love too fast
I fall in love too terribly hard
For love to ever last

My heart should be well-schooled
'Cause I've been fooled
In the past
And still I fall in love too easily
I fall in love too fast
Oh How Happy you have made me
Oh How Happy you have made me
I have kissed your lips a thousand times
And more times than I can count
I have called you mine
You have stood by me in my darkest hour

Oh How Happy you have made me
Oh How Happy you have made me
Oh How Happy you have made me
Oh How Happy you have made me

Through our years together
We have had stormy weather
But our love has been so strong
That's, love, how we carry on
Oh How Happy you have made me
Oh How Happy you have made me
You brought joy in my empty life
All that was wrong, you made it right
My love, my love, my love
Oh How Happy you have made me
Oh How Happy you have made me
Oh How Happy, Oh How Happy
Oh How Happy
Oh How Happy you have made me
Oh How Happy you have made me

[DMX] - "This is music, This is in my heart, I mean, I can't even explain it, This... Is music... and I love music."

[Chorus]
If I can't fuck with you for real, I can't fuck with you at all
And that means y'all
But when you get caught up don't even call
Don't worry 'bout me 'cause I'm gon' ball
If I can't fuck with you for real, I can't fuck with you at all
And that means y'all
But when you get caught up don't even call
Don't worry 'bout me 'cause I'm gon' ball

[Verse 1]
Cats say they ridin', but half way through and they be like
"Not Gon be able to do it!"
Just last week wasn't really nothing to it
Cat's ain't shit, sad, I knew it
You know what it is, same old rappin
Like watchin' a movie and knowin whats gonna happen
Check it, you do you I do me
The Dog gon' be alright you'll see
Been down this road before I'm sure
This is the battlefield and I'm built for war
Ain't nothin' new to a O.G
Bullshit, troubles, and hard times they all know me!
Then there's the dick riders, the insiders
But the ones that we let get in right beside us
Keep your friends close, enemies closer
I got it, now I put 'em all in one pocket

[Chorus]
If I can't fuck with you for real, I can't fuck with you at all
And that means y'all
But when you get caught up don't even call
Don't worry 'bout me 'cause I'm gon' ball
If I can't fuck with you for real, I can't fuck with you at all
And that means y'all
But when you get caught up don't even call
Don't worry 'bout me 'cause I'm gon' ball

[Verse 2]
I wish I could believe, I wanna count on you
Never got to worry about me runnin' out on you
After thinking about it I see what it was for
It took the snake to make me trust more
I trust you to stab me in the back
Trust you to stuck one in your mouth
Soon as I walk out
Trust you to steal from me, lie to me
Acting like we love each other why do we?
Everything about you is crooked, look it
Fed a nigga some bullshit , and I took it
That's what I get, an old school fucking with a hybrid
Most of you talk about "try it"
Fool me once, shame on you
Fool me twice, did what you supposed to do
Ain't never even thought about biting the hand that feeds me
But Y'all motherfuckers is greedy

[Chorus]
If I can't fuck with you for real, I can't fuck with you at all
And that means y'all
But when you get caught up don't even call
Don't worry 'bout me 'cause I'm gon' ball
If I can't fuck with you for real, I can't fuck with you at all
And that means y'all
But when you get caught up don't even call
Don't worry 'bout me 'cause I'm gon' ball

[Intro: Sample from Dangerously Yours]
("You are very young. You are clever. And you are very beautiful. Because of your youth, you should be exceptionally valuable to us.")
("And I was very lonely. So I thought tonight I will have an adventure.")
("If I'm never to see you again I can forget you in a minute! You'll see!")

("She's just pretending.")
("You were wrong. It wasn't! I loved you!")

[Verse 1]
Well this thing that we had built
Was flaying into shreds
It was sharp and it was dry
Like the hair on a shrunken head

And all the king's men
Spread the pieces on the floor
By the time they fit together
We had forgotten what they were for

Pretending like she's beautiful
In the pictures I can see
But she only picks the good ones
And that's more than I can say for me

[Chorus]
But that's the way it always starts
You feel like Lily and the Jack of Hearts
Always making out like bandits
Until you get away and it falls apart
It falls apart

[Verse 2]
You're always dressed up like a priest
You're always drilling through the wall
Cracking the safe and skipping town
While poor Rosemary takes the fall

You're always looking for the future
Rinsing out the dye
Looking for a moral to the story
That sounded good and happened to rhyme

Rosemary on the gallows
Dressed like nothing's wrong
No funeral no flowers
For an outlaw in a song

[Chorus]
But that's the way it always starts
You feel like Lily and the Jack of Hearts
Always making out like bandits
Until you get away and it falls apart
It falls apart
("She's just pretending.")
("You were wrong. It wasn't! I loved you!")

[Chorus]

[Outro]
But that's the way it always starts (that's the way it always starts)
You feel like Lily and the Jack of Hearts
What child is this who laid to rest
On Mary's lap is sleeping
Whom angels greet with voices sweet
While shepherds watch are keeping

This, this is Christ the King
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing
Haste, haste to bring him praise
The Son, the Babe of Mary

So bring Him incense, gold, and myrrh
Come peasant king to praise Him
The King of kings, a glory brings
Let loving hearts enthrone Him

Raise, raise the song on high
Let singing fill the earth and sky
Joy, joy for Christ is born
The Babe, the Son of Mary

What child is this who laid to rest
On Mary's lap is sleeping
Whom angels greet with voices sweet
While shepherds watch are keeping
What goes on in your heart?
What goes on in your mind?
You are tearing me apart
When you treat me so unkind
What goes on in your mind
The other day I saw you
As I walked along the road
But when I saw him with you
I could feel my future fold
It's so easy for a girl like you to lie
Tell me why
What goes on in your heart?
What goes on in your mind?
You are tearing me apart
When you treat me so unkind
What goes on in your mind
I met you in the morning
Waiting for the tides of time
But now the tide is turning
I can see that I was blind
It's so easy for a girl like you to lie
Tell me why
What goes on in your heart?
I used to think of no one else
But you were just the same
You didn't even think of me
As someone with a name
Did you mean to break my heart and watch me die
Tell me why
What goes on in your heart?
What goes on in your mind?
You are tearing me apart
When you treat me so unkind
What goes on in your mind
I am with name, I am with name
I am Ramona A Stone
A night filled female
Good timing drone

I am with name
I am with name
I am with name
I am with name
I am Ramona A Stone

She should say
Twitch & stream
It'll end in chrome
Night of the female good time drone
I am with name
I am Ramona A Stone
And she should say
I am with name
I am Ramona A Stone
Feel anxiety decending

I am with name I am with name
I am Ramona A Stone
I am with name

Night fear female good time drone
I am with name I am Ramona A Stone

Anxiety decending
Anxiety decending

[Hook] x2

[Music fades and song is over]
The sweetest girl in the world
Is my blue-eyed Jane
We fell in love like turtledoves
While the moon was shining down
I asked her then, I asked her when
Wedding bells would ring
She said, "Oh, dear, it seems so queer
That this could happen here."

You are my little pal
And I never knew a sweeter gal
My little blue-eyed Jane
I love you so
And when the sun goes down
And the shadow's creeping over town
Just meet me in the lane
My blue-eyed Jane

Janie dear, listen here
I've come to say farewell
The world is drear without you, dear
But now I cannot linger here
I'm going away this very day
Oh please, come go with me
I'll be sad and blue wanting you
Longing all day through
My little blue-eyed Jane
You'll always be the same sweet thing
I know you'll never change
I love you so
And when the sun goes down
And the shadow's creeping over town
Then I'll come back again
My blue-eyed Jane

And when the sun goes down
And the shadow's creeping over town
Then I'll come back again
My blue-eyed Jane

[Hook: John Legend]
Give me the green light

I'm ready to go right now
I'm ready to go right now
I'm ready to go right now

[Verse 1: John Legend]
I see you move, I'm checking your smile
Working your back like, it's going out of style
Shake just a little bit faster
Shake just a little now girl
Dying to meet you, so let's mess around
Got an obsession, of us getting down
Come just a little bit closer
I just need permission, so...

[Hook: John Legend]

[Verse 2: John Legend]
Do I have a girlfriend? Well, technically no (NO!)
If you be my girlfriend, then I'll make it so
You'll be my only true lover
No competition, no other (No other)
Baby, it's just, the thrill of the chase
I've got a feeling, I'm winning this race
Baby, I'm in much closer
I just need permission, so...

[Hook: John Legend]
Give me the green light

[Verse 3: Andre 3000]
So I went hard like Medusa staring at me
I told her, "Let's go, let's blow this lame nigga factory"
She said, "What kind of girl do you think that I are?
The kind that you meet in a bar?
You think you can get whatever you want 'cause you some kind of star"
No, I'm a comet; I just want you woman
Hey, if I were you then it would be me that I'd go home with
Three, the one and only, one thing you ain't considered
I heard you when you told your girl, "Ooh, he can get it" - admit it
You did it! Let's hop a cab, and split it
I'm kiddin'! We both going to where you livin'!
HAH! I got you giggling like a piglet - oh, that's the ticket?
I hope you more like, Anita Baker, than Robin Givens
No, I don't know that lady, so let me quit it
I'm just style-freein', freestylin' which I seldom do
This is what I'm tellin' you, to the bed I'm nailin' you
Like I've been in jail for two, years and then they done let me loose

[Hook: John Legend + (Andre 3000 talking)]
Give me the green light
(You got you one, Legend!)
Give me just one night
(Sometimes you gotta step from behind that piano)
I'm ready to go right now
(And let 'em know what's going on)
I'm ready to go right now
(Even Stevie Wonder got down sometimes...Hahaha!)
We could go all night
Give me the green light
(I'm ready to go!)
I'm ready to go right now
(My mandate can't wait)
I'm ready to go right now
(Participate)

[John Legend]
I'm ready to go right now
I'm ready to go right now

I'm ready to go right now
I'm ready to go right now
Bells will be ringing this sad sad news
Oh what a Christmas to have the blues
My baby's gone I have no friends
To wish me greetings once again

Choirs will be singing "Silent Night"
Christmas carols by candlelight
Please come home for Christmas
Please come home for Christmas

If not for Christmas by New Years night
Friends and relations send salutations
Sure as the stars shine above
But this is Christmas yes Christmas my dear

The time of year to be with the ones you love
So won't you tell me you'll never more roam
Christmas and new Years will find you home
There'll be no more sorrow no grief and pain

And I'll be happy, happy once again
Oh there'll be no more sorrow, no grief and pain
And I'll be happy, Christmas once again
There's no doubt about it
A may as well shout about it
I got the blues
I got'em bad

Yes this awful feeling
When you don't have what you thought you had
Oh yesterday, yesterday I sang love songs
But today I got'em bad

Oh, I didn't know she would leave me
I didn't know she was gone
Well, at last she should've told me goodbye people
But she stole away while I was gone
Yes that's what makes me feel so sad people
Oh, and today I got'em bad

Oh, I could tell you much more people
But I think you already how I feel
Oh, I could tell you much, much, much more people
But I think you already how I feel
Yes, you know I'm hurt beyond explaining people
And it's all because I've got a dirty deal
I've tried to run I've tried to hide
It just don't do no good
Nights grow long and love grows strong
I'd leave you if I could
Can't believe this power of love
This hold you've got on me
It's been so strong it seems so long
It just won't let me be

Help me love my heart's a-burning
Tell me why I keep returning
Set me up and turn me around
Flames of love keep burning me down

Put me off put me down
I won't die away
Love that's hotter than the sun
You know I'm here to stay
Do me right do me wrong
You're about to do me in
The way you move's a doggone crime
The way you loves a sin
Help me love my heart's a-burning
Tell me why I keep returning
Set me up set me down
These flames of love are turning me around

My tongue gets tied my eyes go blind
The truth is plain to see
I'm hooked my friend it's near the end
And you won't let me be
I can't eat I can't sleep
You've got me in your spell
If this goes on I won't last long
Darling you know darn well

Help me love my heart's a-burning
Tell me why I keep returning
I've tried to run I've tried to hide
It just don't do no good
The nights grow longer love grows stronger
I'd leave you if I could

Can't believe the power of love
This hold you've got on me
It's been so strong it seems so long
You just won't let me be
Do me right do me wrong
You're about to do me in
I saw the saddest thing, other day
When an old man pass my way
Walking the streets so all alone
All because he had no home
But the saddest thing I've ever seen
Is a tear from a woman's eye
A tear from a woman's eye
Hmmm
I saw a man, no shoes on his feet
But the saddest thing is to see a woman weep
A woman is tender thing
To see her cry, a sad, sad thing
Nothing touches me deeper inside
Than a tear from a woman's eye
A tear from a woman's eye
Hmmm
(Instrumental - Humming)
A woman's tears dropping on her cheek
Is like a sound of thunder, that loudly it rings
'Cause when I see her cry, I know she hurts inside
Yes, the saddest thing I've ever seen
Is a tear from a woman's eye
A tear from a woman's eye
Hmmm
Sad, sad thing is a tear from a woman's eye
A sad, sad thing is to see a woman cry
Sad, sad, sad thing is a tear from a woman's eye
Sad, sad, sad thing is to see a woman cry
Yo, yo, what?
I heard he sang a good song, yeah
Yo, I heard he had a style
And so, I came to see him and listen for awhile
What? And there he was, this young bra
Stranger to my eyes
Strummin' my pain with his fingers, yo
Singing my life with his words, two times
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life, with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Strummin' my pain
Yes, he was singing my life with his words, two times
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life, with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Oooooooooohhh..oooohhh...
Early in the mornin', around this time of year
I like to sit around the pool and get my chill on, yes I do
Well sippin' on a glass 'o wine, or my favorite kind of beer
When I'm feelin' oh so right, you know that you can't go wrong
A cuz is gonna be summer(summer)...
My summertime is here yes it is hhmmm...

(chorus)
And it's gonna be you and me (baby you and me oohhh)
When was the lasttime (Time) that you made love on the beach baby
Baby (oohhh)
Girl won't you sit down, and let me feel over and round you
Let me rub you down, my love, and spread the lotions all around you
Like the smooth theme that glows ya hair, I don't care if people stare
All I know is that I'm in love, and wanna spend the summer with you
It's gonna be...(summer)
Chorus
When was the last time (time) that you made love on the beach baby
Baby, baaaaaaabbbbby
The rain is gone, I want you right here, I do, yes I do
Come on baby
I need to know right now, can I spend a little time with you?
Lest the sun don't shine you through the summer. (My baby) Good Lord
Chorus
Had an uncle named Matthew
Was his father's only boy
Born just south of Colby, Kansas
Was his mother's pride and joy

Yes, and joy was just the thing that he was raised on
Love was just the way to live and die
Gold was just a windy Kansas wheatfield
Blue, just a Kansas summer sky

All the stories that he told me
Back when I was just a lad
All the memories that he gave me
All the good times that he had

Growin' up a Kansas farmboy
Life was mostly havin' fun
Ridin' on his daddy's shoulders
Behind a view beneath the sun

Yes, and joy was just the thing that he was raised on
Love was just the way to live and die
Gold was just a windy Kansas wheatfield
Blue is just a Kansas summer sky
Well, I guess there were some hard times
And I'm told some years were lean
They had a storm in forty-seven
A twister came and stripped them clean

He lost the farm and lost his family
He lost the wheat and lost his home
But he found a family Bible
Faith as solid as a stone

Yes, and joy was just the thing that he was raised on
Love was just the way to live and die
Gold was just a windy Kansas wheatfield
Blue, just a Kansas summer sky

So he came to live at our house
And he came to work the land
He came to ease my daddy's burden
And he came to be my friend

So, I wrote this down for Matthew
And it's for him the song is sung
Ridin' on his daddy's shoulders
Behind a mule beneath the sun

Yes, and joy was just the thing that he was raised on
Love was just the way to live and die
Gold was just a windy Kansas wheatfield
Blue, just a Kansas summer sky
Yes, and joy was just the thing that he was raised on
Love was just the way to live and die
Gold was just a windy Kansas wheatfield
Blue, just a Kansas summer sky
It's B.o., B.o., B.o., B.o.B

She's a fast love professional
Crafty, bold and beautiful
Staged right, locked eyes
I swear it's magical

Her name is Melanie
Says she digs my melodies
Likes how I move
Thinks I'm cool
That's what she says to me

Big stage, bright lights, short love, long nights
Frequent flights through the skies to see stars

I come back to town
She's hangin' around
It still feels so real but it can't go too far
Her favorite colours be platinum and gold
She only loves in stereo, she only loves in stereo
I should know 'cause I've seen it before
I think I gotta let her go
She only loves in stereo

Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh

Turned on the video
Oh my goodness there she goes
Now I'm hot, seems I'm not the only one she knows

Name droppin' everyday
But I still want her anyway
I like how she moves
Think she's cool
My favorite getaway

Big stage, bright lights, short love, long nights
Deja vu, yeah, we do it again

Off to the next town
She's on to the next round
Let it go
We both know that it's all gonna end, oh
Her favorite colours be platinum and gold
She only loves in stereo, she only loves in stereo
I should know 'cause I've seen it before
I think I gotta let her go
She only loves in stereo

Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh

Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh

She fell in love with the radio
It wasn't really me
So I had to let her go
Just ask any DJ back in her hometown
She likes to get around
Just watch as she gets down, oh

Her favorite colours be platinum and gold
She only loves in stereo, she only loves in stereo
I should know 'cause I've seen it before
I think I gotta let her go
She only loves in stereo
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
She loves in stereo
(I think I gotta let her go)

Oh, oh
Oh, oh (ohh)
She loves in stereo
(I think I gotta let her go)

Oh, oh
Oh, oh
She loves in stereo

Oh, oh
Oh, oh
She loves in stereo
Oh yeah

[1] - I've been waiting

Spent nights out chasing
For your love
But it's going down tonight
It's going down
I've been waiting
Spent nights out chasing
For your love
But it's going down tonight
It's going down

What did you think you would do?
What did you think you'd say?
After I told you how I was feeling
Never thought I'd see this day
I always kept dreaming
Never let failure hurt my heart
I knew that soon you'd see better
All I could do is hope and pray

[2] - Is there a chance?
Or a possibility?
That I can get close to you
I wanna get romantic with you
Do all the things lovers do
Finally all the things I've done
To get the chance to be with you
I guess it was sure enough worth the wait
Tonight I'll be wrapped up in your arms

[Repeat 1]

I always kept wishing
I always kept praying
Good things come to those who wait
That's what mama always said
Baby that phrase stuck in my head
There's nothing I won't do to please you
Given the chance
I'll do you right
Even inside I have to know

[Repeat 1 (2x)]

Ooh, oh yeah
Oh yeah
Hey baby, ooh
Oh yeah, ryde or die
Walk on by
Oh yeah, hey, hey, hey

[Repeat 1 till end]
Ring out the old, ring in the new
Ring out the bells ringin' the truth
Let's start the new year right, twelve o'clock at night
When they dim the light, let's begin
Kissing the old year out
Singing the new year in
Let's watch the old year die with a fond goodbye
Our hopes as high as a kite
How can our love go wrong if
We start the new year right?
Let's start the new year right
The mood is right
The spirit's up
We're here tonight
And that's enough

Simply having a wonderful Christmastime
Simply having a wonderful Christmastime

The party's on
The feeling's here
That only comes
This time of year

Simply having a wonderful Christmastime
Simply having a wonderful Christmastime

The choir of children sing their song
Ding dong, ding dong
Ding dong, ding
Ooh, ooh
Doo-doo, doo-doo, doo doo-doo
We're simply having a wonderful Christmastime
Simply having a wonderful Christmastime

The word is out
About the town
To lift a glass
Ahh, and don't look down

Simply having a wonderful Christmastime

The choir of children sing their song
They practiced all year long
Ding dong, ding dong
Ding dong, ding dong
Ding dong, ding dong

The party's on
The spirit's up
We're here tonight
And that's enough

Simply having a wonderful Christmastime
We're simply having a wonderful Christmastime

The mood is right
The spirit's up
We're here tonight
Ohh, and that's enough
We're simply having a wonderful Christmastime
Simply having a wonderful Christmastime
Simply having a wonderful Christmastime
Simply having a wonderful Christmastime

Ohh-ohh-ohh-ohh
Ohh-ohh-ohh
Christmastime
Here's to those who love not too wisely, know not wisely, but too well
To the girl who sighs with envy when she hears that wedding bell
To the guy who'd throw a party if he knew someone to call
Here's to the losers, bless them all

Here's to those who drink their dinners when that lady doesn't show
To the girl who'll wait for kisses underneath that mistletoe
To the lonely summer lovers when the leaves begin to fall
Here's to the losers, a-bless them all

Hey, Tom, Dick and Harry, come in out of the rain
Those torches you carry must be drowned in champagne

Here's the last toast of the evening, here's to those who still believe
All the losers will be winners, all the givers shall receive
Here's to trouble-free tomorrows, may your sorrows all be small
Here's to the losers, bless them all

She belongs there, left with her liberty
Never known as a non-believer
She laughs and stays in the
Won- won- wonderful

She knew how to gather the forest when
God reached softly and moved her body
One golden locket quite young
And loving her mother and father

Farther down the path was a mystery
Through the recess the chalk and numbers
A boy bumped into her
Won- won- won- wonderful

She'll return in love with her liberty
Never known as a non-believer
She'll smile and thank God
For one won- won- wonderful

Na na na na na na na
I came here from the city
A thousand miles away
I came just for a little while
You know I never meant to stay
I meant to take my pleasure
Have a good time and be gone
But I fell in love with a lady
Now I sing a mountain song

I listened to the music
Of the night wind in the pines
I saw the quiet slendour
Of a field of columbine
I skied on crystal pathways
To a mountain peak so tall
And I walked the mighty summits
With the one who made it all

And I fell in love with a lady
'Cause I've seen her at her best
And I've walked her wild and rugged paths
Through her open wilderness
And now I never can betray her
Steal her riches and be gone
'Cause when you love a mountain lady
You're gonna sing a mountain song
Now people come from everywhere
To see what they can find
And some take lots of pictures
And some just take their time
But they're some who take her beauty
That can't be bought or sold
And they think of only money
While destroying wealth untold

But you fall in love with a lady
When you've slept upon her breast
And I've walked her wild and rugged paths
To her open wilderness
And you never can betray her
Steal her riches and be gone
'Cause when you love a mountain lady
You're gonna sing a mountain song
Higher, higher
Fire

Don't change your style now that you've reached the top
Don't choose your friends by what they've got
Remember beneath the glitter and gleam
Like everyday people you're just a human being

Superstar, good God
Enjoy your champagne and caviar
And your chauffeur driven fancy car
But remember how you got where you are
Oh ho ho, 'cause the same folks that made you
Mmm-hmm, you better believe they can break you

No, you didn't make it all by yourself
You had help from somebody else
The truth is the light, don't let it depress you
You just be thankful that the good Lord made you

Superstar, ah, do you know who your real friends are?
I'm talkin' to you
Superstar, remember how you got where you are
Ah ah, down, down, down, down
Drummer keep it going, going
Horns starts blowin'
Right on time, blow my mind
Higher, higher, higher, higher

It's easy for you to look down
Turn up your nose and frown
Now that you're on top (Top)
(Bright lights)
Don't let the bright lights blind you
(Bridges)
Don't burn 'em behind you

Superstar, good God, do you know who your real friends are?
I'm talkin' to you
Superstar, remember how you got where you are

Don't change your style now that you've reached the top
Don't choose your friends by what they've got
Remember beneath the glitter and gleam
Like everyday people you're just a human being

Superstar, good God, do you know who your real friends are?
I'm talkin' to you
Superstar, remember how you got where you are

[Verse 1]
What are we supposed to do
After all that we've been through
When everything that felt so right is wrong
Now that the love is gone

[Verse 2]
There is nothing left to prove
No use to deny this simple truth
Can't find the reason to keep holding on
Now that love is gone

[Verse 3]
There is nothing left to prove
No use to deny this simple truth
Can't find the reason to keep holding on
Now that love is gone

[Chorus]
Love is gone
Love is gone
Love is gone

[Post-Chorus]
Love is gone
I feel so hurt inside
Love is gone
Feel so hurt inside
Got to find a reason

[Verse 4]
What are we supposed to do
After all that we've been through
When everything that felt so right is wrong
Now that the love is gone

[Verse 5]
There is nothing left to prove
No use to deny this simple truth
Can't find the reason to keep holding on
Now that love is gone (Love is gone)

[Verse 6]
What are we supposed to do
After all that we've been through
Where everything that felt so right is wrong
Now that the love, now that the love, now that the love is gone (Now that the love is gone)

[Verse 7]
There is nothing left to prove
No use to deny this simple truth
Can't find the reason to keep holding on
Now that the love, now that the love (Now that the love is gone)

[Chorus]
Love is gone
Love is gone
Love is gone

[Outro]
Got to find a reason, got to a find a reason
Got to find a reason, got to find a reason (Love is gone)
Got to find a reason, got to find a reason
Got to find a reason to hold on (Love is gone)
Baby mine, don't you cry
Baby mine, dry your eyes
Rest your head close to my heart
Never to part, baby of mine

Little one, when you play
Pay no mind to what they say
Let your eyes sparkle and shine
Never a tear, baby of mine

If they knew all about you
They'd end up loving you too
All those same people who scold you
What they'd give for just the right to
Hold you

And if they knew all about you
They'd end up loving you too
All those same people who scold you
What they'd give for just the right to
Hold you
From your head to your toes
You're not much, heaven knows
But you're so precious to me
Sweet as an be, baby of mine
You're so precious to me, baby of mine
Baby of mine
You're so precious to me, baby of mine
I'm a little red rooster, too lazy to crow for days
Just a little red rooster, too lazy to crow for days
Keep everything in the barnyard people, upset in every way

Dogs begin to bark now and the hounds begin to howl
Dogs begin to bark now and the hounds begin to howl
Watch out stray cat people the little red rooster is on the prowl

If you see the little red rooster, won't you please drive him home
If you see my little red rooster, won't you please drive him home
Been no peace in the barnyard people, since the little red rooster's been gone

( Brent rap )

Yeah and the little red rooster, well you ain't shit to me
Think you're a stud boy, well I doubt you'll ever be
While your away I'm gonna fuck with your hens, boy
I'm just bein' neighborly
Well my temperature is rising got my feet on the floor
Crazy people rocking 'cause they want to go more
Let me in baby I don't know what you got
But you better take it easy 'cause this place is hot
And I'm so glad you made it, so glad you made it
You got to gimme some lovin', gimme gimme some lovin'
Well I feel so good, everybody's getting high
You better take it easy 'cause the place is on fire
Been a hard day and I don't know what to do
Wait a minute Baby, this could happen to you
Well I feel so good, everybody's getting high
You better take it easy 'cause the place is on fire
Been a hard day nothing went too good
Now we're gonna relax just like everybody should

[Verse 1: Travie McCoy]
They said anything is possible
And life's just another obstacle
Well show me the manual
And the man responsible, yeah
I went lookin' for answers in the hospital
And came back with a pocket full
When I stole the manual
And killed the man responsible

[Pre-Chorus: Travie McCoy & T-Pain]
Now we all make mistakes
But those mistakes just make us who we are
And not who we choose to be (No)
My faith got misplaced
Somewhere between a superstar (Hey)
And the boy that I used to be (Hey)

[Chorus: T-Pain]
I'm just trying to be who you say you are
But who are you?
I'm just trying to be who you say are the stars
And who is cool
But who am I? (Whoa-oh-oh)
Oh, I'm the dude responsible, hey
But who am I? (Whoa-oh-oh)
Hey, I'm the dude responsible (Hahahah)
Hey!

[Verse 2: Travie McCoy]
They say clothes don't make the man
But I'ma show you how fresh I am
Soon as I pay my water bill
And a couple other bills
They say they got a cure for my smile
Rather for my lack thereof
So they gave me another pill
But it was just that water pill (Raiders!)

[Pre-Chorus: Travie McCoy & T-Pain]
You know we all make mistakes
But they just make us insecure
And a little uncomfortable
My faith got misplaced
Between who I was before (Hey)
And the dude you think you know (Hey)

[Chorus: T-Pain]
I'm just trying to be who you say you are
But who are you?
I'm just trying to be who you say are the stars
And who is cool
But who am I? (Whoa-oh-oh)
Oh, I'm the dude responsible, hey
But who am I? (Whoa-oh-oh)
Hey, I'm the dude responsible (Hahahah)
Hey!

[Verse 3: Young Cash]
See, I can be in the hood sippin' 'gnac with my boys
Or at the keg party with the white boys
At the beach with the surfers in Beverly Hills
Or at a X party with Vicks and light toys
I guess you can call me a chameleon
I adapt to any situation I'm in
And my momma ain't raise no fools
I'm just comfortable in the skin that I am in

[Pre-Chorus: Young Cash & T-Pain]
And we all make mistakes
Yeah, I'm a walkin' contradiction
And plus I never listen, ooh
And my faith got misplaced
Somewhere along the lines of (Hey)
Tryin' to make my mind up, yeah (Hey)

[Chorus: T-Pain]
I'm just trying to be who you say you are
But who are you?
I'm just trying to be who you say are the stars
And who is cool
But who am I? (Whoa-oh-oh)
Oh, I'm the dude responsible, hey
But who am I? (Whoa-oh-oh)
Hey, I'm the dude responsible (Hahahah)
Hey!
Ahhh
This ain't no love song girl

This is for the G's, the bedroom G's
If you wanna to take me home
You better make me moan and groan, (oh oh oh)
If you wanna to take me home
Your better make me groan and moan, (oh yeah, and moan)
If you need it, need it, need it
It's right here
All you have to do is ask

What I can do (ooh ooh)
And if you still don't believe
Thats cool
You fool
But you gotta wet me up and wet me down
I can do it (down oh yeah)
Then you gotta dry me up with some foreplay
Any problem
I can solve it
Push it, work it, hurt it, all night, all night, all day
Show me how you love a woman
Till the morning light (morning light, morning light)
If you wanna take me home you better make me groan and moan (oh yeah)
If you wanna take me home you better make me moan (whoa)
Gonna moan
If you wanna take me home you better make moan
Make me moan
If you wanna take me home you better make me groan
Cos I told her, told her, told her (whoa)

If you want to come and see

And baby
If you dare to play
Lets just go my place
You'd better lick me up and lick me down

Repeat and fade
There's a Red House over yonder
That's where my baby stays
There's a Red House over yonder, baby
That's where my baby stays

Well, I ain't been home to see my baby
In ninety nine and one half days
'Bout time I see her
Wait a minute something's wrong here
The key won't unlock the door

Wait a minute something's wrong baby
Lord, have mercy, this key won't unlock this door
Something's goin' on here
I have a bad bad feeling that my baby don't live here no more

That's all right, I still got my guitar
Look out now...

I might as well go on back down
Go back 'cross yonder over the hill
I might as well go back over yonder
Way back over yonder 'cross the hill
That's where I came from
'Cause if my baby don't love me no more
I know her sister will

[Verse 1]
Even more than philosophers, aiming at no less than
The total transformation of man and the world
Begin with the dissolution of superfluous matters
So that desire and consciousness are free

[Chorus]
New man, new woman proud and free
(Proud and free, proud and free)
New man, new woman happy to be

[Verse 2]
True life, embodying pleasure
Principle's noblest triumph over the
Cowering mendacity
Of bourgeois Christian civilisation

[Chorus]
New man, new woman proud and free
(Proud and free, proud and free)
New man, new woman happy to be
(Happy to be free, happy to be free)

In my hallucination
I saw my beloved's flower garden
In my vertigo, in my dizziness
In my drunken haze
Whirling and dancing like a spinning wheel

I saw myself as the source of existence
I was there in the beginning
And I was the spirit of love
Now I am sober
There is only the hangover
And the memory of love
And only the sorrow

I yearn for happiness
I ask for help
I want mercy
And my love says:

Look at me and hear me
Because I am here
Just for that
I am your moon and your moonlight too
I am your flower garden and your water too
I have come all this way, eager for you
Without shoes or shawl

I want you to laugh
To kill all your worries
To love you
To nourish you

Oh sweet bitterness
I will soothe you and heal you
I will bring you roses
I, too, have been covered with thorns
Could you lend me a hand
Because Iâve only got one
I miss my fingers
Like you miss your son
Are you thinking about Joffrey?
Such a spirited lad
I was his uncle
I was also his dad
Around the world
My heart had to roam
Now Iâm looking for something
A little closer to home
Closer to home
Closer to home
A family tree
With a branch of our own
Closer to home
Closer to home
Ensuring our family
Stays on the throne
I've been in this town so long that back in the city
I've been taken for lost and gone
And unknown for a long, long time

Fell in love years ago with an innocent girl
From the Spanish and Indian home
Of the heroes and villains

Once at night Catillian squared the fight
And she was right in the rain of the bullets
That eventually brought her down

But she's still dancing in the night
Unafraid of what a dude'll do
In a town full of heroes and villains

Heroes and villains
Just see what you've done

Heroes and villains
Just see what you've done
Stand or fall I know there shall be peace in the valley
And it's all an affair
Of my life with the heroes and villains

In the Catina
Margareta keeps the spirit high
There I watched her
She spun around and whilst (ha-ha-ha)
She kept the warmth in her body and the flame of the dance

Dance Margareta
Don't you know that I'm in love with you

You're under arrest!

My children were raised
You know they suddenly rise
They started slow long ago
Head to toe, healthy, wealthy, and wise

I've been in this town so long
So long to the city
I'm fit with the stuff
To ride in the rough
And sunny down snuff I'm all right
By the heroes and
Heroes and villains
Just see what you've done

Heroes and villains
Just see what you've done
Don't cry no more, wipe away your tears
Don't cry no more, baby, wipe away your tears
And I know, I know that your love is real
Don't cry, don't cry, I'm begging you
Don't cry no more, baby, I'm begging you
Every tear you shed tells me that your love is true

You cried me a river, you cried me a sea
Now I believe without a doubt
That you really, really, really love me

You cried me a river, you cried me a sea
Now I believe without a doubt
That you really, really, really love me

Don't cry no more, wipe away your tears
Don't cry no more, baby, wipe away your tears
And I know, I know that your love is real

I don't want you to cry, no, I don't want you to cry
It's summertime and the living is easy
I don't want you to cry, no, please don't cry
The dusk is gaining ground, lights flicker all around
And as I walk the lonely streets
The snow is fallin' ever faster
Looking to the sky
I wonder where you are
The way you came in to my life
I'm feeling every day with laughter
Almost blinded by the snow flakes on my face
Despite the chill I feel the warmth of your embrace
Intoxicated now I spank her like a fool
I feel that surely like a flow away

[Chorus:]
I want to show you everything
I see the way I'm feeling
I need to be with you tonight
To hold your arms around me
My love for you is deep within
The deepest snows of winter
The greatest gift I ever had was you, you
Your sparkling crystal the world
This magic winter land
If I could share it all with you
And make believe forever after
Like a blanket over everything inside
And in the hush I hear the silence of the night
The snow has covered all the streets we walk alone

(I'm dreaming all alone)
And I hope you still remember me tonight

I want to show you everything
And I need to be with you tonight
Hold your arms around me, huu
This snows of winter
The greatest gift I ever had

Can remember feeling this way before
Do you know, do you understand what's going through my heart
The way that I love you I just hope you feel it too
Tonight wherever you are

[Chorus:]
I want to show you everything Im feelin
I need to be with you tonight
And feel your arms around me
My love for you is deeper
The deepest snows of winter
The greatest gift I ever had was you, you
The greatest gift I ever had was you, you
The greatest gift I ever had was you, you
The greatest gift I ever had was you, you
O give me land, lots of land, and the starry skies above, don't fence me in
Let me ride through the wide open country that I love, don't fence me in
O let me be by myself in the evening breeze
And listen to the murmur of the cottonwood trees
Send me off forever but I ask you please, don't fence me in

Just turn me loose and I'll straddle on my saddle underneath the western skies
On my cayoose let me wander over yonder till I see the mountains rise
O let me ride to the ridge where the west commences
Gaze at the moon till I lose my senses
Can't look at hobbles and I can't stand fences, don't fence me in
Horses are creatures who worship the earth
They gallop on feet of ivory
Constrained by the wonder of dying and birth
The horses still run they are free

My body is merely the shell of my soul
But the flesh must be given its due
Like a pony that carries its rider back home
Like an old friend that's tried and been true

I had a vision of eagles and horses
High on a ridge in a race with the wind
Going higher and higher and faster and faster
On eagles and horses I'm flying again

Eagles inhabit the heavenly heights
They know neither limit nor bound
They're the guardian angels of darkness and light
They see all and hear every sound

My spirit will never be broken or caught
For the soul is a free flying thing
Like an eagle that needs neither comfort nor thought
To rise up on glorious wings
I had a vision of eagles and horses
High on a ridge in a race with the wind
Going higher and higher and faster and faster
On eagles and horses I'm flying again
Flying again, I'm flying again

My body is merely the shell of my soul
But the flesh must be given its due
Like a pony that carries its master back home
Like an old friend that's tried and been true

My spirit will never be broken or caught
For the soul is a free flying thing
Like an eagle that needs neither comfort nor thought
To rise up on glorious wings

I had a vision of eagles and horses
High on a ridge in a race with the wind
Going higher and higher and faster and faster
On eagles and horses I'm flying again
Flying again, I'm flying again
Flying again, I'm flying again

[Spoken Word - Jack Rieley]
There was a mansion on a hill
But deep in a secret kingdom
Where a young prince lived
He had four sisters and four brothers

The prince had a special bedroom on the ground floor
With a window that looked down into a deep deep forest
He could see distant lights from other castles in the kingdom
From his window

During the day
He went to school
When it became night
He stayed by himself
Usually in his secret hidden bedroom

One night
While nearly everyone was asleep
He took out of the attic a radio
And he decided to listen to it
Every day there's something new
Honey, to keep me lovin' you
And with every passin' minute
Ah baby, so much joy wrapped up in it

Heaven must have sent you from above
Wo, heaven must have sent your precious love

And I, I've got a song to sing
Tellin' the world about the joy you bring
And you gave me a reason for livin'
And, ooh, you taught me, you taught me the meaning of givin'

Heaven must have sent you from above
Wo, heaven must have sent your precious love

To find a love like ours is rare these days
'Cause you've shown me happiness, yes, in so many ways
I look in the mirror, and I'm glad to see
Laughter in the eyes where tears used to be
What you've given me I could never return
'Cause there's so much, girl, I have yet to learn
And I wanna show, I wanna show my appreciation
'Cause when I found you, I found a new inspiration

Heaven must have sent you from above
Wo, heaven must have sent your precious love

[Verse 1]
Despair, regret, and tenderness
Is what I feel for you
I loved you from the very start
What else could I do

[Pre-Chorus]
You read my mind, you made me cry
Time stood still
And now I know the reasons why
Time stood still

[Chorus]
Maybe you're the next best thing to happen
All the things we might have been

[Verse 2]
A flame becomes a fading light
That burns inside my heart
And like a castle in the sand
It had to fall apart

[Pre-Chorus]
You made me laugh, you gave me hope
It's over now
Our happiness went up in smoke
It's over now

[Chorus]
Maybe you're the next best thing to happen
All the things we might have been
Maybe you're the next best thing to happen
All the things we might have been

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Maybe you're the next best thing to happen
All the things we might have been
Maybe you're the next best thing to happen
All the things we might have been

[Verse 1]
What Child is this who came to earth
Through Mary was born of a virgin birth
What Child is this, the Son of Man
From Heaven, was sent with His plan

[Refrain]
Hark, how the bells, sweet silver bells
Christmas is here, bringing the cheer

[Verse 2]
What Child is this who laid to rest
On Mary's lap is sleeping
Whom angels greet with anthems sweet
While shepherds watch are keeping

[Bridge]
Oh, this, this is Christ the King
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing
Haste, haste, to bring Him laud
The Babe, the Son of Mary
(Hark, how the bells; hark, how the bells
Sweet silver bells; sweet silver bells)
Christmas is here
(Christmas is here, Christmas is here
Bringing the cheer, bringing the cheer)
To young and old
(To young and old, meek and the bold, oh, how they pound)
Raising the sound, the songs of good cheer
Merry, Merry, Merry, Merry Christmas, Christmas is here
(Merry, Merry, Merry, Merry Christmas)
Christmas is here
Christmas is here

[Verse 3]
So bring Him incense, gold and myrrh
Come peasant, king to own Him
The King of kings salvation brings
Let loving hearts enthrone Him

[Bridge]
He is King of kings
This Child is Lord of lords
He is Christ the King
Hark, how the bells, sweet silver bells
Christmas is here, bringing the cheer
And they will sing Merry
(Merry, Merry, Merry, Merry Christmas)
Merry Christmas
(Merry, Merry, Merry, Merry Christmas)
Oh, Merry
(Merry, Merry, Merry, Merry Christmas)
Merry Christmas
Oh, oh, oh, how the bells, sweet silver bells
Christmas is here, bringing good cheer
Oh, how the bells, sweet silver bells
Oh, how the bells, sweet silver bells
Christmas is here, bringing good cheer
(Hark, how the bells; hark, how the bells
Sweet silver bells; sweet silver bells)
Sweet silver bells, sweet silver bells
(Hark, how the bells, sweet silver bells
Christmas is here, bringing good cheer
To the young and the old)

[Outro]
What Child is this who laid to rest
On Mary's lap, He is the King
(He is King) He is King

Look out my window. I can see tomorrow
Just a whole way of sorrow when the change is made
And I've been a-cryin'
Oh, Lord, I've been a cryin'
But I'll go on a-cryin' when the change is made
And I been a good man. Oh Lord, Lord, I've been a good man
But what's good's a good man after the change is made? Yeah!
And I'm not forgettin' all the love, the love, the love I been a-gettin'

And I been a-cryin'. Oh Lord, Lord, I been a-cryin'
But I got to go on a-cryin' after the change is made
And I'm not forgettin' all the love, love I been a-gettin.'
'Cause I got to go on living after the change is made

And I'm not forgettin' all the love, all the love I been a-gettin'
And I got to go on livin' after the change is made
And I'm not forgettin' all the love I been gettin'
But I got to go on living after the change is made
And I'm not forgettin' ...
It's a celebration baby, step out with me
Draped in your finest clothes and accessories
I notice you've been focused on the stress of the week
But it's Friday tonight
Spend the night out with me

Let's hit the party tonight
That will be out of sight
No matter where we decide, it's gon' be on tonight
You look you're ready and right
You showed me out of sight
We're coming home late tonight

We'll do it right right
Our hands are sky high

Don't look that the time
Just let it fly by
We live the good life
And we'll do it right right
We'll do it right right
Ain't too fast or slow, it's just enough to get down
Might be from the country but were going to town
This weekend we can freak a leek all on the floor
First get low, then come close
Let the music control, oh

Let's hit the party tonight
That will be out of sight
No matter where we decide, it's gon' be on tonight
You look you're ready and right
You showed me out of sight

This is the last call
Fill up your glass ya'll
We'll dance until they play the last song
It's the end of the night
Now it's just you and I
It's time for us to take this party back home
Let's hit the party tonight
That will be out of sight
No matter where we decide, it's gon' be on tonight
You look you're ready and right
You showed me out of sight
When we go home late tonight

Girl we gon do it right right
Until the daylight
We'll do it light right

Then we say bye bye

[Intro: Ron Browz]
It's your boy, Ron Browz, aka the Ether Boy. Shoutout to Mynd Tek

[Chorus: Mac Miller & Sample]
Faithful to the end
She says I can't be
Faithful to the end
She says I'll never be
Faithful to the end
So I'll try and be
I'd like to be her very best friend, aha

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Uh, look
She say I'm just a player like Punisher was
A bunch of old girls that I swept under the rug
So before you shut me out, first let me explain
'Cause I'ma keep you warm when the temperature change
And I'll try my best to stay true (Stay true)
I really hope that I can stay faithful (Yep)
'Cause you the type of girl that I prayed for (Prayed for)
I'ma wait outside for you when the rain pour
Here's my crib, let's take a tour
You layin' on my bed like you gon' make it yours (Aha)
You taste sweet like a peach when we deep in the sheets
When I leave I'ma try my best not to cheat
'Cause never would I lie, deceit you (Nah)
I wanna be the other half that completes you (Yep)
Not only fuckin' but goin' out to eat too (Syke)
I was prayin' that I would meet you (Aha)

[Chorus: Mac Miller & Sample]
Faithful to the end
(What?) She says I can't be
Faithful to the end
She says I'll never be
Faithful to the end
So I'll try and be
I'd like to be her very best friend

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Let's go, look
Man, you know the ways of the rap world (Rap world)
I don't even have to holler at girls
They just approach me, tellin' me they know me
It's all just a circle like Ring Around the Rosie (Yep)
So I don't listen to hoes
I just smile, laugh, let 'em hit up my bros
'Cause I love it when you kiss me on the tip of your toes
When I take you out, you know I'm bringin' a rose, and
It's apparent, you can meet my parents (Wassup?)
Mark and Karen, let's try not to scare 'em
And I'm recording this with a smile
Pick up the dial 'cause I ain't seen you in a while (What's up, baby?)
Hard to believe it's true
But right now all I want is you (Is you)
So, baby, you can holler at me
Forget about your pops, you can call me daddy (

[?])

[Chorus: Mac Miller & Sample]
Faithful to the end
She says I can't be
Faithful to the end
She says I'll never be
Faithful to the end
So I'll try and be
I'd like to be her very best friend

[Verse 1]
Front rooms, back rooms
Slide into tables, crowd into bathrooms
Joke around, cheap talk
Deep talk, talk, talk, talk around the clock
Crawl home, lie down
Teeth chatter, heart pounds
I don't feel so good, I don't feel so good
Push a button to escape

[Pre-Chorus 1: Joni Mitchell & evangelist]
Preacher on the tube crying "Lord, there's evil in this land"
Rock and roll music!
"Cast down these dope-fiends and their noisy bands"
Damn their souls!

[Chorus 1]
Preacher preaching love like vengeance
Preaching love like hate
Calling for large donations
Promising estates
Rolling lawns and angel bands
Behind the pearly gates
You know he will have his in this life
But yours will have to wait

[Post-Chorus: Joni Mitchell, evangelist & man]
He's immaculately tax free
Multiple hundreds of thousands of
Tax free
Hundreds of millions of dollars
Tax free
A hundred billion dollars!
And who is paying the price?
Who, who
Your children are

[Verse 2: Joni Mitchell & evangelist]
Pissed off, jacked up
Scream into the mic, spit into the loving cup
Strut like a rooster, march like a man
God's hired hands and the devil bands packing the same grandstands
Different clothes (pot in their pockets!), different hair (sexually active!)
Raise a screaming guitar or a bible in the air
Theatre of anguish, theatre of glory
God's hired hands and the devil bands

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Oh come let us adore me
Lord, there's danger in this land
You get witch hunts and wars
When church and state hold hands
(Fuck it!)

[Chorus 2]
Tonight I'm going dancing
With the drag queens and the punks
Big beat deliver me
From this sanctimonious skunk
We're no flaming angels
And he's not heaven sent
How can he speak for the Prince of Peace
When he's hawk-right militant?

[Post-Chorus: Joni Mitchell & evangelist]
And he's immaculately tax free
Our nation has lost its guts!
Save me
Our nation has lost its strength
Tax free
Our nation has whimpered and cried
Save me
And petted the Castros
Tax free
The Khomeinis' and the Kaddafis'
Save me
For so long
Tax free
That we don't know how to act like a man
Save me
I think that we should turn the United States Marines
Loose on that little island south of Florida and
Stop that problem!
I am preachin' love, I am!
Through a blurry window out above the rooftop
I keep looking at the rain-swept sky
In this small apartment where she used to love me
I just sit here as my life goes by
There's no doorbell ringing, no sweet sounds of singing
Just a silent room where tears won't dry
Life is sad when people hurt you, sad when friends desert you
Sad when dreams get lost beyond recall
But remembering that love stopped blossoming
And that's the saddest thing of all
Once we had it made, our days one grand parade
Of thrills and laughter, only lovers know
She was proud of me and we were young and free
One touch was all it took, and off we go
Now above the rain, I hear a passing plane
And all my loneliness begins to show
Life is sad when people hurt you, sad when friends desert you
Sad when dreams get lost beyond recall
But remembering from spring to lonely spring
Well, that's the saddest thing of all
My baby gives me love
As good as love can be
I just leave her crying
When the blues come over me
Up on a mountain
I'm drowning in the sea
All the clocks say midnight
When the blues come over me
The blues come over me
I pack it up and go
The blues come over me
I catch the wind and blow
And some will take the wine
And some will take the night
When everything's all wrong
Then anything is all right
Some put in a song
And some sing it for their dues
Some go to sleep and wake up
Tangled in the blues
The blues come over me
I pack it up and go
The blues come over me
I catch the wind and blow
The blues come in a whisper
And make you scream and shout
And you'll do most anything
Just to let them out
I may think I'm happy
I may think I'm free
Nothing don't mean nothing
When the blues come over me
The blues come up behind
The blues wait up ahead
The blues ask why you are born
If you just end up dead
The blues, talking about the blues
The blues, oh the blues, the blues
Talking about the blues
When the blues come over me
Talking about the blues
I have to go away
The blues, the blues
When the blues come over me
I have to pack it up and go

[Verse 1]
It's the time of the year again for you to share
All the love that you have
With every woman and every man to share love
Christmas day is here
And the Lord is what is near
To share love with your family and thank God for allowing you to see that

[Chorus]
Christmas is the time to share
With the one you love share good things
Joy, glad tidings
Share love
Giving all you have this day
Lets the world know you care
And you will be there to share love

[Verse 2]
Families all around
Children are happy with what they found
Giving things on this day and thanking our God
For teaching us the way to share love
As the snow is falling down
Presents unwrapped underneath the tree
Bringing tidings of great joy to every little girl and boy, you know

[Chorus]
Christmas is the time to share
With the one you love share good things
Joy, glad tidings
Share love
Giving all you have this day
Lets the world know you care
And you will be there to share love

[Bridge]
Now the true meaning of Christmas
Is falling on your knees
Thanking the Lord for what he's done
Giving the world is only some

[Chorus]
Christmas is the time to share
With the one you love share good things
Joy, glad tidings
Share love
Giving all you have this day
Lets the world know you care
And you will be there to share love
Christmas is the time to share
With the one you love share good things
Joy, glad tidings
Share love
Giving all you have this day
Lets the world know you care
And you will be there to share love
Sugar magnolia, blossoms blooming
Heads all empty and I don't care
Saw my baby down by the river
Knew she'd have to come up soon for air

Sweet blossom come on, under the willow
We can have high times if you'll abide
We can discover the wonders of nature
Rolling in the rushes down by the riverside

She's got everything delightful
She's got everything I need
Takes the wheel when I'm seeing double
Pays my ticket when I speed

She comes skimmin' through rays of violet
She can wade in a drop of dew
She don't come and I don't follow
Waits backstage while I sing to you

Well, she can dance a Cajun rhythm
Jump like a Willys in four wheel drive
She's a summer love for spring, fall and winter
She can make happy any man alive
Sugar magnolia, ringing that bluebell
Caught up in sunlight, come on out singing
I'll walk you in the sunshine
Come on honey, come along with me

She's got everything delightful
She's got everything I need
A breeze in the pines and the sun and bright moonlight
Lazing in the sunshine, yes indeed

Sometimes when the cuckoo's crying
When the moon is half way down
Sometimes when the night is dying
I take me out and I wander around, I wander 'round

Sunshine, daydream, walking in the tall trees
Going where the wind goes
Blooming like a red rose
Breathing more freely

Ride our singin'
I'll walk you in the morning sunshine
Sunshine, daydream, sunshine, daydream
Walking in the sunshine
Say you wanna be loved?
But you won't let me love ya
Say you want someone to trust in you?
Can't you see that's what I'm trying to do

I know you've been hurt before
And you're afraid to try love once more

Without love by your side, you're only half alive (Doo doo doo)
Cause everybody needs love, oh yeah
Everybody needs love

Say you wanna be kissed? (Wanna be kissed)
But you won't let me kiss you (No no no)
Say you wanna be missed?
Can't you see how my arms are missing you

It's got you hurtin' so inside...
That now from love you're trying to hide

Without love by your side - without love you can't survive (Doo doo doo)
Cause everybody needs love, oh yeah
Everybody needs love, yeah yeah yeah
Eww ewww You need love
And I need love
Everybody needs love

So you wake up in the morning (Wake up in the morning)
Feeling all empty inside (Yeah yeah yeah)
I'll bet you I know what your trouble is...
You need someone like me by your side

And I know you've been hurt before
But don't be afraid to try love once more

Cause without love you'll find you'll have no peace of mind (Doo doo doo)
Cause everybody needs love, oh yeah
Everybody needs love - Hey

You need love (yeah)
I need love (yeah)
Everybody needs love, love

Now now now now

Everybody needs love

Everybody needs love
Listen to the wind blow, watch the sun rise
Running in the shadows--damn your love, damn your lies

And if you don't love me now
You will never love me again
I can still hear you saying
We would never break the chain (Never break the chain)
And if you don't love me now (If you don't love me now)
You will never love me again
I can still hear you saying (You would say)
We would never break the chain (Never break the chain)

Listen to the wind blow, down comes the night
Running in the shadows--damn your love, damn your lies
Break the silence--damn the dark, damn the light

And if you don't love me now
You will never love me again

We would never break the chain (Never break the chain)
And if you don't love me now (If you don't love me now)

We would never break the chain (Never break the chain)
And if you don't love me now (If you don't love me now)
You will never love me again
I can still hear you saying (You would say)
We would never break the chain (Never break the chain)
Chain, keep us together (Running in the shadows)
Chain, keep us together (Running in the shadows)
Chain, keep us together (Running in the shadows)
Chain, keep us together (Running in the shadows)
Chain, keep us together (Running in the shadows)
Chain, keep us together (Running in the shadows)
Hog of a Sunday
Dog of a Monday
Get it back someday
What'd I say?
Movin' in close
Cut from a long shot
Fade on a downbeat
Ready or not ready or not

Chorus:
Corrina, Wake it up baby
Corrina, Shake it on down
Corrina, Corrina
Cruise through a stop sign
Loggin' up short time
Bird on a phone line
Soakin' up the Sun
Salt on a crowtail
What can I do?
I'm down by law
But I'm true to you true to you
Chorus:
If, what, where and when
Told at the proper time
Big black wings beat on the wind
But they don't hardly climb
There's a silver ocean
Silver clouds and silver sea
A bird on the horizon
Silver wingin' back to me

Chorus:
Wake it up baby
Shake it down easy
Bring it back someday
What'd I say?
Movin' in closer
Cut from a long shot
Fade on a downbeat
Ready or not ready or not
Corrina-Wake it up baby
Corrina-Shake it down easy
Corrina-Shake it up now
Corrina-Shake it back down
If, what, where, when and how
No it don't mean a thing to me
I would love you even if
You flew away from me
I'll just stand here waiting
On the far side of the sea
There is no fear that lovers born
Will ever fail to meet
Chorus:
Yeah, oh my my my
Yeah
La la la la
Oh oh oh oh oh oh

Oh oh oh oh oh oh

If I told you that I placed the world right in your hands
And I'd rather be your man and girl

Me and you to be together, forever

And givin me a brand new start and girl

And for those of you who still think we're from England
We're not, no

We pit our blades and all trades
Till we think we might die, far from North America
Where the buildings are old
And you might have lots of mines

I hate the feeling when you're lookin' at me that way
'Cause we're North Americans
But if we act all shy, it'll make it okay
Makes it go away

Oh, I don't know, I don't know, oh, where to begin
Well, we're North Americans
But in the end, make the same mistakes all over again
Come on, North America

We are North American scum
We're from North America
We are North American scum
We are North American
New York's the greatest
If you get someone to pay the rent
We're from north America
It's the furthest you can live from the government

Some proud American Christians might disagree
You're in North America
But New York's the only place
Would keep them off the streets

Now we can't have parties like in Spain
Where they go all night
Shut down in North America
Oh, like Berlin where they go another night, alright

You see, I love this place that I've grown to know
Alright, north America
And yeah, I know you wouldn't touch us with a ten foot pole
'Cause we're north Americans

We are North American scum
We are North Americans
We are North American scum
We are North American

Take me back to Statesman
North American scum
Well, we could be where we want to be in
In North America
Where the DJ engraved
Here in North American scum

[Incomprehensible]
Look out, North America
You know, when you're in love and your lover leaves you
And you've got nobody, the lonely hours over here
Sittin' home and thinkin', you say

Distant lover, lover
Oh, so many miles away
Oh, heaven knows that I long for you
Every night, every night and sometimes I yearn through the day

Distant lover, oh lover
You should think about me, say a prayer for me
Please, please, baby
Think about me sometime, think about me yeah
Here in misery, misery

As I reminisce
Oh, baby, through our joyful summer together
The promises we made of the daily letter
Then all of a sudden everything seemed to explode
Now I gaze out my window, sugar, down the lonesome road
Distant lover, oh, sugar
How can you treat my heart so mean and cruel
Don't you know, sugar
That every moment that I spent with you
I treasured it like it was a precious jewel
Oh, baby

Lord, have mercy

Oh baby, don't go
Please come back, baby
Something I wanna say
When you left you took all of me with you
Now, Lord
I wonder do you wanna hear me scream and plead
Please, please, please, come back home girl
Please, baby, come back home

Oh baby, don't go
Please come back, baby
Oh, something I wanna say
When you left to go away
No other do I want, do you wanna have me plead and scream
Please, please, oh please, baby
Come back home, girl
Oh baby, come back
Oh, oh

[Verse 1]
Day after day
He goes out of his way
'Cause he knows you're gonna be there
And if he doesn't say too much
At least he keeps in touch, to show his care

And it ain't like he never loved before
And it ain't like he'll never love no more
It's just that someday, maybe
He'll find some way baby
To turn you around

He may just be right
Why, is he so in love with you
Why, don't he find something else to do

Well, it ain't what he loves you for
And it ain't that you got so much more
It's just that sometimes someone
Got to play the dumb one to get along (And you may just get along)

[Chorus]
My my my my
He's a fool for you
No one else will do

[Verse 2]
Laugh and be gay, ooh
You look so nice that way
You know you'll get a smile
Wear a ribbon in your hair
He'll notice that it's there
Just his style

You just state your case and sing the song
And you take it as it comes along
Who knows someday maybe
You'll take a look out baby, and find you care

And I know you'll be there

[Chorus]
My my my my
He's a fool for you
No one else will do

My my my my
He's a fool for you
No one else will do
There's a long-distance train rolling through the rain
Tears on the letter I write
There's a woman I long to touch and I'm missin' her so much
But she's drifting like a satellite

There's a neon light ablaze in a green smoky haze
And laughter down on Elizabeth Street
There's a lonesome bell tone in that valley of stone
Where she bathed in a stream of pure heat

Her father would emphasize you got to be more than street-wise
But he practiced what he preached from the heart
A full-blooded Cherokee, he predicted it to me
The time and the place that we'd part

There's a babe in the arms of a woman in a rage
And a longtime golden-haired stripper onstage
And she winds back the clock and she turns back the page
Of a book that nobody can write
Oh, where are you tonight?
The truth was obscure, too profound and too pure
To live it you had to explode
In that last hour of need, we entirely agreed
Sacrifice was the code of the road

I left town at dawn, with Marcel and St. John
Strong men belittled by doubt
I couldn't tell her what my private thoughts were
But she had some way of finding them out

He took dead-center aim, but he missed just the same
She was waiting, putting flowers on the shelf
She could feel my despair as I climbed up her hair
And discovered her invisible self

There's a lion in the road, there's a demon escaped
There's a million dreams gone, there's a landscape being raped
As her beauty fades and I watch her undrape
Well I won't, but then maybe again, I might
Oh, if I could just find you tonight

I fought with my twin, that enemy within
Till both of us fell by the way
Horseplay and disease is killing me by degrees
While the law looks the other way
Your partners in crime hit me up for nickels and dimes
The man you were lovin' could never get clean
It felt out of place, my foot in his face
But he shoulda stayed where his money was green

I bit into the root of forbidden fruit
With the juice running down my leg
Then I dealt with your boss, who'd never known about loss
Who always was too proud to beg

There's a white diamond gloom on the dark side of this room
And a pathway that leads up to the stars
If you don't believe there's a price for this sweet paradise
Just remind me to show you the scars

There's a new day at dawn and I've finally arrived
If I'm-a there in the morning, baby, you'll know I've survived
I can't believe it, I can't believe I'm alive
But without you it doesn't seem right
Oh, where are you tonight?
When I first met you baby
Honey you were almost out of school
When I first met you baby
Honey you were almost out of school
You were real wild then woman
Honey, but you were nobody's fool

I was so in love with you baby
And I tried to get you to love me too
I was so in love with you baby
And I tried to get you to love me too
I thought you had no time for me then woman
Wouldn't do anything I asked to

Oh, sweet thing
You are all I want to see
Oh, sweet thing
You are all I want to see
I having so much trouble baby
I wonder what's gonna happen to me
Got a fine lookin' woman, lives way across the town
Yes, she's a fine lookin' woman, lives way across the town
Whenever I see that woman
My love comes tumbling down

She's a fine lookin' woman and she soothes my worried soul
She's a fine lookin' woman and she soothes my worried soul
Well, she put the lights out on me
Then I gave up all my gold

She's a fine lookin' woman and she shakes all the men
Yeah, fine lookin' woman and the meat shakes on the bone
Well, everytime she shakes mine
Then all my body's gone
What now my love, now that you've left me
How can I live through another day
Watching my dreams turn to ashes
And my hopes turn to bits of clay

Once I could see, once I could feel
Now I am numb, I've become unreal
I walk the night, without a goal
Stripped of my heart and my soul

What now my love, now that it's over
I feel the world falling all around me
Here come the stars, tumbling around me
There's the sky, where that sea should be

What now my love, now that you're gone
I'd be a fool to go on and on
No one would care, no one would cry
If I should live if I should live or die

What now my love, now there is nothing
Only my last, my last good-bye
It's the little old lady from Pasadena

The little old lady from Pasadena
Go granny, go granny, go granny go
Has a pretty little flower bed of white gardenias
Go granny, go granny, go granny go
But parked in her rickety old garage
Is a brand new shiny red Super-Stock Dodge

And everybody's saying that there's nobody meaner
Than the little old lady from Pasadena
She drives real fast and she drives real hard
She's the terror of Colorado Boulevard

It's the little old lady from Pasadena

If you see her on the street don't try to choose her
Go granny, go granny, go granny go
You might try a goer but you'll never lose her
Go granny, go granny, go granny go
She's gonna get a ticket now sooner or later
'Cause she can't keep her foot off the accelerator
And everybody's saying that there's nobody meaner
Than the little old lady from Pasadena
She drives real fast and she drives real hard
She's the terror of Colorado Boulevard

It's the little old lady from Pasadena

Go granny, go granny, go granny go
Go granny, go granny, go granny go
The guys come to race her from miles around
But she'll give 'em a length then she'll shut 'em down

And everybody's saying that there's nobody meaner
Than the little old lady from Pasadena
She drives real fast and she drives real hard
She's the terror of Colorado Boulevard

It's the little old lady from Pasadena

Go granny, go granny, go granny go
Go granny, go granny, go granny go
Go granny, go granny, go granny go
Go granny, go granny, go granny go

Go granny, go granny, go granny go
Go granny, go granny, go granny go
Sometimes I wonder
Just what am I fighting for?
I win some battles
But I always lose the war
I keep right on stumblin'
In this no-man's land out here

But I know
Mmmmm yes, I know
There must be a better world somewhere

Flying high
Some joker clips my wings
Just because he gets a kick
Out of doing those kind of things
I keep on fallin' in space
Or just hangin' in mid-air

But I know
Ohh yes, I know
There has just got to be a better world somewhere
Every woman I want
Only wants herself
Everybody I love
Seems to love somebody else
And every woman
Got a license to break my heart
And every love, oh it's over
Over before it gets a chance to start

If it ain't dead
Maybe in the year after
Instead of tears
I'll learn all about laughter
But meanwhile I'm stuck out here

It just ain't fair, but I know
I said I know
Oh yes, I know
There must be a better world somewhere
There's just gotta be
Gotta be a better world somewhere
Ooh
I know what you like
Convict

Chorus:
Till fades out
When the moon hangs low in Napoli
There's a handsome gondolier
Every night he sings so happily
So his lady love can hear
In a manner oh gravissimo
He repeats his serenade
And his heart beats so fortissimo
When she raises her Venetian shade

Ciribiribin, chiribiribin, ciribiribin

Ciribiribin, he waits for her each night beneath her balcony
Ciribiribin, he begs to hold her tight, but no, she won't agree
Ciribiribin, she throws a rose and blows a kiss from up above
Ciribiribin, ciribiribin, ciribiribin, they're so in love

(Orchestral Interlude)

Ciribiribin, ciribiribin, ciribiribin, they're so in love
When I think about love
Honey, you always
Come across my mind
Is it the way that you hold me
Or the way that
You told me love is blind
Well, it's a crime of the heart
These things I'm
Thinking to myself
But I can't forget you, babe
Just can't seem to
Think of nothing else

Got a woman at home
A family to feed
Three fine children
They think the Lord of me
Now I'm standing
At the crossroads
Looking for a sign of true love
Well, I heard that song
Says girls just wanna have fun
Well, I guess I
Bought my ticket, honey
'Cause it feels as if
The ride has just begun
Well, there's two kinds of love
One is wrong and one is right
But I can't forget you baby
Can't forget
The way you hold me tight

I got a woman at home
A family to feed
Three fine children
They think the Lord of me
Well, I'm standing
At the crossroads
Looking for a sign of true love

When I think about women
Honey, you always
Come across my mind
Is it the way that you told me
The way you told me love is blind
Well, it's a crime of the heart
These things I'm
Thinking to myself now
Can't forget you, babe
Can't forget
The way you make me feel
I got a woman at home
A family to feed
Three fine children
At the crossroads
Looking for a sign of true love
When I was a little bitty baby
My mama done rock me in the cradle
In them old cotton fields back home

It was back in Louisiana
Just about a mile from Texarkana
In them old cotton fields back home

Let me tell you now well, I got me in a fix
I caught a nail in my tire doing lickitey splits
I had to walk a long, long way to town

I came upon a nice old man well, he had a hat on
Wait a minute, mister, can you give me some directions?
I'm gonna want to be right off for home

When I was a little bitty baby
My mama done rock me in the cradle
In them old cotton fields back home

It was back in Louisiana
Just about a mile from Texarkana
In them old cotton fields back home
Don't care if them cotton balls get rotten
When I got you, baby, who needs cotton?
In them old cotton fields back home

Brother, only one thing more that's gonna warm you
A summer's day out in California
It's gonna be those cotton fields back home

It was back in Louisiana
Just about a mile from Texarkana
Give me them cotton fields (It was back in Louisiana)
Let me hear it for the cotton fields (Just about a mile from Texarkana)
You know that there's just no place like home

Oh, boy, it sure feels good to breathe the air back home
You shoulda seen their faces when they seen how I grown
In them old cotton fields back home
Oh just let me hold you baby
I'm trying to forget about the past
Yes, let me hold you baby
I'm trying to forget about the past
Yes, I know you've had a hard time baby
But remember troubles don't always last

Oh you tried so hard to tell me you love me
And I didn't believe a word you said
You tried so hard to tell me you love me, woman
And I didn't believe a word you said
But now I'm older and I'm wiser, baby
And now I can understand your ways

Oh, I'm at your mercy, woman
Do with me what you will to me
Yes I'm at your mercy, baby
Just do with me what you will to me
Yes I'm not asking for sympathy baby
Yes I was wrong and I must pay
Oh, I'm asking for just one more chance
Baby, to try to prove my love to you
Well, I'm asking you for just one more chance
Baby, to try to prove my love to you
You just say the word now baby
And I'll do anything you tell me to

[Chorus]
We are going down, Jordan
We are going down, Jordan
We are going down, Jordan
Let's walk the Heavenly road

[Verse 1]
I was livin' me life as an Anglican
Let me tell you how I changed to a Baptist man
I was livin' me life as an Anglican
Let me tell you how I changed to a Baptist man
One night I was walking down Fredrick street
Poor and hungry, no shoes on me feet
I passed a door that said "Down with sin"
It was the smell of food that pull me in

[Chorus]
We are going down, Jordan
We are going down, Jordan
We are going down, Jordan
Let's walk the Heavenly road
All together, children
Going down, Jordan
We are going down, Jordan
We are going down, Jordan
Let's walk the Heavenly road
Once again now
Going down, Jordan
We are going down, Jordan
We are going down, Jordan
Let's walk the Heavenly road

[Verse 2]
Well, the leader walked up and he shook my hand
Said "I want you to be a holy man"
Right away I made a quick decision
Me stomach was a growling for this new religion
I started over to get some food
When some sisters approached me in a mystic mood
They dunked me in the water 'bout four, five times
I couldn't see a thing 'cause I was almost blind
Singing I've got a sword in my hand
I'm going to use it well
Deliver me
I've got a sword in my hand (Hallelujah)
I'm going to use it well

[Verse 3]
I was drenched to me skin and I was feeling cold
But the sight of the food made me take a hold
The sisters started to break away
They said "Kneel, believers, kneel and pray"
I prayed and I prayed in a newfound style
In the meantime me taste buds was running wild
I was about to fall clear out of me seat
When a man jumped up and said "Before you eat
You got to mourn, children, mourn
You got to mourn, children, mourn
And if you want to go to Heaven when you die
You got to mourn, children, mourn
All together now
Mourn, children, mourn
You got to mourn, children, mourn
And if you want to go to Heaven when you die
You got to mourn, children, mourn
Once again now
Mourn, children, mourn
Oh, you got to mourn, children, mourn
And if you want to go to Heaven when you die
You got to mourn, children, mourn

[Verse 4]
Well, before I baptized I had plenty pain
Now I find myself a free man again
Well, before I baptized I had plenty pain
Now I find myself a free man again
Don't talk 'bout the leaders, they treat me good
Plenty sweet oil and plenty food
Brother, it was then that I realized
Every man on earth should be baptized

[Outro]
Going down, Jordan
We are going down, Jordan
We are going down, Jordan
Let's walk the Heavenly road
Hop de doubla
Going down, Jordan
We are going down, Jordan
We are going down, Jordan
Let's walk the Heavenly road
Once again now
Going down, Jordan
We are going down, Jordan
We are going down, Jordan
Let's walk the Heavenly road
There was never a doubt, never a doubt in my mind
We weren't meant to be lonely
Never a doubt I knew that I'd find you some day
There was never a doubt, after all of those nights alone
All those desperate mornings
Never a doubt, there was never a doubt in my mind

I suppose there have been times when you felt like a room filled with darkness
Not a window around
There must have been moments you felt you were truly alone
Then again each of us knows, in a night of unbearable sadness
Still a light can be found
In each morning the promise that someday your true love will come

I suppose there are some people who never believe in the magic
Oh the magic of love
They think nothing is precious and life is just pleasure and pain
Then again each of us knows, when a heart has been broken it's tragic
Oh the magic of love
Even that which is broken with love can be mended again
All the things that you fear, at the most they mean nothing
All the sorrow and sadness can just disappear

There was never a doubt, never a doubt in my mind
We weren't meant to be lonely
Never a doubt I knew that I'd find you some day
There was never a doubt, after all of those nights alone
All those desperate mornings
Never a doubt, there was never a doubt in my mind
There was never a doubt in my mind
Never a doubt in my mind
Yeah, yeah
It's the easy, queasy, beautiful, beautiful
Yeah, y'all know me
It's the queen bee, queasy, breezy, beautiful

She gets her own on her own like a captain

Queen bee, baby, your front page lady

Hey there pretty lady
Love has come my way
So nice to be involved
It's tough out there these days

I got my weather 'cause I'm so wrapped up in you
My heart is on the line
Tell me what more can I do, pretty baby
'Cause you're special, hey
Girl, you make me feel real good
Special to me, you see, you are special
Baby, you're so special to me

Hey baby, I can't believe the things you've done for me
You put me back on the right track
Think about you constantly
And I know in your heart that you feel the same way for me, baby
Late nights with me all alone, it's total ecstasy

All I can do is think about the the times
When I'm making sweet love to you
And there seems to be, I'm tellin' you girl
Some kind of magic when we touch
Don't you leave
Special, yeah, you are
Girl you make me feel real good
So special to me, you see
Baby girl, you're special
So special to me, baby
Hey baby

Girl, you make me feel so good
You make me feel so good, hey
And all I can do is think about the the times
When I'm making sweet love to you, baby
And there seems to be
Some kinda magic when we touch
Don't you go nowhere, don't you leave

Special, so special, special to me, you see
You're a special part of me, love
So special to me, baby
Oh, you put me back on the right track, baby
And I like that, oh you're so good
So special to me, you see

I put my heart on the line any time
'Cause I know that you'll let us guarantee, baby
You're so special
Y'all know there's a lot of M C's
But just give my chance on the mic
Open the, open the, open the
Open the, open the, open the, aah

Open the safe with no key, it's easier than battlin' me
'Cause uh, uh, I'll make you walk like a doggy
Some say on and on but they mean on, on
I got tired of that new style, breakdown

I have to take it back to the break of dawn
When Melle Mel was Melle Mel
And Al Capone was Al Capone
Bootleg is sellin' now it's rap
That's sellin' in the village but I'm just privileged
To makin' my home from my spirit

So when you hear me it's the man
With the deeper thoughts
At night I can't sleep my brain
Keep movin' like a body on a horse
I don't stand, don't stand
Don't wife me I construct on bricks
Some thoughts it wasn't
Until he said, "He sunk my battleship"

So hip-hip, load the clip, hip, I miss, damn
I pay my taxes so I won't mess with Sam
Ya hear the rhyme, you stand still, some ask for refill
We move your thoughts so I can see if you for fake or real
'Cause Buffalo Bill bit battle inside from my rap meal

And left me on a hill, hill so when I battle no will
So mama should I kill a man like Cypress Hill, chill
I got no lawyer so I pleadin' my own appeal
How does it feel when a monkey is your ill
In a J A I L? I have no time to make bail

Saw someone to be macho
Like fritches that got the lyro
So they had it at bein' a heroes
Where did their bodies go, only God knows

You got caught, between the fire and the hoses
You wanna battle? Bring your Moses
Forget what fun, what time Moses and someone goin' down
And it ain't Gastor Douglass 'cause the roughest with the guy
Becomes a pussy so all the bad boy talk
Come on 'cause I'm the nice dog, yeah, hawk
Throw many fights in fought courts, boss
Never lost so toss a nickel and change your course
Say, "Mama", say, "Mama", say, "Mama", say, "What?"

Some thought we were blunted when we wrote this
'Cause we were far, from reality
Some thought we were blunted when we wrote this
'Cause we were far, from reality

Aiyyo, huh, huh, ho, with the badder that run the Tent
Who walks really for lack of listenin' to the drum set
You silly nimble bad as to my car, don't put the bass
Oh, on the table test the super lantra, you got caught all that toe

With twenty-thousand legs, I'm laughin' arrogantly
As your nostril bleeds, relax and max and drink a Gin on the Tech
Well their gatin' for another Pirate to lose his neck, check
I got a call from Captain Hook in so quick

We used to be partners 'fore the clip stole my rapper
I had to be right 'cause you fight like it was a bitch
I had to change the rhythmic pattern
And make sure it fit so now when I go and see with she
I thought the pirates through a telescope
And bomb 'em like it's make believe
Blow me my sword, I out for my protection
'Cause I might ship on landin' side and start an insurrection
A pirate had disguised himself as one of my crew
But I saw true and had to shake a him before he got through

Hey, hey, guy the loot the booty
I formed like a ram, I gave an ultimatum
And told him he could do time
But he argued and fought me
He tried to bust right and so I took it upon myself
To make the brother walk the plank

Some thought we were blunted when we wrote this
'Cause we were far, from reality
Some thought we were blunted when we wrote this
'Cause we were far, from reality

Fo' to the fo' to the fi fe come, I smell the blood of
An Englishman run son, ya, see the man cannot understand
The hammer and the barrel hum, so when I get them someone
Will know where the hell I'm from

'Cause I'm sprayin' M C's
With my mack ten machine gun, the hand that rocks will
Be the hand of the gun bum, rum, pum, pum, pum, pum
Is the drop of my snare drum, freakin' is the beat of my tum, tum

Makin' M C's walk like a doggy, hah, hah
I'll make them walk like a doggy, it's like the blunt to the phillie
The ganja to the sessy, you can't write a rhyme
Without the roots mentality

'Cause ain't no Milli, Vanilli but the kiddy with the skilly
To rhyme so dope, I made up my own vocabulaby, skilly
Missed it from a bomber tacky lackin' all the bum
That get her to a to and fro, I guess they made me boy

So can I get the cheers, not the chant from cheers
But the chant from my peers
That I know are really down with me, cheers
Now that I mean those that been since the beginnin'
'Cause some of y'all cut out when it started rainin'

Now check me at the movies, I'm rollin' like Black Man
I didn't need Batman, he teamed up with the favourite, eh
Tell all your friend, friend, watch all your friend, friend
'Cause some say are your friend before wanna dem bring you poison

So I roll by myself and that I carry my bit
You wished you stayed around, you know my clip got the lip
So empty your hooray, your hooray to your hip
And if your hip's a book, you know you got to get off bricks man

Some thought we were blunted when we wrote this
'Cause we were far, from reality
Some thought we were blunted when we wrote this
'Cause we were far, from reality

Some thought we were blunted when we wrote this
'Cause we were far, from reality
Some thought we were blunted when we wrote this
'Cause we were far, from reality

Some thought we were blunted when we wrote this
'Cause we were far, from reality
Some thought we were blunted when we wrote this
'Cause we were far, from reality

I miss the thrill of grammar school romances
I miss the junior prom and graduation dances
The gossip in assembly hall
I'm homesick, that's all

I miss the gang that hangs around at Miller's
Devouring chocolate sodas, with those whipped cream fillers
The girl I promised I would call
I'm homesick, that's all

I miss the midnight services on Christmas Eve
And the joy when Christmas morning came
I miss the scramble for the wishbone every Sunday
And the big Thanksgiving football game

I miss the times I had to set the table
I miss the rolls my mother made when she was able
The fragrant bonfires in the fall
I'm homesick, that's all

I miss the times I had to set the table
I miss the rolls my mother made when she was able
The fragrant bonfires in the fall
I'm homesick, that's all
Taxis lights pull out of sight
Around the lane and into the night
Goodbye this time may be the last

Might have to cry might have to lie
Might have to die a little

Evening song didn't last long
Dreamed I was right sussed I was wrong
So I make my way through an empty day

Might have to cry might have to lie
Might have to die a little... this time

Never believed she would leave
I forgot about last time
When she walked out this morning
I went out of my mind

I'll try to smile
Pretend it never happened
Leave 'em slow but leave 'em laughing
I'll try to fight down to the last
Might have to cry might have to lie
Might have to die a little... this time

Some people live and learn
Never was lucky that way

Wanted so hard to believe her

But other rains will come
And wash it all away
Other loves will come and go
You must believe me when I say
Didn't want it that way

I'll try to smile
Pretend it never happened
Leave 'em slow but leave 'em laughing
Goodbye this time may be the last

Might have to cry
Might have to lie
Might have to die a little

Might have to cry
Did you ever have to lie
Did you ever have to die a little
Whoa whoa did you ever have to cry
You know you have to lie
You know you gotta die just a little... a little
You know you have to die whoa you gotta cry
Whoa you gotta die

The sun shall not smite I by day
Nor the moon by night;
And everything that I do
Shall be upfull and right
And if it's all night
It got to be (alright!)
If it's all night
Got to be alright!
I'm a not lose this one;
I'm the lucky one under the sun
If you make me move
Then you know you got to groove:
A do ya like it, a do ya like it
Do ya do ya do ya do you?
If it's (all night)
Got to be (all right)
I'm workin (all night)
See, I Work for my pay, night and day (all night, alright)
Work for my pay, night and day (all night, alright)

Wipe them lonely tears, baby
I'll tell you why
If it's all night, it got to be (alright!)
If it's all night, got to be (alright!)
(all right) know that I'm a stranger
In your town
I ain't got no claim to nothing
I don't mess with anyone
I walk my way living in a masquerade
And one day I looked behind me at all the things I've done
That's the 1st mistake I ever made

I was born to a lonely women in a town called Buffalo
Never knew the man who never stayed
With my 12-string on my back I discovered every track
That's the 1st mistake I ever made

With a million hearts I've broken
I never kept the score
Memories of good love hate to stay
But I still remember someone who loved me so much more
That's the 1st mistake I ever made

So, when nothing's worth the living and in the night I look above
Prayed, about a million times I prayed
I know my story ended when I lost my only love
That's the 1st mistake I ever made
I was born to a lonely women in a town called Buffalo
Never knew the man who never stayed
With my 12-string on my back I discovered every track
That's the 1st mistake I ever made
Loose talk costs lives
People like to play
We're basically the same
We never lie
Loose talk costs lives

Don't look at me as if you don't remember me at all
There was laughter, there was pain
But I won't make the same mistakes I made
You are too beautiful to me
I hide my tears inside the rain

Am I the soul you cast your spell upon
I had control and now it's gone
Or are you someone who controls my heart and mind
And I will never say a word
And I will never say goodbye

Loose talk costs lives
People like to play
We're basically the same
We never lie
Loose talk costs lives
I can see that someone hung a sign around your heart
And it reads "do not return"
And there is so much trouble I could cause
Someone as beautiful as you
You can feel my candle burn

And I still recall some starry night
We had it all, we held on tight
I promised I would come to you and catch you if you fall
And they will never know about us
For just one moment you were mine

Loose talk costs lives
People like to play
We're basically the same
We never lie
Loose talk costs lives

For just one moment, just one moment, you were mine
Loose talk costs lives
(Our moment held in time)
People like to play
We're basically the same
We never lie
Loose talk costs lives
Loose talk costs lives
People like to play
We're basically the same
We never lie
Loose talk costs lives
Love is everywhere, I see it
You are all that you can be, go on and be it
Life is perfect, I believe it
Come and play the game with me

Open yourself to the first celebration
Open your eyes to the joy and pain
Life is the fruit of your own creation
Ev'ry new birth is a soul regained

Love is everywhere, I see it
You are all that you can be, go on and be it
Life is perfect, I believe it
Come and play the game with me

Drinkin' my life from a silver fountain
Sweetwater running to the cold salt sea
Old man moon on a white-top mountain
Sound of the wind singin' dreams for me

Love is everywhere, I see it
You are all that you can be, go on and be it
Life is perfect, I believe it
Come and play the game with me
Follow your heart like a flying stallion
Race with the sun to the edge of night
Form your truth like a gold medallion
Dance in the circle of the love and the light

Love is everywhere, I see it
You are all that you can be, go on and be it
Life is perfect, I believe it
Come and play the game with me
Everything will be alright tonight
Everything will be alright tonight
No one moves
No one talks
No one thinks
No one walks tonight
Tonight
Everyone will be alright tonight
Everyone will be alright tonight
No one moves
No one talks
No one thinks
No one walks tonight
Tonight

I am gonna love you till the end
I will love you till I reach the end
I will love you till I die
I will see you in the sky
Tonight
Awoke today, felt your side of the bed;
The covers were still warm where you been layin'
You were gone, oh gone, my heart was filled with dread;
You might not be sleeping here again
But it's all right cause I love you, and that's not going to change
Run me around and make me hurt again and again
But I'll still sing you love songs, written in the letters of your name
The rain is gonna come, oh it surely looks like rain

Did you ever waken to the sound of street cats making love?
You guess from the cries you were listening to a fight
Well you know, oh know, haste is the last thing they're thinking of
You know they're only tryin' to make it thru the night

I only want to hold you, I don't want to tie you down
Or fit you in the lines I might've drawn
It's just that I, oh I, have gotten used to havin' you around
The landscape would be empty, if you were gone;
But it's all right cause I love you, and that's not going to change
Run me around and make me hurt again and again
But I'll still sing you love songs, written in the letter of your name
The rain is gonna come, oh it surely looks like rain

[Chorus]
Baby, we need to talk
You know, you know our relationship ain't really been going right
I don't really know how to tell you this but
I'm leaving you for the groove

[Verse 1]
Baby, I gotta let you know
There's something inside of me, girl, that I can't control
Now I love you, baby
And I always will
But that ain't strong enough to change the way that I feel
No

[Pre-Chorus]
You gave me attitude, when all I do is for you
Well find another dude, I'm tired of being your fool

[Chorus]
So
I'm leaving you for the groove
Finally making my move
Now that I'm finally free
I just wanna be me
Yeah, yeah
I'm leaving you for the groove
Finally making my move
Now that I'm finally free
I just wanna be me
Yeah, yeah, aw

[Verse 2]
Baby, I'm done playing your game
Every time I'm dancing, you just look at me strange
I was the one that you loved, now I'm the one the you hate
Well, I don't care girl, go ahead, take me off your top 8
'Cause

[Chorus]
I'm leaving you for the groove
Making my move
Now that I'm finally free
I just wanna be me
Yeah, yeah
I'm leaving you for the groove
Making my move
Now that I'm finally free
I just wanna be me
Yeah, yeah, aw
Dance
I'm leaving you for the groove

[Verse 1]
It's a new day, new day, and it's evident
You must have been Heaven sent
Sometimes we should be hesitant, but I'm not at all
Just feeling more confident
Just using my common sense
Just trusting it, I'm loving it
I can't refuse an offer so benevolent
Can't assume he's gon' use me
And after he'll never call again
Don't be afraid (No, no), don't be afraid (No)
This is your day (Yeah), this is your day

[Chorus]
It's time to be brave
Say I'm not afraid, not anymore
I used to be cold, now the temperature's changed
It just ain't the same
I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid
'Cause I've become brave as the light of day
Straight into a cave to show me the way (Show me the way)
That I might be saved
Now I'm turning the page
Thanks to the power of love I can love
Because I am brave
I am brave, I am brave
Yeah, ooh
Oh, oh, ooh

[Verse 2]
I heard him say this thing moving too fast for him
It's a feeling that I'm straddling
Foolishly adamant, but It's all in his eyes
Really wish he would let me in
'Cause the same way, I'm scared of him
He's scared of being hurt again
It's time to let go, let go of your heart
It's time for a brand new start
Never know, we might never part
Baby, don't be afraid (No), don't be afraid (No)
This is your day (Day), this is your day

[Chorus]
It's time to be brave
Say I'm not afraid, not anymore
I used to be cold, now the temperature's changed
It just ain't the same
I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid
'Cause I've become brave as the light of day
Straight into a cave to show me the way (Show me the way)
That I might be saved
Now I'm turning the page
Thanks to the power of love I can love
Because I am brave

[Bridge]
I wouldn't take back anything that I've gone through (No)
I pray for strength for anything that I'm gonna do
Whether joy, or it's pain, I'm still okay (I'm still okay)
I'ma be alright, 'cause I'm not afraid
No, I am brave

[Chorus]
Say I'm not afraid, not anymore (Not anymore)
I used to be cold (Used to be cold), now the temperature's changed
It just ain't the same
I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid), I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
'Cause I've become brave as the light of day
Straight into a cave to show me the way (Show me the way)
That I might be saved
Now I'm turning the page
Thanks to the power of love I can love
Because I am brave

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah
I am brave

Little girl is not from the East

But I'm so crazy 'bout her
I like the way she wears her dress

Casey Jones was a mighty man, now he's resting in the Promised Land
The only thing he could understand was an eight-wheel driver under his command
He made the freight train boogie all the time
He made the freight train boogie as he rolled down the line
Woo woo, wah wah, woo woo, wah wah. Woo woo, wah wah, woo woo, wah wah
He made the freight train boogie as he rolled down the line
I'm headed for the station with my pack on my back
I'm tired of transportation in the back of a hack
I just love the rhythm of the clickity-clack
I hear the whistle blowing, see the smoke from the stack
And pal around with democratic fellas named Mac
Take me right back to the track, Jack
Choo choo, choo choo ch'boogie, woo woo, woo woo ch'boogie
Choo choo, choo choo ch'boogie, take me right back to the track, Jack
You reach your destination and alas and alack
You need some compensation to get back in the black
You take a morning paper from the top of the stack
And read the situation from the front to the back
The only job that's open needs a man with a knack
Take me right back to the track, Jack
Choo choo, choo choo ch'boogie, woo woo, woo woo ch'boogie
Choo choo, choo choo ch'boogie, take me right back to the track, Jack
Choo choo, choo choo ch'boogie, woo woo, woo woo ch'boogie
Choo choo, choo choo ch'boogie
He made the freight train boogie as he rolled down the line

[Verse 1]
I was driving across the burning desert
When I spotted six jet planes
Leaving six white vapor trails across the bleak terrain
It was the hexagram of the heavens
It was the strings of my guitar
Amelia it was just a false alarm

[Verse 2]
The drone of flying engines
Is a song so wild & blue
It scrambles time & seasons if it gets through to you
Then your life becomes a travelogue
Of picture post card charms
Oh Amelia, it was just a false alarm

[Verse 3]
People'll tell you where they've gone
They'll tell you where to go
But till you get there yourself you'll never really know
Where some have found their paradise
Other's just come to harm
Oh Amelia, it was just a false alarm

[Verse 4]
I wish that he was here tonight
It's so hard to obey
His sad request of me to kindly stay away
So this is how I hide the hurt
As the road leads cursed and charmed
I tell "Amelia, it was just a false alarm"

[Verse 5]
A ghost of aviation
She was swallowed by the sky
Or by the sea like me she had a dream to fly
Like Icarus ascending
On beautiful foolish arms
Amelia, it was just a false alarm

[Verse 6]
Maybe I've never really loved
I guess that is the truth
I've spent my whole life in clouds at icy altitude
And looking down on everything
I crashed into his arms
Amelia, it was just a false alarm

[Verse 7]
I pulled into the Cactus Tree Motel
To shower off the dust
And I slept on the strange pillows of my wanderlust
I dreamed of 747s
Over geometric farms
Dreams, Amelia
Dreams and false alarms

[Verse 1]
Everybody's looking for love, oh (woo, huh)
Ain't that the reason you're at this club? Oh (huh)
You ain't gon' find it dancing with him, no (no)
I've got a better solution for you, girl, oh (huh)

[Pre-Chorus]
Just leave with me now, say the word and we'll go (and we'll go)
I'll be your teacher, I'll show you the ropes (you the ropes)
You'll see the side of love you've never known
I can see it going down, going down

[Chorus]
In my head, I see you all over me
In my head, you fulfill my fantasy
In my head, you'll be screaming loud
In my head, it's going down
In my head, it's going down
In my head, yeah
In my head, oh, yeah, c'mon

[Bridge]
Break it down (ayo, ayo), c'mon on, let's go (ayo)
You're singing to me, baby, in my head right now
(Ayo, ayo), c'mon, yeah (ayo, ayo)
She'll be screaming out when it all goes down

[Pre-Chorus]
Just leave with me now, say the word and we'll go (and we'll go)
I'll be your teacher, I'll show you the ropes (you the ropes)
You'll see the side of love you've never known (never known)
I can see it going down, going down

[Chorus]
In my head, I see you all over me (head)
In my head, you fulfill my fantasy (head)
In my head, you'll be screaming loud (head, oh, oh)
In my head, it's going down
In my head, it's going down
In my head, I see you all over me (all over you)
In my head, you fulfill my fantasy (you do, baby)
In my head, you'll be screaming loud (oh, oh)
In my head, it's going down (in my head)
In my head, it's going down
It's going down in my head
The words I have to say
May well be simple but they're true
Until you give your love
There's nothing more that we can do

Love is the opening door
Love is what we came here for
No-one can offer you more
You know what I mean
Have your eyes really seen?

You say you find it hard
To lead the life that we once knew
But there's no other way
So now it's really up to you

Love is the key we must turn
Truth is the flame we must learn
Freedom the lesson we must learn
Do you know what I mean?
Have your eyes really seen?
Love is the key we must turn
Truth is the flame we must burn
Freedom the lesson we must learn
Do you know what I mean?
Have your eyes really seen?

You say you find it hard
To lead the life that we once knew
But there's no other way
So now it's really up to you

Love is the key we must turn
Truth is the flame we must learn
Freedom the lesson we must learn
Do you know what I mean?
Have your eyes really seen?

Love is the key we must turn
Truth is the flame we must burn
Freedom the lesson we must learn
Do you know what I mean?
Have your eyes really seen?
"F" is 4 frustration
I'm looking 4 what isn't really there
"I" is instigation
I'm listening 2 the voice beneath my hair
"N" is 4 the naked body
And 4 what my naked eye can see

CHORUS:
G-spot, G-spot
Where, oh where can U be?

"A" is 4 America
And 4 the things U read in magazines
"L" is 4 location
I am a clock, the time is 9:15
"L" is 4 the lust we share
We want 2 know that infamous pleasure

CHORUS

"Y" is 4 my yearning
I'm burning into mystery
CHORUS

G-spot {x3}

Ooh yeah
Yeah, yeah
Oh, oh Lord

Maceo, blow your horn
I don't want no trash
Gimme some of that
Popcorn

Oh God

(Hey man) Oh leave me alone, you know
(Hey man) Oh Henry, get off the phone, I gotta
(Hey man) I gotta straighten my face
This mellow thighed chick just put my spine out of place

(Hey man) My schoolday's insane
(Hey man) My work's down the drain
(Hey man) Well, she's a total blam-blam
She said she had to squeeze it but she-- and then she--

Oh don't lean on me, man, 'cause you can't afford the ticket
I'm back from Suffragette City
Oh don't lean on me, man, 'cause you ain't got time to check it
You know my Suffragette City
Is outta sight
She's alright

(Hey man) ah Henry, don't be unkind, go away

There's only room for one and here she comes, here she comes
Oh don't lean on me, man, 'cause you can't afford the ticket
I'm back on Suffragette City
Oh don't lean on me, man, 'cause you ain't got time to check it
You know my Suffragette City

Oh don't lean on me, man, 'cause you ain't got time to check it

Now I taught the weeping willow how to cry, cry, cry
I showed the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky
And the tears that I cried for that woman are gonna flood you Big River
And I'm gonna sit right here until I die

I met her accidentally in St. Paul, Minnesota
And it tore me up every time I heard her drawl, Southern drawl
Then I heard my dream was back Downstream cavortin' in Davenport
And I followed you, Big River, when you called

Then you took me to St. Louis later on, down the river
A freighter said she's been here, but she's gone, boy, she's gone
I found her trail in Memphis, but she just walked up the bluff
She raised a few eyebrows and went on down alone

Now, won't you paddle down by Baton Rouge, River Queen, rollin' on
Take that woman on down to New Orleans, New Orleans
Go on, I've had enough, dump my blues down in the gulf
She loves you, Big River, more than me

Now I taught the weeping willow how to cry, cry, cry
And I showed the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky
And the tears that I cried for that woman are gonna flood you Big River
And I'm gonna sit right here until I die
I've been here all your life
Watching your crying game
You were the heaven in my lonely world
And he was your sun and your rain

I was losing you before I ever held you tight
Before you ever held me in your arms
And I won't make you blue
And maybe an everlasting love will do

Ah, we got an everlasting love
So tall, so wide, so high above
The rumble of thunder down below
It's your love I need, it's the only show

And it's you want an everlasting dream
Can take us anywhere are the tears
Of yesterday, we killed the pain, we blew away
The memories of the tears we cried
And an everlasting love will never die
Take me out of the cold
Give me what I've hungered for
If it's the pleasure of taking my heart that you need
Then it only makes me love you more

I was yours before the stars were born and you were mine
I could have saved you all the pain you knew
And I won't make you cry
And maybe an everlasting love can try

Ah, we got an everlasting love
So tall, so wide, so high above
The rumble of thunder down below
It's your love I need, it's the only show

And it's you want an everlasting dream
Can take us anywhere are the tears
Of yesterday, we killed the pain, we blew away
The memories of the tears we cried
And an everlasting love will never die

Ah, we got an everlasting love
So tall, so wide, so high above
The rumble of thunder down below
It's your love I need, it's the only show
And it's you want an everlasting dream
Can take us anywhere are the tears
Of yesterday, we killed the pain, we blew away
The memories of the tears we cried
And an everlasting love will never die

Ah, we got an everlasting love
So tall, so wide, so high above
The rumble of thunder down below
It's your love I need, it's the only show

And it's you want an everlasting dream
Can take us anywhere are the tears
Of yesterday, we killed the pain, we blew away
The memories of the tears we cried
And an everlasting love will never die
Discovery of fire, America
The invention of the wheel, steel work and democracy
Philosophy, the Soviets and other events in history of humanity
Happened at a certain, given moment in time

Philosophy, the Soviets and other events in history of humanity
Happened at a certain, given moment in time

Won't go back to the days, couldn't even start a fire
Won't go back to the days, America'd not been discovered
The transition has been operated forever
What had gone on before from what there'd been after

Won't go back to the days, couldn't even start a fire
Won't go back to the days, America'd not been discovered
The transition has been operated forever
What had gone on before from what there'd been after
Won't go back to the days, couldn't even start a fire

As the Strippers
Flyin'  through the valley
Is that friend in memory we made
Is a true friend we have lost

We remember the king

We remember, we remember the king
We recall, we recall everything
We will treasure all of the gifts
That he did bring
We remember the king
Well, I'm all flesh and bone
Hmm, I'm a man
Cool and calm, big and strong
Hmm, I'm a man
There's so many ladies that need love
Oh, I'll do the best I can
But if the morning comes and I'm not there
Then darling please understand that
I'm a man
I'm a man, that's right I am
I'm a man
Well, feels so dirty but stays so clear
'Cause I'm the man
Yes, I am

Built to last, like a love machine
But I'm a man
I said, good or bad, right or wrong
Oh, take me as I am
But when you need somebody to scratch back at you
You'll need these helping hands
Uh, I'm a man
Uh, I'm a man
Touch my hand
Touch me
I love you baby, but God knows
Let's do that baby!!
I'm a man
Yes, I am

[Intro]
It's so hot in here

[Verse 1]
Oh, it's so hot, and I need some air
It's so hot I need some air
Just put your lips together, and blow
(Just blow)
And boy, don't stop cause I'm halfway there
It's not complicated, we're just syncopated
We can read each other's minds
One love united
Two bodies synchronizing
Don't even need to touch me
Baby, just

[Chorus]
Breathe on me
Oh baby just, breathe on me
We don't need to touch, just
Breathe
Uh, yeah

[Verse 2]
Oh, this is way beyond the physical
(Too way beyond the physical)
Tonight, my senses don't make sense at all
Our imagination, taking us to places
We have never been before
Take me in, let it out
Don't even need to touch me
Baby, just

[Chorus]
Breathe on me
Oh baby just, breathe on me
We don't need to touch, just
Breathe
Breathe on me
Oh baby just, breathe on me
We don't need to touch, just
Breathe

[Bridge]
Monogamy is the way to go
Just put your lips together and blow
Breathe, breathe, breathe...
Blow, blow, blow, blow...

[Chorus]
Breathe on me
Oh baby just, breathe on me
We don't need to touch, just
Breathe
Breathe on me
Oh baby just, breathe on me
We don't need to touch, just

[Outro]
Breathe on me
Oh baby just, breathe on me
We don't need to touch
Breathe on me
Oh baby just, breathe on me
We don't need to touch, just...
I've got a little girl
And when she holds me in her arms its out of this world
She helps keep that world
She's gotten me cryin' a valley of tears
You know who they are, because you know how I feel
You got me cryin', oh yeah, you know who you/they are

Now now you know darling, that you thrill me so
I'm telling you honey, you don't have to go
You gotten me cryin' a valley of tears
You know who they, are because you know how I feel
You gotten me cryin', oh yeah, all the way home

And now you know darling, that you thrill me so
I'm telling you honey, you don't have to go
You gotten me cryin', a valley of tears
You know who they are, because you know how I feel
You gotten me cryin', oh yeah, all the way home
Ok now everybody with me drunk as f*ck
Break it down and roll it up
Everybody got they killas with em
Rep yo' side and throw em up
Pour it up and it's goin' down
Light another blunt and it's goin' rough
Puff Puff pass you can toast yo glass
Later on we'll screw and slow it up
If you make it fast I can make it last
And I'm a nigga that's makin' cash
8 Figures in the bank and I'll pull yo rank
What you think with your hatin' ass
You think you fly I know you not
You tote your knife I tote my Glock
Big body cadillac women in the back seat
Speakers steady pumpin' as I pass these losers
Yo' car too small I can't fit my women in a PT cruiser
Get ya cake up get ya weight up way up to the top
Till you can't go further
These snitches is after my riches and yes
I smell bloody murder
When I cock back better drop that
Can't block that, lock that fools better stop that
Otherwise you can pop back
But after dumpin' a round you'll be wonderin' where the cops at? Where the cops at? Cause I'm drunk as f*ck
Tell em I'm far from sober 'cause if the po po happen to pull me oooover I'm a just tell em...

[Verse 1]
Are you missing something?
Looking for something?
Tired of everything?
Searching and struggling?
Are you worried about it?
Do you wanna talk about it?
Oh you're gonna get it right sometime

[Verse 2]
There's so much to be scared of
And not much to make sense of
Are you running in a circle?
You can't be too careful
And you can't relate it
'Cause it's complicated
Oh you're gonna get it right sometime
You're gonna get it right sometime

[Chorus]
That's how you see the world
How many times can you say
You can't believe what you heard?
That's how you see the world
Don't you worry yourself
You're not gonna get hurt
Oooh

[Verse 3]
Is there something missing?
Is nobody listening?
Are you scared of what you don't know?
Don't wanna end up on your own
You need conversation and information
Oh you're gonna get it right sometimes
You just wanna get it right sometimes

[Chorus]
That's how you see the world
How many times have you heard
But you can't believe a word?
That's how you see the world
Oh don't you worry yourself
'Cause nobody can hurt you

[Outro]
That's how you see the world
That's how you see the world
I like a new Lincoln with all of its class
I like a martini, and third on the glass
I'm gonna start living, you wait and see
Nothing but the best is good enough for me
I like to eat lobster directly from Maine
I like to see bullfights in sunny old Spain
I'm gonna start living, you wait and see
Nothing but the best is good enough for me
Talley ho, off we go, who can wait another day
You and me, out on a spree, let's get started right away
We're gonna go charlin', and have us a fling
We'll visit a palace, and dine with the king
We're gonna start living, you wait and see
Nothing but the best is good enough for me
(musical interlude)
You and me, on a spree, let's get started right away
We're a-gonna go charlin', and have us a fling
We'll visit a palace, and dine with the king
We're gonna start living, you wait and see
Nothing but the best is good enough,.
Nothing but the best is good enough for me
I may not always love you
But long as there are stars above you
You never need to doubt it
I'll make you so sure about it

God only knows what I'd be without you

If you should ever leave me
Though life would still go on, believe me
The world could show nothing to me
So what good would living do me?

God only knows what I'd be without you

And God only knows what I'd be without you

If you should ever leave me
Though life would still go on, believe me
The world could show nothing to me
So what good would living do me?
God only knows what I'd be without you

And God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows what I'd be without you
I loved you all the summer through
I thought I'd found my dream in you
For me you were the one
But that was yesterday and yesterday's gone

We walked together hand in hand
'cross miles and miles of golden sand
But now it's over and done
'cause that was yesterday and yesterday's gone

We had such happiness together
I can't believe it's gone forever
Wait 'til summer comes again
I hope that you'll remember when

Our love had just begun
I loved you yesterday and yesterday's gone

We had such happiness together
I can't believe it's gone forever
Wait 'til summer comes again
I hope that you'll remember when
Our love had just begun
I loved you yesterday and yesterday's gone

Yesterday's gone
Yesterday's gone
Yesterday's gone
The band played songs from years ago
There wasn't one we didn't know
The singer's voice was soft and low
The lights came on, we didn't know

I held your body close to mine
Your eyes were closed and so were mine
I fell in love with you once more
Just like a million times before

Then I awoke, I was alone, my dreams like you have come and gone
Tonight I'll hold you one more time, and dream your eyes are closed like mine

[Distorted Spoken Intro: Snoop Dogg]

[Verse]
Flyin' high in the friendly sky, flyin' high
Without ever leavin' the ground, no
Rest of the folks are tired and weary, oh Lord
And have laid their bodies down, yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, I go the place where danger awaits me, oh Lord
And it's bound to forsake me
So stupid-minded
I can't help it, oh yeah, so stupid-minded
But I go crazy when I can't find it
In the morning, I'll be alright, my friend
But soon the night will bring the pains
The pain, oh, the pain
Flyin' high in the friendly sky, oh
Without ever leavin' the ground, yeah, yeah
And I ain't seen nothin' but trouble, baby
Nobody really understands, no no (Help me, somebody)
And I go to the place where good feelin' awaits me
Self destruction in my hand, oh Lord
So stupid-minded (Help me, can you help me?)
Oh, and I go crazy when I can't find it
Well, I know I'm hooked, my friend
To the boy who makes slaves out of men
Oh, oh, baby, ooh
Flyin' high in a friendly sky
Oh baby, flyin', ooh ooh, wee ooh
Flyin' high in a friendly sky
There's such a high wind blowing
It's snowing in my bed
Oh baby, you started flowers growing
Where nothing grew instead
I need some things to hide the failure
Of my garden, and the way it grew
Oh baby, I didn't know I could depend on you
There's such a high wind blowing
I won't get to sleep tonight
I think that warm wind feels alright
There's such a high wind blowing
I won't get to sleep at all
I feel like I'm gonna fall
Into your fine high wind

You look like twilight falling
On the ocean in the setting sun
Oh baby, do you know what you have done
I feel like you have changed my mind
About living the way I do
Oh baby, I didn't know I could depend on you
There's such a high wind blowing
I won't get to sleep tonight
I think that warm wind feels alright
There's such a high wind blowing
I won't get to sleep at all
I feel like I'm gonna fall
Into your fine high wind

While you were gone
These spaces filled with darkness
The obvious was hid
With nothing to believe in

Solemn wings of fortune beat like rain

For good or ill again

It was twenty years ago today
Sgt. Pepper taught the band to play
They've been going in and out of style
But they're guaranteed to raise a smile

So may I introduce to you
The act you've known for all these years
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band

We're Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
We hope you will enjoy the show
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
Sit back and let the evening go

Sgt. Pepper's Lonely
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band

It's wonderful to be here
It's certainly a thrill
You're such a lovely audience
We'd like to take you home with us
We'd love to take you home
I don't really want to stop the show
But I thought that you might like to know
That the singer's going to sing a song
And he wants you all to sing along
So let me introduce to you
The one and only Billy Shears
And Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
With the departure of the Snow Goose
Fritha no longer visits the lighthouse and
Rhayader is once more alone with the
Melancholy sounds of the marshes
Angel came down from heaven yesterday
She stayed with me just long enough to rescue me
And she told me a story yesterday
About the sweet love between the moon and the deep blue sea
And then she spread her wings high over me
She said she's gonna come back tomorrow

And I said, "Fly on, my sweet angel
Fly on through the sky
Fly on, my sweet angel
Tomorrow I'm gonna be by your side"

Sure enough, this morning came unto me
Silver wings silhouetted against the child's sunrise
And my angel, she said unto me
"Today is the day for you to rise
Take my hand, you're gonna be my man
You're gonna rise"
And then she took me high over yonder

And I said, "Fly on, my sweet angel
Fly on through the sky
Fly on, my sweet angel
Forever I will be by your side"
Jojo was a man who thought he was a loner
But he knew it wouldn't last
Jojo left his home in Tucson, Arizona
For some California grass

Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back Jojo. Go home

Get back, get back
Back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back
Back to where you once belonged
Get back Jo

Sweet Loretta Martin thought she was a woman
But she was another man
All the girls around her say she's got it coming
But she gets it while she can
Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back Loretta. Go home
Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back Loretta

Your mother's waiting for you
Wearing her high-heel shoes
And her low-neck sweater
Get on home Loretta

Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged

[Thanks, Mo! ...on behalf of the group I hope we passed the audition.]

Chains of love have tied my heart to you
Chains of love have made me feel so blue
Well, now I'm just a prisoner
Tell me what are you gonna do?
Are you gonna leave me?
Are you gonna make me cry?
Are you gonna love me?
Are you gonna make me cry?
These chains of blues gonna haunt me
Until the day I die

Well, if you're gonna leave me
Please won't you set me free?
Well, if you're gonna leave me
Please won't you set me free?
I can't stay here with these chains
Unless you gonna stay right here with me

It's three o'clock in the morning, baby
And the moon is shining bright
Yes, it's three o'clock in the morning
And the moon is shining bright
I'm just sittin' here wonderin'
Where can you be tonight?

[Intro: Woman, Sample & LL Cool J]
Love is life and life is living

You are about to experience a Ignorants remix
All my love
Baby, don't go
All my love
Baby, don't go
Yeah, yeah
Baby, don't go
Baby, don't go

[Verse 1: Jennifer Lopez & LL Cool J]
It's such a shame, but I'm leaving (Uh)
Can't take the way you mistreated me (Uh)
And it's crazy, but oh, baby (Come on, yo, uh, uh, uh)
It don't matter, whatever, don't phase me
I don't believe you wanna leave like this
I don't believe I just had my last real kiss
I do believe we'll laugh and reminisce
Wait a minute, don't bounce, baby, let's talk about this, man

[Pre-Chorus: Jennifer Lopez & LL Cool J]
Well, I'm bouncing and I'm out, son (What you want, baby?)
I gotta leave you alone (Come on now)
'Cause I'm good, holding down my spot
And I'm good reppin' the girls on the block (Don't go, baby)
And I'm good, I got this thing on lock
So without me you'll be fine, right? (Come on, baby)

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez & LL Cool J]
All my pride is all I have
Pride is what you had, baby girl, I'm what you have
You'll be needing me, but too bad
Be easy, don't make decisions when you mad
The path you chose to run alone
I know you're independent, you can make it on your own
Here with me you had a home, oh, yeah
But time is of the essence, why spend it alone? Huh

[Verse 2: Jennifer Lopez & LL Cool J]
The nights I waited up for you (Oh, boy)
Promises you made about coming through
So much time you wasted
That's why I had to replace you (Uh, uh, uh)
It makes a cat nervous, the thought of settling down
Especially me, I was creepin' all over town (Creepin')
I thought my tender touch could lock you down (Yeah)
I knew I had you, as cocky as it sounds
That's the way you used to giggle right before I put it down
It's better when you angry, come here, I'll prove it now (Come here)
Stop playing (Haha, aw), you gaming
I gotta leave you alone (What you want now?)

[Pre-Chorus: Jennifer Lopez & LL Cool J]
'Cause I'm good holding my spot
Stop acting like that
And I'm good reppin' the girls on the block
Now you know you need to stop
And I'm good, I got this thing on lock
So without me you'll be fine, right?
Here we go

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez & LL Cool J]
All my pride is all I have
Pride is what you had, baby girl, I'm what you have
You'll be needing me, but too bad
Be easy, don't make decisions when you mad
The path you chose to run alone
I know you're independent, you can make it on your own
Here with me you had a home, oh, yeah
But time is of the essence, why spend it alone? Huh

[Verse 3: LL Cool J & Jennifer Lopez]
People make mistakes to make up, to break up, to wake up
Cold and lonely, chill, baby, you know me, you love me (Oh)
I'm like your homie, instead of beefin', come hold me
I promise I'm not a phony, don't bounce, baby, console me (Come here)
Ain't nothing you can say to me that
Can change my mind, I got to let you go now (Chill, baby)
And nothing will ever be the same, so just (Yeah)
Be on your way, go ahead and do your thing now (Baby, don't go)
And there's no more to explain to me, you know (Come on, now)
I know your game and I'm feeling what you do (Come on, now)
So I'm bouncing and I'm out, son (Don't bounce)
I gotta leave you alone, yeah, yeah (Don't bounce, don't bounce, baby)

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez & LL Cool J]
All my pride is all I have (Don't bounce, baby)
Pride is what you had, baby girl, I'm what you have
You'll be needing me, but too bad (Don't bounce, baby)
Be easy, don't make decisions when you mad (Uh)
The path you chose to run alone
I know you're independent, you can make it on your own
Here with me you had a home, oh, yeah
But time is of the essence, why spend it alone? Huh
All my pride is all I have (Don't bounce, baby)
Pride is what you had, baby girl, I'm what you have (Baby, don't go)
You'll be needing me, but too bad (You're everything to me)
Be easy, don't make decisions when you mad (You mean everything to me, baby)
The path you chose to run alone
I know you're independent, you can make it on your own (We all make mistakes, you know what I'm sayin'?)
Here with me you had a home, oh, yeah (I still love you, baby)
But time is of the essence, why spend it alone? Huh (I'll always love you, baby)

[Outro: LL Cool J]
I promise you
You know what I'm sayin'?
You must leave now, take what you need, you think will last
But whatever you wish to keep, you better grab it fast
Yonder stands your orphan with his gun
Crying like a fire in the sun

Look out, all those saints are coming through
And it's all over now, Baby Blue
And it's all over now, Baby Blue

The highway is for gamblers, you better use your sense
Take what you have gathered from coincidence
The empty handed painter from your streets
Is drawing crazy patterns on your sheets

The sky, too, is folding under you
And it's all over now, Baby Blue

All your seasick sailors, they are rowing home
All your empty-handed armies are all going home
Your lover who has just walked out your door
Has taken all his blankets from the floor
The carpet, too, is moving under you
And it's all over now, Baby Blue

Leave your stepping stones behind, there's something calls for you
Forget about the dead you've left, they will not follow you
The vagabond who's rapping at your door
Is standing in the clothes that you once wore

Strike another match, go start anew
And it's all over now, Baby Blue
And it's all over now, Baby Blue
And it's all over now, Baby Blue

Now you know the world's all in a tangle man
Everybody begin to sing this song
The Reds are just over yonder boys
And we ain't gonna be here long

That's why I'm gonna build myself a cave
Move down in the ground
When I go into the army babe
Won't be no more Reds around

Now you know I got my personary man 

[note: best translation]
I've got my class cattoo 

[note: best translation]
I begin to feel so worried
I just don't know what to do

That's why I'm gonna build myself a cave
Move down in the ground
When I go into the army babe
Won't be no more Reds around me
Now you know the world's all in a tangle man
Everybody begin to sing this song
The Reds are just over yonder boys
And we ain't gonna be here long

That's why I'm gonna build myself a cave
Move down in the ground
When I go into the army babe
Won't be no more Reds around me

[Verse 1: Wanya Morris, Shawn Stockman]
I've been thinking of you
And I've been trying to figure out
What you remind me of
'Cause you are nothing like I've ever known

Are you an angel
Sent to me feeling so unreal
Must be heavenly, it's a mystery
And it hit me, that you remind me of the perfect words

[Pre-Chorus: Boyz II Men]
The perfect words written by your favorite singer
The type of song that you turn into an ringtone
I get this feeling every time I think of you
And I know, you're the perfect love song

[Chorus: Boyz II Men]
Ronald Isley, Babyface, Jodeci, and Marvin Gaye
Made melodies that can't be replaced
But you, you're the perfect love song
Joe, R. Kelly, Mary J., Faith, Mariah, and Sade
Made the Whole world sing many times, many ways
But you are, you're the perfect love song

[Verse 2: Nathan Morris, Boyz II Men]
Your voice is soothing to me
Like the strings of a guitar (Like the strings)
It takes me right back to the beginning
And I fall in love all over
You never, never ask for nothing
That's why I wanna give you everything
That's why I sing, the joy you bring
It's worth more than the perfect love words

[Pre-Chorus: Boyz II Men]
The perfect words written by your favorite singer
The type of song that you turn into an ringtone
I get this feeling every time I think of you
And now I know, you're the perfect love song

[Chorus: Boyz II Men]
Joe, R. Kelly, Mary J., Faith, Mariah, and Sade
Made the Whole world sing many times, many ways
But you are, you're the perfect love song

[Bridge: Boyz II Men]
Every time I'm with you
I get inspired to be a better man
Your love is timeless, it lasts forever
Like the perfect love song

[Chorus: Boyz II Men]
Ronald Isley, Babyface, Jodeci, and Marvin Gaye
Made melodies that won't be replaced
But you are, you're the perfect love song
Oh, Usher, Brandy, and BeyoncÃ©
(Faith, Mariah, and Sade)
Voices sound so heavenly
Made the whole world sing many times, many ways
But you are the perfect love song
Ronald Isley, Babyface (Oh, Babyface), Jodeci, and Marvin Gaye
Made melodies that can't be replaced
But you are, you're the perfect love song
Joe, R. Kelly, Mary J., Faith, Mariah, and Sade
Made the Whole world sing many times, many ways
But you are, you're the perfect love song

[Outro: Boyz II Men]
You are the perfect words written by your favorite singer
(Whoa, oh oh oh oh, you are)
The type of song that you turn into a ringtone
Everyone knows the best Dead is live

The Grateful Dead: a two record set, recorded live at Winterland, Manhattan Center and the late, lamented Fillmore East; on Warner Brothers' Records

I had a hard run
Running from your window
I was all night running, running
Lord, I wonder if you care?

Go
Go, Johnny, go, go
Go, Johnny, go, go
Go, Johnny, go, go
Go, Johnny, go, go
Go, Johnny B. Goode

The Grateful Dead on Warner Brothers' Records

Good enough for me and Bobby McGee, yeah-hah
Yo, I knew it, I knew it, this tape was the dopest thing I eva' heard in my mothefuckin life. This boy Ice-T ain't no joke, that's my nigga right there, boy. I'm telling you, man, I love this stuff. "POWER POWER, woo woo woo woo!" Oh, my man, gotta goin' on man, word man I'm out of he...Oh, man, homeboy still bleeding, i forgot all about homeboy! Oh man, let me... Oh shit, oh wait a minute, he still breathing, I'm gonna call the paramedics man, let me call the... Well on second thought... Lemme jam this tape just one more time...
There was a howl that night
A howling like they never heard before
A cry so loud old granddad almost hit the door
He said, "I love this child as much as any one that she ever bore
But I thank the Lord we won't be having any more."
Then the baby heard the sweetest sound he'd ever heard
In tones so beautiful he hung on every word
She sang, "Hush, my love, granny's little dove is going to take to the sky."
It was on such a night he learned to fly like a bird
Now the years have passed and memories come and go
He hears that voice that rocked him gently so
A calm will descend and there's peace at the end of the darkest night
Sometimes I cry, sometimes I fly like a bird
Now the years have passed and memories come and go
He hears that voice that rocked him gently so
Well, the rain's gonna fall and the wind my blow in the darkest night
Sometimes I cry, sometimes I fly like a bird
A calm will descend and there's peace at the end of the darkest night
Sometimes I cry, sometimes I fly like a bird
Spoken:
Shoot down some of those airplanes your flyin'
Specially the ones that are flyin' too low (x2)
Come on back up to earth my friend
Come on back up with me
We've all been up through the night time, baby
Now let's read the rays of the ? ? ?
With the power of soul
Anything is possible (x2)
Flyin' too much today
It's so groovy to float around sometimes
Even a jellyfish will agree to that
Yeah, but that old jellyfish
Been floatin' around so long
Lord, he ain't got a bone
In his jelly back
Floatin' everyday and every night
Ridin' high is a risk
Sometimes the wind ain't right
With the power of soul
Anything is possible
With the power of you
Anything you wanna do

One more lonely night
Just one more lonely night
She doesn't like sleeping alone

You may come home one morning
And find she's not sleeping alone
Oh, then baby you'll see
Oh yes, you should have stayed at home
Because

One more lonely night
Just one more lonely night
She doesn't like sleeping alone
Just one more lonely night
Just one more lonely night
Oh, wouldn't you like to be the one
Holding her tight

If you want her, better get her now
Or she'll be running away somehow
Oh, it's not for me to say
If she'll be happy some other way
Because
One more lonely night
Just one more lonely night
She doesn't like sleeping alone
Oh, One more lonely night
Just one more lonely night
Oh, wouldn't you like to be the one
Holding her tight
Don't be a fool

Just one more lonely night
Oh, One lonely night
Wouldn't you like to be the one
Holding her tight
Don't be a fool

Just one more lonely night
Just one more lonely night
Oh, wouldn't you like to be the one
Holding her tight
Everybody's building the big ships and the boats
Some are building monuments, others jotting down notes
Everybody's in despair, every girl and boy
But when Quinn the Eskimo gets here everybody's gonna jump for joy

Come all without, come all within
You'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn

Now I like to do just like the rest, I like my sugar sweet
But guarding fumes and making haste, it ain't my cup of meat
Everybody's just standing around 'neath the trees
Feeding pigeons on a limb
But when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, all the pigeons gonna run to him

Come all without, come all within
You'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn

A cat's meow and a cow's moo, I can't recite 'em all
Just tell me where it hurts and I'll tell you who to call
Nobody can get any sleep, there's someone on everybody's toes
But when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, everybody's gonna wanna doze
Come all without, come all within
You'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn
Come all without, come all within
You'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn

The moon in all it's splendor
Your kiss so very tender
The words will you surrender to me...marie
Goodbye Mary
Goodbye Mary

Memory of a friend
Memory I need to embrace
Fallen out
Fallen out
Fallen out
Of our time and space
Memory
Of a friend
Memory

All the aches, pains and the joys
Of growing up beside you
Dancing a spontaneous
A dance with you
Your spirit lives
As you have spread the seed
Of love
Love of life
Dark and bright
Love of life
Loved to laugh
Love of life
Dark and bright
Dark and bright

It took years to intimate (I remember)
But finally love found its way (I remember)
Unimpeded it could exist (A victory)
So fun, so free

Love of life
Dark and bright
Love of life
Loved to laugh
Love of life
Dark and bright
Dark and bright

It took years to intimate (I remember)
But finally love found its way (I remember)
Unimpeded it could exist (A victory)
So fun, so free
As much
As I don't want
I have to say goodbye

You
Will
Sing
For
Ever
Like
An
Angel
Who
Flew away

[Verse 1]
She's so tired of this
So tired of that
Sometimes I don't see why
She'd go out of her way
To mess up your day
So what's the use in trying

To get along with her
It's all wrong for her
What more can you do
She just wants to fight
She likes to keep you uptight
And its just too bad for you

But the only thing is
She can take care of business
Like no woman you've ever seen
Then without thinking twice
She can make it so nice
Like no place that you've ever been

[Chorus]
She got the smile
She got the pretty face
She keeps her pretty things on my mind
She got the moves
She got the grooves
She got the.. moves.. yeah..yeah..yeah

[Verse 2]
Oh the pains are here
The pains are there
She may not see tomorrow
She just can't go on
She's as good as gone
And her love may die of sorrow

But the only thing is
She can take care of business
Like no woman you've ever seen
Then without thinking twice
She can make it so nice
Like no place that you've ever been

[Chorus]
She got the smile
She got the pretty face
She keeps the pretty things on my mind
She got the moves
She got the grooves
She got the moves.. yeah.. yeah.. yeah
I may not always love you
But long as there are stars above you
You never need to doubt it
I'll make you so sure about it

God only knows what I'd be without you

If you should ever leave me
Though life would still go on, believe me
The world could show nothing to me
So what good would living do me?

God only knows what I'd be without you

And God only knows what I'd be without you

If you should ever leave me
Though life would still go on, believe me
The world could show nothing to me
So what good would living do me?
God only knows what I'd be without you

And God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows what I'd be without you
I love my woman, no Im tell you the truth
But I ain't gonna put up with the way she do
My gal doing something that I know it won't work
Me and her one just might get hurt

Shes evil mother fuyer dont you know
Hmmm, a bad mother fuyer dont you know
But Im a rotten mother fuyer
I ain't gonna tell you no lie

Say I dont love my woman tell ya the reason why
She fill my pants full of red devil lye

I was a hot mother fuyer dont you know
Hmmm a burnn mother fuyer dont you know

My gramma told grandpa last year

Your stiff mother fuyer dont you know
Worn out mother fuyer dont you know
You a funky mother fuyer

The monkey and the baboon were playing 7up
The monkey won the money but scared to pick it up
The monkey stumbled and the baboon fell
The monkey grabbed the money and he ran like

He was a runn mother fuyer dont you know
A trukn mother fuyer dont you know
Hes roegish mother fuyer
No I ain't gonna tell you know lie
(feat. Akon)

New York City
All in Los Angeles California
From the drive lanes to the open seas baby
To all my beautiful ladies

[Akon]
(I see)
The first thing I noticed when I walked in the club girl was you watching me (me, me, me)
Then I started walking to here when I lost her in the crown, where could she be? (be, be, be)
You got me in the middle of the dance floor, just searching for you girl
I'm steady looking for you baby
I ask my myself where you created in this world, by the beauty in you girl
And I can't believe that you got me

[Chorus: Akon]
You got me so, you got me so
You got me so high and confused
I don't know what to do
So, you got me so
You got me so high and confused
I don't know what to do

[T-Pain]
Now you got me all in the club like I ain't got none better to do than look for you (you, you)
Yeah
'Cause I'll be all night searching, do what I gotta do till I find you (you, you)

You got me in the middle of the dance floor, just searching for you girl
(I said I'm searching for you girl)
You got me sweating, got me weak in the knee
'Cause I've been working for you girl
It's so hard because I'm so...

[Chorus: Akon & T-Pain]
You got me so, you got me so
You got me so high and confused (so high and confused)
I don't know what to do (don't know what to do)

So, you got me so
You got me so high and confused
I don't know what to do (don't know what to do)

[Akon]
Now I'm looking in the back while I'm looking in the front
While I'm standing in the middle like where are you? (Are you, are you)
I couldn't sworn that she walked right past me baby
Make her sip on jack and tack
And the blunt got me looking at ladies, where are you? (Are you)
I couldn't sworn that she look right at me
'Cause I'm looking for you
You got me in the middle of the dance floor, just searching for you girl
And I'm tryna find you baby
I ask my myself where you created in this world, by the beauty in you girl
The beauty got me going crazy
Come on and find me

[Chorus: Akon]
You got me so, you got me so
You got me so high and confused
I don't know what to do

So, you got me so
You got me so high and confused
I don't know what to do

Don't know if I can go on through this night without you
The desert is growing
The wars are threatening
Where's the place in your face?
Where's the place on your plate?
Consumorphic morality
Privatize, desensitize
Hey big fish in the lake
Hey all the small ones now "explain"
Hey big fish in the lake
Hey all the small ones now "explain"
Hey big fish in the lake
What good is all this knowledge we've acquired
In the face of deep realism
After this affront isn't what we choose
Regression into Spartan rule
We can learn to respect each other
And nature govern "all it widest can"
Where's the place in your face?
Such a dim conformity
Where's the place on your plate?
Consumorphic morality
The desert is growing
The wars are threatening
Hey big fish in the lake
I'm a ramblin' pony
Rollin' from town to town
I'm a ramblin' pony
Rollin' from town to town
I'm a looking for a sweet woman - make my love come down

She's a marriied woman, yeah
Only nine years old
She's a marriied woman, yeah
Only nine years old
I got a woman I'm loving - keeps me fishin' all day long

Now, I'm, thinking this old feeling
Crossing this countryside
Now, I'm, thinking this old feeling
Crossing the countryside
I've got a lover now - she won't let old Greeny ride

Now, I'm leaving this morning won't be back no more
Now, I'm leaving this morning won't be back no more
There ain't a rider in the city - keep me inside the door

[Chorus]
No more water in the well, no more (No more, no more, no more)
No more water in the well, baby no more (No more, no more, no more)

[Verse 1]
You take my love for granted
Like water, water you spill and you waste
Though love is thicker than water
It spills quicker than water
And you'll lookup one of these days

[Chorus]
And there'll be no more water in the well, baby no more  (No more, no more, no more)
No more water in the well, baby no more (No more, no more, no more)
This is the day you better pray on me
You won't have a leg to stand on baby

[Verse 2]
How long do you think my love can last?
Through sorrow pain and mistrust?
Today my love is strong
But keep doing me wrong
And tomorrow it may turn to dust

[Chorus]
And there'll be no more water in the well, baby no more  (No more, no more, no more)
No more water in the well, baby no more (No more) hear what I say no more
This is the day you better pray on me
You won't have a leg to stand on baby
There'll be no more water in the well, baby no more  (No more, no more, no more)
No more water in the well, baby no more (No more, no more, no more)

[Verse 3]
You take advantage of me 'cause I need you
I can't make you change though I tried
One day you just may be that you need me
And you'll be the one denied

[Chorus]
'Cause there'll be no more water in the well, baby no more  (No more, no more, no more)
No more water in the well, baby no more (No more, no more, no more) no more
This is the day you better pray on me
You won't have a leg to stand on baby
There'll be no more water in the well, baby no more (No more, no more, no more)
No more water in the well, baby no more (No more, no more, no more)

[Verse 1]
Raving and drooling, I fell on his neck with a scream
He had a whole lot of terminal shock in his eye

[Verse 2]
That's what you get for pretending the rest are not real
Babbling and snapping at far away flies
He will zig zag his way back through memories of boredom and pain

[Verse 3]
How does it feel to be empty and angry and spaced
Split up the middle between the illusion of safety in numbers
And the fist in your face
Many ways of interpretation, to a problem there's not one solution
The light is comatose, or shines through and from above
This side is too morose, while the other explodes

Plus?
Au dela de la pensee, l

Ariale's not one solution

There was a little girl I planned to marry
If this was my love I didn't want to share
I thought that love would make my life bright and sunny
But she said she could not love me 'cause I didn't have no money

Every day I have to cry so
Drying the water from my eyes so
Till the clouds slowly pass by (?)
Every day I have to cry

I got me a girl
I guess I really love her
'cause every night I've been thinking over
But you can't live all your love this morning
But if you do it's gonna hurt somebody
Every day I have to cry so
Drying the water from my eyes so
Till the clouds slowly pass by (?)
Every day I have to cry

I thought I know she's just a woggle (?)
If she found a love because she's not a rich girl (?)
But every time you reach love this morning (?)
Every time it's gonna hurt somebody
Every day I have to cry so
Drying the water from my eyes so
Till the clouds slowly pass by (?)
Every day I have to cry

[Verse 1]
When I first saw your gallery, I liked the ones of ladies
Then you began to hang up me, you studied to portray me
In ice and greens and old blue jeans and naked in the roses
Then you got into funny scenes that all your work discloses

[Chorus 1]
"Lady, don't love me now I am dead
I am a saint, turn down your bed
I have no heart," that's what you said
You said, "I can be cruel, but let me be gentle with you"

[Verse 2]
Somewhere in a magazine I found a page about you
I see that now it's Josephine who cannot be without you
I keep your house in fit repair, I dust the portraits daily
Your mail comes here from everywhere, the writing looks like ladies'

[Chorus 2]
"Lady, please love me now, I am dead
I am a saint, turn down your bed
I have no heart," that's what you said
You said, "I can be cruel, but let me be gentle with you"

[Verse 3]
I gave you all my pretty years, then we began to weather
And I was left to winter here while you went west for pleasure
And now you're flying back this way like some lost homing pigeon
They've monitored your brain, you say, and changed you with religion

[Chorus 3]
"Lady, please love me now I was dead
I am no saint, turn down your bed
Lady, have you no heart," that's what you said
Well, I can be cruel, but let me be gentle with you

[Outro]
When I first saw your gallery, I liked the ones of ladies
But now their faces follow me and all their eyes look shady
Stargazer, you with your head in the heavens
You'll never get by, walking that high off the ground
Hey, moon dreamer, I've been around and I see it
That higher you get, the harder they let you down

You pay your dues, it seems forever
And if you're clever
You may be in for a while
Then you're out of style

Hey, stargazer, probably think I'm crazy
And you haven't heard one single word I said
No I don't want to burst your bubble
But you got trouble

Don't you know the higher the top
The longer the drop
Hey, stargazer
(Jump on it, Sam, get all over that thing)

No I don't want to burst your bubble
But you got trouble
Don't you know the higher the top
The longer the drop
Hey, stargazer, stargazer, stargazer, stargazer
You moon dreamer, you moon dreamer

[Chorus]
I wonder if I care as much
As I did before

[Verse 1]
Last night I cried myself to sleep
For the one that makes me weep
I dried my eyes to greet the day
And wondered why I had to pay
The tears that I have shed by day
Give relief and wash away
The memory of the night before
I wonder if I'll suffer more

[Chorus]
I wonder if I care as much
As I did before

[Verse 2]
My pride is made to say forgive
And take the blame for what you did
It's your mistakes I'm thinkin' of
I wonder if I'm still in love
My heart can't thrive on misery
My life it has no destiny
When things get more than I can bear
I ask myself "Do I still care?"

[Chorus]
I wonder if I care as much
As I did before
As I strolled out one evening within a small cafe
A forty year old waitress to me these words did say
I see that you are a logger and not just a common bum
Because no one but a logger stirs his coffee with his thumb
My lover was a logger but not like none today
If you'd pour whiskey on it he'd eat a bale of hay
My lover came to see me upon one freezing day
He held me in a fond embrace which broke three vertebrae
Well he kissed me when we parted so hard that he broke my jaw
I could not speak to tell him that he forgot his mackinaw
I saw my logger leaving sauntering through the snow
Going bravely homeward at forty eight below
The weather it tried to freeze him It tried its very best
At a hundred degrees below zero he buttoned up his vest
It froze clear down to china It froze the stars above
At a gazillion degrees below zero It froze her logger love
And so I lost my lover And to this cafe I come
And here I wait till someone Stirs his coffee with his thum

[Intro]
Are you ready kids?
Aye, aye, captain!
I can't hear you!
Aye, aye, captain!
Ha ha ha
(Ohh!)

[Verse]
Who lives in a pineapple under the sea?
(SpongeBob SquarePants!)
Absorbent and yellow and porous is he!
(SpongeBob SquarePants!)
Now, if nautical nonsense be something you wish!
(SpongeBob SquarePants!)
Then drop on the deck and flop like a fish!
(SpongeBob SquarePants!)
Oh, SpongeBob (SquarePants)
Oh, come on, SpongeBob (SquarePants)
Everybody!
SpongeBob SquarePants
SpongeBob SquarePants!

[Outro]
Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha!

[Verse 1]
Marcie in a coat of flowers stops inside a candy store
Reds are sweet and greens are sour, still no letter at her door
So she'll wash her flower curtains, hang them in the wind to dry
Dust her tables with his shirt and wave another day goodbye

[Verse 2]
Marcie's faucet needs a plumber, Marcie's sorrow needs a man
Red is autumn green is summer, greens are turning and the sand
All along the ocean beaches stares up empty at the sky
Marcie buys a bag of peaches, stops a postman passing by

[Chorus 1]
And summer goes, falls to the sidewalk
Like string and brown paper
Winter blows up from the river
There's no one to take her to the sea

[Verse 3]
Marcie dresses warm, it's snowing, takes a yellow cab uptown
Red is stop and green's for going, sees a show and rides back down
Down along the Hudson River, past the shipyards in the cold
Still no letter's been delivered, still the winter days unfold

[Chorus 2]
Like magazines fading in dusty grey attics
And cellars
Make a dream, dream back to summer
And hear how he tells her wait for me

[Verse 4]
Marcie leaves and doesn't tell us where or why she moved away
Red is angry, green is jealous, that was all she had to say
Someone thought they saw her Sunday, window shopping in the rain
Someone heard she bought a one-way ticket and went west again
Ow! Oh oh oh oh oh!
Ooo whoooooa! Come on!
Listen Girl!

Drop yo clothes, on da floor!
And close da door, ya know da score! Yeah!
Don't be shy, fantasize! (All night!)
And just enjoy, my nasty ri e-i e-i ide!

(Chorus)
Get horny! get horny!

Get horny! get horny!

Get horny! get horny!

Get horny! get horny!

Get horny! get horny!

(Rap)
Ya want a freak? A freak like me

Come get a move on, baby get cha groove on

So if ya with it and ya know ya want me

(Bridge)

(Cause she knows, I goes for mine)

[Verse 1]
Lazy lightin', sleepy fire in your eyes
It's like desire in disguise
I keep on tryin' but I
I can't get through

Lazy lightin', I'd like to find the proper potion
That's gonna capture your emotion
You're right beside me but I
I can't get through

[Chorus]
You're a loop of lazy lightin'
Just a loop of lazy lightnin'
Must admit you're kinda frightenin'
But you really get me high

[Verse 2]
So exciting
When I hear your velvet thunder
You seem so near I start to wonder
Would you come closer if I
If I asked you to?
So inviting, the way you're messing with my reason
It's an exception but it's pleasing
Tell me a lie and I will swear
I'll swear it's true

{Chorus]
You're a loop of lazy lightin'
Just a loop of lazy lightnin'
Must admit you're kinda frightenin'
Just a loop of lazy lightnin'

[Bridge]
Rope of fire 'round my heart (lightin')
Rope of fire ever tightnin' (lightnin')
Rope of fire 'round my heart (lightnin')
Well come on lazy lightnin'
Just a loop of lazy lightnin'

[Verse 3]
Misty lightnin'
Well, you always electrify me
Someday I know you'll satisfy me
And all that lightnin' will be my lightnin' too
My lightnin' too (my lightnin' too)

[Outro]
Just a loop of lazy lightnin' (my lightnin' too)
My lightnin' too (my lightnin' too)
Just a loop of lazy lightnin' (y lightnin' too)
My lightnin' too (my lightnin' too)
Oh come on lazy lightnin' (my lightnin' too)
If we just try
We can put it back together, you and I
And all the bad is blown away
I never said goodbye
It's the writing on the wall that makes you see
And it's the saviour of my soul
And what I say that must be heard
With love in every word

Close your eyes, don't let go
Don't get lost in the falling snow
Always out of place alone
With someone you're not sure of
Broken wings, don't arrive
It's a storm but you still survive
Gonna take a miracle
So I go around believing you
Say goodnight, stay forever and
Nobody knows how much
I pray for you at night
And miracles happen...
Yesterday
There was nothing in my life worth living for

You were there when I was born
The very strength to carry on
A miracle has come

Hold on tight, call my name
Don't get caught in the midnight rain
Part of me believes in you
You're someone I'm not sure of
Don't look down, I'll be there
Like the wind in the cold night air
I can see a miracle
And through it all we rise and fall
Tear it apart and stay forever
I know where heaven is
And somewhere in-between
Miracles happen

Red, blue, black and white
True light, shine on anyone
Two hearts make it right
And all that love can change

Close my eyes, don't let go
I'll be lost in the falling snow
Always out of place alone
With someone I'm not sure of
Don't look down, I'll be there
Like the wind in the cold night air
I can see a miracle
And through it all we rise and fall
We tear it apart, stay forever
I know where heaven is
And somewhere in-between
Miracles happen
Hold on tight, call my name
Don't get caught in the midnight rain
Part of me believes in you
You're someone I'm not sure of
Don't look down, I'll be there
Like the wind in the cold night air
I can see a miracle...
I've got sunshine on a cloudy day
When it's cold outside
I've got the month of May
I guess you'd say
What can make me feel this way?
My girl
(My girl, my girl)
Talkin' 'bout my girl
(My girl)
I've got so much honey
The bees envy me
I've got a sweeter song
Than the birds in the trees
Well, I guess you'd say
What can make me feel this way?
My girl
(My girl, my girl)
Talkin' 'bout my girl
(My girl)

[Chorus]
I got a fresh line up, fresh outfit
'Bout to have the parking lot on smash
Plus I got a Chevy with a 4-54 in the hood that bitch got 1-25 in the dash
(She like a gangsta cause)
I'm the biggest boss that ya seen thus far
I'm the biggest boss that ya seen thus far
I'm the biggest boss that ya seen thus far
Cause it's just another day in the life of a God damn boss

I don't make love baby we make magic
Come home with a thug, let's get shit crackin'
Always wear plastic baby cause shit happens
She leaves the backseat just to freak in the magnum
Hopped out the magnum hopped in the tray
Just to let the top back and thank God for the day
Who gives a fuck what a hater gotta say?
I made a couple million dollars last year dealin' weight
Still in the streets strapped with them thangs
She in love with a G so she tatted my name (Ross!)
I'm the biggest boss that ya seen thus far
Ten black maybacks back to back in a lane
I'm a make it rain then I'm a make it back
You are just a lame lil' homie that's a fact
Workin' with the police actin' like ya know me
Fresh outta jail already in ya hoe's sheets

[Chorus]
The boss, boss, boss, the boss

Shawty straight diggin' me and I ain't even rich
I know you niggas on the sideline like ain't that a bitch
I'm on my job and I ain't gettin' off
Cause it's just another day in the life of the goddamn boss

[Verse 2]
I'm the biggest boss that you seen thus far
Got the biggest car Spanish broads no bra
Callin' otha lames for the walks in the park
I ain't come to play games I just wanna play my part
Tell ya girlfriend to come talk with my dawg
We straight G's and we came here to ball
Bottle after bottle and I'm sure you count em all
Then we off to the Chevy fire it up and takin' off
Baby slow it down cause you movin' to fast
Ya ass too fine to be movin' too fast
Back to the thuggin' now I'm sippin' sy-z-urp
All my niggas love it baby that's my w-is-ord
Stack for the jeans five bones for the sh-is-irt
I don't smoke 28? 800 for the?
I'm the biggest boss that you seen thus far
You can tell by the shon's that's standin' by the car

[Chorus]
Ay, yea, yea, yea, yea, yea, yea, ay
Ay, uh huh, yea, uh huh, yea, yea, yea
I'm the biggest boss that ya seen thus far
You can live your own life, and I'll live mine - I will never try to keep you down;
And even if I only see you some of the time, I'm just happy when you come around...
And even if the sun don't shine
I'm warm enough when you're in these arms of mine...

Just as long as we're together, everything's alright, (Everything's alright...)
Everything's alright... (Everything's alright...) Oh!

There is nothing that will overcome the love we share, nothing that will break us apart;
Girl, I got to always have you in my hair, got to always have you in my heart...
Ooh, baby, your place or mine?
I'll get the music, baby, you bring the wine...

Just as long as we're together...
(Just as long as we're together...) Oh, girl, there ain't nothin' better...
Just as long as we're together, everything's alright, (Everything's alright...)
Everything's alright... (Everything's alright...) Oh!

Just as long as there is you
I'll be around doin' what you what me to...
Just as long as there is me
I'll be around to sing you a melody, sugar...
Just as long as we're together (everything's alright)
Oh, baby, everything's alright...
Just as long as we're together (everything's alright)
Ooh, girl, everything's alright...
Just as long as we're together (everything's alright)
Ooh, girl, everything's alright...
Don't you know there ain't better? (everything's alright)
Really want you, baby, in my life, you know...
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!
Blue decorations on my Christmas tree
The saddest time of the year
'Cause you're not here with me
But I hung you a stocking, just in case you're free
Blue decorations on my Christmas tree

You know the spirit of Christmas
Is so hard to share alone
When you once have it all
But now all you had is gone

All the children are singing
The saddest melodies
Blue decorations on my Christmas tree
Ho, ho, ho, I don't feel Christmas

They call it a holiday
But they all are the same to me
Like these blue decorations on my Christmas tree

The forecast is cloudy
Buffing, sad and cold
And the weatherman says
We gonna get some snow
I guess I'll open my presents
To me, from me
Make these blue decorations on my Christmas tree
Ho, ho, ho, oh, I don't feel Christmas
Ah, Kansas City
Coming to get my baby back home
Yeah, yeah
I'm gonna Kansas city
Coming to get my baby back home
Yeah, yeah
Well, it's a long, long, time
Since my baby's been gone

Ah, Kansas City
Coming to get my baby on time
Yeah, yeah
I'm gonna Kansas City
Coming to get my baby on time
Yeah, yeah
It's just a one, two, three, four
Five, six, seven, eight, nine, wah

Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, baby, you're no clown
I say you're no clown
Now, now, now, now
Tell me baby
What's been wrong with you
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, baby, you're no clown
I say you're no clown
Now, now, now, now
Tell me baby
What's been wrong with you

Well, I'll say bye
Bye, bye, baby bye, bye
Oh, so long
Bye, bye, baby I'm gone
Yeah, I said
Bye, bye, baby, bye, bye
Bye, bye, bye, bye

Well, I'll say bye
Bye, bye, baby bye, bye
Oh, so long
Bye, bye, baby I'm gone
Yeah, I said
Bye, bye, baby, bye, bye
Bye, bye, bye, bye
Baby, won't you please come home
'Cause your daddy's all alone
I have tried in vain
Never no more to call your name

When you left you broke my heart
Because I never thought we'd part
Every hour in the day, you will hear me say
"Baby, come home."

Baby, won't you please come home
Because your daddy's so alone
I have tried in vain
Never no more to call your name

When you left you broke my heart
Because I never thought we'd part
Every hour in the day, you will hear me say
"Baby, come home."

Daddy needs baby
Baby, won't you please come home

[Verse 1: Eddie Kendricks]
Girl, as you walk by, I breathe a sigh
And deep inside I knew it had to be
This little girl is mine
And for a little while I heard a strange rhapsody
Mhm

[Chorus: Eddie Kendricks & The Temptations]
So lovely and so fair (Fair)
I knew right then and there (There)
That you were made for me
And it wasn't hard to see
I guess I was born to love you (Born to love you)
Born to love you (Born to love you)
Mhm (Born to love you)
Honey I, I was born to love you
Give my love to no one but you

[Bridge: David Ruffin & (The Temptations)]
Here stands a man, with his future in your hands
Don't let go (Don't let go)
Don't let go (Don't let go)
Baby, don't let it go (Don't let go)
Please (Don't let go)

[Verse 2: Eddie Kendricks]
You better come on and take my hand
'Cause I don't understand this crazy feeling in my soul
But I know that I would rather die, than let this feeling go
Now girl can't you see (See)
That this was meant to be (Be)
It's funny but it's true
I guess I was just born to love you (Born to love you)

[Outro: Eddie Kendricks, David Ruffin, (The Temptations)]
Darling... (Born to love you)
Darling I... (Born to love you)
I was born... (Born to love you)
Born to love only you (Born to love you)
Why don't you believe... (Born to love you)
Believe what I tell you, baby (Born to love you)
I was born to love only you (Born to love you)
(Born to love you)
Darling... (Born to love you)
I... (Born to love you)
Oh, our love is true (Born to love you)
Ten years ago on a cold dark night
Someone was killed 'neath the town hall lights
There were few at the scene, but they all agreed
That the slayer who ran looked a lot like me

She walks these hills, in a long black veil
She visits my grave, when the night winds vail
Nobody knows, nobody sees
Nobody knows, but me

Now the schaffold is high, and eternity's near
She stood in the crowd and shed not a tear
But some times at night, when the cold wind moans
In a long black veil, she cries over my bones

She walks these hills, in a long black veil
She visits my grave, when the night winds vail
Nobody knows, nobody sees
Nobody knows, but me

The judge said, "Son, what is your alibi
If you were somewhere else, then you won't have to die"
I spoke not a word, though it ment my life
I'd been in the arms of my best friends wife
She walks these hills, in a long black veil
She visits my grave, when the night winds vail
Nobody knows, nobody sees
Nobody knows, but me

[Verse 1]
If you're feeling sad and lonely
There's a service I can render
Tell the one who loves you only
I can be so warm and tender

[Chorus]
Call me don't be afraid, you can
Call me baby it's late but just
Call me tell me and I'll be around

[Verse 2]
When it seems your friends desert you
There's somebody's thinkin' of you
I'm the one who never hurt you
Baby that's because I love you

[Chorus]
Call me don't be afraid, you can
Call me baby it's late but just
Call me tell me and I'll be around

[Bridge]
Now don't forget me
Because If you left me
I will always stay by you
You've got to trust me
That's how it must be
There's so much that I can do

[Verse 3]
If you call I'll be right with you
You and I should be together
Take this love I long to give you
I'll be at your side forever

[Chorus]
Call me don't be afraid, you can
Call me baby it's late but just
Call me tell me and I'll be around

Call me don't be afraid, you can
Call me baby it's late but just
Call me tell me and I'll be around

[TT:] Ooo here I am alone, thinkin' aimlessly
Seein' other girls in love & wishin' it were me
If I could only find the key & make love come my way
I would trade this loneliness for true love any day

[Both:] When love comes knockin' at my heart
I'm surely gonna let it in
When love comes knockin' at my heart
Happiness will surely begin

[TT:] Oh darlin', 

[MG:] Oh darlin'

[TT:] Oh darlin', 

[MG:] Oh darlin'

[MG:] Emptiness is in the air & all around me gloom
As I gaze through the window of my lonely room
I hate to get up in the mornin' 'cause I know what lies ahead
Where there should be a cheerful smile, there's loneliness instead

[Both:] When love comes knockin' at my heart
I'm surely gonna let it in
When love comes knockin' at my heart
Happiness will surely begin

[MG:] Oh if you've never been in love, darlin'
Then you're just like me, now

[TT:] Don't you get lonely? What am I to be?
Oh darlin', 

[MG:] Oh darlin'

[TT:] Oh darlin', 

[MG:] Oh darlin'

[TT:] Oh darlin', 

[MG:] Oh darlin'

[TT:] Oh darlin', 

[MG:] Oh darlin'

[TT:] My heart's full of envy for the girl who lives next door
She has so many things that I've never had before

[MG:] She possesses one thing I've never had a chance to get
That's someone to call her own & there's one thing you can bet

[Both:] When love comes knockin' at my heart
I'm surely gonna let it in
When love comes knockin' at my heart
Happiness will surely begin

[TT:] Oh darlin', 

[MG:] Oh darlin'

[TT:] Oh darlin', 

[MG:] Oh darlin'

[TT:] When love comes, I'm gonna let it in
Because I know I'll be happy then
Loneliness will be no more
When love comes, gonna open that door
When love comes, when love comes
Oh darlin', when love comes
Finding you was incredible
Losing you would be unbearable
For you woman, I'd go through hoops of fire

Somethings are impossible
'Cause some folks never try
Some folks see an obstacle
And they never get by

I used to be that way before
I met you, baby
But the force of your gentle touch
Too much is not enough for me

Whoa, I'll go through hoops of fire
I'll do anything
(Anything)
To get close to you

I'll go through hoops of fire
To prove to you
(To prove to you)
That no one else will do
And nothing can keep me from you
No, no, no, no, baby

Finding you was incredible
In every way, you show me why
(Why girl)
Losing you would be unbearable
I'd lose the meaning you've brought to my life

You've done for me
What no one else could ever do
Through your love I've got the strength
To face up to anything
God, I'm telling you the truth

I would go through
(Hoops of fire)
To prove to you
(To prove to you)
That no one else will do

(Nothing)
Nothing
(Will keep me)
Keep me from you
I'll take a chance
I'd risk it all
I'll get back on my feet
If I should happen to fall

It's all because of you
That I am what I am
I'll get down on my knees
If you ask me to, don't you know

I'd go through
(Hoops)
Oh yes I will baby
(Of fire)
Whoa, I'll do anything
(Anything)
To get close to you

(Ah hoops)
Ah my, my, my, my, my, my, my, baby
(Of fire)
Oh yes I will, I'll prove to you
(Prove to you)
That no one else is gonna do

No
(Nothing)
Nothing
(Could keep me)
Is gonna keep me from you, baby, baby
(Oh oh, hoops of fire)
I'll go through hoops of fire
Oh I'll do anything
(Anything)
To get close to you, baby
Yes people are talkin' all over town
They say you don't love me
You gonna put me down
You better watch yourself baby
You better watch yourself
You better watch yourself
Cause I got my eyes on you

Now you tell me what's the matter
What you gonna do
First you say you love me
Then you say we're through
You better watch yourself baby
Watch yourself
You better watch yourself woman
Cause I got my eyes on you

I gave you my money
Everything too
A big fat house
Now baby what you gonna do
You better watch yourself
You better watch yourself
You better watch yourself woman
Cause I got my eyes on you
Now you're gonna leave me
Leave me here to cry
Now you know I love you
You're my whole heart's desire
You better watch yourself baby
You better watch yourself
You better watch yourself woman
Cause I got my eyes on you

Yes!
Yes, yes baby!
Yes, yes baby!
Yes, yes baby!
Yes, yes baby!
Yes, yes baby!

You better watch yourself woman
You better watch yourself
You better watch yourself baby
Cause I got my eyes on you
Sailors in snow
Send a callout raising hands
Some are bound to fail
Some are winter sun, ah

Sailors in snow
Send a callout rasing hands
Some are bound to fail
Some are winter sun, ah

[Chorus]
Spend the night with me tonight
Ce soir tonight (Golden lady)
Spend the night with me tonight
(With me tonight)
Tonight, tonight (Ah, golden lady)

[Verse 1]
Oh, why go home to an empty bed?
Why try to fight those passions in your head?
We're two hearts on fire, fueled by a simple touch
With love and desire, we both need so much

[Pre-Chorus]
(You're the girl) You're the girl
(Only girl) Only girl
(So right for me) Oh, oh, oh, oh oh
(You're the girl) You're the girl
(Golden girl) Golden girl

[Chorus]
Spend the night with me tonight
Ce soir tonight
(Would you do that? Would you do that for me, lady?)
Spend the night (Spend the night)
With me tonight (With me tonight)
Tonight, tonight (Ah, golden lady)

[Verse 2]
Listen, I'm not out just for an easy lay
I really love you in a special way
Unlock the door, girl, we can throw away the key
See, I want more of you, and girl, here's all of me

[Pre-Chorus]
(You're the girl) You're the girl
(Only girl) Only girl
(So right for me) Oh, oh, oh, oh oh
(You're the girl) You're the girl
(Golden girl) Golden girl

[Chorus]
Spend the night (Hey) with me tonight
Ce soir tonight
(Please, pretty please, baby please, baby)
Spend the night (Spend the night)
With me tonight (With me tonight)
Tonight tonight (Ow, golden lady)
Spend the night (Could you spend the night)
With me tonight (With me tonight)
Ce soir tonight
(So we can ladadadada, ladadadada, ladadada, throw down, baby)

[Intro]
Ladies and gentlemen
I like to introduce you all to a new game
It's called Dope Ball
Similar rules and regulations, but at the same time, very different
Goes a lil' something like this

[Verse]
It's not pick 'n' roll, it's more like pick a roll
What you gon' push? We waste a blow
If it's all 3, then that's the 3 from the top of the key, before you cup a brick, scrape some grams off the top of the key
Same for the blow, we call those free throws, they call 'm' cheerleaders, we call 'm cheap hoes
Find some low ones, have them beg a few O's
Next thing you know your puttin' numbers on the boat
The whole point is to stay on the courts, but in this game the whole point is to stay outta courts
Yeah they similar, but not the same sports
Both international, import, export
Extort and if you get caught, the law is like referee, it can get bought
Extort and if you get caught, the law is like referee, it can get bought

[Outro]
Dope Ball, dope ball, we play, we play
We playin' dope ball, dope ball
This is called what? Dope Ball, Dope Ball
I know y'all later, if you push weighter, you see a dope ball
Hahaha
Thought that would entertain you all for a little bit
Little idea I came up with sitting at the crib
Watching the ocean, thinking about things we used to do back in the day
Hahaha
Say it over and over again
Over and over again
Never stop saying you're mine
Say it
Ever and ever so sweet
Ever and ever so sweet just like an old valentine
When you say I love you
The same old I love you
They whisper in stories and plays
You can change I love you
The same old I love you
To oh such a heavenly phrase
So say it
Softly and gently and then
Over and over again
Never stop saying you're mine
Ecce Cor Meum
Behold my heart
Ecce Cor Meum
Behold my heart
There in the future we may be apart
Here in my music I show you my heart

Ecce Cor Meum
Behold my heart
Ecce Cor Meum
Behold my heart
There in the future we may be apart
But here in my music I show you my heart

Ecce Cor Meum
Behold my heart
Ecce Cor Meum
Behold my heart
When in the future we are apart
Music will show you my heart
Ecce Cor Meum
Behold my heart
In the future we may be apart
Here in my music I show you my heart
Ecce Cor Meum
Behold my heart
Ecce Cor Meum
Behold my heart
Ecce Cor Meum
Show you my heart
Music will show you my heart

Truth is only reality
Nature truly is what we are
Peace is only nature at rest

Love is our true nature
Love is all

Truth and nature bring us peace and love
Love is our true nature
Love is all
Love is our true nature
Love is all

Peace and love are all we long for
Peace and love
Truth is only reality
Nature truly is what we are
Peace and love are always our true nature
Love is all
Human nature, our true nature
Love at peace with nature
Human nature, human nature

Therefore every one of us
Has to find a strong foundation for a love
Help us find a strong foundation for a love

Although life sometimes is hard we still pull through
Without truth false shades nothing else remains
Without truth false shades nothing else remains
But still we are able to pull through
Even though we may have nothing else
Nothing ever remains
And then our feelings are threatened
Unless we can pull through
To the opposite side
Nothing else remains
Now I have a story that I'd like to tell
About this guy you all know he had me scared as hell
He comes to me at night after I crawl into bed
He's burnt up like the weenie and his name is Fred
He wears the same hat and sweater every single day
And even if it's hot outside he wears it anyway
He's home when I'm awake but he shows up when I sleep
I can't believe that there's a nightmare on my street
It was a Saturday evening if I remember it right
And we had just gotten back off tour last night
So the gang and I thought that it would be groovy
If we summoned up the posse and done rushed the movie
I got Angie, Jeff got Tina
Ready rock got some girl I'd never seen in my life
That was alright because the lady was chill
Then we dipped to the theater set to ill
Buggin' cold havin' a ball
And somethin' about Elm St. was the movie we saw
The way it started was decent you know nuthin' real fancy
About this homeboy named Fred and this girl named Nancy
But word when it was over, I said yo that was def
And everything seemed all right when we left
But when I got home and laid down to sleep
That began the nightmare on my street
It was burning in my room like an oven
My bed soaked with sweat and man I was bugging
I checked the clock and it stopped at 12:30
It had melted it was so darn hot and I was thirsty
I wanted something cool to quench my thirst
I thought to myself yo this heaters the worst
But when I got downstairs I noticed something was wrong
I was home all alone but the TV was on
I thought nothin' off it as I grabbed the remote
I pushed the power button and then I almost choked
When I heard this awful voice coming from behind It said
"You got my favorite letter but now you must die"
Man, I ain't even wait to see who it was
Broke inside my drawers and screamed, "So long, 'cuz"
Got halfway up the block I calmed down and stopped screaming
Then thought, "Oh, I get it, I must be dreaming"
I strolled back home with a grin on my grill
I think that since this is a dream I might as well get ill
I walked in the house, the Big Bad Fresh Prince
But Freddy killed all that noise real quick
He grabbed me by my neck and said
"Here's what we'll do, we gotta lotta work here
Me and you, the souls of your friends you and I will claim
You've got the body and I've got the brain"
I said, "Yo Fred I think you got me all wrong
I ain't partners with nobody with nails that long
Look, I'll be honest man this team won't work
The girls won't be on you Fred, your face is all burnt"
Fred got mad and his head started steaming
But I've thought what the hell I'm only dreamin'
I said please leave Fred so I can get some sleep
But give me a call maybe we'll hang out next week
I patted him on the shoulder, said, "Thanks for stopping by"
Then I opened up the door and said, "Take care guy"
He got mad, drew back his arm and slashed my shirt
I laughed at first, then thought, "Hold up, that hurt"
It wasn't a dream, man, this guy was for real
I said, "Freddy, uh, pal, there's been an awful mistake here"
No further words and then I darted upstairs
Crashed through my door then jumped on my bed
Pulled the covers up over my head and said
"Oh please do something with Fred"
He jumped on my bed, went through the covers with his claws
Tried to get me, but my alarm went off and then silence
It was a whole new day I thought
"Huh, I wasn't scared of him anyway"
Until I noticed those rips in my sheets
And that was proof that there had been a nightmare on my street
Oh man, I gotta call Jeff, I gotta call Jeff
Come on, come on
Come on Jeff, answer
Come on, man
Hello?
Jeff, this is Prince, man Jeff, wake up, Jeff, wake up
What do you want?
Jeff, wake up, man, listen to me, Jeff
It three o'clock in the morning, what do you want?
Jeff, Jeff, would you listen to me? Listen
Whatever you do, don't fall asleep
Man
Jeff, listen to me, don't go to sleep, Jeff
Look, I'll talk to you tomorrow
Jeff, Jeff, Jeff, Jeff, answer me
Someday I'll be gone
Believe me, it won't be long
When I leave you it's gonna grieve you
What you bet

You're abusing of our romance
I'm warning you in advance
You're gonna cry when I say bye bye
What you bet, what you bet

I smiled when you mistreated me
My friends called me a fool
I firmly believe where love is concerned
You've broken every rule

Oh, you got a good thing in me
You're gonna lose me, wait and see
You won't wake up until we break up
What you bet, what you bet

Oh, I smiled when you mistreated me
My friends called me a fool
I firmly believe where love is concerned
You've broken every rule
Oh, you got a good thing in me
You're gonna lose me, wait and see
You won't wake up until we break up
What you bet, baby

[Verse 1]
With these hands, I will cling to you
I'm yours forever and a day
With these hands, I will bring to you
A tender love as warm as May
(And just as beautiful as the flowers are)
With this heart I will sing to you
Long after stars have lost their glow
And with these hands, I'll provide for you
Should there be a stormy sea
I'll turn the tide for you
And I'll never
(And I'll never)
No, I'll never let you go

[Verse 2]
With these hands I will cling to you
I know forever and a day
With these hands I will bring to you
A tender love as warm as 

[?] in the middle of August
With this heart I will sing to you
Long after stars have lost their glow
And with these hands I will love for you
Should there be a storm at sea I'll turn the tide for you
And I'll never (And I'll never), no I'll never and I'll never let you go
And I'll never (And I'll never), no I'll never and I'll never let you go
I got a bad sensation
The enemy is all around
The traces of my naked heart
Are laid upon the ground
I suffered side effects
That might have been forever
Even in my dreams
And I was left alone to pray
When there was no one in the way
And nothin' what it seemed

And from a hard time, play time
Took a trip around the world
Made myself invisible
The taste was in the wine
And just when the thought of someone
Needing me forever
I don't believe the words are true
That only she could be my savior

Experience is not enough
I'll show you how to fall in love
She said experience is not enough
I'll show you how to fall in love
And she's all alone with me
Every night
And lighting all my days of sorrow
On my own
If there was any more to give
You know I'd sacrifice it for her

And in the prime of my life
I was blessed and I was sent
Someone sweet and innocent
And nervous when she kissed
And in the face of my
Forbidden fruit forever
Miracles are mine
And knowing I'm the first
In her secret universe
There's no sense of space and time

You take a small town, young girl
Someone warm and wonderful
That any man would understand
That love is like the wind
Something deep inside to give you
And when the words get in the way
The only thing you need is silence
Experience is not enough
I'll show you how to fall in love
She said experience is not enough
I'll show you how to fall in love
Let's take a boat to Bermuda
Let's take a plane to Saint Paul
Let's take a kayak to Quincy or Nyack
Let's get away from it all

Let's take a trip in a trailer
No need to come back at all
Let's take a powder to Boston for chowder
Let's get away from it all

We'll travel 'round from town to town
We'll visit every state
I'll repeat, "I love you sweet!"
In all the forty-eight

Let's go again to Niagara
This time we'll peek at the Fall
Let's leave our hut, dear
Get out of our rut, dear
Let's get away from it all
We'll travel 'round from town to town
We'll visit every state
I'll repeat, "I love you sweet!"
In all the forty-eight

Let's go again to Niagara
This time we'll dig the Fall
Let's leave our hut, dear
Get out of our rut, dear
Let's get away from it all
I gotta right to sing the blues
I gotta right to feel low-down
I gotta right to hang around
Down around the river

A certain gal in this old town
Keeps draggin' my poor (old) heart around
All I see, for me is - misery

I gotta right to sing the blues
I gotta right to moan and sigh
I gotta right to sit and cry
Down around the river

I know the deep blue sea
Will soon be callin' me
It must be love - say what you choose
I gotta right to sing the blues
Prince
Miscellaneous
Toy Box
Sister's got a place she goes whenever she's lonely
It's so much fun
Brother cries whenever he's lonely
And he's lonely cuz he hasn't one
But that's cool cuz...

CHORUS:
Sister's got a place she goes whenever she's lonely
She's got a toy box
Love, it comes so easy when the children open doors
Doesn't matter who knocks
Sister's very kind so it's never quite a problem
When it comes 2 love
Everything's so easy when we're children
One touch is 2 much
Oooh
CHORUS
One touch, one touch, one touch is 2 much
Why we hide our feelings when we're older
Is a movie I don't want 2 see (I don't want 2 see)
Truth is all that matters in a month of Saturdays
When U're 17 (When U're 17)
CHORUS {x2}
(She's got a toy box)
(Knock, knock)
Sister's got a place she goes whenever she's lonely
She's got a toy box (toy box)
Love comes so easy
She's got a toy box
One touch, one touch, one touch is 2 much

(Toy box) {repeat 2 end}
My toy box
Lord, y'all want some, oh, look
Toy box
Though I know it's time to take you home
Baby you and I are all alone
We should take a moment of our own
And look what we've got
You could destroy this heart of mine
I'm only trying to get by
Hiding in the shadows of the night
Holding you and knowing the wrong is right

Show me some mercy
You know what you're doin' is making me
A happy man
I shield you from the rain
I've been slow to get you but
I'm working
As hard as I can

This time, it's what we believe is true
And whether you believe I'm in love with you
I gotta be sure that you say what you mean
Is it only a dream to a teenage queen
And all the years of tears and laughter
We could go through
Will it be happy ever after
For me and you
Heaven is a place inside of me
Livin' with your heart as company
Only you can change the way I feel
And make it feel good
Where there is love there is no crime
I'm only tryin' to get mine
Let me be the one to dry your eyes
We can be the promise that never dies

Light of an angel
Blinded by the vision
I'm wishin' we could travel on
Stay with me baby
Any less than an hour
You be leavin' me lonely too long

This time, it's what we believe is true
And whether you believe I'm in love with you
I gotta be sure that you say what you mean
Is it only a dream to a teenage queen
And all the years of tears and laughter
We could go through
Will it be happy ever after
For me and you

This time, it's what we believe is true
And whether you believe I'm in love with you
I gotta be sure that you say what you mean
Is it only a dream to a teenage queen
And you define the dream you're after
Make it come true
Will it be happy ever after
Will it be happy ever after
For me and you
Dear friend of my mine
The Weather's fine
Today I saw some ruins of the Roman world's decline
And I climbed all those Spanish steps
You've heard of them no doubt
But Rome has lost its glory, I don't know what its about
I wish you were here
When the shadows fall and all the rushing traffic's still
I wish you were here
When the bells are ringing on the seven hills
I make my way to a small cafe, I wonder what you did today
Wish you were here

Dear one at home
I just flew in from Rome
Paris is a postcard all decked out in colour chrome
And so I climbed the Eiffel Tower
And prayed at Notre Dame
But I just can't find the romance
And I wonder why I came
Wish you were here
On the Champs Elysees lovers walk hand in hand
Wish you were here
They take one look at me and seem to understand
This city of light is a lovely site, the first bright star I see tonight
Wish you were here
Now I write this from the plane
Drinking cheap champagne
And wondering why two people got so far apart
Wish you were here, here in London where the rain the pouring down
Wish you were here
On this airplane headed back to New York Town
I'll never leave you alone again. I'm coming home but until then
Wish you were here
I wish you were here
Wish you were here
When the evening, the evening sun goes down
You gonna find me somewhere hanging around
The night life, people, it ain't no good life
But it's my life, yeah

All the people just like you and me
Everybody's dreaming
Dreaming about their old used to be
The night life, hey, it ain't no good life, people
Oh but it's my life

Yes listen to the blues, people
Listen to what they're saying
Yes listen to the blues, people
Listen to the way they're playing

Heaven please send to all mankind
Understanding and peace of mind
If it's not asking too much
Please send me someone to love, someone to love
Show the world, show them how to get along
Peace will enter when hate is gone
If it's not asking too much
Please send me someone to love
Please send me someone to love

Nights I lay awake and ponder world's troubles
And my answer is always the same
Unless man put an end to this damnable sin
Hate will put the world in a flame, what a shame

Just because I'm, because I'm in misery
Oh I don't beg, I don't beg for no sympathy
But if it's not asking too much
Please send me someone to love, yeah

Oh the night life, people it ain't no good life
But it's my life, yeah
So please, please, please, please, please, please
Please send me someone to love
Someone to love
A little child on a sickbed lay
And death was very near
He was the pride and the only child of a railroad engineer

His duty had called him from those he loved
And seeing that hope was dim
While a tear he shed to his wife he said, "Just have two lanterns trimmed."

Just hang a light when I pass tonight
Hang it where it can be seen
If the baby's dead then show the red
If he's better then show the green

In a little shack
By the railroad track
A mother with watchful eyes
Saw a gleam of hope in a tender smile
As the train went rushing by
Just one short look
Was his only chance?
To see the light a gleam
In the midnight air their rose a prayer
Thank god the light was green
Just hang a light when I pass tonight
Hang it where it can be seen
If the baby's dead then show the red
If he's better then show the green

[Intro]
I wonder why nobody don't like me
Or is it the fact that I'm ugly?
I wonder why nobody don't like me
Or is it the fact that I'm ugly?

[Verse 1]
I leave my whole house and home
My children don't want me no more
Bad talk inside de house dey bring
And when I talk they start to sing:

[Chorus]
Mama, look a boo-boo they shout
Their mother tell them shut up your mouth
That is your daddy, oh no
My daddy can't be ugly so
Shut your mouth, go away
Mama, look a boo-boo dey
Shut your mouth, go away
Mama, look a boo-boo dey

[Verse 2]
I couldn't even digest me supper
Due to the children's behavior
John (Yes, pa), come here a moment
Bring de belt, you're much too impudent
John says it's James who started first
James tells the story in reverse
I drag my belt from off me waist
You should hear them screamin' 'round de place

[Chorus]
Mama, look a boo-boo they shout
Their mother tell them shut up your mouth
That is your daddy, oh no
My daddy can't be ugly so
Shut your mouth, go away
Mama, look a boo-boo dey
Shut your mouth, go away
Mama, look a boo-boo dey

[Interlude]
Hey! I kill mother's son!

[Verse 3]
So I began to question the mother
These children ain't got no behavior
So I began to question the mother
These children ain't got no behavior
They're making fun, my wife declare
You should be proud of them, my dear
These children were taught too bloomin' slack
That ain't no kind of joke to crack

[Chorus]
Mama, look a boo-boo they shout
Their mother tell them shut up your mouth
That is your daddy, oh no
My daddy can't be ugly so
Shut your mouth, go away
Mama, look a boo-boo dey
Shut your mouth, go away
Mama, look a boo-boo dey

[Outro]
Shut your mouth, go away
Mama, look a boo-boo dey
Shut your mouth, go away
Mama, look a boo-boo dey
Shut your mouth, go away
Mama, look a boo-boo dey
Run here, pretty mama
Sit down on your daddy's knee
So I can tell everybody
How you've been sending me

Mama, if this is your secret
You better keep it to yourself
Because if you tell me
I might, I might tell somebody else

I like it red, big fat mama
With the meat shakin' on her bone
And every time she walks down the street
Some steely the woman and longs to home
And longs to home

I want you to take me, pretty mama

[Incomprehensible]
I want you to love me, mama
Till my face turns like cherry red
Magdalene is trembling
Like a washing on a line
Trembling and gleaming
Never before was a man so kind
Never so redeeming

Enter the multitudes
In Exxon blue
In radiation rose
Ecstasy
Now you tell me
Who you gonna get to do the dirty work
When all the slaves are free?
(Who're you gonna get)

I am up a sycamore
Looking through the leaves
A sinner of some position
Who in the world can this heart healer be
This magical physician
Enter the multitudes
In Exxon blue
In radiation rose
Misery
Now you tell me
Who you gonna get to do the dirty work
When all the slaves are free?
(Who're you gonna get)

Enter the multitudes
The walking wounded
They come to this diver of the heart
Of the multitudes
Thy kingdom come
Thy will be done

Oh, climb down, climb down he says to me
From the middle of unrest
They think is light is squandered
But he sees a stray in the wilderness
And I see how far I've wandered

Enter the multitudes
In Exxon blue
In radiation rose
Apathy
Now you tell me
Who you gonna get to do the dirty work
When all the slaves are free?
(Who're you gonna get)
Enter the multitudes
The walking wounded
They come to this diver of the heart
Of the multitudes
Thy kingdom come
Thy will be done

Oh, all around the marketplace
The buzzing of the flies
The buzzing and the stinging
Divinely barren
And wickedly wise
The killer nails are ringing

Enter the multitudes
In Exxon blue
In radiation rose
Tragedy
Now you tell me
Who you gonna get to do the dirty work
When all the slaves are free?
(Who're you gonna get)
Look at her shinin'
Her feathers, they glow
Now the jungle is smiling
'Cause our baby's home
Can you feel what I feel?
The day has come at last
Our precious jewel has returned
I'll be the first to say welcome back
Oh, welcome back

I say welcome, welcome, welcome
Back!
The light-hearted gay kind of charm you display, that's for me
The wonderful sly little trick with your eye, that's for me
What a feather in my hat if I could gratify your wish;
Do you like the movies, or what is your favorite dish?
The tilt of your chin, when you chuckle or grin, that's for me
You might as well know that wherever you go, there I'll be
Just to make sure you keep your heart alone and fancy free
No one else can have it; that's for me
I dont wanna sell yay
Get my door kicked in by the kkk
Shoulda said the police
Lookin for the quarter piece inside my caprice

From the tracks of the ghetto
I try to escape
Ya caught my music
On a CD or rap tape
I make it then take it
To the mom and papa store
For a proper cash flo'
From the mom and papa store

Dont want no more rappers on consignment
Find another alignment
Come back another climate
People don't even know who you is
You need a name in the music biz

Your album, for one, has no promotion
Your elbows and kneecaps have no lotion
Your ashy, your music is trashy
Outkast, inside they class me
Out the door is where they catch me
(WHERE?)
Straight into the street
(WHERE YOU GOIN?)
Now im on my way to swap meet
(SAY WHAT?)
Tryn to make a mil without a record deal
Selling tapes off the back of my Coupe de ville (Bucka!)
Hustlin on the street is hard
In a fight with the white security guard
Talkin bout Ã¢â¬Ëno solicitin, no publicitin'
I try to talk to him but nope he not listenin
Punk ass, flunk ass, can't slam dunk ass
Skunk ass, monk ass, sufferin suckatash!
Now i'm seein a black guard workin for a Korean
Tellin me i can't be in the places that i be in
You can spend your money here
You can't make no money here
You better get outta here ya here here
Did i make myself clear?
I go and drink a beer
Til im pissy in my belly
Big as missy elliot (EEEEEE!)

I'm so depressed plus overstressed
Wanna rap so hard im obsessed
Sometimes i wanna cock my heat
Make them punks play my song on the beat (BUCKA!!!!)

Let me out, let me out
Let me show the whole world what im all about
Let me out, let me out
Let me rap til the party people scream n shout
Let me out, let me out
Let me show the whole world the best of me
Let me out, let me out
Let me take contol of my destiny
Depressed, determined
Smokin, shermann
Black, german
Monster, herman
Sellin, crack
Money, stacked
Down for a murder, black
Like roberta flack
Get dressed up, get my tapes pressed up
'cause the music industry is messed up, baby!
I throw a pity party as i sip bacardi
Sell on! rap tapes, i dont need nobody
Ima beethoven givin, colt 45 sippin
Its the year 2000 and my gerri curl still drippin
It might sound strange in my rhyme
But im from the west coast
I can't change with the hands of time
What i am is what i am
If you dont like what i am i dont give a damn
Black pecker's my title, john king is my idol
Im havin thoughts thats suicidal, young rival
I dont care about fashion, just cadillac mashin
Bags to put my grass in, bank to put my cash in
I dont wear FUBU like you do 'cause FUBU is booboo
I pull my gat and make you shit boo boo sit
You talk too much shit, thats why you got hit
Walkin home with your gums split

You can hide em, I'm-a find them, on the counter, in the closet
And I'll say I ain't do it with my face covered in chocolate
My girl be setting booby traps to catch me eating Scoobie snacks
I left crumbs in the bed once but I told her I was through with that
She still don't be believing me and I guess that I'm cool with that
But I got a sweet tooth that'll never come loose
And the truth of the matter is

(The-Dream:)
I like girls, they like me

Butter Pecan, Puerto Rican, or them Oatmeal Raisin Asians
Hazelnut Brazilians, Macadamia Caucasians
Double stuffed or thin mint, it don't matter you getting it
Cause I got a sweet tooth that'll never come loose
And the fact of the matter is

I like girls, they like me
They look so good in their Seven jeans

Freak
Alright, alright
Thank you so much ladies and gentlemen right here
Right here I want to tell you a little story
This is about a country boy from down home
This young man has never been north before
I want you to listen to me, I got something to tell you

He heard about Chicago
He worked hard over here, made all of that money, 800 dollars
After caring for his crop, he called his cousin in Chicago
And he said, "Cousin, I'm on my way"
He picked all of that cotton
I said this is about a country boy like myself, B.B. King you know
So when he get to Chicago, his cousin meet him and bring him out to the club
He said, "Set him up!", cous's payin' for
Had all the go-go girls set up, waitin' up
They carried him downtown and put him up in one of the pleasure hotels
They brought him back out and said, "Set him up!", cous's payin' for
His money got a little lighter, they lured him out from the Lute and brought him down to Robert's
And then he said, "Set him up!", cous's payin' for
And then the 800 dollars, bein' more money then my man had ever had, began to run out
Then they moved him out and put him down with the ...
And then, ladies and gentlemen, the go-go girls would get fewer
His friends was fewer
All his buddies are startin' passin' him on the other side of the street
And then it happened all his buddies were gone
And my man knew only one thing to do, it was getting cold there, like it is today
You know what I'm talking about
He went down to the railroad yard
And one of the few ladies that had helped him to spent his money, came by to see him
And she said "You fool!, you fool!", I wouldn't have spend your money, but the rest of them was spending your money so I decided to spend my portion too, you know
But ladies, God bless 'em, wonderful something's aren't they?
They always like to feel like they're needed, and she knew my man needed her bad
He gotten sick, he's layin' down there under the boxcar
Couldn't read so well, so you know if he couldn't read so well, he couldn't write too well
You know what I'm talkin' about?
So this is a letter back down home, I know what I'm talkin' about
It go like this:

I've had my fun, whoah, if I don't get well no more
Whoah, I've had my fun, people, ooh, if I don't get well no more
Yes, my health is faillin' on me now, people
Ooh, and I'm goin', goin' down slow

Yes, tell my mother, people, please tell her the shape I'm in
Ooh yes, tell my people, mother, tell her the shape I'm in
Tell her to pray for me, people, ooh, to forgive, people, my sins

Oohooh mother, mother I live alone with my prayers
Ooh, tell my mother, people, tell her this is all in prayers
Yes, if you don't see this old body, mother
Hey, you know I'm out in the world somewhere
Maybe you don't know me anymore then I know you
And I wouldn't blame you if you walked away
I been watchin' you all evenin' with the teardrops in your eyes
And it touches me much more then I can say
You know I'd hate to think that someone
Could have hurt someone like you
And if I was him, I'd be right by your side

Lay your troubles on my shoulders
Put your worries in my pocket
Rest your love on me awhile
Lay your troubles on my shoulder
Put your worries in my pocket
Rest your love on me awhile

Saw you in the corner on the moment I walked in
Saw your lonely face across the room
No, I won't forget it
And the way it might have been
Why did you have to leave so soon
You know I'd hate to think that someone
Could have loved you more than me
And at times like this I'd be right by your side
Lay your troubles on my shoulders
Put your worries in my pocket
Rest your love on me awhile
Lay your troubles on my shoulders
Put your worries in my pocket
Rest your love on me awhile

How long must I wait for the last train to be here
And the last chance to know
Get to think that I was born too soon
How long honey, when the lovin' don't come
I was there when you left me
Just didn't know how to begin

Lay your troubles on my shoulders
Put your worries in my pocket
Rest your love on me awhile
Lay your troubles on my shoulders
Put your worries in my pocket
Rest your love on me awhile

We lived our little drama
We kissed in a field of white
And stars fell on Alabama
Last night

I can't forget the glamour
Your eyes held a tender light
While (And) stars fell on Alabama (fractured 'Bama)
Last night

I never planned in my imagination
A situation - so heavenly
A fairy land where no one else could enter
And in the center - just you and me

My heart beat (just) like a hammer
(My) Arms wound around you tight
And (While) stars fell on Alabama
Last night
Say, baby
You know i want you
To let your light come shining through
Aww, baby
Baby, why don't you
Just let your light come shining through
Baby
No need to worry
Let your love come shining through
Honey
When in trouble
Let your love come shining through
Ohh, baby
You'll be happy
When your light come shining through
Baby
Life is a party
Let your love come shining through

Let it shine, baby
Let it shine, baby
Let it shine, baby
Let it shine, baby
Shine all the time
Shine & be kind
Then you'll feel fine
Then you'll be mine
Baby
Life is worth living
If you let your love come shining through
Aww, baby
The world is mellow
When you let your love come shining through

Mmmm, baby
You look so pretty while you dancin', baby
Shining
Look so pretty, shining, shining
Give it to me, shining, shining
Look so pretty, shining
Oh, baby
Let your love come shining through
Oh, darling
Let your light come shining through
Ooh, baby
The world is waiting
So let your light come shining through
Stevie
We really dig you
Hope you don't mind this riff from you

Ohh, praise Him when you go to work
Praise Him when your feelings hurt
Praise Him when you're feeling bad
Praise Him when you're feeling sad
All praises to the power
Praise Him by the love you give
Praise Him by the way you live
Praise Him even when you dance & make romance
When you make romance
(let your light come shining through, BABY!)
Praise Him when you got no time
Praise Him whether rain or shine (shine shine shine shine shine)
Praise Him for the sunlighted sky
Praise Him for the moonlight
Oh gosh darn it, there goes that last butt
Come on, sweet, let's walk it. Here we go

It's a long way from your house to my house
And the last bus passed us long ago
Goodnight, my sweet, I love you very very
Oh my poor feet, is this trip necessary?

It's a long way from your lips to my lips
And your lips, to me, are divine
So have a little sympathy, say that you'll marry me
It's such a long way from your house to mine

Walk those squares and dodge those lines
Gee, I feel light enough to skip home

It's a long way from your house to my house
Your lips, to me, are divine
So have a little sympathy, say that you'll marry me
It's such a long way from your house to mine
Ahem, can I get in for five minutes more?
You mean this is goodnight after I walked you all the way home?
It's such a long way from your house to mine
You know it is even longer going back to my house, geez?
Why even in France the best upper sets do it, Lithuanians and Letts do it
Let's do it, let's fall in love
In old Japan, all the Japs do it, up in Lapland little Laps do it
Let's do it, let's fall in love
The Deutch in old Amsterdam do it, not to mention the Fins
Folks in Siam do it - think of Siamese twins
In shallow shoals English souls do it, goldfish in the privacy of bowls do it
Let's do it, let's fall in love
The chimpanzees in the zoos do it, some courageous kangaroos do it
Let's do it, let's fall in love
I'm sure giraffes on the sly do it, even eagles as they fly do it
Let's do it, let's fall in love
Electric eels I might add do it, though it shocks 'em I know
Why ask if shad do it - garcon de "shad roe"
The world admits bears in pits do it, even Pekingeses at the Ritz do it
Let's do it, let's fall in love
The royal set sans regret did it, and they considered it fun
Marie Antoinette did it - with or without Napoleon
Parliament pleasure bent did it, mam'selles every time their short of rent did it
Let's do it, let's fall in love
(Boy of mine, boy of mine)
(Dear little boy of mine)

Boy of mine, boy of mine
Although my heart was aching
I seem to know that you'd want to go
Pride in your manhood waking

I'll be here, waiting, dear
Till at a glad dawn's breaking
I'll hear you say you're home to stay
Dear little boy of mine (mine)
Dear little boy of mine (dear little boy of mine)

(Boy of mine, boy of mine)
(Although my heart was breaking)
I'll hear you say you're home to stay
Dear little boy of mine (mine)
Dear little boy of mine
(Dear little boy of mine)

[Intro]
Oh, oh, talk about it, talk about it

[Verse 1]
You know life, has its ups and downs
(Talk about it)
It can turn your pretty face to an ugly frown
Seems that when I face one thing, another one comes
Clouding up my vision, but I can feel the sun
I believe that I can do this; I know that I can win
Just as long as I have His love within

[Chorus]
I believe that I can make it (Make it)
I can make it through the night
I believe that I can walk on (Walk on)
With my head held high
I believe that I am special (Special) in every way
But in order to have my victory, I gotta believe
Oh, oh, oh yeah
(Oh, take your time and tell the world you'll make it)

[Verse 2]
I have to see myself at the finish line
(Talk about it)
I have to visualize that everything will fall in line, uh-huh
(Talk about it)
I have to visualize the land while riding through the storm
I have to trust in my Father and open up my heart
I know that I can do this, I know that I can win
Just as long as I have His love within

[Chorus]
(I believe) I believe that I can make it (Oh yeah)
I can make it through the night (I believe)
I believe that I can walk on (With my head held high)
With my head held high
(I believe that I am special, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I believe that I am special in every way
But in order to have my victory

[Bridge]
Oh, heartbreaks (I can handle it)
And heart pains (I can handle it)
Being let down (I can handle it)
No one's around (I can handle it)
I believe I can (I can handle it)
I receive, I can (I can handle it)
And now I'm walking right into my victory

[Outro]
I believe that I can make it
(I believe that I can)
I can make it through the night
(I believe I'll walk on, walk on, walk on, walk on)
I believe that I can walk on
With my head held high
(I am special, yes I am, oh, oh, oh, oh)
I believe that I am special in every way
(And in order) And in order to have my victory
(Everybody help me say)
I believe that I can make it
(Oh, I believe)
I can make it through the night
(Oh, I believe)
I believe that I can walk on
(I'm gonna walk on)
With my head held high
(With my head held high, I believe that)
I believe that I am special in every way
(There's nobody like me, and in order for me to)
And in order to have my victory
(I gotta believe, yeah)
When I hear that serenade in blue
I'm somewhere in another world
Alone with you
Sharing all the joys we use to know
Many moons, ago

Once again your face comes back to me
Just like the theme of some forgotten, melodie
In the album of my memory
Serenade, in Blue

It seems like only yesterday
A small caffee, a crowded floor
And as we danced the night away
I hear you say forever more
And then the song became a sigh
Forever more became goodbye;
But you remained in my heart

So tell me darling is there still a spark?
Or only lonely ashes of the flame, we knew
Should I go on whisteling in the dark?
Serenade in Blue
*MUSIC BREAK*

It seems like only yesterday
A small caffee, a crowded floor
And as we danced the night away
I hear you say forever more
And then the song became a sigh
Forever more became goodbye;
But you remained in my heart

So tell me darling is there still a spark?
Or only lonely ashes of the flame, we knew
Should I go on whisteling in the dark?
Serenade in Blue

[Verse 1]
I spend all my money
On a big, old fancy car
For these bright-eyed honeys
Oh yeah, you know who you are
Keep me up 'til the sun is high
'Til the birds start calling my name
I'm addicted and I don't know why
Guess I've always been this way

[Pre-Chorus]
All these roads steer me wrong
But I still drive them all night long
All night long

[Chorus]
All you young, wild girls
You make a mess of me
Yeah, you young, wild girls
You'll be the death of me, the death of me
All you young, wild girls
No matter what you do
Yeah, you young, wild girls
I'll always come back to you, come back to you

[Verse 2]
I get lost under these lights
I get lost in the words I say
Start believing my own lies
Like everything will be okay
Oh I still dream of a simple life
Boy meets girl, makes her his wife
But love don't exist when you live like this
That much I know, yes I know

[Pre-Chorus]
All these roads steer me wrong
But I still drive them all night long
All night long

[Chorus]
All you young, wild girls
You make a mess of me
Yeah, you young, wild girls
You'll be the death of me, the death of me
All you young, wild girls
No matter what you do
Yeah, you young, wild girls
I'll always come back to you, come back to you

[Bridge]
You, you, you, you
Yeah you you you
You you you you

[Chorus]
All you young, wild girls
You make a mess of me
Yeah, you young, wild girls
You'll be the death of me, the death of me
All you young, wild girls
No matter what you do
Yeah, you young, wild girls
I'll always come back to you, come back to you
Kiss me once, oh yeah, baby
Kiss me twice, oh yeah, crazy
Kiss me three times
The three kisses of love, oh yeah

Morning, noon, and at night
Never gonna let you out of sight
Kiss me three times
The three kisses of love

Tell me that you really care
I run your fingers through my hair
Kiss me once
Kiss me twice
And I'm in paradise

Kiss me once, oh yeah, baby
Kiss me twice, oh yeah, crazy
Kiss me three times
The three kisses of love

The three kisses of love
Love woke me up this mornin', baby
Feeling fine, I had you on my mind
Oh. love woke me up this mornin'
And I haven't had a heartache today, today
And all my little tears have gone away
Skies are blue because of you
Love woke me up this mornin'
Thinking of last night
You know you make me feel alright
Wow wow wow
Love woke me up this mornin'
And I'm so glad baby because of you happiness is really mine
And all my cloudy days are far behind
And every place, baby, I see your face
Girl, I can smile
You made my life worthwhile
I haven't had a heartache, no not today or any other clay
And all my tears have gone away
Hey hey hey
Listen people
I can remember when I wished it would rain
Without the sunshine of your love
Listen people
There's smooth sailin' now
With you and me from now on
And I just want to say baby
No more cloudy days baby, baby, hey
Woo -- wo --
Now how many of you out there, people out there in the audience tonight can honestly say you feel the same way as we do, in saying love woke you up this morning and brought you no more cloudy days. Well, if any of you just so happens to feel the same way we do, just go on with the group

No more cloudy days
No more cloudy days
I've been cheated
Been mistreated
When will I be loved

I've been pushed down
I've been turned down
When will I be loved

When I find a new girl
That I want for mine
She always breaks my heart into
It happens every time
Every time
Every time

I've been lied to
I've been made blue
When will I be loved

When I find a new girl
That I want for mine
She always breaks my heart into
It happens every time
Every time
Every time
I've been cheated
Been mistreated
When will I be loved
When will I be loved
Just one more time
When will I be loved
Oh, let me hear it again
When will I be loved
I'm gonna wait till the midnight hour
That's when my love comes a-tumbling down
I'm gonna wait till the midnight hour
When there's nobody else around

I'm gonna take you girl and hold you
Do all the things I told you
In the midnight hour
Yes I am

I'm gonna wait till the stars come out
And twinkle in your eyes
I'm gonna wait till the midnight hour
That when my love begins to shine

'Cause you're the only girl I know
That can really love me so
In the midnight hour
So messed up I want you here

Lose my heart on the burning sand

You're throwing it all away
Everything we've been living for
All the promises that were made
They all have gone and flown away

You locked me out
And let your new love come in
Now you are making it
With my closest friend
Fussing and fighting, baby
Where have you been
Yeah, I get the message
That you clearly send

You're so mean and evil
You're so mean
You're so mean and evil
You're so mean

I saw you at the place
Where we used to go
Showing it off
With the lights down low
Telling your lover about eternity
How soon you forget
That's what you once told me
Your sweet talking
Made me go for it
Now you've got someone else
At the top of your list
Like the wind
That's blowing free
Suddenly you've changed
Turned your back on me

You're so mean and evil
You're so mean
You're so mean and evil
You're so mean

Your sweet talking
Made me go for it
Now you've got someone else
At the top of your list
Like the wind
That's blowing free
Suddenly you've changed
Turned your back on me

You're so mean and evil
You're so mean
You're so mean and evil
You're so mean
It takes cheerful resignation, heart and humility
That's all it takes, a cheerful person told me
Nobody's harder on me than me, how could they be?
And nobody's harder on you than you

Betsy's blue, she says, "tell me something good"
You know I'd help her out if I only could
Oh, but sometimes the light can be so hard to find
At least the moon at the window, the thieves left that behind

People don't know how to love, they taste it and toss it
Turn it off and on like a bathtub faucet
Oh sometimes the light can be so hard to find
At least the moon at the window, the thieves left that behind

I wish her heart, I know these battles
Deep in the dark when the spooks of memories rattle
Ghosts of the future, phantoms of the past
Rattle, rattle, rattle in the spoon and the glass

Is it possible to learn how to care and yet not care?
Since love has two faces, hope and despair
And pleasure always turns to fear, I find
At least the moon at the window, the thieves left that behind
At least they left the moon behind the blind
Moon at the window

[Verse 1]
Take away any desire in me that hurts You
Take away anything that stands between You and me
I want to be what You've created me to be
It's my desire that You find favor in me
Lord, take away anything that displeases You, mmm

[Verse 2]
Take away any evil thought within me
Take away anything that proves to break Your heart
I want to be in sweet communion with You
It's my desire that I do everything You want me to do
Lord, take away anything that displeases You

[Bridge]
Oh Lord
Remove all doubt
All insecurity
Erase all hate
And all iniquity
Discard all the fear
The fear deep inside of me, yeah, yes
Lord, take away anything that displeases You
Lord
Remove all doubt
And all of my insecurity
Please erase all hate
And everyone of my iniquities, yes
Discard all of the fear
Found deep in of me, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Take away) Take away, Lord, anything You find
(Take away) I'm sure there are a lot of things that You will find
(Lord, take away) Lord, take away anything that displeases You

[Outro]
Father (Take away)
Take away my doubt (Lord, take away)
Take away my fear (Take away)
Take away those things (Lord, take away)
I thought had already disappeared (Take away)
Take away the hurt (Lord, take away)
And take away the pain (Take away)
Take away all of the things (Lord, take away)
That would stop me from praising Your holy name
Take away any desire in me that hurts You
Take it away
One mornin' at breakfast, I said to my wife
We been everywhere once and some places twice
As I had another helping of country ham
She said "We ain't never been to Vietnam
"And there's a bunch of our boys over there."
So we went to the Orient: Saigon

Well we got a big welcome when we drove in
Through the gates of a place that they call Long Vinh
We checked in and everything got kinda quiet
But a soldier boy said: "Just wait 'til tonight
"Things get noisy. Things start happenin'
"Big bad firecrackers."

Well that night we did about four shows for the boys
And they were livin' it up with a whole lot of noise
We did our last song for the night
And we crawled into bed for some peace and quiet
But things weren't peaceful. And things weren't quiet
Things were scary
Well for a few minutes June never said one word
And I thought at first that she hadn't heard
Then a shell exploded not two miles away
She sat up in bed and I heard her say: "What was that?"
I said: "That was a shell, or a bomb."
She said: "I'm scared." I said "Me too."

Well all night long that noise kept on
And the sound would chill you right to the bone
The bullets and the bombs, and the mortar shells
Shook our bed every time one fell
And it never let up; it was gonna get worse
Before it got any better

Well when the sun came up, the noise died down
We got a few minutes sleep, an' we were sleepin' sound
When a soldier knocked on our door and said:
"Last night they brought in seven dead, and 14 wounded."
And would we come down to the base hospital, and see the boys
"Yes!"

So we went to the hospital ward by day
And every night we were singin' away
Then the shells and the bombs was goin' again
And the helicopters brought in the wounded men
Night after night; day after day
Comin' and a goin'
So we sadly sang for them our last song
And reluctantly we said: "So long."
We did our best to let 'em know that we care
For every last one of 'em that's over there
Whether we belong over there or not
Somebody over here love's 'em, and needs 'em

Well now that's about all that there is to tell
About that little trip into livin' hell
And if I ever go back over there any more
I hope there's none of our boys there for me to sing for;
I hope that war is over with
And they all come back home
To stay

In peace
Alright, already the show goes on
All night, till the morning we dream so long
Anybody ever wonder, when they would see the sun up
Just remember when you come up
The show goes on!

Alright, already the show goes on
All night, till the morning we dream so long
Anybody ever wonder, when they would see the sun up
Just remember when you come up
The show goes on!

Have you ever had the feeling that you was being had?
Don't that shit make you mad?
They treat you like a slave, with chains all on your soul
And put whips up on your back

They be lying through they teeth
Hope you slip up off your path
I don't switch up I just laugh
Put my kicks up on they desk
Unaffected by they threats than get busy on they ass
See that's how that Chi-Town made me
That's how my daddy raised me
That glittering may not be gold, don't let no body play me

If you are my homeboy, you never have to pay me
Go on and put your hands up, when times are hard you stand up
L-U-P the man, cause a brand that the fans trust
So even if they ban us they'll never slow my plans up!

Alright, already the show goes on
All night, till the morning we dream so long
Anybody ever wonder, when they would see the sun up
Just remember when you come up
The show goes on!

Alright, already the show goes on
All night, till the morning we dream so long
Anybody ever wonder, when they would see the sun up
Just remember when you come up
The show goes on!

One in the air for the people that ain't here
Two in the air for the father that's there
Three in the air for the kids in the ghetto
Four for the kids who don't wanna be there
None for the niggas trying to hold them back
Five in the air for the teacher not scared
To tell those kids that's living in the ghetto
That the niggas holdin' back that the world is theirs!
Yeah yeah, the world is yours, I was once that little boy
Terrified of the world
Now I'm on a world tour
I will give up everything, even start a world war
For these ghettos girls and boys I'm rapping around the world for!

Africa to New York, Haiti then I detour, Oakland out to Auckland
Gaza Strip to Detroit, say hip-hop only destroy
Tell 'em look at me, boy!
I hope your son don't have a gun and that would be a D-boy

Alright, already the show goes on
All night, till the morning we dream so long
Anybody ever wonder, when they would see the sun up
Just remember when you come up
The show goes on!

Alright, already the show goes on
All night, till the morning we dream so long
Anybody ever wonder, when they would see the sun up
Just remember when you come up
The show goes on!

So no matter what you been through
No matter what you into
No matter what you see when you look outside your window
Brown grass or green grass
Picket fence or barbed wire
Never ever put them down
You just lift your arms higher
Raise 'em till your arms tired
Let 'em know you're there
That you struggling and survivin' that you gonna persevere
Yeah, ain't nobody leavin', nobody goin' home
Even if they turn the lights out the show is goin' on!

Alright, already the show goes on
All night, till the morning we dream so long
Anybody ever wonder, when they would see the sun up
Just remember when you come up
The show goes on!

Alright, already the show goes on
All night, till the morning we dream so long
Anybody ever wonder, when they would see the sun up
Just remember when you come up
The show goes on!

[Verse 1]
Can you see me
Floating above your head
As you lay in bed
Thinking about everything
That you did not do?
'Cause saying "I love you"
Has nothing to do with meaning it

[Verse 2]
And I don't trust you
'Cause every time you're here
Your intentions are unclear
I spend every hour waiting for a phone call
That I know will never come
I used to think you were the one
Now I'm sick of thinking anything at all

[Chorus]
You ain't ever coming back to me
And that's not how things were supposed to be
You take my hand just to give it back
No other lover has ever done that

[Verse 3]
Do you remember the way we used to melt?
Do you remember how it felt when I touched you?
Oh, 'cause I remember very well

[Bridge]
And how long has it been
Since someone you let in
Has given what I gave to you?
And at night when you sleep
Do you dream I would be there
Just for a minute or two, do you?

[Chorus]
You ain't ever coming back to me
That's not how things were supposed to be
You take my hand just to give it back
No other lover has ever done that

[Chorus]
Heartache, heartache, I just have so much
A simple love with a complex touch
And there is nothing you can say or do
I called to let you know I'm through with you
You ain't ever coming back to me
And that's not how things were supposed to be
You take my hand just to give it back
No other lover has ever done that
Heartache heartache I just have so much
A simple love with a complex touch
And there is nothing you can say or do
I called to let you know I'm through
I called to let you know I'm through
I called to let you know I'm through with you

[Outro]
I ain't ever coming back to you
Come, come on
Come on, come, come on
MIB
The black suits comin'
The black suits comin'
I'm comin', I'm comin' I'm comin', I'm comin'
I am the man in black, I'm back
Breaking the back of the random attackers
So can the flak, yo I'm dangerous

When a stranger fuss try to endanger us
Praise me y'all, don't nothin' faze me y'all
When they see me their gaze be all crazy y'all

Out of the depth of your imagination appears Will Smith
Black suit, the black shades, the black shoes
Black tie with the black attitude
New style black Ray Bans, I'm stunnin' man
New hotness pitch black six hundred man
Don't you understand?

Tanglin' with the alien scum again

When the enemy is near the elite is here
So have no fear just let me see you

Hold me in your arms, dear, dream with me
Cradled by your kisses tenderly
While a choir of angels from above
Sing our melody of love

Heart to heart forever, lips entwined
I am yours and you are mine, all mine
Heaven wrote the music up above
For our melody of love

[Intro]
Tonight is the night, baby
You know for the first time in my life
I think I found what I want

[Verse 1]
Tonight is the night, I wanna be with you
You look like the kind of woman I wanna hold on to
Come a little closer, let me show you how much I care
(Tonight is the night)
Tonight is the night, please stay right here

[Chorus]
Oh, life would be so sweet if I had you, baby
Don't you know that life would be so sweet if I had you
If I just had you (Tonight is the night)

[Verse 2]
Let me show you a love you never felt before
(Whoa-oh, tonight is the night)
I'm gonna give you all that I have, and then some more
(Whoa-oh, tonight is the night)
Come on, baby, I know you want me to
(Whoa-oh, tonight is the night)
Kiss me this way and that way and this way, baby
'Til I'm all over you

[Chorus]
(Life) Life could be so sweet if I had you, if I had you
(Life) Life could be so sweet if I had you, oh
(Tonight is the night)

[Bridge]
You know, girl, I thought I seen it all
(Whoa-oh, tonight is the night)
But you're something special, so very special

[Verse 3]
And I've been all over the world, tryna find someone like you
But for the first time in my life, I realize it wasn't so easy to do
But now that I found your love, I won't let you get away, no
'Cause you're the sunshine that brightens up my day

[Chorus]
Life would be so sweet if I had you, yeah
(Life) Life would be so sweet if I had you
(Tonight is the night)

[Verse 4]
Tonight is the night I wanna be with you
(Whoa-oh, tonight is the night)
You got the kind of lovin' I wanna hold on to
(Whoa-oh, tonight is the night)
Come a little closer and let me show you how much I care
(Whoa-oh, tonight is the night)
Tonight is the night, please stay right here

[Outro]
Oh, life would be so sweet if I had you
Life would be so sweet if I had you
If I had you girl, I know that
(Life) Life would be so sweet if I had you
Life could be so sweet if I had you

[Verse 1: Harry Belafonte, Miriam Makeba]
Darling, go home, your husband is ill
Is he ill? Let them give him a pill
Oh, come my dear Franz, just one more dance
Then I'll go home to my poor old man
Then I'll go home to my poor old man
(Then she'll go home to her poor old man)

[Verse 2: Harry Belafonte, Miriam Makeba]
Darling, go home, your husband is worse
Is he worse? Well, I am no nurse
Oh, come my dear Franz, just one more dance
Then I'll go home to my poor old man
Then I'll go home to my poor old man
(Then she'll go home to her poor old man)

[Verse 3: Harry Belafonte, Miriam Makeba]
Darling, go home, your husband is dead
Is he dead? There's no more to be said
Oh, come my dear Franz, just one more dance
Then I'll go home to my poor old man
Then I'll go home to my poor old man
(Then she'll go home to her poor old man)

[Verse 4: Harry Belafonte, Miriam Makeba]
Darling, go home, the will's to be read
What's that you said?
I said the will's to be read
Oh, no, no, my dear Franz, this is no time to dance
I must go weep for my poor old man
I must go weep for my poor old man
(I must go weep for her poor old man)

[Outro: Harry Belafone]
Ooh wee
And now to move on, it gives me a great deal of pleasure to present twelve men and three accompanists, fifteen all together, who, three years ago started off just as a group to tour with me around the country in a concert that I was doing. So wonderful were the men that they decided to stay together. Gives me a great deal of pleasure to present the Belafonte Folk Singers
One, you come to my room for a little game
Two you, I'll do very erotic things
I wanna make love, babe, very slowly
Three times in a row, all night I'll go
I love when you come over
And when you come
It gives me feva
Body next to mine
Love dance syncopated time
Sugar rush keeps me high
Sweet kiss on my thigh
I wanna make love, baby, very badly
Feels good in the air every time you're here
I love when you come over
And when you come
It gives me feva
Don't keep me waiting, anticipating
Love, I am saving for you
Hear what I'm saying
You I am craving
Love is here waitng for you
All day you're staying
Please no delaying
Patiently waiting for you
Don't keep me waiting
No time for playing
Sitting here waiting for you
I love when you come over
And when you come
It gives me feva
Come one over
I love when you come over
And when you come
There's a rumor flying through the air;
Paranoia's creeping everywhere
You're gonna raise a wall
To draw the line

You say you've got your reasons
I hear them all the time
You say it's talking treason
And a crime...
To question why

Don't you know I've seen this all before?
History repeats itself once more
I don't want to go
And I can't stay

You say you've got your reasons
I hear them all the time
You say it's talking treason
And a crime...
To question why
I don't want to be a refugee
I just want a single guarantee
I don't want to be a refugee
I just want the right to disagree
She's an all-night all-night rental
She's a rental Oriental
Suki-Lee

Oh her eyes yes her eyes
You better pass her by yes
Suki-Lee

Each night she crosses
Different borders mmmm
Each night she's someone's refugee

Crimes of passion
You'll pay the price
If you do it once yeah
Why not do it twice yeah yeah

She only works while the parrot's squawking
In the light of the TV talking
Suki-Lee
She undresses in the light of the TV
In the light of the TV squawking
Suki-Lee

She hears the preachers
Quoting from Solomon's psalms
She hears the news of terrorist bombs

Crimes of passion
You'll pay yes you'll pay the price
If you do it once yeah
Go on do it twice

Cracks in the mirror
Bombs in the moonlight
Those whims of vice
Just how much terror
Can one kiss entice

Crimes of passion
You will pay the price
If you do it once yeah
Why not do it twice

Crimes of passion
Sweet whims of vice
Just how much terror
Can one kiss entice
Crimes of passion

Crimes of passion
Everyday, everyday I have the blues
Everyday, everyday I have the blues
When you see me worried baby
Because it's you I hate to lose

Oh nobody loves me, nobody seems to care
Yes nobody loves me, nobody seems to care
Speaking of bad luck and trouble
Well you know I had my share

I'm gonna pack my suitcase, move on down the line
Yes I'm gonna pack my suitcase, move on down the line
Where there ain't nobody worried
And there ain't nobody crying

[Verse 1]
I read all of the magazines
While waiting around
You said you couldn't wait to see me
But you got stuck in town
So turn off the phone
Now we're finally alone
And some moments at the end of the day
Feel your touch and it's the sweetest
Your kisses are my weakness
I never want them to go away

[Chorus]
I wanna feel you in my heart (heart)
As I look into your eyes (eyes)
No need to get busy so lets take our time
And make slow love slow love
And every minute that we have (have)
It goes too fast
Wanna show you how to rock it
So this feelin last and
Make slow love slow love
Slow love slow love slow love all night

[Verse 2]
It is just a few little things
That you gotta know
A girl will give you all of her heart
When it's happening slow
I need a little laughter
And love will follow after
Lets take this chance to steal away
Your kisses are delicious
And no one is gonna miss us
Tonight I really want you to stay

[Chorus]
I wanna feel you in my heart (heart)
As I look into your eyes (eyes)
No need to get busy so lets take our time
And make slow love slow love
And every minute that we have (have)
It goes too fast
Wanna show you how to rock it
So this feelin last and
Make slow love slow love
Slow love slow love slow love all night

[Bridge]
So I'm callin out do you hear my cries?
Don't have to say goodbye
You're the breath on my skin cherish the taste
It's far too good to go to waste
Feel my desire
Make sweet love all through
All through the night
Make love through the night

[Chorus]
I wanna feel you in my heart (heart)
As I look into your eyes (eyes)
No need to get busy so lets take our time
And make slow love slow love
And every minute that we have (have)

Slow love slow love slow love all night
Little surfer, little one
Made my heart come all undone
Do you love me, do you, surfer girl?
Surfer girl, my little surfer girl

I have watched you on the shore
Standing by the ocean's roar
Do you love me, do you, surfer girl?
Surfer girl, surfer girl

We could ride the surf together
While our love would grow
In my Woody I would take you everywhere I go

So I say from me to you
I will make your dreams come true
Do you love me, do you, surfer girl?
Surfer girl, my little surfer girl

Girl, surfer girl, my little surfer girl
Girl, surfer girl, my little surfer girl
Girl, surfer girl, my little surfer girl
They're pickin' up the prisoners
And putting 'em in a pen
And all she wants to do is dance, dance

Rebels been rebels
Since I don't know when
And all she wants to do is dance

Molotov cocktail, the local drink
And all she wants to do is dance, dance

They mix 'em up right
In the kitchen sink
And all she wants to do is dance

Crazy people walkin' round
With blood in their eyes
And all she wants to do is dance, dance, dance

Wild-eyed pistol-wavers
Who ain't afraid to die
And all she wants to do is
All she wants to do is dance
And make romance
She can't feel the heat
Comin off the street
She wants to party
She wants to get down
All she wants to do is
All she wants to do is dance

Well the government bugged the men's room
In the local disco lounge
And all she wants to do is dance, dance

To keep the boys from sellin'
All the weapons they could scrounge
And all she wants to do is dance

But that don't keep the boys
From makin' a buck or two
And all she wants to do is dance, dance

They still can sell the army
All the drugs that they can do
And all she wants to do is

All she wants to do is dance
And make romance
Well, we barely made the airport
For the last plane out
As we taxied down the runway
I could hear the people shout
They said, "Don't come back here, Yankee"
But if I ever do
I'll bring more money

'Cause all she wants to do is dance
And make romance
Never mind the heat
Comin' off the street
She wants to party
She wants to get down
All she wants to do is
All she wants to do is dance
And make romance
All she wants to do is dance
Blue on blue
Sky's in your eyes
Steer you away like I wasn't here
Where do you go when you fantasize?
Bet you wish I'd disappear
Leave you to dreaming and leave you alone
Lost in a world that's all your own
Can I come, too
Blue on blue

Dreams like you are making now
Are very hard to share
All I ask is one small favor
Dream a dream and wish me there

Gold on gold, sun in your hair
Spinning the rainbow, weaving the wind
Bluing the dye for the midnight air
Counting the gold at the rainbows end
Rapier princess whispers your name
Out of the time before I came
I'll never know
Gold on gold
Dreams like you are making now
Are very hard to share
All I ask is one small favor
Dream a dream and wish me there

Blue on blue

[Verse 1: Calvin Harris]
"Counterfeit, counterfeit," that's what you're shouting at me
I could run but I'd sooner have this end amicably
Lick the blood stain from your finger, say, "What do you see?"
Remind you that whatever you get is what you want it to be
(You want it to be)

[Pre-Chorus: Calvin Harris]
You get a feeling, that's what you choose
And I was told there's not a minute to lose
So if you're waiting, jump out your skin
To find a cure for whatever state you're in
I tell my good friends, get out the way
Of all the lightning hitting the trees today
We get a thrill from clapping our hands
We find the nearest girl and ask her to dance

[Chorus: Mary Pearce]
Ooh, I put on my shoes and I'm ready for the weekend
Ooh, I put on my shoes and I'm ready for the weekend
Ooh, I put on my shoes and I'm ready for the weekend
Ooh, I put on my shoes and I'm ready for the weekend
Weekend, weekend, weekend

[Verse 2: Calvin Harris]
Coming back, coming back to a place where I never knew
Pushing knobs, pushing faders, but I don't know what they do
This reflection in my mirror reminds me of you
When I tilt it towards the sunlight, you fall out of view
(You fall out of view)

[Pre-Chorus: Calvin Harris]
You get a feeling, that's what you choose
And I was told there's not a minute to lose
So if you're waiting, jump out your skin
To find a cure for whatever state you're in
I tell my good friends, get out the way
Of all the lightning hitting the trees today
We get a thrill from clapping our hands
We find the nearest girl and ask her to dance

[Chorus: Mary Pearce]
Ooh, I put on my shoes and I'm ready for the weekend
Ooh, I put on my shoes and I'm ready for the weekend
Ooh, I put on my shoes and I'm ready for the weekend
Ooh, I put on my shoes and I'm ready for the weekend
Ooh, I put on my shoes and I'm ready for the weekend
Weekend, weekend, weekend
Ooh, I put on my shoes and I'm ready for the weekend
Weekend, weekend, weekend
Ooh, I put on my shoes and I'm ready for the weekend
Weekend, weekend, weekend
Ooh, I put on my shoes and I'm ready for the weekend
Weekend, weekend, weekend

[Verse 1]
I don't care where you came from
Oh no, I don't care what you've been
All I know is that, I love you
And I'm gonna love you 'til the end
(Gonna love you until the end)

[Chorus]
'Cause you're my
(Dream come true)
You're my
(Dream come true)
You're my
(Dream come true)
And I love you better than anyone before

[Verse 2]
For every hand there's a glove
For every, for every heart there should be love
Yes, I've been waiting for such a long, long time
Don't worry, nobody, nobody is gonna change my mind
(Nobody's gonna change my mind)

[Chorus]
'Cause you're my
(Dream come true)
You're my
(Dream come true)
You're my
(Dream come true)
And I love you better than anyone before

Yes, you're my
(Dream come true)
You're my
(Dream come true)
You're my
(Dream come true)
And I love you better than anyone before

[Outro]
(Better than anyone)
(Better than anyone)
I love you
(Better than anyone)
Than anyone before
(Better than anyone before)
A-do me right because I love you
(Better than anyone)
Keep coming 'cause I love you
(Better than anyone)

MAKE IT FUNKY!!

[Hook: Ice-T]
So the people can get down to the funky sound
Cause my crew don't mess around (MAKE IT FUNKY!!)
So the girls can get busy and dogg the dancefloor
Make the guys get dizzy (MAKE IT FUNKY!!)
Totally deaf as Evil E cuts the records and the beat is dealt (MAKE IT FUNKY!!)

[Verse One: Ice-T]
Stupid fly, it's got to the F-U-N-K-Y
So that you can get loose as I produce sounds hard as the deuce
Manipulate the bass game, give the label a boost
A lyric layer, rhyme sayer, born to be player
Politics were my kick, then I'll be your mayor
Governator, Senator, I'm your mentor
Rap rhythm is erratic, time is your four
I'm the microphone scholar, clocking on dollars
See I'm here to make the place funky while the fly girls holler
Genius, vocalist, rhyme style priceless
Pound of gold around my neck, mic in my fist
The microphone virtuoso, crazy insane, I'm loco
With the speed to exceed, that got the MC's look slow mode
Unleash release words mean as a beast
I eat MC's for lunch and dinner, I can serve for a feast
Their rhymes are elementary, mine deserve a PH.D
This beat is F-U-N-K-y, my name is Ice-T

[Chorus: DJ Evil E the Great]
MAKE IT FUNKY!! MAKE IT FUNKY!!
MAKE IT FUNKY!! MAKE IT FUNKY!!
WHORES!! Uhh!! Uhh!! Uhh!!
Uhh!! Uhh!! Uhh!! Uhh!! Uhh!! Uhh!!

[Verse Two: Ice-T]
Undoubtedly you recognize this jam is the ultimate cut
Uncontrollably you motivate and move your butt
It's rough, the beat is gangsterous, call it tough
If you're dissing, stop fronting, come on, what's up?
Complicated voice, gymnastics are all in your face
Vegas got my highs, EVs got control my bass
My break is coming to get busy, no time to waste
Now's the time do body work, here's the place

[Interlude: Ice-T]
Uhh!! Uhh!! Uhh!! Uhh!! Uhh!!
Go L.A.!! Go L.A.!! Go L.A.!! Go L.A.!! Go L.A.!! Go L.A.!!
Rock on, cold rocking the house
Aww yeah, in the place to be
Ice-T and Evil E rocking it out west, you know it buddy
Evil E, you're from Brooklyn man, let's see whose in the house out there
We're gonna check it out right now, and get cold busy as I wanna see whose in the house
Is Queens in the House? check Queens is in the House!
Is Queens in the House?
The Bridge.. Queens Bridge.. The Bridge.. Queens Bridge..
The Bridge.. The Bridge.. The Bridge.. The Bridge.. --------- MC Shan
Go Queens!! Go Queens!! Go Queens!! Go Queens!! Go Queens!! Go Queens!!

Yeah Buddy, so wherever you are from, if you with us tonight
We want you to do one thing, what you wanna do E?
Don't you wanna go up, right now and go crazy for me, you know you gotta do one thing

[Chorus: DJ Evil E the Great]
MAKE IT FUNKY!! MAKE IT FUNKY!!
MAKE IT MAKE IT MAKE IT FUNKY!!

[Verse Three: Ice-T]
Make it funky enough, so the tracks lay tough
Cause I'm tossing it up, and the Ice don't bluff
The girl charmer toy Harmer, juice strong as armor
When I stand upon the stage you could call it melodrama
Intense, suspense my voice emends
I wouldn't have you come and see me under false pretense
The girlies do be wilding, as I'm profiling
Limos lined around the block for about a mile and a half
Autographs; the list goes on
If you forgot, Make It Funky is the name of this song
Stupid dope and you know it, it rates a ten
You pray my DJ cuts the records, so it starts again
Cause I can keep the mic cooking for an entire month
My rhymes are always hard hitting, I don't know how to bunt
My DJ cuts like a laser, E-V-I-L-E
Put your finger on the records, make it Make It Funky

[Chorus: DJ Evil E the Great]
MAKE IT FUNKY!! MAKE IT FUNKY!!
MAKE IT MAKE IT MAKE IT FUNKY!!
Ho Ho Go!!
Go Ice!! Go Ice!! Go Ice!! Go Ice!! Go Ice!! Go Ice!!
Go Ice!! Go Ice!! Go Ice!! Go Ice!! Go Ice!! Go Ice!!

[Outro: Ice-T]
We gonna do it like that y'all
Evil E MAKE IT FUNKY!!
Islam MAKE IT FUNKY!!
South Bronx MAKE IT FUNKY!!
Shawnie Shawn MAKE IT FUNKY!!
Melle Mel MAKE IT FUNKY!!
TDF MAKE IT FUNKY!! ~ AWWWWWWWWWWWW!!
This is my right
A right given by god
To live a free life
To live in freedom

Talkin' about freedom
I'm talkin' about freedom
I will fight for the right
To live in freedom

Any one
Tries to take it away
You'll have to answer
Cause this is my right

I'm talkin' about freedom
I'm talkin' about freedom
I will fight for the right
To live in freedom

Yeah Oh
Im' talkin' about freedom
I'm talking about freedom
I will fight for the right
To live in freedom

Everybody talkin' about freedom
We're talkin' about freedom
We will fight for the right
To live in freedom

Oh

Talkin' about freedom
I'm talkin' about freedom
I will fight for the right
To live in freedom

Im' talkin' about freedom
Im' talkin' about freedom
We will fight for the right
To live in freedom

[Verse 1]
If I be so inclined to climb up beside you
Would you tell me that the time just isn't right?
And if I ever find the key you hide so well
Will you tell me that I can spend the night?

[Chorus 1]
Leaving your smell on my coat
Leaving your taste on my shoulder
I still fail to understand what it is about this woman

[Verse 2]
If I could bottle up the chills that you give me
I would keep them in a jar next to my bed
And If I should ever draw a picture of a woman
It is you that would come flowing from my pen

[Chorus 2]
Leaving your clothes on the floor
Making me walk out the door
And I still fail to understand what it is about this woman

[Verse 3]
Helplessly melting as I stand next to the sun
As she burns me, I am screaming out for more
Drink every drop of liquid heat that I've become
Pop me open, spill me out onto the floor

[Chorus 1]
Leaving your smell on my coat
Leaving your taste on my shoulder
I still fail to understand, fail to understand
Leaving your smell on my coat
Leaving your taste on my shoulder
I still fail to understand what it is about this woman
Here we are two very bewilder'd people
Here we are two babes that are lost in the wood
We're not quite certain what has happen'd to us
This lovely thing that's so marvelous
But right from here the future looks awfully good

Our Love Affair was meant to be
It's me for you dear and you for me
We'll fuss, we'll quarrel and tears start to brew
But after the tears
Our love will smile through

I'm sure that I could never hide
The thrill I get when you're by my side
And when we're older we'll proudly declare
Wasn't ours a lovely love affair

Our love affair will be such fun
We'll be the envy of everyone
Those famous lovers we'll make them forget
From Adam and Eve to Scarlett and Rhett
When youth has had its merry fling
We'll spend our evenings remembering
Two happy people who say on the square
Isn't ours a lovely love affair

[Ludacris] And now brothas and sistas
We present the black man's struggle...

(Straining groans and moans followed up with
Farting sounds a splash and a toilet flushing)
I-I love the colorful clothes she wears
And the way the sunlight plays upon her hair
I hear the sound of a gentle word
On the wind that lifts her perfume through the air

I'm pickin' up good vibrations
She's giving me excitations (Oom bop bop)
I'm pickin' up good vibrations (Good vibrations, oom bop bop)
She's giving me excitations (Excitations, oom bop bop)
Good, good, good, good vibrations (Oom bop bop)
She's giving me excitations (Excitations, oom bop bop)
Good, good, good, good vibrations (Oom bop bop)
She's giving me excitations (Excitations)

Close my eyes, she's somehow closer now
Softly smile, I know she must be kind
When I look in her eyes
She goes with me to a blossom world

I'm pickin' up good vibrations
She's giving me excitations (Oom bop bop)
I'm pickin' up good vibrations (Good vibrations, oom bop bop)
She's giving me excitations (Excitations, oom bop bop)
Good, good, good, good vibrations (Oom bop bop)
She's giving me excitations (Excitations, oom bop bop)
Good, good, good, good vibrations (Oom bop bop)
She's giving me excitations (Excitations)
(Ahh)
(Ah, my my, what elation)
I don't know where but she sends me there
(Oh, my my, what a sensation)
(Oh, my my, what elation)
(Oh, my my, what)

Gotta keep those lovin' good vibrations a-happenin' with her
Gotta keep those lovin' good vibrations a-happenin' with her
Gotta keep those lovin' good vibrations a-happenin'

(Ahh)

Good, good, good, good vibrations (Oom bop bop)
(I'm pickin' up good vibrations) (Oom bop bop)
She's giving me excitations (Excitations, oom bop bop)
Good, good, good, good vibrations

Na na na na na, na na na
Na na na na na, na na na (Bop bop-bop-bop-bop, bop)
Do do do do do, do do do (Bop bop-bop-bop-bop, bop)
Do do do do do, do do do (Bop bop-bop-bop-bop, bop)

[Verse 1]
Down in the cellar in the Boho Zone
I went looking for some sweet inspiration
Oh well, just another hard-time band
With Negro affectations
I was a hopeful in rooms like this
When I was working cheap
It's an old romance, the Boho dance
It hasn't gone to sleep

[Chorus 1]
But even on the scuffle
The cleaner's press was in my jeans
And any eye for detail
Caught a little lace along the seams

[Verse 2]
And you were in the parking lot
Subterranean by your own design
The virtue of your style inscribed
On your contempt for mine
Jesus was a beggar, he was rich in grace
And Solomon kept his head in all his glory
It's just that some steps outside the Boho dance
Have a fascination for me

[Chorus 2]
A camera pans the cocktail hour
Behind a blind of potted palms
And finds a lady in a Paris dress
With runs in her nylons

[Verse 3]
You read those books where luxury
Comes as a guest to take a slave
Books where artists in noble poverty
Go like virgins to the grave
Don't you get sensitive on me
'Cause I know you're just too proud
You couldn't step outside the Boho dance now
Even if good fortune allowed

[Chorus 3]
Like a priest with a pornographic watch
Looking and longing on the sly
Sure it's stricken from your uniform
But you can't get it out of your eyes

[Chorus 4]
Nothing is capsulized in me
On either side of town
The streets were never really mine
Not mine these glamour gowns

[Verse 1]
I said I never used to dig the sunshine much
Until I smoked some marijuana, man
I'm just a real chill guy beneath a pretty pink sky
And a money stack in the sand
Oh yeah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, oh yeah, yeah!

[Verse 2]
I never used to get around a lot until I got some money in my hand
I'm just a real six shooter, a sin city schooler, tokin' every time I can
Oh yeah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, oh yeah, yeah!

[Verse 3]
I said I never used to dig the sunshine much
I never knew it would be 

[?]
Where the feelings flow and pretty biddies go
To watch the flowers grow and let their bad vibes go
Oh yeah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, oh yeah, yeah!
What is there to write? What is there to say?
Same things happen everyday, not a thing to write, not a thing to say
So I take my pen in hand and start the same old way

Dear, I thought I'd drop a line, the weather's cool, the folks are fine
I'm in bed each night at nine, P. S. I love you
Yesterday we had some rain, but all in all, I can't complain
Was it dusty on the train, P. S. I love you
Write to the Browns just as soon as you're able
They came around to call, and I burned a hole in the dining room table
And let me see, I guess that's all
Nothing else for me to say, and so I'll close but by the way
Everybody's thinking of you, P. S. I love you
I do my best to obey all your wishes, I put a sign up "Think"
But I gotta buy us a new set of dishes, or wash the ones that are piled in the sink
Nothing else to tell you dear, except each day seems like a year
Every night I'm dreaming of you, P. S. I love you
Now you know some fellahs, they want fame and fortune
Yeah, and other fellahs they just wanna swing
But all I wanted all my life
Was a TV set and a truck and a wife
And a front row seat to hear ole Johnny sing

Yeah the TV and the truck I got on credit
And I got that girl with a little old Woolworth ring
And life was warm and life was sweet
But still, it was kinda incomplete
Without a front row seat to hear ole Johnny sing

Chorus:
Hey, John you walk the line
Do "Deelia" one more time
And when you do them Cottonfields
You warm this heart of mine

So, one day I thought, Hey, I'm gonna do it!
(That's what I said)
So, I mortgaged the farm and pawned her wedding ring
I sold the gold tooth out of my mouth
And jumped in the pickup and headed South
For a front row seat to hear ole Johnny sing
I hit Nashville cold and wet and hungry
I said, "I'm here, bring him on let him do his thing."
But they told me down at the Old Pit Grill
I'd have to go all the way to Andersonville
For a front row seat to hear ole Jonny sing

I found his house knocked on the door and it was opened
By a brown-haired girl and a baby with a teethin' ring
I said "I seen you somewhere before
But don't stand there and block the door
I want a front row seat to hear ole Johnny sing."

(chorus)
She said I'd have to go down to The Opry
And the feller there said I'd have to wait till Spring
He said, "We've been sold out for months and months
And this poor insane fellah wants
A front row seat to hear ole Johnny sing."

Well, he said a couple more things, and I started cryin'
And then he laughed at me and that's when I started to swing
Well I bust through the doors in a roaring rage
Crawled over the crowd till I reached the stage
For a front row seat to hear ole Johnny sing

(chrous)
Then some crazy guard started shootin'
I shot back, and the next thing I know I was winged
And on the floor
When a guy in a voice kinda deep and low
Says, "Boy that's a mighty long way to go
For a front row seat to hear ANYBODY sing."

And I guess that judge, he weren't no music lover
I got fifteen months but that don't mean a thing
'cause' yesterday in the prison yard
A show come through and HAR! de HAR!
I had a front row seat to hear ole Johnny sing

(chorus plus some typical Shel ranting and raving)

[Verse 1]
I resent you calling
I resent your voice
I resent that I don't have a choice
Anywhere I go
You are always there
Outside the car or in my hair

[Verse 2]
I think I've been here before
Yes, I've been here before
The last time you locked all the doors
And I resent you calling
I resent your voice
I resent that I don't have a choice

[Chorus]
And yes, I am wary
Yes, I am
I am

[Verse 3]
Think I've told you once
Think I needed advice
You were such a help, that's very nice
Think I've been here before
Yes, I've been here before
But this time I kick down your door

[Chorus]
Yes, I am wary
Yes, I am wary

[Instrumental Outro]
I'm so weary from holding this load
But it's only, love for you, that I walk this lonely road
I must follow the wind, follow the wind
And the wind will take me hold before the cold

Ev'ry stay I have counted
Each flower I have seen
But the place I am going, there's no grass as green
I must follow the wind, follow the wind
And the wind will take me home where I can dream

In the hour I am lonely, your love will be mine
I will stay in your arms dear, until comes the time
I must be on my way for my home is anywhere
I have no time to stay, I have no time to care
I must follow the wind, follow the wind
As the wind gently blows in my hair

I must follow the wind, follow the wind
As the wind gently blows in my hair
I must follow the wind, follow the wind
As the wind gently blows in my hair

Hey, get rhythm when you get the blues
Hey, get rhythm when you get the blues
Yes a jumpy rhythm makes you feel so fine
It'll shake all the troubles from your worried mind
Get rhythm when you get the blues

Little shoeshine boy never get slow down
But he's got the dirtiest job in town
Bendin' low at the peoples' feet
On the windy corner of the dirty street
Well, I asked him while he shined my shoes
How'd he keep from gettin' the blues
He grinned as he raised his little head
Popped a shoeshine rag and then he said

Get rhythm when you get the blues
Hey, get rhythm when you get the blues
It only costs a dime, just a nickel a shoe
Does a million dollars worth of good for you
Get rhythm when you get thee blues
Hey, get rhythm when you get the blues
Hey, get rhythm when you get the blues
Yes a jumpy rhythm makes you feel so fine
It'll shake all the troubles from your worried mind
Get rhythm when you get the blues

Well, I sat down to listen to the shoeshine boy
And I thought I was gonna jump for joy
Slapped on the shoe polish left and right
He took a shoeshine rag and he held it tight
He stopped once to wipe the sweat away
I said you're a mighty little boy to be-a workin' that way
He said I like it with a big wide grin
Kept on a poppin' and he said again

Get rhythm when you get the blues
Hey, get rhythm when you get the blues
Get a rock 'n' roll feelin' in your bones
Get taps on your toes and get gone
Get rhythm when you get the blues
I don't know why I should cry over you
Sigh over you, even be blue
I should have known that you'd leave me alone
And break my heart in two

Although you have left me alone to pine
And all of my love was a waste of time
Someday your heart will be broken like mine
So why should I cry over you?

Although you have left me alone to pine
And all of my love was a big, fat waste of time
Someday your heart will be broken like mine
So why should I cry over you?

You broke my heart, you took it apart
So pack up your baggage and beat it
Why should I cry over you?

Thank you very much
I've been in this town so long that back in the city I've been taken for a lost and gone an unknown for a long, long time
Fell in love years ago with an innocent girl from the Spanish and Indian ho-home of the Heroes and Villains

Once at night, cotillion squared the fight and she was right in the rain of the bullets that eventually brought her down
But she's still dancing in the night unafraid of what a dude'll do in a town full of Heroes and....

Heroes and Villains, just see what you've done-
Done...
Heroes and Villains, just see what you've done-
Done...

Stand or fall I know there shall be peace in the valley and it's all an affair of my life with the Heroes and Villains

In the Cantina, Margarita's keep the spirit high
There I watched her
She spun around and wound in the warmth
Her body fanned the flame of the dance-
Dance, Margarita! Don't you know that I love with you?
Dance...
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST!!!
My Children were raised, you know they suddenly rise, they started slow long ago, head-to-toe; healthy, wealthy and wise

I've been in this town so long, so long to the city
I'm fit with the stuff, to ride in the rough
And sunny-down snuff I'm alright
By the Heroes and-

Heroes and Villains, just see what you've done-
Done...
Heroes and Villains, just see what you've done-
Done...
You got, you got, you got (Woo)
Come on, baby, and show me what you got

Whiskey bottles and brand new cars
Oak tree you're in my way
There's too much coke and too much smoke
Look what's going on inside you

Ooh, that smell
Can't you smell that smell?
Ooh, that smell
The smell of death surrounds you

Angel of darkness is upon you
Stuck a needle in your arm (You fool, you)
So take another toke, have a blow for your nose
One more drink fool, would drown you (Hell, yeah)

Ooh, that smell
Can't you smell that smell?
Ooh, that smell
The smell of death surrounds you

Now they call you Prince Charming
Can't speak a word when you're full of 'ludes
Say you'll be alright come tomorrow
But tomorrow might not be here for you (Yeah, you)
Ooh, that smell
Can't you smell that smell?
Ooh, that smell
The smell of death surrounds you

Aw, you fool, you
You stick them needles in your arm
I know I been there before

One little problem that confronts you
Got a monkey on your back
Just one more fix Lord, might do the trick
One hell of a price for you to get your kicks (Hell, yeah)

Ooh, that smell
Can't you smell that smell?
Ooh, that smell
The smell of death surrounds you

Ooh, that smell
Can't you smell that smell?
Ooh, that smell
The smell of death surrounds you

Oh, you fool, you
Don't stick those needles in your arm
You're just a fool, just a fool, just a fool
Ah, look at all the lonely people
Ah, look at all the lonely people

Eleanor Rigby picks up the rice
In the church where her wedding has been
Lives in a dream
Waits at the window
Wearing the face that she keeps
In a jar by the door
Who is it for?

All the lonely people, where do they all come from ?
All the lonely people, where do they all belong ?

Father Mackenzie, writing the words to a sermon
That no one will hear
No one comes near

Look at him working
Darning his socks
In the night when there's nobody there
What does he care ?
All the lonely people, where do they all come from ?
All the lonely people, where do they all belong ?

Ah, look at all the lonely people
Ah, look at all the lonely people

Eleanor Rigby died in the church
And was buried along with her name
Nobody came

Father Mackenzie, wiping the dirt from his hands
As he walks from the grave
No one was saved

All the lonely people, where do they all come from?
(ah, look at all the lonely people)
All the lonely people, where do they all belong?
(ah, look at all the lonely people)
April skies are in your eyes, but darling, don't be blue
Don't cry, oh honey please don't be that way
Clouds in the sky should never make you feel that way
The rain will bring the violets of May
Tears are in vain, so honey please don't be that way
As long as we see it through, you'll have me, I'll have you
Sweetheart, tomorrow is another day
Don't break my heart, oh honey, please don't be that way

Don't cry, oh honey please don't be that way
Clouds in the sky should never make you feel that way
The rain will bring the violets of May
Tears in vain, so honey please don't be that way
As long as we will see it through
You'll have me and I'll have you
Sweetheart, tomorrow is another day
Don't break my heart, nh honey, please don't be that way
Don't cry, don't cry, don't cry

[Chorus]
You been bamboozled, hoodwinked, took
If you thought that you could put me down
And not get a page in my book
You been bamboozled, hoodwinked, took
Tryin' to ball, you will fall
And never get a second look

[Verse 1]
Before me there was nothing
Without the eye you cannot see
Just a form in the darkness
I brought the light and you believed
With everyone of my creations
A future story would be told (Change it up)
I tried to change it up with temptation (With temptation)
But all your claims must be sold (Walk away with soul, soul)

4 every soul there's a buyer (There's a buyer)
4 every action there's a price (How much U pay for that, dude?)
4 every option there's a tryer
But when the claim run out, ain't nothing nice
That's why...

[Chorus]
You been bamboozled, hoodwinked, took
If you thought that you could put me down
And not get a page in my book
You been bamboozled, hoodwinked, took
Tryin' to ball, you will fall
And never get a second look

I changed your name, it didn't suit ya
I did the same 4 a little while (The same 4 a little while)
The day your love led 2 revenue (Talkin' about the money)
In return a Judas smile (Hahaha, U gave me)
What I am will never fade away
Like U being funky - it'll never be
Woo hoo, (What I am) What I am U will finally see (U will see)
Then U will admit 2 4 part harmony

[Chorus]
You been bamboozled, hoodwinked, took
If you thought that you could put me down
And not get a page in my book
You been bamboozled, hoodwinked, took
Tryin' to ball, you will fall
And never get a second look
(Hoodwinked)
(Ah, come on)
1979 times 2 or maybe a bit 'fo that
Me, your sister and yo' brother got paid when the man let 'em up to bat
Whaddya do, do U act like a fool and wonder why your people disown ya?
Sang any song Mr. Charlie wanna sang, see around here we don't know ya

They'd have 2 take me out (Okay)
4 treating B like a B if she ain't one
And if she is it's no good like a rat in the hood
We gonna give her a Bible and then some
Come on! (Uh)

The chocolate invasion starts here
The chocolate invasion starts here

Neapolitan born 2 rule
I never was fond of a dumb blonde
That can't swim in the carpool
Your secret's out da box, B

Here's what we think - U're the weakest link
Get ready 'cause we coming with the old school (Old school)
Old school (Old school) {x2}
Come on, come on - give it 2 me, baby

Ahh Mr. Aussieman what makes ya think I'll work 4 U?

Pinocchio mentality on levels more than 9
From now on the only piece U'll ever get from me's my mind

Chocolate invasion starts here
Chocolate invasion starts here (Ahh)
The chocolate invasion starts here

Now wait a minute

Confess these shuffling punks (Yeah)
Everyone claiming no sin
Act the fool if U wanna
Guess the quickest way out (Tell 'em) is the way in

(Bamboozled) U been bamboozled, hoodwinked, took
If U thought that U could put me down
With a song that got no hook (Oh no)

Mighty waves come crashing down
The spray is lashing high into the eagle's eye
Shrieking as it cuts the devil wind
Is calling sailors to the deep
But I can hear the sound of seabirds in my ear
Surf is high an' the sea is awash
An' a haze of candy floss, glitter and beads
Rock that we sat on and watched in the sun

That was hot to touch
And the sea was emerald green
I can hear the sound of seabirds in my ear
And I can see you smile
Surf comes rushing up the beach
Now will it reach the castle wall and will it fall
Catfish dappled silver flashing
Dogfish puffing bubbles in my deep
I was by myself
Tryin' to get my thoughts together
Tryin' to figure out me something
That would make my life a little better
So I came up with one thing
And I don't think I'm wrong
Ain't nothing but a fool want to live his life alone

So I got to get myself somebody
Somebody to call my own
Cause it ain't nothing but a fool want to live his life all alone

From log rollers to ditch diggers
From beggars to presidents
Whoah, everybody's got somebody if they got a little sense

So I got to get myself somebody
Somebody to call my own
Ain't nothing but a fool want to live his life all alone

Gettin' used to my baby's ways is the price I'm gonna pay
Gonna love her everyday when she talk too much and not know what she say
Gonna hold on to you baby like a dog holds on to a bone
Cause nothing in this world want to live his life alone
So I got to get myself somebody
Somebody to call my own
Cause it's nothing but a fool want to live his life all alone...all alone

Well I get so lonely sometimes...so lonely
Oh I get so lonely sometimes...I'm all alone
I'm all alone...
We both acknowledge what we came here for
We take each other and walk through the open door
From the first time that I saw you
To the way you look tonight
I was shaken by your spirit
I was blinded by your light

And the world that I used to see is gone without a trace
Replaced by your eyes and the smile upon your face
And I will not turn away
'Cause you might disappear
I was haunted by your heart
And I felt that you were here

And funny when the time is right
When lightning strikes
You're not alone
Baby, I will pray for you my whole life through
This day

We'll be together
Husband and wife
Now and forever
The rest of our lives
Well, take me to Heaven
Take me tonight
There is nothing words can say
On this our wedding day
Oh, now is the hour, now is the sowing of the seed
I will take tomorrow
I will lay it at your feet
And the two of us escape from the sadness of the world
From the thunder and the darkness
From the hunger and the hurt

You know I will remember well the mission bell
That rings your name
And baby there could never be
A memory like you

We'll be together
Husband and wife
Now and forever
Lovers for life
Well, take me to Heaven
Take me tonight
There is nothing words can say
On this our wedding day

This is my pledge to you
I will follow through to the end
And we will find another plane
We'll be home again
And tonight I'm going to find true love, true love
We'll be together
Husband and wife
Now and forever
Lovers for life
Well, take me to Heaven
Take me tonight
There is nothing words can say
On this our wedding day
This our wedding day
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so very much... We've got one really nice tip we'd like to belong(?) to you, if it's at all possible, anything you can do to give us a hand to leave this area somewhat the way we found it, I don't think it'll ever be quite the same. But somewhat the way we found it certainly would be appreciated. It's been a delight seeing you. May we wish you anything that the person next to you wishes for you. Good wishes, good day and a good life... Thank You

[Verse 1]
I'm goin' down south
'Neath the borderline
I'm goin' down south
'Neath the borderline
Some fat momma
Kissed my mouth one time

[Verse 2]
Well, I knew it this morning
Without a shadow of doubt
I knew it this morning
Without a shadow of doubt
My suitcase is packed
My clothes are hangin' out

[Verse 3]
San Francisco is fine
You sure get lots of sun
San Francisco is fine
You sure get lots of sun
But I'm used to four seasons
California's got but one

[Harmonica solo]

[Verse 4]
Well, I got my dark sunglasses
I got for good luck my black tooth
I got my dark sunglasses
And for good luck I got my black tooth
Don't ask me nothin' about nothin'
I just might tell you the truth

[Verse 1]
Now I'm a guy who's fond of sweet things
Sweet things I adore
In coffee most take one or two lumps
But I use three or four
But since I kissed your sweet, sweet lips
Sugar ain't sweet no more
Your kiss was sweeter than any cup of coffee
I ever made before

[Chorus]
You're little Miss Sweetness, you're little Miss Sweetness
The sweetest girl in the world
(Sweetest girl in the world now)

[Verse 2]
If ever a man had a sweet tooth
I have one indeed
I order cookies and cakes, and malts and shakes
From the menus that I read
But all the cakes and shakes and malts I've bought
Put together don't exceed
The sweetness in just one of your kisses
Baby, you're the one I need

[Chorus]
You're little Miss Sweetness, you're little Miss Sweetness
Ooh wee, sweetest girl in the world
(Sweetest girl in the world now)

[Verse 3]
Ooh yeah, now listen to me you sweet thing
(you'd better listen to me, baby)
Hear what I have to say
(you'd better listen to me, baby)
If ever you need somebody
(you'd better listen to me, baby)
Send for me without delay
But do one thing for me
Don't ever go out on a rainy day
'Cause if it's true that rain melts sugar
You will surely melt away

[Chorus]
You're little Miss Sweetness, you're little Miss Sweetness
Sweetest girl in the world
(sweetest girl in the world now)
Oh yeah
(sweetest girl in the world now)
Sweetest little girl in the world
(sweetest girl in the world now)
Oh, sweetest girl
(sweetest girl in the world now)

You don't fit it, ask the critics, already did it, skipped the gimmicks
I don't mimic, metaphysics, you'll admit it, better to live it
Better to give it, so I spit it every minute so you get it
My lyric is wicked an' full of culture y'all
Huh? Battle, nah - get back in your car
Either you never heard of me or you really wanna get with me
But as your teacher let me test you for a learning disability
You feeling me? Cause you can't, get it through your head
This is, sui-CIDE!! You're better off dead
Let me not amp you up, cause this style you can't do what
My stomach can take it and your stomach it'll cramp you up
This is, breath control, breath control stylee
I get up all in that ass that (?) heinie
Try me, back in the days you woulda had sorrow
Try the teacher today, and you won't see tomorrow cause

[KRS-One]
Like a piss on the streets I exist
Not the meat but the fish
Complete the feat when I'm speakin the heat into this
Witness Kris rippin this
Don't trip on this, skip ahead if you're ready
My show medley is deadly
I'm about a hundred million mic years away
These players I don't hate, but I'm not here to play
I hit it all day, all night, all afternoon
Rock all mics from the days of sassoon
Where the hell was you? On the corner with rats
When we was at the LQ, lockin it down and that was that
Divine speaker, mind keeper, time teacher, time leader
I'll be sittin in the club by the speaker
Waitin for you rappers to choke up then I eat ya
Like some prehistoric winged creature, AHHH!
On your neck, like the American eagle facin East and West
I be the best, Blastmaster KRS cause

[Intro: Usher]
Oh baby
I love you
Why did you go away?

[Verse: Usher, Faith Evans]
Sitting in my window, day by day (Day by day)
Thinking of your face (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Nothing in the world so strong
To take the tears away (Take the tears away)
Since you took your love away
My heart has not a home (No, no, no)
Can't stop these tears from coming down
I just don't know what I did wrong

[Chorus: Usher & Faith Evans]
Can't stop thinking of you
And you know I don't stop, oh
My world's lost without you
I'm so lost without you, baby

[Bridge: Usher]
Baby, baby
No, no

[Chorus: Faith Evans]
Can't stop thinking of you
My world's lost without you

[Spoken Intro]
How many of you can step?
Who can step? Can you step?
Can you really step? Can you cut a rug?
Aight, so what we gonna do is slow it down
And see if you can step to this one
Another one for the ladies
Coming from the Chocolate Factory
It's the piper y'all
Your music weatherman

[Verse 1]
I can't wait 'til I hit the door
Can't wait 'til your clothes hit the floor
I want you so bad, my pretty baby
Oh, baby, you should know how I feel
When it comes down to making love with you (whoa)

[Pre-Chorus]
So come on (come on), lets get on this plane of love, baby
And fly through the night
And our destination is wherever your spot is, baby (oh baby)
And woman please believe me I'm gonna drive you crazy, so

[Chorus]
Welcome to (welcome to) the greatest show on Earth (the greatest show)
Welcome, baby, to my bedroom girl (hello)
Welcome to the greatest show on Earth
Girl, welcome to the greatest show on earth
What you're about to witness is unheard...

[Verse 2]
I'll be kissing places on you (kissing you, baby)
All the way from your head to toe and everything in between
I promise to keep you a happy camper
While we make history (Lord have mercy)
Tonight we'll rescue love and set it free
'Cause that's how it's supposed to be
Oh baby, tonight we'll reach the skies
Just you and me girl, 'cause
All I want, all I need, is you here loving me tonight, girl

[Pre-Chorus]
So come on (come on) and let's get on this plane of love baby
We'll fly through the night (girl through the night)
And our destination is wherever your spot is, baby (oh baby)
And I guarantee (my body) I'm gonna drive you crazy
Girl, like a circus when it comes to town
(So many bills in my switch, flips and tricks, in places all around)
Oh baby, come on, girl
I'll be kissing you, baby, up and down
Giving it to you round and round
So...

[Chorus]
Welcome to (welcome to the greatest) the greatest show on Earth
(Welcome baby, baby, to my, girl, my bedroom)
Welcome to (welcome to the greatest) the greatest show on Earth
Baby, welcome to the greatest show
Hope you will enjoy, just sit back and relax
I'm gonna try and make this one hell of a night you won't forget
What you are about to witness is unheard
So welcome to the greatest...woo....show on Earth

[Outro]
Happy People, baby, it's the Chocolate Factory
And the love lines are open and we want you to call us at
1-2-3-L-O-V-E
We wanna send out a shout out to all the birthday people
All the birthday people today
So we gonna send this one out to y'all
Happy People, baby!
So you think the girl is crazy
To eat up your lies like it's good
(Your lies like apple pie)
(She don't even cry)

She is not a fool
She's just tryin to do
What her heart says do
To love you

And as you take to the wind
(to the wind again she breaks down)
And as she breaks down within
(within within)

She waits for you patiently
Hoping that some day you'll see
All she really wants to be
Is yours and yours alone eternally

What do you want the girl to do
Don't you know you're breaking the child in two
What do you want the girl to do
All she really wants is you
She knows what you are
Still she'll be your queen if you'll let her
(Just say the word today)
Oh if you'll let her
(Build the world around her)

Now and then you'll promise
All the way-out things you're going to get her
(You will see you will see)
Maybe she knows better

(So damn glad you found her found her)
As she watched you come and go
(All your show)
And as she watched your promises erode

She waits for your patiently
Hoping that some day you'll see
All she really wants to be is yours and yours alone
Eternally

What do you want the girl to do
Can't you see you're breaking the child in two
What do you want the girl to do
All she really wants is you
What do you want the girl to do
Don't you know you're breaking the child in two
What do you want the girl to do
Can't you see you're breakin' the child in two

[Verse 1]
Hanging down from my window
Those are my wind chimes
On the warm breeze the little bells
Tinkle like wind chimes
Though it's hard I try not to look at my wind chimes
Now and then a tear rolls off my cheek

[Verse 2]
Close your eyes and lean back now listen to wind chimes
In the late afternoon you're hung up on wind chimes
Though it's hard I try not to look at my wind chimes

(Instrumental and Wordless Vocals Outro)

[rapping: T-Pain]
Man I been gone for way to long
When I come back I snap on niggas
Deficatition is an assessity
I had to crap on niggas
And it's not even the trust nigga my daddy told me too
You can lay in yo bed scared of what them Nappy Boys would do
I was planning taking a break
But you niggas done brought me out
You was making songs like crazy
Now it's a musicial drought
Now I got them versions on the lowest price around
Hundred thousand dollars for that T-Pain's sound (T-Pain's sound)

[Hook: Karaoke Sample]
Why you wanna do some shit I did in '03?
But don't act like you know...

NAPPY BOOYYY
There's nothing left for me of days that used to be
I live in memory among my souvenirs
Some letters tied with blue, photograph or two
I see a rose from you among my souvenirs
A few more tokens rest within my treasure chest
And though they do their best to give me consolation
I count them all apart and as the teardrops start
I find a broken heart among my souvenirs

A few more tokens rest within my treasure chest
And though they do their best to give me consolation
I count them all apart and as the teardrops start
I find a broken heart among my souvenirs
Another day another mountain
Who's to say they never move
'Cause we moved one after another
Till there was nothing left to prove

Then we turned around and tossed it
After all that we'd been through
When I look at what it cost us
I guess it's time I faced the truth

Maybe I lost it
When I lost you
Maybe I lost it
When I lost you

The night we climbed above the ruins
The gypsies sang those ancient Spanish blues
I saw a man awake but still dreaming
I saw myself in love with you

I walk around I think about it
And all the things that we went through
To tell you the truth

Maybe I lost it
When I lost you
Maybe I lost it.. yeah lost it
When I lost you

I walk around I think about it
And all the things that we went through
The more I think about it
It wasn't you.. that I lost
No no

Was it the dream or just the notion
Well I lost it.. when I lost you

I had it.. maybe I lost it
Yeah lost it.. when I lost you
I had it in the palm of my hand
And baby I lost it
I lost it.. when I lost you

I had it.. had it.. had it
Whoah I had it yeah
And I lost you
Hey hey hey
Hey hey hey
I lost it
When I lost you
Gather everyman, gather everywoman
Celebrate your lives, give thanks for your children
When will there be a harvest for all the people
When will there be a harvest for the world
Beautiful miracle, pardon my lyrical rhapsody
But can't you see, you've captured me
Being so glamorous, can't you be amorous just with me?
Make it soon, take a look at the moon

Love is just around the corner, any cozy little corner
Love is just around the corner when I'm around you
I'm a sentimental mourner, and I couldn't be a loner
When you keep me in a corner just waiting for you
Venus de Milo was noted for her charms
But strictly between us, you're outer than Venus
And what's more you got arms
So cuddle in a corner, any cozy corner
Love is just around the corner and I'm around you
Hey mama, don't you treat me wrong
Come and love your daddy all night long
All right, hey, hey, all right now
See the girl with the diamond ring
She knows how to shake that thing
All right, hey, hey, mmm, all right now
Ahhh, ohh, ahhh, ohh, ahhh, ohh, ohh
Make me feel so good, make me feel so good right now
Make me feel so good, make me feel so good right now
Make me feel so good, make me feel so good
Mmm, see the girl with the red dress on
She can do the dog all night long
All right, hmm what'd I say, tell me what'd I say
Tell me what'd I say, tell me what'd I say right now
Tell me what'd I say, tell me what'd I say right now
Tell me what'd I say, tell me what'd I say
Ahhh, ohh, ahhh, ohh, ahhh, ohh, ohh
It's all right, it's all right right now
Baby, it's all right, baby, it's all right right now
Baby, it's all right, oh yeah!
Baby shake that thing, baby shake that thing right now
Baby shake that thing, baby shake that thing right now
Baby shake that thing, well I feel all right
In my heart is where I long for you
In my smile I search for you
Each time you turn and run away I cry inside
My silly way, just too young to know any more
In my world the devil dances and dares
To leave my soul just anywhere
Until I find peace in this world
I'll sing a song everywhere I can
Just too young to know any more
The wind covers me cold
The starry skies all around my eyes
Far behind the city moans
Well worthy of the people there
Oh, the psalms they love to hear
So let me sing a song for you
Just to help your day along
Let me sing a song for you
One I've known so very long
Oh, please could you find the time

[Luda] Damn, man I can't believe them hoes ain't come over here man

[I-20] Nigga I can't believe you told them hoes the truth! You never tell hoes the truth!
(Phone rings)

[Both] Yeah! Yeah! Second chance, second chance!

[Mama] And stop wearing your brother's damn chain! Who the hell car is in my driveway?!

[Girl] Oh hell no

[I-20] Ah oooh noo
Well, it seems every night and day, I get to lose
And I always held the faith inside
That love would find a way
And I always reached for more than the others ever saw
I was always the first to follow my foolish prayer
And the feeling that I have is more than any soul could bear
Hold me when I wake
Then I can be sure of who I am
I'm half the man I should be, when you're gone

And you're telling me this is love
But just in case, keep my heart in a secret place
Safe under lock and key, 'til I know it's only me
One of us got to be the one that's true
One for the other and the love comes through
Right here or out in space
Give my heart to you, babe, but just in case
Yeah, just in case

Tell the world that I've come to claim your tomorrows
Let the universal word go out a million miles away
And let history show
On the wind the seed is sown
We are living in a time where the tears fall where they might
But we hear each other much more than those who see
We are not alone
Love is there for everyone who needs
And for anyone who cries
I will always have you here with me
Ohh
And you're telling me this is love
But just in case, keep my heart in a secret place
Safe under lock and key
'Til I know it's only me
One of us has got to be the one that's true
One for the other and the love comes through
Yours, mine, and face to face
Give my heart to you
But just in case
Yeah, just in case

Ahhh, ohhh baby, ahhh, ohhh, ohhh baby, ahhh

And you're telling me this is love
But just in case, keep my heart in a secret place
Safe under lock and key
'Til I know it's only me
One of us has got to be the one that's true
One for the other and the love comes through
Yours, mine, and face to face
You are my favorite girl
I was your favorite guy
And somehow I thought that we'd always be down (down)
We went through crazy times
Inside this crazy mind
Somehow I thought that you would always be around
Somehow we changed up, we flamed up
And every day you're fighting with me
(baby, baby, baby)
And then it came up, I asked did you love me
Who knew that would be the last time we speak

[Chorus]
All I could say is why (why, why)
What did I do? What did I say? I didn't see this coming
All I can say is
Why why, why why why why why why why why
For the last two months I was
Kissing you goodbye
Bye bye bye bye bye bye bye
Kissing you goodbye
Bye bye bye bye bye bye bye

[Verse]
Behind your lovely eyes
Couldn't see those lovely thighs
That couldn't break her in over a course of time
You could unbreak this glass heart
By just saying we're not apart
By how can I go on knowing my love is blind?
So many makes ups, So many break ups
I never thought I'd see u leave, (you leave, you leave)
I'ma put it to rest; because all I want is the best for you
You still haven't told me how I hurt so I deserve the answer to

[Chorus]
Why (why, why)
What did I do? What did I say? I didn't see this coming
All I can say is
Why why, why why why why why why
For the last two months I was
Kissing you goodbye
Bye bye bye bye bye bye bye
Kissing you goodbye
Bye bye bye bye bye bye bye

[Verse]
All baby how, can you leave me like this
Through all the smiles, and all the cries
The love we had I thought was divide
No why, could u do me like this
I guess love question lesson would have learned to say
There are no real answers to

[Chorus]
Why (why, why) ohhhhhhhhhh
What did I do? What did I say? I didn't see this coming
Ohhhhhhhhhhhhh
Why why, ahhh baby why
For the last two months I was
Kissing you goodbye
Bye bye bye bye bye bye bye
Baby whyyy, shawty why
You are my favorite girl
I was your favorite guy
And somehow I thought that we'd always be down (down)

[Chorus 1]
He came down from Trinity
A midtown boy from home
In the dirt walking miles before
And dreaming of his thirst

[Chorus 2]
Oh, on his way
He had to go
Oh, on his way
He had to go

[Chorus 1]
He came down from Trinity
A midtown boy from home
In the dirt walking miles before
And dreaming of his thirst

[Chorus 2]
Oh, on his way
He had to go
Oh, on his way
He had to go

[Verse 1: Nathan Morris]
I was lonely
I needed someone to see me through
And I was at the end of my rope
I needed someone to cut me lose

[Pre-Chorus]
And then an angel, out of the blue
Gave me the sense that I might make it through
And somehow I survived, with no rhyme or reason
And now I know I'll make it
Through the miracle of you

[Chorus]
I know the color of love
And it lives inside of you
I know the color of truth
(It's in the image of you)
If it comes from the heart
Then you know that it's true
It will color your soul, like a rainbow
(Like a rainbow)
And the color of love is in you
Colors, the colors, the colors, the colors of...
Colors, the colors, the colors, the colors of...
Colors, the colors, the colors, the colors of...
The colors of love

[Verse 2: Shawn Stockman]
Like a bridge
Over troubled, troubled water
You stood beside me, stood beside me
And your love, did not falter

[Pre-Chorus]
And then the angel, angel in you
Gave me the strength to know that I will get through
And that's how I survived
Ain't no other reason
And now I know I'll make it
Through the miracle of you

[Chorus]
I know the color of love
And it lives inside of you
I know the color of truth
(It's in the image of you)
If it comes from the heart
Then you know that it's true
It will color your soul, like a rainbow
(Like a rainbow)
And the color of love is in you
Colors, the colors, the colors, the colors of...
Colors, the colors, the colors, the colors of...
Colors, the colors, the colors, the colors of...
The colors of love

[Bridge: Wanya Morris]
So girl I want to thank you
I can't thank you enough
For showing me the meaning
The meaning of true love
When I was lost and so in need, you opened up your heart
When I needed you to comfort me, you opened up your arms
I couldn't face another day
You said don't be afraid
You showed my heart the, showed me the way...

[Chorus]
I know the color of love
And it lives inside of you
I know the color of truth
(It's in the image of you)
If it comes from the heart
(Comes from the heart)
Then you know that it's true
It will color your soul, like a rainbow
(Like a rainbow)
And the color of love is in you
Colors, the colors, the colors, the colors of...
Colors, the colors, the colors, the colors of...
Colors, the colors, the colors, the colors of...
The colors of love

Oh, the color of you...

[Skit: Keith B-Real & Jada Pinkett Smith]
I am Keith B-Real, story breaker, keepin' it real here

Charlie, you need to stop grabbin' up on me
Anyway, this is Keith B-Real, I'll be right back
Charlie, you gon' get enough of grabbin' up on me, man
I took a walk and sat down in a park
The gardener walked out and the sprinklers went on
They watered the lawn and I went to sleep

Ten thirty I turned my radio on
Some group was playing a musical song
It wasn't too long and I went to sleep

Again at the park on a nice summer day
High up above me the trees gently sway
A bird flew away and I went to sleep
Ohp!
That did it
See this guy over here? That's my cousin, Brian Wilson
Of course I'm his cousin too, don't forget, I'm Mike Love, Brian Wilson's cousin!
This guy is always bragging about how athletic he was in high school and everything
Throw, throw a football seventy-five yards and all that
So we made up a song and it goes like this

When some loud braggart tries to put me down
And says his school is great I tell him right away
Now what's the matter buddy, ain't you heard of my school
It's number one in the state

(Hey, hey, take it away, let's call it fight)

So be true to your school now
(Rah-rah-rah-rah, sis-boom-bah)
Just like you would to your girl or guy
(Rah-rah-rah-rah, sis-boom-bah)
Be true to your school now
(Rah-rah-rah-rah, sis-boom-bah)
And let your colors fly
(Rah-rah-rah-rah, sis-boom-bah)
Be true to your school
(Rah, rah-rah-rah)
I got a letterman's sweater with a letter in front
I got for footbal and track, I'm proud to where it now
When I cruise around the other parts of the town
I got my decal in back

So be true to your school now
(Rah-rah-rah-rah, sis-boom-bah)
Just like you would to your girl or guy
(Rah-rah-rah-rah, sis-boom-bah)
Be true to your school now
(Rah-rah-rah-rah, sis-boom-bah)
And let your colors fly
(Rah-rah-rah-rah, sis-boom-bah)
Be true to your school

Alright, hit it

(Rah, rah-rah-rah)

On Friday we'll be jacked up on the football game
And I'll be ready to fight, we're gonna smash 'em now
My girl will be working on her pom poms now
And she'll be yelling tonight

So be true to your school now
(Rah-rah-rah-rah, sis-boom-bah)
Just like you would to your girl or guy
(Rah-rah-rah-rah, sis-boom-bah)
Be true to your school now
(Rah-rah-rah-rah, sis-boom-bah)
And let your colors fly
(Rah-rah-rah-rah, sis-boom-bah)
Be true to your school
(Rah-rah-rah-rah, sis-boom-bah)
Donât let it down
(Rah-rah-rah-rah, sis-boom-bah)
Donât put it down
(Rah-rah-rah-rah)

Partna, just listen

If you don't want those things to click-clack
Take a few steps back
Because I'm playin' for keeps, go ahead keep playin' with me
And watch how I hit 'em in the head once again

For those who didn't believe in the kid
Y'all might as well be dead
Because what y'all thought couldn't be done, I did
I'm like Ray Charles dawg, I don't see none of y'all

I'm blind to the fact that half of y'all rap, and I'm outrunnin' y'all
When I hit 'em from the back
I got them mamis saying dammit man
When I put it in they mouth

I got them mamis saying duh-huh-huh-muhh (Time out, woo!)

Pitbull's that underrated, underdog, killin' the underground
But that's just an understatement
It's hard to understand why I'm still underpaid
Just look in my blue eyes and see the hunger and pain, dammit man
But I don't plan it man, because I do what I wanna do, move what I wanna move
Y'all gonna see what I mean when I live out my dreams
Imma tell you like Biggie told me, cash rules everything around me
I could give a fuck about what you say about me
'Cause when those things get pulled out and squeezed, they'll spray about three

Hit 'em up, wet 'em up, get 'em up, give it up, that's how it goes
Pit's gon' spit it up, flip it up, rip it up, but I'm a pro (Time out, woo!)
Hit 'em up, wet 'em up, get 'em up, give it up, that's how it goes
Pit's gon' spit it up, flip it up, rip it up, but I'm a pro
So all y'all amateur ass niggas do-don't try to sit home
Pit's co-co-comin', runnin' gunnin' fo-for that throne

When you see them boys 'round your way, holla dammit man! (Dammit man!)
When you see them boys 'round your way, holla dammit man! (Dammit man!)

This town is a lonely town
Not the only town like-a this town
This town is a make-you town
Or a break-you-town and bring-you-down town

This town is a quiet town
Or a riot town like this town
This town is a love-you town
And a shove-you-down and push-you-'round town

This town is an all-right town
For an uptight town like-a this town
This town, it's a use-you town
An abuse-you town until-you're-down town

This town is a losin' town
It's a miserable town
It's a nowhere town
And I am leavin' this town
You better believe that I'm leavin' this town
Man, it could never be uptown
It's bound to be downtown
This town, bye-bye
Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye-bye
Intro:
He's Bionic! (x4)
He's Bionic! He's Bionic! He's Bionic, Bionic, Bionic, Bionic!
He's Bionic! Aaah Bionic! (x2)

Verse 1: Yella
There's no measure of the skills that are in his hands
People ask "Is he machine or man?"
Positions what he's called or just Dr Dre
People take a look cos he's your future DJ
When he cuts the beat you all will know
Because his records start to smoke and then his turntables glow
If you're a sucka DJ then you'll have a comic
Step to the front if you like embarassment

Chorus:
He's Bionic! Yes!
He's Bionic! So fresh!
*repeat*

Verse 2: Yella
Acquired the skill that you must learn
To become a DJ Doctor, not a grabbin turn
Always seen wit you nurses by his side
And you can bet that the Doctor keeps them satisfied
His supersonic speed is his ace in the hole
Over all the top DJ's, Dr Dre's in control
He operates in LA cos it's the place to be
He's B-I-O-N-I-C
Chorus
Verse 3: Yella
Now as the wheels start burnin and the mixer explodes
The wax from his discs will make you suckas corrode
Radiation level rises to degrees unknown
The circuits overloaded then your speakers are blown
Now ya hear a loud thunder that vibrates the ground
Cos his hands are movin faster than the speed of sound
Everybody runs and they try to avoid
But it's too late cos the place is already destroyed
Chorus
Here I come to save the day

A little boy inside a dream just the other day
His mind fell out of his face and the wind blew it away
A hand came out from heaven and pinned a badge on his chest
It said "Get out there, man, and do your best" ooh

They call him Astro Man
And he's flyin' higher than
That faggot Superman ever could

Oh, they call him Cosmic Nut
And he's twice as dense as Donald Duck
And he'll try his best to screw you up
The rest of your mind
Oh, regard my baby, come on!

Astro Man, flyin' across the sky two times higher
Than that old faggot Superman ever, ever could
Ever could, yeah
Ha
There he goes, there he goes
Where he stops, no one knows
There he goes, there he goes, ya
He's tryin' to, tryin' to blow out the rest of your mind
He's gonna blow out the rest of your mind
Talkin' about lookin' for peace of mind
Astro Man will leave it in pieces
Have you put our trouble behind him, yeah
Make you fly around in pieces
Yeah, blow out the rest of your mind
Astro Man will blow out the rest of your mind
He's gonna blow out the rest of your mind
Hoo-hoo, ye-ye-ye-yeah, blow out the rest, blow out the rest of
Your mind
I want to go home but I ain't got sufficient clothes
Doggone my bad luck soul
I ain't got no money and my job's done closed
I would call that old woman but I'm afraid that she may explode

My wife done quit me, my girlfriend too
Doggone my bad luck soul
I ain't got nobody and I don't know what to do
They say things will get better but I don't believe it's true

I thought I had friends but they all disappeared
Doggone my bad luck soul
Everything I do people, everything I do seems to be wrong
It wouldn't be so bad if I knew I had a home
Merry Christmas baby
Babe you sure did treat me nice
Yeah! Merry Merry Merry Christmas baby
Babe you sure did treat me nice
Gave me a diamond ring for Christmas
And now I'm living in paradise

Oh! I'm feeling mighty fine this morning
I've got good music on my radio
Hey baby, I'm feeling mighty fine
I've got good music on my radio
I would love to hug and kiss you baby
While you're standing beneath the mistletoe

Santa came down the chimney
About half past three
He got all of these presents that you'll use
See, I'll help you put on these

Merry Merry Merry Christmas baby
Oh! You sure been good to me
I haven't had a drink this evenin' baby
But I'm all lit up like a Christmas tree
Hey! Merry Merry Merry Christmas baby
I've got good music on my radio
I said, Merry Merry Merry Christmas baby
I've got good music on my radio
I would love to hug and kiss you baby
While you're standing beneath the mistletoe
My left shoe's on my right foot
My right shoe's on my left
Oh, listen to me Mimi
Of reason I'm bereft
The buttons of my trousers
Are buttoned to my vest
Oh, listen to me Mimi
Mere passion's in my breast
Mimi, you funny little good for nothing Mimi
Am I the guy?
Mimi, you sunny little honey of a Mimi
I'm aiming high
Mimi, you've got me sad and dreamy
You could free me, if you'd see me
Mimi, you know I'd like to have
A little son of a Mimi bye and bye

I'm 6 cKars, 10 chains, 12 earring
Still got my Jacob watch but customized my brightlen
How much it cost
It cost AR-15
So Icey Ent. we tatted like a bike gang
No shirt n da club let my chain swang
So Icey Boys n we rockin like a rock band
Gucci Mane save money like a white mane

[Chorus x2]

[Verse 1]
Out on some borderline
Some mark of in between
I lay down golden in time and woke up vanishing

[Verse 2]
Sweet bird you are
Briefer than a falling star
All these vain promises on beauty jars
Somewhere with your wings on time you must be laughing

[Verse 3]
Behind our eyes
Calendars of our lives
Circled with compromise
Sweet bird of time and change, you must be laughing
Up on your feathers laughing

[Verse 4]
Golden in time
Cities under the sand
Power, ideals and beauty fading in everyone's hands

[Verse 5]
Give me some time
I feel like I'm losing mine
Out here on this horizon line
With the earth spinning and the sky forever rushing

[Verse 6]
No one knows
They can never get that close
Guesses at most
Guesses based on what each set of time and change is touching

[Outro]
Guesses based on what each set of time and change is touching
Guesses based on what each set of time and change is touching
Jackson made twenty tapes in a day
To give away
A give away

And he play
The tunes they'd call creative when they're running out of names
Heaven knows he's really torn it now
But the names it hurt poor Jackson stopped the haters in his way
Heaven knows he's for it

Sha-a-a-me!
Hey hey
He was never quite unsure but really sane
Wants to play

Jackson stole twenty souls in a day
To take away
A take away
He takes away
And no complaints
Heart's upon his sleeve and his blade
Wood Jackson took the beating every day, given out, passed away, another way
Hey hey
Just wants to play
And how he played
The mob they bleed and tremble when they're running after life
Heaven knows he's really torn it now
The words that killed Wood Jackson's friends were written on the wall
Heaven knows he's for it
Shame!
Just wants to play
It's a shame
Shame
It's a shame
Wants to play
It's a shame
It's a shame
Just wants to play
And the hardest part
Was letting go, not taking part
Was the hardest part

And the strangest thing
Was waiting for that bell to ring
It was the strangest start

I could feel it go down
Bittersweet, I could taste in my mouth
Silver lining the cloud
Oh, and I
I wish that I could work it out

And the hardest part
Was letting go, not taking part
You really broke my heart, oh

And I tried to sing
But I couldn't think of anything
And that was the hardest part, oh, oh
I could feel it go down
You left the sweetest taste in my mouth
You're silver lining the cloud
Oh, and I
Oh, and I
I wonder what it's all about

I wonder what it's all about

Everything I know is wrong
Everything I do, it just comes undone
And everything is torn apart

Oh, and that's the hardest part
That's the hardest part
Yeah, that's the hardest part
That's the hardest part
Pardon me , if I use you in my dreams
You throw those angel eyes at me
Or could the beautiful woman be more than she seems
But she is not in love with me
All of my life I been looking for someone to carry my love away
A chip on my shoulder , a misery , suddenly there you are
Nobody knows , but she knows that I love her
It's got to be growing
I can't wait no longer

Life goes on for the lonely man
When love goes wrong only love knows why
Life goes on for the lonely man
We'll be the dreams , we'll be the seasons
You and I , I

Suddenly , all the world gets in the way
You disappear into the crowd
Maybe the beautiful woman never really came
But I still call your name out loud
I wanna know you , but I never met you
Reality can be cruel
If a wandering soul meets another
They shouldn't be separated
Better in love with your head on my shoulder
But I'll never be satisfied
And if I can't see you
Life goes on for the lonely man
When love goes wrong , only love knows why
Life goes on for the lonely man
We'll be the dreams , we'll be the seasons
You and I , I

Living your life in someone else's heart
A lover's dream that has no end
There may be somebody you can base your world upon
I'll never be the same again
And there's a part of me here
And there's a part of me with you
But all of me loves you
Nobody gave me the feeling you gave me
I'm so proud of
All of my days I will be here for you
And the love keeps running
And if I can't hold you

Life goes on for the lonely man
And there's a million words for the one goodbye
Life goes on for the lonely man
We'll be the dreams, we'll be the seasons
You and I , I
Life goes on for the lonely man
And there's a million words for the one goodbye
Life goes on for the lonely man
We'll be the dreams, we'll be the seasons
You and I , I

[Verse 1]
All my life I've kept my feelings deep inside
Never was a reason to let somebody know
"Lover here, lover there" - Who cried? Who cared? Foolish pride
"Never was a good seat at any of this man's shows"

[Chorus 1]
Until now all I wanted to do is
Do do do what I do, and
Bang bang bang on the drummer
And love so-and-so

[Chorus 2]
But now I've got to let it go
Lay back and let the vibe just flow
I wanna just let it go
Lay back and let my feelings show
I'm ready for the real
Give me something I can feel

[Verse 2]
All my life this heart's been under lock and key
My curtains were drawn, there wasn't nobody home
Trigger here, Trigger there - everybody's high except for me
Better off dead if I couldn't be alone

[Chorus 1]
Until now all I wanted to do is
Do do do what I do, and
Bang bang bang on the drummer
And love so-and-so

[Chorus 2]
But now I've got to let it go
Lay back and let the vibe just flow
I wanna just let it go
Lay back and let my feelings show
I'm ready for the real...

[Bridge - Rap]
They call me the ego of rhyme, Young Soldier Of Time
From the past 2 the future while my world be spinnin'
200 and one, another century arrived
Thought I wasn't gonna make 2 see the year '95
Now 

[95] years, ah, they come-a
Brothers got smoked and brothers went under
I gots 2 letitgo, I gots 2 let my vibe flow
I gots 2 be real in 9-4
I gots 2 make my ends meet, a young soldier don't sleep
I just do it right, I gots 2 make the 

[sound check]
Tryin' 2 check me, but they can't f--k with the Y.S.O.T
Yeah, and I'm out

[Verse 3]
Fourteen years and tears I've longed to sing my song
But a horse couldn't drag your ass to put me on
But now I've got an army and we're three million strong
This song will ring in your ears when we are gone

[Chorus 1]
Until now all I wanted to do is
Do do do what I do, and
Bang bang bang on the drummer
And love so-and-so

[Chorus 2]
But now I've got to let it go
Lay back and let the vibe just flow
I wanna just let it go
Lay back and let my feelings show
I'm ready for the real
Give me something I can feel
Come all you young fellers so young and so fine
Seek not your fortune in the dark dreary mine
It'll form as a habit it'll seed in your soul
Till the blood in your veins runs black as the coal

For it's dark as a dungeon and it's damp as the dew
Where the dangers are double the pleasures are few
Where the rain never falls the sun never shines
Oh God, it's dark as a dungeon way down in the mines

Oh, it's many a man I've known in my day
Who lived just to labor his whole life away
Like a fiend for his dope a drunkard his wine
A man will have lust for the lure of the mine

Oh,I hope when I die and the ages do roll
Yes, my body will harden and turn into coal
And I look from the door of my heavenly home
To see a poor miner a diggin' my bones
Gotta keep movin'
Gotta keep movin'
Hellhound on my trail
Hellhound on my trail

If today was Christmas day
If today was Christmas day
And tomorrow was Christmas Eve
Lord, wouldn't we have a time boys

I gotta keep on movin'
Gotta keep on movin'
That hellhound is on my trail
Hellhound on my trail
It's early in the morning and I can't get right
'Cause I had a little date with my baby last night

Now it's early in the morning
It's early in the morning
It's early in the morning
And I ain't got nothin' but the blues

I went to all the places where we used to go
I went to her house but she don't live there no more

And it's early in the morning
It's early in the morning
It's early in the morning
And I ain't got nothin' but the blues
I went to her girlfriend's house, but she was out
I knocked on her door and her mother started to shout
"Get away from here!"

Too early in the morning
It's early in the morning
It's early in the morning
And I ain't got nothin' but the blues
Went to Jenny Lou's to get something to eat
The waitress looked at me, she said, "B., you sure look beat"
It's early in the morning, baby
Early in the morning
It's early in the morning
And I ain't got nothin' but the blues

Had a lot of money when I first started out
I couldn't find my baby, now my money's run out

Now it's early in the morning
It's early in the morning
It's early in the morning
And I ain't got nothin' but the blues

It's early in the morning
I ain't got nothin' but the blues

[Verse: Bret, Jemaine, Both]
Lives are like retractable pencils
If you push them too hard, they're gonna break
And people are like paper dolls
Paper dolls and people, they're a similar shape
Love is like a roll of tape
It's real good for making two things one
But just like that roll of tape
Love sometimes breaks off before you are done
Another way that love is similar to tape
That I've noticed
Is sometimes, it's hard to see the end
You search 'round the roll (Search 'round the roll)
You search 'round the roll (Searching 'round the roll)
You search 'round the roll (Search)
With your fingernail
Again and again and again and again
And again

[Chorus]
Whoa-oh
Brown paper, white paper
Stick it together with the tape
The tape of love (The sticky stuff)
Whoa-oh
Brown paper, white paper
Stick it together with the tape
The tape of love (The sticky stuff)

[Spoken]
You know, recently, I've been thinking about love. About mutual love, where two... things love each other mutually. And, um... I guess I've realized that of all the things we're given, that love... is the very strongest adhesive. Yeah. Jemaine?
Oh, sorry? Sorry, what- what were you saying?
Oh, I was- I just- I don't wanna say it again

[Chorus]
Brown paper, white paper
Stick it together with the tape
The tape of love (The sticky stuff)

[Bridge]
Ooh!
People, people, paper, paper
Paper, paper, people, people
People, people, pencil, pencil
Pencil, pencil, paper, paper
Put the pencil to the paper
Give the paper to the people
Let the people read about the sellotape
Oh baby, baby, yeah!

[Chorus]
Brown paper, white paper
Stick it together with the tape
The tape of love

[Outro]
Stick! Sticky, sticky!
Stick, stick! Stick it together!
Yeah, yeah!
Best of friends
Never part
Best of fools has loved forever
From the bottom of his heart

So why pretend
This is the end
You'll have to find out for yourself
Go on ask somebody else

Why can't you just get it through your head
It's over, it's over now
Yes, you heard me clearly now I said
It's over, it's over now

I'm not really over you
You might say that
I can't take it, I can't take it
Lord, I swear I just can't take it no more

(Go away) go away
(Far away) so far away
It's too late to turn back now
And it don't matter anyhow
'Cause you were right
I'm to blame
Can't go on the same old way
Can't keep up the same old game

Why can't you just get it through your head
It's over, it's over now
Yes, you heard me clearly now I said
It's over, it's over now

I'm not really over you
You might say that
I can't take it, I can't take it
Lord, I swear I just can't take it no more

Why can't you just get it through your head
It's over, it's over now
Yes, you heard me clearly now I said
It's over, it's over now

[Verse 1: Eddie Kendricks]
I ain't got time to think about money
Or what it can buy
And I ain't got time to sit down and wonder
At what makes a birdie fly

[Pre-Chorus: Eddie Kendricks]
I don't have time to think about
What makes a flower grow
And I never given a thought
To where rivers flow

[Chorus: Eddie Kendricks + (The Temptations)]
(Too busy thinking about my baby)
Oh yeah
Ain't got time for nothing else

[Verse 2: Eddie Kendricks]
I ain't got time to discuss the weather
Or how long it's gonna last
And I ain't got time to do no studying
Once I get out of class

[Pre-Chorus: Eddie Kendricks]
And I'm just a fella
With a one, a one track mind
And when it comes to thinking about anything but my baby
I just dont have time

[Chorus: Eddie Kendricks + (The Temptations)]
(Too busy thinking about my baby)
Oh yeah
Ain't got time for nothing else
And I know it's all, it's alright

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3: Eddie Kendricks]
I ain't got time to read a newspaper
Or look at TV
And I'm not concerned with what the future holds
In store for me

[Pre-Chorus: Eddie Kendricks]
I'm just a fella
With a one, a one track mind
And when it comes to thinking about anything but my baby
I just dont have time

[Chorus: Eddie Kendricks + (The Temptations)]
(Too busy thinking about my baby)
Oh yeah
Ain't got time for nothing else
You know I'm too, too busy
(Too busy thinking about my baby)
Oh baby
Ain't got time for nothing else
Lost again
I see it in your eyes you feel alone again
I made it just in time to break your fall again
You thought you'd come so far, but here we are again
Down again
I see it on your face the hope is gone just when
You thought the pieces fit, but you fell apart again
And as I was before, here I am again

But if you could see Beyond The Tears
You'd know love won't desert you
To see beyond the tears, you know I'll never hurt you
To see the sun behind the rain, feel the joy behind the pain
You know you'll see me standin' right beyond the tears

Once again, I see it in your look, you're feelin' lost again
And now you are afraid to try your love again
'Cause this lonely moment feels like the end

But if you could see Beyond The Tears
You'd know love won't desert you
To see beyond the tears, you know I'll never hurt you
To see the sun behind the rain, feel the joy behind the pain
You know you'll see me standin' right beyond the tears
When alone turns to lonely, and loneliness to fear
It's so easy to imagine love will disappear
But love is always here
If you could see Beyond The Tears
You'd know love won't desert you
To see beyond the tears, you know I'll never hurt you
To see the sun behind the rain, feel the joy behind the pain
You know you'll see me standin' right beyond the tears
See me standin' right Beyond The Tears
See me standin' right Beyond The Tears
Right Beyond The Tears

[Verse 1]
I heard you're gonna leave me
I've known it for a while
I wasn't naive to the news
My mind just couldn't walk a mile
I only see you with me
'Cause I know the things you like
I know all that you believe
And all the plans of your life
So take a minute to understand me
To re-evaluate your mind
I'm everything you need
And in this world a good man is hard to find
And I know you'll miss me
When all is said and done
You'll think about this day
And then you'll realize I was the one

[Chorus]
You know that all you need is in me and
You know that my love's alright, and baby
You know I can't be denied, girl
You know, ooh, you know, oh oh

[Verse 2]
Gave you all a man could give ya
Made sure I found the time
To keep it all together
But the way you're treating me ain't right
Can't understand it
Why you're doing me the way you're doing
Do you enjoy to see our love fade away?
Can't face the world without ya
Can't even sleep at night
Gave you all that treasured
And I tried to love you will all my might
And I know you'll miss me when all is said and done
You'll think about this day and realize I was the one
You know

[Chorus]
You know that all you need is in me and
You know that my love's alright, and baby
You know I can't be denied, girl
You know, ooh, you know, oh oh
You know that all you need is in me and
You know that my love's alright, and baby
You know I can't be denied, girl
You know, ooh, you know, oh oh
You know that all you need is in me and
You know, ooh-ooh-ooh, oh
You know I can't be denied, girl
You know, ooh, you know, oh oh

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
You know that all you need is in me and
You know, ooh-ooh-ooh, oh
You know I can't be denied, girl
You know, ooh, you know, oh oh
You know that all you need is in me and
You know, ooh-ooh-ooh, oh
You know I can't be denied, girl
You know, ooh, you know, oh oh
You know that all you need is in me and
You know, ooh-ooh-ooh, oh
You know I can't be denied, girl
You know, ooh, you know, oh oh
Say baby, the soup tastes kinda funny
I don't know
My skin's crawling
It feels strange
Is this the same soup as usual?
Mmm, I don't know
It feels strange

CHORUS:
Hallucination rain
Hallucination rain
Find another vein
Hallucination rain

I think this is gonna be the big 1
This 1's gonna last 5 minutes or more
This is gonna be the real 1
1 that's gonna make U look 4 the key 2 the door That leads 2 the alley where we

It's all about our love
So shall it be forever, never ending

After all this time
After all is said and done

[Verse 2]
We have seen some suffering, baby
It has not always been perfect

[Chorus]
After all this time

[Bridge]

So shall it be forever, never ending
Darling we know it

[Chorus]
After all this time
After all is said and done

[Outro]
After all this time
After all is said and done
You must have been a beautiful baby
You must have been a wonderful child
When you were only starting to go to kindergarten
I bet you drove the little boys wild

And when it came to winning blue ribbons
You must have shown the other kids how
I can see the judges' eyes as they handed you the prize
I bet you made the cutest bow

You must've been a beautiful baby
'Cause, baby, look at you now

Hey you must have been a beautiful baby
You must have been a wonderful child
When you were only starting to go to kindergarten
I bet you drove the little boys wild

And when it came to winning blue ribbons
You must have shown the other kids how
I can see the judges' eyes as they handed you the prize
I bet you made the cutest bow
You must've been a beautiful baby
'Cause, baby, just look at you now
I've got something up my sleeve
I've got something up my sleeve

Without saying the word
I'm ready for a party tonight
My fire is on the front burner
Can't you tell by the mood I'm in
You have no need to doubt
Do I have to spell it out
Just read between the lines
Yeah, tonight we're going to unwind

I'll make you see
Baby, we can talk it out
Everything, everything
That I'm thinking about

I've got something up my sleeve
I've got something up my sleeve
Something up my sleeve
There's a place just for two
And it's just right for me and you
To let our emotions go free
And be what we wanna be
Turn off the lights
Pull out the phone
Do not disturb
Nobody's home

Baby, for so long
I wanted to get next to you
Just let me love you
There's no telling what I may do
'Cause -

I've got something up my sleeve
I've got something up my sleeve
Something up my sleeve

Stay with me, baby
We can work it out
Just let me get next to you
Ain't no telling what I may do

I've got something up my sleeve
I've got something up my sleeve
I've got something up my sleeve
I've got something up my sleeve, baby
I've got something, baby
Up my sleeve, baby
Give me a chance
I've got something, baby . . 
There's a wildwood in the pines where the family used to gather
There's a little shady grove where they built a country church
They was singing in the ground. Baptisin' in the river
Glory! Hallelja, brother! Sweet salvation there was found

So I believe that the saints go side-by-side in the land that lies up yonder
I believe that there are streets there paved with gold
There are people on their feet shoutin', singin' halleluja!
I believe that Jesus loves me. I can feel it in my soul

There's a long and windin' road that I long once more to travel
There's a homeplace in my heart sittin' high upon a hill
There's a rosewood rockin' chair and a place set at the table
Guess I better have a little talk with Jesus. Maybe he can take me there

So I believe that the saints go side-by-side in the land that lies up yonder
I believe that there are streets there paved with gold
There are people on their feet shoutin', singin' halleluja!
I believe that Jesus loves me. I can feel it in my soul

So I believe that the saints go side-by-side in the land that lies up yonder
I believe that there are streets there paved with gold
There are people on their feet shoutin', singin' halleluja!
I believe that Jesus loves me. I can feel it in my soul
I studied at the feet of a master
Gamaliel we called him, the beauty of the law
I was born of the Tribe of Benjamin, I was a Pharisee
And I could quote from memory the Holy Torah

That day that the Nazarene was brought to trial
It was on a Sabbath eve ,there was a earthquake when He died
Just another passing preacher who came up from Galilee
Blaspheming trouble-maker, we let Him be crucified

Then I thought that I would hear no more about him
But his friends found his tomb empty, claimed that he rose from the dead
Then they said he walked among them with the nail wounds in his hands
That King upon a donkey with a thorn crown on his head

His followers kept growing in great number
And the one that they call Caiaphas mocked us in the judgement hall
And with the Greek name Stephen we knew the gentiles had come in
I cast my vote against him, he was stoned I saw him fall

Then the friends of the Nazarene became united
And I became enraged then led a slaughter zealously
I found their secret places, they were beaten, they were chained
But some of them were scattered, justified in fearing me
Then the Man in White, appeared to me
In such a blinding light it struck me down
With it's brilliance, took away my sight, then the Man in White
In gentle loving tone spoke to me
And I was blinded so that I might see, the Man in White

But like the wind that blows the scattered sea
From Alexandria to Antioch their congregation grew
I went to the high priest for letters of permission
To go to other cities, to see my mission through

Six days on the hot road to the masters
And just outside the city in the middle of the day
A great unearthly light struck and overpowered me
Prostrate on the hot road, I was blinded were I laid

Then I thought I heard the rushing of great water
And a multitude of angels singing sweet and heavenly
And through the sound of wind, came a voice so soft and kind
Meant for only me to hear, "Saul, why do you persecute me?"

As I lay there on the ground, in my blindness
He asked me once again, and suddenly the voice I knew
So finally I managed, a trembling response
Who are you Lord?, I asked him, but I already knew
I am Jesus of Nazareth the voice answered
Arise go to Damascus on the street called Straight will be
A place where you will wait for my servant Ananais
He will open up your eyes, you'll be a witness unto me

So now I live to serve my master
As zealous in his service as I once was as his foe
And keeping his commandments given on Damascus road
I go to all the world, and I let the whole world know

Then the Man in White, appeared to me
In such a blinding light it struck me down
With it's brilliance, took away my sight, then the Man in White
In gentle loving tone spoke to me
And I was blinded so that I might see, the Man in White
And I was blinded so that I might see, the Man in White
The Man in White...

[Intro]
Woo, woo
Your, your, your, your love

[Verse 1]
Oh, it's gettin' hot in here (It's gettin' too hot in here)
So turn the lights down low (Turn the lights down low)
And let your smooth body take control (Let your smooth body take control)
You know what I need sweetie
Take this time and you will succeed
In loving me the way I like it
Your love

[Chorus]
Your love is too hot
I can feel your love running through my mind
Nobody loves me, you're a one of a kind
Your love
Your love is too hot
Your love

[Verse 2]
Stop right here, baby (Stop)
I can't take it anymore
It's just the way you move
And the way your kisses groove
Love is on the rise
And caress me with surprises
Of your love, love

[Refrain]
I love it when you hold me
'Cause you hold me so tight
And I love it when you keep my attention
Sharing love beyond mention, oh, girl

[Bridge]
Your love is so right
And I'll never have to look for another
Your love
Your love is so right
Moving all down my spine

[Chorus]
Your love is too hot
I can feel your love running through my mind
Nobody loves me, you're a one of a kind
Your love
Your love is too hot
Your love is aggressive but smooth
Takes the frown off my face

[Refrain]
I love it when you hold me
'Cause you hold me so tight, baby
And I love it, I love it, when you keep my attention
Sharing love beyond mention
Your love, your love is so right

[Interlude: Mike]
I'm convinced
I've got sense
I'll never look for anyone else
It's your love

[Bridge]
Your love is so right
Moving all down my spine
You make me wanna lose my mind
Your love
Your love
Feels so good, I want, I want some more (Your love)
Oh, oh, woah, oh, hey, all my love, yeah
Your love is so right (Oh, you got the best love now)
I love it when you hold me

[Chorus]
Your love is too hot
I can feel your love running through my mind
Nobody loves me, you're a one of a kind
Your love is too hot
I love it when you hold me
Your love
Your love is so right
No more delight or crawling around
Whisper the word and hold my hand
Never forget those who refuse you
Never forget who you've been

And you will fight with demons
When we shall go to town
And we'll eat between the rich men
And we'll dream, if we don't go down

Follow the light, stay on the outside
The only way in is swollen with tears
Don't bring your things, just let me serve you
Only the fool turns around

Then you will fight with demons
When we shall go to town
And you will wear your best shoes
And we'll dance, if we don't go down
And we'll dance, if we don't go down
"Here he comes"
"Here he comes take one"

Here he comes, I say
Here comes your lover now
Here he comes
Here comes your lover man
Aah I gotta get my head from this pillow
I gotta get outta your
No heart fellin's
Reach down baby and get my runnin' shoes
Oh yeah
Reach down baby and get my runnin' shoes
I gotta get outta here and I got no time to lose
Hey
Here he comes
Here comes your lover now
Here he comes
Here comes your lover man
I gotta get my suitcase
And get the hell outta just as fast as I can
Here he comes baby
Here he comes baby
Here he comes baby
Here he comes baby
Doo doo....
I wake up and think of her
No matter what I do
She's always on my mind
A time a day or two
Seems to me the things you've loved the most
You always lose
But once you've got them
You've always got the blues

In time, well you may find someone else
That can comfort you
But not someone to light the fire
No, not the way she used to do

You lose the things that made it
What it was when it was new
And once you've got them
You've always got the blues

That new love only can replace
Just so much of you
That leaves a lot that gets lost between
Number one and number two
In time, well you may find someone else
That can comfort you
But not someone to light the fire
No, not the way she used to do
You lose the things that made it
What it was when it was new
And once you've got them
You've always got the blues
Hey Jude don't make it bad
Take a sad song and make it better
Remember to let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better

Hey Jude don't be afraid
You were made to go out and get her
The minute you let her under your skin
Then you begin to make it better

And any time you feel the pain, Hey Jude, refrain
Don't carry the world upon your shoulders
For well you know that it's a fool who plays it cool
By making his world a little colder
Da da da da da
Da da da da

Hey Jude don't let me down
You have found her now go and get her
Remember to let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better
So let it out and let it in
Hey Jude begin
You're waiting for someone to perform with
And don't you know that it's just you
Hey Jude you'll do
The movement you need is on your shoulder

Da da da da da
Da da da da Yeah

Hey Jude don't make it bad
Take a sad song and make it better
Remember to let her under your skin
Then you'll begin to make it better
Better, better, better, better, better, Yeah,Yeah,Yeah

[Verse 1]
Quietly He speaks to me
Gently He leads me
Lovingly the Shepherd carries me
He carries me hidden safely in His bosom
I feel His love inside when other times, my friend, I couldn't
He knows just what's best for me
The Good Shepherd knows, He knows
Just what I need

[Verse 2]
Quietly He speaks
Gently He leads me
Lovingly the Good Shepherd carries me (He carries me)
He carries me hidden safely, safely in His bosom
I feel His love inside when other times, my friend, I couldn't
I'm so glad that He knows, He knows just what's
Just what's best for me
The Good Shepherd knows, yes, He knows
Just what I need, oh, oh, oh

[Outro]
Quietly (Quietly) He speaks (He speaks)
Gently (Gently), the Master leads (He leads)
So lovingly (He carries me) He carries me to (To safety)
A safe place of rest
And I feel the Master's unconditional love (I feel)
Everlasting love (His love)
Ever so deeply (Deeply) inside of me (Inside of me)
I'm so glad (Jesus knows) Jesus knows
Just what's best for me

I'm so glad (Jesus knows) Jesus knows
Just what's best for me
In my house we shall praise Him forever
(The Good Shepherd knows) The Good Shepherd knows
Yay, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
(Yes, He knows) I will fear no evil, for Jesus is with me
(Ooh, He knows) He leads me, He guides me, He hides me
(Yeah, He knows)  In the shelter of His arms, He holds me there
(Jesus knows) The Good Shepherd knows
(The Good Shepherd knows) Just what I need, oh, I need (Need)
Woo

[Verse 1]
Cold Blue Steel out of money
One eye for the beat police
Sweet Fire calling, "You can't deny me
Now you know what you need"

[Verse 2]
Underneath the jungle gym
Hollow-grey-fire-escape-thief
Looking for Sweet Fire
Shadow of Lady Release

[Chorus 1]
"Come with me, I know the way," she says
"It's down, down, down the dark ladder
Do you want to contact somebody first, leave someone a letter?
You can come now or you can come later"

[Verse 3]
A wristwatch, a ring, a downstairs screamer
Edgy black cracks of the sky
"Pin-cushion-prick, fix this poor bad dreamer!"
"Money" cold shadows reply

[Verse 4]
Pawnshops crisscrossed and padlocked
Corridors, spit-on prayers and pleas
Sparks fly up from Sweet Fire
Black soot of Lady Release

[Chorus 2]
"Come with me, I know the way" she says
"It's down, down, down the dark ladder
Do you want to contact somebody first, does it really matter?
You can come now or you can come later"

[Verse 5]
Red water in the bathroom sink
Fever and the scum brown bowl
Blue Steel still begging but it's indistinct
Someone's HI-Fi drumming Jelly Roll

[Verse 6]
Concrete concentration camp
Bashing in veins for peace
Cold Blue Steel and Sweet Fire
Fall into Lady Release

[Chorus 3]
"Come with me, I know the way" she says
"It's down, down, down the dark ladder
Do you want to contact somebody first, I mean what does it really matter?
You're going to come now or you're going to come later"

[Verse 1]
Cherokee Louise is hiding in this tunnel
In the Broadway bridge
We are crawling on our knees
We've got flashlights and batteries
We got cold cuts from the fridge

[Chorus 1]
Last year about this time
We used to climb up in the branches
Just to sway there in some breeze
Now the cops on the street
They want Cherokee Louise

[Verse 2]
People like to talk
Tongues are waggin' over fences
They're waggin' on the phones
All their doors are locked
God she can't even come to our house
But I know where she'll go

[Chorus 2]
To the place where you can stand
And press your hands like it was bubble bath
In dust piled high as me
Down under the street
My friend Cherokee Louise

[Bridge]
Ever since we turned thirteen
It's like a minefield walking to the door
Going out to get your third degree
And comin' in you get the Third World War

[Verse 3]
Tuesday after school
We put our pennies on the rails
And when the train rolled by
We were jumpin' round like fools
Going "Look no heads or tails"
Going "Look my lucky prize"

[Chorus 3]
Then she runs home to her foster dad
He open up his zipper
And he yanks her to her knees
Oh please be here - please
My friend Cherokee Louise

[Verse 4]
Cherokee Louise is hiding in this tunnel
In the Broadway bridge
We're crawling on our knees
I've got Archie and Silver Screen
I know where she is

[Chorus 4]
She's in the place where you can stand
And press your hands like it was bubble bath
In dust piled high as me
Down under the street
My friend, poor Cherokee Louise

[Outro]
Oh Cheeroke Louise, poor Cherokee Louise
Cherokee Louise, Cherokee Louise
Loving you is driving me crazy
People say that you were born lazy
'Cause you say that
Work Is A Four-Letter Word

So change your life
There is so much I know
That you can do
Come and see...

Wide-awake
And take all of this love
That is waiting for you

If you stay
I'll stay right beside you
And my love
May help to remind you
To forget that
Work Is A Four-Letter Word
I don't need
A house that's a showplace
I just feel
That we're going no place
While you say that
Work Is A Four-Letter Word

So change your life
There is so much I know
You can do
Come and see...

Wide-awake
And take all of this love
That is waiting for you

If you stay
I'll stay right beside you
And my love
Might help to remind you
To forget that
Work Is A Four-Letter Word
Oh...

I don't need
A house that's a showplace
I just feel
That we're going no place
While you say that
Work Is A Four-Letter Word
So change your life
There is so much I know
That you can do
Please come and see...

Wide-awake
And take all of this love
That is waiting for you

[Verse 1]
Darling, stand by me
Please be there
I need your smiling face when no one seems to care
You brought the sunshine back into my world
Now my lady's 

[?]
You can 

[?]

[Chorus]
You're all I need
Darling, stand by me

[Verse 2]
Baby, 

[?] and hold my hand
I need you to hear me when nobody understands
You're my prescription no doctor can prescribe
Your kind of lovin' makes me 

[?]
I have some when you're right here by my side
You're all I need
Darling, stand by me

[Chorus]
Oh, oh, you're all I need
Darling, stand by me

[Verse 3]
My little lady of five-foot-two
Although you're small in size, your love outmeasures you
Oh, I don't know what it is you've got
But what you got, most women 

[?]
For you're one of a kind and that's hard to find, you're mine

[Chorus]
You're all I need
Darling, stand by me

[Outro]
I can't live, baby, without you
I just can't live, baby, without you
Oh, I can't live without you, baby
(What a woman) Yes you are, (What a woman) you really are
(What a woman) Yes you are, (What a woman) you really are

[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
You say that you're proud of me, oh
Then you take something out of me
So predictable

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Why do I have to see this through?
Why do I have to take this?
Isn't there something I can do
To make myself finally say this?

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
No, you've taken this too far
Exposing who you are, for all to see
You're not the one that you pretend to be

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
You start with apologies, oh
Then take another shot at me
So predictable

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Why do I have to see this through
Why do I have to take this
Isn't there something I can do
To make myself finally say this

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
No, you've taken this too far
Exposing who you are, for all to see
You're not the one that you pretend...

This, no, you've taken this too far
Exposing who you are, for all to see
You're not the one that you pretend to be

[Bridge: Mike Shinoda, Both Mike Shinoda and Chester Bennington]
Oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
No, you've taken this too far
Exposing who you are, for all to see
You're not the one that you pretend...
This, no, you've taken this too far
Exposing who you are, for all to see
You're not the one that you pretend to be

[Instrumental Outro]
Long ago there was a man
Changed stone 2 bread with one touch of his hand
He made the blind see and the dumb understand
He died 4 the tears in your eyes, your eyes
Many people came from all around
2 hear this man preach with glorious sound
He spoke of man in harmony and love abound
He died 4 the tears in your eyes, your eyes
Your eyes, your eyes
He died 4 the tears in your eyes

4 the tears in your eyes if they're tears of sorrow
4 cents may be all that they're worth
4 the rising sun each day assures us
The meek shall inherit the earth, the earth

Faith is a word we all should try
Describing the man who willingly died
Believe that your hunger, sorrow, and fears
Is less than the tears in your eyes, your eyes
Less than the tears in your eyes
4 the tears in your eyes if they're tears of sorrow
4 cents may be all that they're worth (All they're worth)
4 the rising sun each day assures us
The meek shall inherit the earth (Say it again)

4 the tears in your eyes if they're tears of sorrow
4 cents may be all that they're worth (All they're worth)
4 the rising sun each day assures us
The meek shall inherit the earth, the earth

Thank U
Obsessions
Obsessions
Obsessions

It happened in the middle of the night
When I thought I had control
Didn't want to be the one to fight
Didn't want to lose my soul
I was up for somethin' more
And I thought I'd get it started
Paralyzed, polarized
Hung on every word

I'm in love with the child inside
I don't have a right to follow you
Or have a license to get closer
A love that won't be denied
For you are something like I've never seen
I'm a man who's heart is cryin'

Just another one of my obsessions
You don't want to be a special toy
I never be the one to hurt you
Every other girl or boy
Just another little indiscretion
Another game that you want to try
You can never be unfaithful
If you gotta love somebody
(Aah aah aah )
Wanna make your mountains high
Wanna take your valley low
There's a moral to my story
Let me in and close the door
Until the mornin' light
What I'd give to live inside you
Make me wait, we separate
But only to return

Whisper and I'll be there
I don't want you beggin' me to stop
I just want to drown in your desire
Love is for those who dare
All the cream is risin' to the top
And it's the love you save from dyin'
(Aah)

Just another one my obsessions
(Aah)
Something I could never find
(Aah)
It's the kind of love that makes your heart
Feel obsessed with mine
(Obsessed with mine)
Any battle for the one possession
(Aah)
Another game that you want to try
(Aah)
You can never be unfaithful
If you gotta love somebody
(Aah aah aah aah)
(Aah aah)
(Aah)

[incomprehensible] never have
For the guy you tried, tried

Just another one of my obsessions
(Aah)
You don't want to be a special toy
(Aah)
I never be the one to hurt you
(Hey)
Every other girl or boy
(Girl or boy)
Just another little indiscretion
(Hey)
Another game that you want to try
(Aah)
You can never be unfaithful
If you gotta love somebody
(Aah aah aah aah)
(Hey)
Tell me you friend
(Aah aah)
Tell me, tell me
Tell me you baby

Just another one my obsessions
(Aah)
Something I could never find
(Aah)
It's the kind of love that makes your heart
Feel obsessed with mine
(Baby with mine)
Any battle for the one possession
(Hey)
Another game that you want to try
(Aah)
You can never be unfaithful
(Can't have myself)
If you gotta love somebody
(I can't have myself)
Just another one my obsessions
(You my girl)
You don't want to be a special toy
(You my girl)
I never be the one to hurt you
(You're everything)
Every other girl or boy
(Gotta have, gotta have)
Just another little indiscretion
(Gotta have)
Another game that you want to try
(Aah)
You can never be unfaithful
(Aah)

[Spoken Word - Jack Rieley]
As soon as he turned it on
The wind outside of his room
Stirred up for a few seconds

He thought to himself
"i'll climb out my window
And go sit out there with my radio"

Out the window he went
Sitting against a small stump
Behind some flowerbeds

The light from his bedroom window he could still see
The music of Bach was playing

After a while it began to sound distant
As the young prince gazed at this radio on his knee
The music was floating away from his hearing

What could be happening
He took it off of his knee
And put the radio to his ear
Nothing happened
Then the transistor left his hands
And was floating in the mid-air
Two feet off the ground

As the prince laughed
It suddenly turned around
And it was light green phosphourous in color

Dancing back and forth
The magic transistor
Started moving down his path

He could hear the sound out
Like nothing he had ever heard before!

The trees were getting closer together
And flowers glowed with tinges of magic light
As he followed thinking to himself
"what's going on?"

The transistor lifted slowly
Up to the top of a little tree
And sat there
While it slowly became louder
To where the prince could hear it clearly
Fireflies shot across the path in front of the prince
He turned around and couldn't see the light from his window
There he was watching all alone all by himself
He got a hunch to get back to his room
And he turned and ran right back

[Intro]
I'm sending red roses and violets of blue, girl (Violets of blue, girl)
The roses mean I love you
The violets mean I'll always be true, girl (Be true, girl)

[Chorus 1]
'Cause I really love you ('Cause I really love you)
And I truly, truly believe, yes I do (Yes I do)
In spite of the way you're acting that you love me too
Say you do

[Verse]
You try to keep me away, girl
To prove that you don't really care
But I believe you feel the same as I do
And this torture just ain't fair (No, this torture just ain't fair)
I'm sending you a bracelet engraved in gold (Sending you a bracelet baby)
With, "I love you girl" (Love you, girl)
And I'd send my heart if I could to prove I'll always be true

[Chorus 2]
'Cause I really love you ('Cause I really love you)
And I truly, truly believe, yes I do (Yes I do)
That you love me too
Say you love me, 'cause I love you

[Bridge]
I want you to understand the red roses and violets of blue, girl (Want you to understand)
And that bright shining bracelet helps me to say I love you (I love you, love you)

[Chorus 3]
'Cause I really love you ('Cause I really love you)
And I truly, truly believe, yes I do (Yes, I do)
That you love me too
Say you love me too

[Outro]
(I truly believe, yes I do, yes I do, yes I do)
(I truly believe, yes I do, yes I do, yes I do)
(I truly believe, yes I do, yes I do, yes I do)
Bad news is come to town
He's walking three feet off the ground
He's ordering another round
Bound by his own ideas
Lost, doesn't know where she is found

Bad news is fighting mad
He went and lost the biggest prize he ever had
But a prizefighter can't be sad
When he smiles under golden lights and lamps
Taking daylight fights again and again

Bad news is come to town
He's walking three feet off the ground
He's ordering another round
Bound by his own ideas
Lost, doesn't know where she is gone

Bad news is fighting mad
He went and lost the biggest prize he ever had
But a prizefighter can't be sad
When he smiles under golden lights and lamps
Taking daylight fights again and again
Bad news is come to town
Bo Diddley was a private eye
Hand was fast and his I.Q. high
D.A. said "Double O, you won't last
Slow down boy, you living too fast"

Well, Double O had a Cadillac
Machine guns and a bullet-proof back
Engine taken from a 707
Sounds like a sure way to get into heaven

In his pocket, 5 pounds of lead
Keep Bo Diddley from getting dead
Another thing helped Bo keeping alive
Was a snub-nosed, Smith And Wesson, Colt 45

Well, Bo drank gallons of rye and bourbon
Martini's dry, and you better serve them
Martini so dry, the shaker burst
Bo keeled on his side and died of thirst

[Verse 1]
Baby's into runnin' around, hangin' with the crowd
Puttin' your business in the street, talkin' out loud
Sayin' you bought her this and that
And how much you done spent
I swear she must believe it's all heaven sent

[Pre-Chorus]
Hey, boy
You better bring the chick around
To the sad, sad truth
The dirty lowdown

[Chorus]
(Oohooohooohooo)
(I wonder, wonder, wonder, wonder who)
Taught her how to talk like that
(Oohooohooohooo)
(I wonder, wonder, wonder, wonder who)
Gave her that big idea

[Verse 2]
Nothin' you can't handle, nothin' you ain't got
Put your money on the table and drive it off the lot
Turn on that old lovelight and turn a "Maybe" to a "Yes"
Same old schoolboy game got you into this mess

[Pre-Chorus]
Hey son
Better get on back to town
Face the sad old truth
The dirty lowdown

[Chorus]
(Oohooohooohooo)
(I wonder, wonder, wonder, wonder who)
Put those ideas in your head
(Oohooohooohooo)
(I wonder, wonder, wonder, wonder who)

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah
Come on back down, little son
Dig the low, low, low, low, lowdown!

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
You ain't got to be so bad, got to be so cold
This dog eat dog existence sure is getting old
Got to have a jones for this, jones for that
This runnin' with the Joneses, boy, just ain't where it's at, no, no

[Pre-Chorus]
You gonna come back around
To the sad, sad truth
The dirty lowdown

[Chorus]
(Oohooohooohooo)
(I wonder, wonder, wonder, wonder who)
Got you thinking like that, boy
(Oohooohooohooo)
(I wonder, wonder, wonder, wonder who)

[Outro]
I wonder, wonder, wonder, wonder who
Said I wonder, wonder, wonder, I wonder who
Oh, look out for that lowdown
(I wonder, wonder, wonder, wonder who)
That dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty lowdown
(Ooohooohooohooo)
I wonder, wonder, wonder, wonder who
Ooohooohooohooo
I wonder, wonder, wonder, wonder who
Got you thinkin' like that
Got you thinkin' just like that
(Ooohooohooohooo)
(I wonder, wonder, wonder, wonder who)
Lookin' that girl in the face is so sad
I'm ashamed of you
I wonder, wonder, wonder, wonder who
Usually in the morning I'm filled with sweet belonging
And everything is beautiful to see
Even when it's raining, sounds of heaven singing
Is simply joyful music to me
Sometimes I feel like a sad song
Like I'm all alone without you
So many different places, a million smiling faces
Oh life is so incredible to me
Especially to be near you and how it is to touch you
Oh paradise was made for you and me
Sometimes I feel like a sad song
Like I'm all alone without you
I know that life goes on just perfectly
And everything is just the way that it should be
Still there are times when my heart feels like breaking
And anywhere is where I'd rather be
Oh, and in the nighttime, I know that it's the right time
To hold you close and say, I love you so
To have someone to care with, someone I could share with
And that is why I wanted you to know
Sometimes I feel like a sad song
Like I'm all alone without you

[instrumental]

Sometimes I feel like a sad song
Like I'm all alone without you
Sometimes I feel like a sad song
Like I'm all alone without you, without you
She's just a night bird flyin' through the night, fly on
She's just a night bird making a midnight, midnight flight, sail on, sail on
Well, she's flyin' down to me
But, 'til tomorrow, got to set her free
Set her free

So all we got, baby, is one precious night
All we got is one precious night
Throw your blues and shoes and things
And lay it down under the bed
Just wrap me up in your beautiful wings
Better hear what I say, yeah
Oh, carry me home

Please take me through your dreams
Inside your world, I want to be

Until tomorrow, no tears will be shed
Hold on 'til the sun gets out of bed
Hold on, hold on, baby
Fly on
Sail on, sail on, sail on
Sail on
Fly on, baby
There's a story told of a very gentle boy
And the girl who wore his ring
Through the wintry snow
The world they knew was one
For their hearts were full of spring

As the days grew old
And the nights passed into time
And the weeks and years took wing
Gentle boy, tender girl
Their love remained still young
For their hearts were full of spring

Then one day they died
And their graves were side by side
On a hill where robins sing
And they say violets
Grow there the whole year round
For their hearts were full of spring

[Verse 1]
If you search for tenderness
It isn't hard to find
You can have the love you need to live
But if you look for truthfulness
You might just as well be blind
It always seems to be so hard to give

[Chorus]
Honesty
Is such a lonely word
Everyone is so untrue
Honesty
Is hardly ever heard
And mostly what I need from you

[Verse 2]
I can always find someone
To say they sympathize
If I wear my heart out on my sleeve
But I don't want some pretty face
To tell me pretty lies
All I want is someone to believe

[Chorus]
Honesty
Is such a lonely word
Everyone is so untrue
Honesty
Is hardly ever heard
And mostly what I need from you

[Bridge]
I can find a lover
I can find a friend
I can have security
Until the bitter end
Anyone can comfort me with promises again
I know
I know

[Verse 3]
When I'm deep Inside of me
Don't be too concerned
I won't ask for nothin'
While I'm gone
But when I want sincerity
Tell me, where else can I turn?
Because you're the one that I depend upon

[Chorus]
Honesty
Is such a lonely word
Everyone is so untrue
Honesty
Is hardly ever heard
And mostly what I need from you
Clap clap clap clap all will join in
Tap tap tap tap simple rhythm
On the drum, develop, into complex intermingling orchestral rhythm, tap

Snap snap snap snap with your fingers
Off beat on time make it linger
Enriching the rhythm do away with scepticism
Come and join the hymn, tap

Sensing the symbiotic forces
Each time I see a crowd of people
Just like a fool I stop and stare
It's really not the proper thing to do
But maybe you'll be there

I go out walking after midnight
Along the lonely thoroughfare
It's not the time or place
To look for you, but maybe you'll be there

You said your arms would always hold me
You said you lips were mine alone to kiss
Now after all those things you told me
How can it end like this

Someday if all my prayers are answered
I'll hear a footstep on the stair
With anxious heart, I'll hurry to the door
And maybe you'll be there
Sitting up on our crane
It always feels the same
When we're up high
'Cause I feel like I'll fall and die
And I can't say goodbye to my friends
'Cause they're having a real good time

Getting on another plane
It always feels the same
When we're up high
'Cause I feel like we'll crash and die
And I can't say goodbye to my love
She's been sleeping the whole flight

And you know
It's gonna get you feeling like you're going down
Just try to tell yourself, you know it's coming up
As you're speeding towards the ground

It's gonna get you feeling like you're going down
Just try to tell yourself, you know it's coming up
As you're speeding towards the ground
Sitting up on our crane
It always feels the same
When we're up high
'Cause I feel like I'll fall and die
And I can't say goodbye to my friends
'Cause they're having a real good time

And you know
It's gonna get you feeling like you're going down
Just try to tell yourself, you know it's coming up
As you're speeding towards the ground

Oh, it's gonna get you feeling like you're going down

___, that's my baby
No sir, I don't mean maybe
Yes sir, that's my baby now

Yes, ma'm, we've decided
No ma'm, we ain't gonna hide it
Yes, ma'm, you're invited now

By the way, by the way
When we walk up to the preacher I'll say

Yes sir, that's my baby
No sir, I don't mean maybe
Yes sir, that's my baby now

(instrumental interlude)

By the way, by the way
When we run into the preacher I'll say

I'll say yes sir, that's my baby
No sir, I don't mean maybe
Yes sir, that's my baby now
Mmm
So many words for the broken heart
It's hard to see in the crimson love
So hard to breathe
Walk with me and maybe
Nights of light so soon become
Wild and free I can feel the sun
Our every wish will be done
They tell me
Show me the meaning of being lonely
Is this the feeling I need to walk with?
Tell me why I can't be there where you are
There's something missin' in my heart
Life goes on as it never ends
Eyes of stone observe the trends
They never say forever gaze
If only guilty roads to an endless love
(Endless love)
There's no control, are you with me now?
Your every wish will be done, they tell me
Show me the meaning of being lonely
Is this the feeling I need to walk with?
Tell me why I can't be there where you are
There's something missin' in my heart
There's no where to run, I have no place to go
Surrender my heart, body and soul
How can it be you're asking me to feel
Things you never show
You are missing in my heart
Tell me why I can't be there where you are
Show me the meaning of being lonely
Is this the feeling I need to walk with?
Tell me why I can't be there where you are
There's something missin' in my heart
The sun is shining, there's plenty of light (oh yeah)
A new day is dawning, sunny and bright (oh yeah)
But after I've been crying all night
The sun is cold, and the new day seems old
Since I lost my baby (Since I lost my baby.)
Oh, since I lost my baby (Oh, since I lost my baby)

The birds are singing and the children are playing
There's plenty of work and the bosses are paying
Not a sad word should a young heart be saying
But fun is a bore and with money I'm poor

Since I lost my baby. (Since I lost my baby)
Oh, since I lost my baby. (Oh, since I lost my baby)
Next time I'll be kinder (Next time I'll be kinder)
Won't you please help me find her (Won't you please help me find her)
Someone just remind her (Someone just remind her)
Of this love she left behind her (Of this love she left behind her)
Till I find her I'll be trying ta ('Til I find her I'll be trying ta)
Everyday I'm more inclined ta
Find her
Inclined ta
Find her
Inclined ta find my baby
Been looking everywhere (ba--by)
Baby, I really, really care!
Oh, determination is fading fast (Oh yeah)
Inspiration is a thing of the past (Oh yeah)
Can't see how my hope's gonna last
Good things are bad and what's happy is sad

Since I lost my baby. (Since I lost my baby)
Oh, since I lost my baby. (Oh, since I lost my baby)
I feel so bad (Since I lost my baby)
I feel so sad (Since I lost my baby)
Everything is wrong
This heart is hard to carry on (Since I lost my baby)
I'm lost as can be (Since I lost my baby)
What's gonna happen to me?
Here comes Dolly Dagger
Her love's so heavy, gonna make you stagger
Dolly Dagger
She drinks the blood from a jagged edge
Aw, drink up, baby

Been riding broomsticks since she was fifteen
Blowin' out all the other witches on the scene
She got a bullwhip just as long as your life
Her tongue can even scratch the soul out of the devil's wife
Well, I seen her in action at the Player's Choice
Turn all the love men into doughnut boys
Hey, red hot mama, you better step aside
This chick's gonna turn you to a block of ice
Look out!

Here comes Dolly Dagger
Her love's so strong, gonna make you stagger, baby
Dolly Dagger
She drinks her blood from a jagged edge
Uh, right on
Drink up, baby
Hey!
Yeah, look at old burnt out Superman, tryin' to shoot his dust on the sun
Captain Karma kids, they're dead on the run
Oh, words of love, do they ever touch Dolly Brown?
Better get some highway an' clear outta town

Here comes Dolly Dagger
Her love's so heavy, gonna make you stagger
Dolly Dagger
She ain't satisfied 'til she gets what she's after
She drinks the blood from a jagged edge
Better watch out, baby, here comes your master

Alright
Watch out, Devon
You give me a little bit of that heaven

Dolly, heavy mama, get it on, get it on, get it on
Dolly, heavy mama, get it on, get it on, get it on
Dolly, heavy mama, get it on, get it on, get it on
Dolly, heavy mama, get it on, get it on, get it on
Get it on, get it on, get it on, get it on, get it on, get it on
Woo, yeah, yeah, yeah
Woo, yeah, yeah, yeah
Woo, yeah, yeah, yeah
Woo, yeah, yeah, yeah
Woo, yeah, yeah, yeah
When skies are cloudy and grey
They're only grey for a day
So wrap your troubles in dreams
And dream your troubles away

Until that sunshine peeps through
There's only one thing to do
Just wrap your troubles in dreams
And dream all your troubles away

Your castles may tumble, that's fate after all
Life's really funny that way
No use to grumble, smile as they fall
Weren't you king for a day?

Just remember that sunshine
Always follows the rain
So wrap your troubles in dreams
And dream your troubles away

Your castles may tumble, that's fate after all
Life's really funny that way
But no need to grumble, smile as they fall
Weren't you king for a day?
Just remember that sunshine
Always follows the rain
So wrap your troubles in dreams
And dream, dream your troubles away

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
All these things I could not say
Made me so much more afraid
Just too scared of what I'd find
To look behind, to look behind

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
All these things I could not say
Made me so much more afraid
Just too scared of what I'd find
To look behind, to look behind

[Bridge: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
If you go, there's no turning back
If you go, there's no turning back
If you go, there's no turning back
There's no turning back

No, no, no, no, no, no...
No, no turning back!
No, no turning back!
No, no turning back!
No, no turning back!

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
All these things I could not say
Made me so much more afraid
Just too scared of what I'd find
To look behind

All of these things I could not say
Made me so much more afraid
Just too scared of what I'd find
To look behind, can't look behind!

[Verse 1]
Stop being a bad joke, it's not the same
Feeling that sunshine and forgetting the rain
It feels so peaceful without the rain
Your life's got happy, you got on the TV

[Chorus]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, la, la, la, la-la, la-la
Yeah, yeah, yeah, la, la, la, la-la, la-la

[Verse 2]
Being with each other, we're having fun
I've got something special, I might find the one
We dig each other and break the rules
We love one another and that's no fool

[Chorus]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, la, la, la, la-la, la-la
Yeah, yeah, yeah, la, la, la, la-la, la-la (My girl)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, la, la, la, la-la, la-la
Yeah, yeah, yeah, la, la, la, la-la, la-la
Yeah

[Verse 3]
I take a piece of paper and write your name
You put it in your pocket and I did the same
We love each other and that's for sure
I live here without you, I can't take it no more

[Chorus]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, la, la, la, la-la, la-la
Yeah, yeah, yeah, la, la, la, la-la, la-la (My girl)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, la, la, la, la-la, la-la
Yeah, yeah, yeah, la, la, la, la-la, la-la
This lovely day will lengthen into evening
We'll sigh goodbye to all we've ever had
Alone where we have walked together
I'll remember April and be glad

I'll be content you loved me once in April
Your lips were warm and love and spring were new
But I'm not afraid of autumn and her sorrow
For I'll remember April and you

The fire will dwindle into glowing ashes
For flames and love live such a little while
I won't forget but I won't be lonely
I'll remember April and smile

I'll be content you loved me once in April
Your lips were warm and love and spring were new
But I'm not afraid of autumn and her sorrow
For I'll remember April and you

The fire will dwindle into glowing ashes
For flames and love live such a little while
I won't forget but I won't be lonely
I'll remember April and smile
If I were a carpenter
I'd build a world of love
Where we would always be together

If I were the captain of
A ship of happiness
I'd sail away with you forever

Close your eyes
And know you are safe with me

If I had a lariat
Made of dreams come true
I would lasso the moon for you

If I were a rocketeer
I'd scale the universe
To bring your heart a star each
Morning

If I were an angel in
Heaven's Holy host
I'd sing to you a verse of glory
Close your eyes
And know you are safe with me

If I had a lariat
Made of dreams come true
I would lasso the moon for you
You
Got nearly all I need
You
Got nearly all I need
Early morning comes
I know you have to leave

Everything you do
I know you wanna please
Everything you do
I know you wanna please
Early morning comes

I know you wanna leave

Everything you do
I know you wanna please
Everything you do
I know you wanna please
Early morning come
I know you have to leave
Love me or leave me and let me be lonely
You won't believe me that I love you only
I'd rather be lonely than happy with somebody else

You might find the night time the right time for kissing
But night time is my time for just reminiscing
Regretting instead of forgetting with somebody else

There'll be no one unless that someone is you, you, you
I intend to be independently blue

I want your love, but I don't want to borrow
To have it today and give back tomorrow
For my love is your love there's no love for nobody else

[Chorus: Laza Morgan]
She just turned 21
Now she's all up in the club, having hell of fun
She says she wanna rock all night
Go ahead and give her some
Go ahead and get a chunk
Oh man, she bought another round
Shawty 'bout to shut it down
Down, down, down, down
(Cups in the air, we can't put 'em) Down, down, down, down
We've got the freaks
It's going down, down, down, down
Oh man, she look like she's ready now
Yes man, let's shut it down!

[Verse 1: Flo Rida]
Yeah, shut it down, 21 like gambling
Black Jack, show the bet, showing all the skin
Go in there, she a ten, 'bout to bring her friends
Throw it back like what's that happening?
In the morning, I'm patronin'
Half the bottle cause she's probably a woman
Drunk up, feel better in the morning
Drank up, ran out like whoa
Don't want the club to get closed
Around like mile 24
When she came to the door

[?] lets go
What happens in the spot tonight, they won't know
The birthday girl is out of control
Like it's room, my show for sure
'Cause she's 21 years old

[Chorus: Laza Morgan]
She just turned 21
Now she's all up in the club, having hell of fun
She says she wanna rock all night

We've got the freaks
It's going down, down, down, down
Oh man, she look like she ready now
Yes man, let's shut it down!

[Verse 2: Flo Rida]
Oh, you know that what happens at a 21st B-Day
Stays at a 21st B-Day
Gotta go hard, you don't wanna take it easy
Shut it down, get the shout out from the D.J
One drop on the birthday girl
The beat 21 is your world
Do you

[Bridge: Flo Rida]
I'm spending money tonight

The after party's back at my house (My house)
I've got a present for you
It's waiting up in my room
But I wanna give it to you right now (Right now)

We've got the freaks
It's going down, down, down, down
Oh man, she look like she ready now
Yes man, let's shut it down
She came in through the bathroom window
Protected by a silver spoon
But now she sucks her thumb and wanders
By the banks of her own lagoon

Didn't anybody tell her?
Didn't anybody see?
Sunday's on the phone to Monday
Tuesday's on the phone to me

She said she'd always been a dancer
She worked at fifteen clubs a day
And though she thought I knew the answer
Well I knew what I could not say

And so I quit the police department
And got myself a steady job
And though she tried her best to help me
She could steal but she could not rob

Didn't anybody tell her?
Didn't anybody see?
Sunday's on the phone to Monday
Tuesday's on the phone to me
Oh yeah
Baby, take off your clothes and come on

[Verse]
Freshnin' air around my head
Mornings tumble out of bed
Eggs and grits and lickety-split
Look at me jump!
I'm in the great shape of the open country...
The way you walk, it drives me mad
And the way you talk, it makes me glad
Love that woman, yes you're everything to me
Whoa, 'cause you're a friend and lover
Whoa, just as sweet as a woman should be
She knows how to work and she knows how to play
She knows how to keep me happy everyday
Love that woman, yes I need you by my side
Whoa, 'cause you got a way baby
Whoa, a way that keeps me satisfied
When a no good man tries to give her a line
She tells him quick, whoa she's all mine
Love that woman, yes you're everything to me
Whoa, 'cause you're a friend and lover
Just as sweet as good as a woman should be
I love you baby, I love you baby
I love that woman, I love that woman
I love that woman and I love that woman

I want a woman like Marylin Monroe
The kind of woman that would never say no
The kind of woman that will make you scream
That's the girl o' my dreams

[Verse 2]
I want a woman that'll treat me right
Giving good love all through and night
Take her on a date, she's my machine
That's the girl o' my dreams

[Chorus]
Oh
Girl o' my dreams
Oh
Listen, people
That's the girl o' my dreams

Old and wrinkled but knows it all
Got all the little tricks that'll make me cream
That's the girl o' my dreams

I want a woman that'll wash my hair
Even wash my underwear
Always smiling, never mean
That's the girl o' my dreams

[Chorus]
Oh
Girl o' my dreams
Oh
Listen, people
That's the girl o' my dreams

[Bridge]
I would say that you're a chauvinist
No, I just got a lot of things that are on the list
Yeah, if she couldn't hang, would U give her the fist?
No man, I'd sit her right down and give her a little kiss!
Oh, I need a woman like Lena Horne
Knowed she was funky since the day she was born
Lena's mama say "Doc, is it a girl?"
Doc say "And how!"
Lena smiled, slapped the doctor and said
"Sucker I'm running things now!"

[Chorus]
Oh
Girl o' my dreams
Oh
Listen, people
That's the girl o' my dreams

[Verse 1]
It was a Zombie Jamboree
Took place in a New York cemetery
It was a Zombie Jamboree
Took place in a New York cemetery
Zombies from all parts of the Island
Some of them was a great Calypsonians
Although the season was Carnival
We get together in bacchanal
And they singing

[Chorus]
Back to back, belly to belly
I don't give a damn, I done dead already
Uh-oh, back to back, belly to belly
At the Zombie Jamboree
I hear ya talkin'
Back to back, belly to belly
Don't give a damn, done dead already
Uh-oh, back to back, belly to belly
At the Zombie Jamboree

[Verse 2]
One female Zombie wouldn't behave
See how she jumping out of the grave
In one hand a quarter rum
In the other hand she knocking Congo drum
Believe singer start to make his rhyme
The Zombies are racking their bones in thyme
One bystander had this to say
It was a pleasure to see the Zombies break away
And they're singing

[Chorus]
Back to back, belly to belly
Don't give a damn, done dead already
Uh-oh, back to back, belly to belly
At the Zombie Jamboree, oh

[Verse 3]
I goin' talk to Miss Brigit Bardot
And tell her "Miss Bardot take it slow"
All the men think they're Casanova
When they see that she's bare foot all over
Even old men out into beaker
Find their hearts getting weaker and weaker
So I goin' to ask her for your sake and mine
At least to wear her earrings part at the time
And I'm singing

[Chorus]
Back to back, belly to belly
Don't give a damn, done dead already
Uh-oh, back to back, belly to belly
At the Zombie Jamboree, oh

[Verse 4]
A lot of world leaders talkin' 'bout war
And I'm afraid they're going too far
So it's up to us, you and me
To put an end to catastrophe
We must appeal to their goodness of heart
And ask them to pitch in and please do their part
'Cause if this atomic war begin
They won't even have a part to pitch in
And we'll be singing

[Chorus]
Back to back, belly to belly
Don't give a damn, done dead already
Uh-oh, back to back, belly to belly
At the Zombie Jamboree
I hear ya talkin'
Back to back, belly to belly
Don't give a damn, done dead already
Uh-oh, back to back, belly to belly
At the Zombie, Zombie Jamboree
Well the blue's still in the water and the blue's still in the sky
And way beyond the blue there's someone watchin' from on high
My clothes may be ragged and my shoes may be worn
But I've been a wealthy boy since I've been born
Cause I call him when I'm troubled and I call him when I'm weak
And he always pulls me through my troubles some way and I believe
He'll be there (he'll be there) he'll be there (he'll be there)
Like he always is to answer when I call him

My mother used to tell me I should take it slow
The pace is not what matters it's the direction that you go
Keep your feet upon the path and your eyes upon the goal
You'll have all the joy a heart could ever hold
Cause I call him when I'm troubled...
Like he always is to answer when I call him
Hey, lumpa sugar, you look kinda sweet
Cuter than a baby walkin' down the street
When I look into your eyes, I wanna leap
I can't conceal that you make me feel

Like a tiger, ooh, ooh, ooh, like a tiger
Ooh, ooh, ooh, just to see you smile nearly drives me wild
I wanna growl wow!

I'm feelin' stronger than a grizzly bear
Soarin' like an eagle flyin' through the air
When I get you in my arms, you'd better beware
I go insane 'cause I can't be tamed

Like a tiger, ooh, ooh, ooh, like a tiger
Ooh, ooh, ooh, just to see you smile nearly drives me wild
I wanna growl wow!

You keep my heart jumpin' like a kangaroo
Floatin' like an onion in a bowl of stew
Baby, every time you come in view
I run like an antelope to get to you
I'm your tiger and you're my mate
Hurry up, buttercup, and don't be late
I might get mad if I have to wait
Come right now 'cause I'm on the prowl

Like a tiger, ooh, ooh, ooh, like a tiger
Ooh, ooh, ooh, just to see you smile nearly drives me wild
I wanna growl wow!

You keep my heart jumpin' like a kangaroo
Floatin' like an onion in a bowl of stew
Baby, every time you come in view
I run like an antelope to get to you

I'm your tiger and you're my mate
Hurry up, buttercup, and don't be late
I might get mad if I have to wait
Come right now 'cause I'm on the prowl

Like a tiger, ooh, ooh, ooh, like a tiger
Ooh, ooh, ooh, just to see you smile nearly drives me wild
I wanna growl wow
I'm going down to West Texas
Behind the Louisiana line
I'm going down to West Texas
Behind the Louisiana line
Get me that fortune telling woman
Want to let her gonna read my mind

If you ever go to Dallas
Take the right hand road
If you ever go to Dallas
Take the right hand road
For wasting down the street boys
Is bound to kill ya for sure

I'm going down to Jackson River
Past that West Texas line
I'm going down to Jackson River
Behind that West Texas line
If there's a star up above
Lord it's mine, leading my sign
Well you never miss your water
Till the well runs dry
And you never miss your water
Till the well runs dry
And you never miss your man
Till he says goodbye

You can ride and tell my mama
I won't be coming home tonight
You can ride and tell my mother
I won't be home tonight
I'm going down the road boys
I've got to do it right

I'm going down to West Texas
Behind the Louisiana line
I'm going down to West Texas
Behind the Louisiana line
That fortune telling woman
Won't you let her really read my mind?
One and one is two
What am I to do
Now that I'm in love with you?
I'm hopin' every day
I'm gonna hear you say
"You really make my wish come true"

Can't you see when I'm holding you near
All the things I do
Show my love, and I'm making it clear
One and one is two

One and one is two
What am I to do
Now that I'm in love with you?
I'm hopin' every day
I'm gonna hear you say
"You really make my wish come true"

Can't you see I've loved you from the start?
Don't you love me too?
I love you, but you're breaking my heart
If you only knew
One and one is two
What am I to do
Now that I'm in love with you?
I'm hopin' every day
I'm gonna hear you say
"You really make my wish come true"

If you say that you're gonna be mine
Everything's alright
All the world would look so fine
If you'll be mine tonight

One and one is two
What am I to do
Now that I'm in love with you?
I'm hoping every day
I'm gonna hear you say
"You really make my wish come true"
Father, Father, Father, Father

You are God, You are God

Father, Father, Father, Father, Father

Praise Him, Praise Him
Praise Him forever, praise Him forever

Power, power, You reign in power
You reign in power, You reign in power
You reign in power, You reign in power
You reign in power, power
Yeah, yeah
There was a time when I could not find
The Spirit of God beyond the mind
In retrospect, the intellect is blind

It makes me think that I'm the reason
For all that's mine
Even this rhyme, I'm inclined to believe
Is from me, instead of being received
This is how we're deceived

How am I more than dust
When it's Your love that animates us?
Forever I will trust
Your love is better than lust
You live forever in us
The sun is shining
But it's raining in my heart
The sun is shining
Although it's raining in my heart

I'm in love with my baby
And I hate to see us part

My baby left me this morning
I didn't even say goodbye
My baby left me this morning
No, she didn't even say goodbye

You know I love you baby
And I don't know the reason why

I had a dream
I had a dream one rainy night
I had a dream
I had a dream one rainy night
You know I'm looking for my baby
And you know the sun was shining bright
(R): Hello, this is a big "Hi" and a sincere Merry Christmas from yours truly, Ringo Starr

[random clapping]

[sped-up marching band sample, with kids cheering]

[sped-up sample of Helter Skelter]
When I get to the bottom
I go back to the top of the slide
Where I stop and I turn and I go for a ride
Till I get to the bottom and I see you again

(over "Believe Me, If All Those Endearing Young Charms" played on piano)
(J): Wonsaponatime, there were two balloons called
Jock and Yono. They were strictly in love, bound to happen
In a million years. They were together man. Unfortunatimetable, they seemed to have previous experience which
Kept calling them one way oranother (you know howitis)
But they battled on against overwhelming oddities
Including some of there beast friends. Being in love
They cloong together even more man. But some of the
Poisonessmonsters of outrated buslodedapethrowers did
Stick slightly, and they occasionally had to resort to
The dry cleaners. Luckily this did not kill them and
They weren't banned form the Olympic Games. They lived
Hopefully ever after and who could blame them

[sample - Baroque Hoedown by Jean-Jacques Perrey and Gershon Kingsley]

(G): Well, here we are again, another fab Christmas. Christmas
Time is here again. Ain't been around since last year
And we'd like to take this opportunity, all the way from
America, to say happy Christmas to you our faithful
Beloved fans all over the world who have made our life
Worth living. And over here I have Mr. Malcolm Evans who
Through thick and thin would surely like to say a word
Of greeting at this festive occasion
(M): Merry Christmas children everywhere!

[over a sped-up orchestra recording of "Deck the Halls", and sample of crowd cheering]

(?): At the first stroke, it will be ...

(R): ... Ringo Starr. Thank you!
"Good evening."
"Hello me dear. I didn't know you were coming."
"I'm not surprised."
"Well, I am! Certainly am!"
"I would have thought so myself."
"Well, if you ask me, I think it's insane."
"Occasionally."
"Yes, me, too. Twice a week sometimes."
"Fourteen and six."
"Nineteen and five to save me if you don't mind."
"Yes, I know."
"Don't you say yes to me! I'm telling you!"
"This is a private line, you know."
"Private line? I've been on this line for two years."

(R): Well, it's my proud pleasure tonight to introduce one of
The most versatile performers in our career. And he's
Come all the way from Stokely Carmichel's -on-Sea
And I hope you're going to like him. Let's give him a
Big hand ... (YAY!!!)
(P): (Double-Tracked Singing)
Happy New Year, happy Christmas
Happy Easter, happy autumn
Happy Michelmas, ev'rybody
Happy Christmas, ev'rybody to you

[over distorted piano samples]
(J): Once upon a pool table there lived a short-haired
Butcher's boy by the way of Ostergrad. It comes in
Sentencesspoolararrowic Airport. Her father was in a
Long story cut short in the middle of his life sentence
We're indebted to the Colloquial office for its immediate
Disposal of her honorwitz, including, I might add, hoc virtallo a totem. On the other handbag, I mean to say
L'amoure ne soome tu joure realistic, strictly speaking
For this film is about an hourglass houseboat. The full
Meaning of Winchester Cathedral defies description. Their
Loss was our Gainsborough nil

(J (Double Tracked)):
The sound of a manservantile defectively lasting barred
Up in a love-dizzy gar-di-dell time. How close can you
Gettysburg and ever underly council ya originally a
Birdbath feeling--

(G): Cut!
We have a special guest here this evening, Mr
Tiny Tim. I'd like to ask him to say a few words

(T): Oh, hello to you nice Beatles. Ah, it's so wonderful
What a thrill it is talking here. Ah, in Mr. Harrison's
Presence, Mr. Weiss' presence, and all his nice wonderful
Friends. And the thing is, I just wanna say Merry
Christmas to you all. And, ah, a Happy New Year

(G): Thank you, Tiny. Would you like to sing us a little song?

(T): Ah, I'd love to. Here's a song I did in 1966 in front of
Miss Jill for the first time. And I did this in Albert
Hall, and what a thrill it was, ah, to do this then, and
Now ... exactly the way I did it then

(Singing)
He's a, ooh, real nowhere man
Living in his nowhere land
Making all his nowhere plans for nobody

Hasn't got a point of view
Knows not where he's going to
Isn't he a bit like you and me?

Nowhere man, (yes?) Don't worry
Take your time, don't hurry
Nowhere man, the world's at your command, ooh

He's a, huh huh, real nowhere man
Living in his nowhere land
Making all his nowhere plans for nobody, ooh, ooh

(G): Thank you, Tiny. Thank you and God bless you, Tiny

(T): God bless you all. Oh, God bless you all
Get back soon
Where are you now?
Oh, get back soon
Maxine, oh where are you now? (Maxine)
Oh, get back soon
Where are you now?
(Where are you now?)
Where are you now?
(Where are you now?)

Sometimes I wonder why she wouldn't stay
What I should have changed
Sometimes I wonder why it's been so long
What did I do wrong?
(Maxine, Maxine...)
Oh, where are you now?
Oh, where are you now?
Oh, where are you now?
Maxine
They say you're running around when I'm out of town
Never get home till after three
You're cheating yourself if you're cheating on me
If what they're saying is true, it's time that you knew
There are many more fishes in the sea
You're cheating yourself if you're cheating on me
I can't believe that you're flirting, but if you're flirting
Baby, I'm reminding you
Whatever's good for the goose is good for the gander too
You will take my advice, you're gonna think twice
Won't find a love as true as mine
Oh open your eyes, and I'm sure you will see
You're only cheating yourself if you're cheating on me
(instrumental)
I can't believe that you're flirting, but if you're flirting
Baby, I'm reminding you
Whatever's good for the goose is good for the gander too
If you will take my advice, you're gonna think twice
Won't find a love as true as mine
Oh open your eyes, and I'm sure you will see
You're only cheating yourself if you're cheating on me
It's over, it's over, it's over, I won't look back
Won't look back, my bridge has been crossed
It's over, it's over, it's over, I'll walk away
I'll stay away, cause my heart's been lost
Losing is not a happy thing when the stakes are high
Not when you lose your lover on a simple goodbye
It's over, it's over, It's over, I can't look back
Won't look back, my heart says it's done
It's over, it's over, it's over, but when I see her
And when I'm near her, I feel like it just began

Losing is not a happy thing when the stakes are high
Not when you lose your lover on a simple goodbye
It's over, it's over, it's over, I can't look back
Won't look back, my heart says it's done
It's over, it's over, it's over, but when I see her
And when I'm near her, I feel like it just began
Don't be so quick to walk away
Dance with me
I wanna rock your body, please stay
Dance with me
You don't have to admit you, wanna play
Dance with me
Just let me rock you, 'til the break of day
Dance with me

Got time, but I don't mind
Just wanna rock you girl

Come on, let's give it a whirl
See I've been watching you
I like the way you move
So go ahead and girl just do
That ass thing you do

So you grab your girls
And you grab a couple more
And you all come meet me
In the middle of the floor
Said the air is thick, it's smelling right
So you pass to the left then you sail to the right
Don't be so quick to walk away
Dance with me
I wanna rock your body, please stay
Dance with me
You don't have to admit you, wanna play
Dance with me
Just let me rock you, 'til the break of day
Dance with me

I don't mean no harm
Just wanna rock you girl
You can move, but be calm
Let's go, let's give it a whirl
See it appears to me
You like the way I move
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do
Pull you close and share my groove

So you grab your girls
And you grab a couple more
And you all can meet me
In the middle of the floor
Said the air is thick, it's smelling right
So you pass to the left then you sail to the right

Don't be so quick to walk away
Dance with me
I wanna rock your body, please stay
Dance with me
You don't have to admit you wanna play
Dance with me
Just let me rock you
Till the break of day
Dance with me

Talk to me boy
But I can't wait to have you in my arms
Talk to me boy
Hurry up 'cause you're taking too long
Talk to me boy
Bet I'll have you naked by the end of this song

So what did you come for?
I came to dance with you
And you know that you don't wanna hit the floor
Need some romance with you
You're searching for love forever more
And I'll take a chance
If love is here on the floor, girl

Hey
Dance with me
Yeah
Come on baby

Don't be so quick to walk away
Don't walk away
Come on and
Dance with me
I wanna rock your body
Let me rock your body
Please stay
Come on and
Dance with me
You don't have to admit you wanna play
You don't have to admit you wanna play, just Dance with me
Just let me rock you
Do do do do
Till the break of day
Come on and
Dance with me
Talk to me boy
No disrespect, I don't mean no harm
Talk to me boy
But I can't wait to have you in my arms
Talk to me boy
Hurry up cause you're taking too long
Come on baby
Talk to me boy
Bet I'll have you naked by the end of this song

Don't be so quick to walk away
Just thinking me and you
Don't be so quick to walk away
We could do something
Don't be so quick to walk away
I like the way you look right now
Don't be so quick to walk away
Come over here baby

Are you feeling me?
Let's do something
Let's make a bet
Cause I, bet I'll have you naked by the end of this song
Oh, oo-o-oh, come on, ooh, yeah
Well I tried to tell you so (yes, I did)
But I guess you didn't know, as I said the story goes
Baby, now I got the flow
'Cos I knew it from the start
Baby, when you broke my heart
That I had to come again, and show you that I'm real

(You lied to me) all those times I said that I love you
(You lied to me) yes, I tried, yes, I tried
(You lied to me) even though you know I'd die for you
(You lied to me) yes, I cried, yes, I cried

1-(Return of the Mack) it is
(Return of the Mack) come on
(Return of the Mack) oh my God
(You know that I'll be back) here I am
(Return of the Mack) once again
(Return of the Mack) pump up the world
(Return of the Mack) watch my flow
(You know that I'll be back) here I go
So I'm back up in the game
Running things to keep my swing
Letting all the people know
That I'm back to run the show
'Cos what you did, you know, was wrong
And all the nasty things you've done
So, baby, listen carefully
While I sing my come-back song

2-(You lied to me) 'cos she said she'd never turn on me
(You lied to me) but you did, but you do
(You lied to me) all these pains you said I'd never feel
(You lied to me) but I do, but I do, do, do

(Return of the Mack) here it is
(Return of the Mack) hold on
(Return of the Mack) don't you know
(You know that I'll be back) here I go
(Return of the Mack) oh little girl
(Return of the Mack) once my pearl
(Return of the Mack) up and down
(You know that I'll be back) round and round
(rpt 2, 1)

(You know that I'll be back) don't you know
(Return of the Mack) here it is
(Return of the Mack) hold on
(Return of the Mack) be strong
(You know that I'll be back) here I go
(Return of the Mack) my little girl
(Return of the Mack) once my pearl
(Return of the Mack) up and down
(You know that I'll be back) round and round

NAPPY BOY
Some enchanted evening, you may see a stranger
You may see a stranger across a crowded room
And somehow you know, you know even then
That somehow you'll see here again and again
Some enchanted evening, someone may be laughing
You may hear her laughing across a crowded room
And night after night, as strange as it seems
The sound of her laughter will sing in your dreams
Who can explain it, who can tell you why?
Fools give you reasons, wise men never try
Some enchanted evening, when you find your true love
When you hear her call you across a crowded room
Then fly to her side and make her your own
Or all through your life you may dream all alone
Once you have found her, never let her go
Once you have found her, never let her go
Hot town summer in the city
Back of my kneck gettin' dirty and gritty
I been down isn't it a pity
Doesn't seem to be a shadow in the city
All around people lookin' half dead
Walkin' down the sidewalk out of their match head
But at night it's a different world
Go out and find the girl
Come on and dance all night
Despite the heat it will be allright
And baby don't you know that you forget it
The day can be like the night
In the summer in the city
In the summer in the city
Cool town evening in the city
Dressed so fine and look so pretty
Cool cat lookin' for a kitty
Gonna look in every corner of the city
Till i reason like a bus stop
Running up the stairs, gonna meet you on the roof top
But night is a different world
Go out and find the girl
Come on come on let's dance all the night
Despite the heat it will be all right
And baby don't you know that you forget it
The day can be like the night
In the summer in the city
In the summer in the city
But at night it's a different world
Go out and find the girl
Come on and dance all night
Despite the heat it will be allright
And baby don't you know that you forget it
The day can be like the night
In the summer in the city
In the summer in the city
Summer in the city
Hot town summer in the city then again a cool town
Evening in the city
Than the back of my kneck gettin' dirty and gritty
Livin' in the city
In the summer town day
A cool town
A cool girl
Have fun
Evening in the city
One day, you will be cared to realize
By the look thats in my eyes

How much I love you
(Love you)
And if you leave, you'll lose a precious love
(You'll lose a precious love)

Somehow, these arms of mine can't let you go
The touch of my hand, baby should let you know

How much I love you
(Love you)
And if you leave, you'll lose a precious love
(You'll lose a precious love)

We go together like hand and glove
Don't destroy our precious love

Somehow these arms of mine can't let you go
The touch of my hand should let you know
How much I love you
(Love you)
And if you leave you'll lose a precious love
(You'll lose a precious love)

You'll lose a precious love
(You'll lose a precious love)
The touch of my hand should let you know
(You'll lose a precious love)
You'll lose a precious love
Down a long lonely road I've been cryin', lookin' 4 someone 2 care
Down a long lonely road I've been cryin', lookin' 4 someone 2 care
Down a long lonely road I've been cryin', lookin' 4 someone 2 care
Down a long lonely road I've been cryin', lookin' 4 someone 2 care

[repeat]
Yeah...

The best things in life are free
But you can give 'em to the birds and bees

I need money, that's what I want
That's what I want, yeah, that's what I want
That's what I want, that's what I want
That's what I want, that's what I want
Listen

Your love gives me a thrill
But your love don't pay my bills

I need money, that's what I want
Oh, that's what I want, that's what I want
That's what I want, that's what I want
That's what I want, that's what I want
Hey hey hey...

That's what I want...that's what I want
Sing it, y'all...
Money don't get everything, it's true (nah nah nah)
But what it don't get I can't use

I need money, that's what I want
That's what I want, that's what I want
That's what I want, that's what I want
That's what I want, that's what I want

Hey, I need money, that's what I want
Lots of money, that's what I want
Whole lotta money, that's what I want
That's what I want, that's what I want
That's what I want, that's what I want

I need money, that's what I want
A whole lotta money, that's what I want
I need money, that's what I want
That's what I want, that's what I want
That's what I want, that's what I want
That's what I want, that's what I want
It ain't no comparison and I'm not being arrogant
My jewelry game got them staring but your jewelry games embarrasing
Still got got that nasal flow I think I need some claritin
Still keep that White girl with me Kim Kardashian

Rap game I mastered it, yo G card I cancelled it
Flow hotter than candles get
A butt end of a candle stick
If you wanna challenge me
Make sure you can handle it
Cause it may be a funeral so gon call the evangelist
Conan man I conquer shit
Old school willy wonkad it
Candy paint with candy rims no candy for my spanish chicks
Suckas know I'm swagged up
But most of yall are swaggerless
Paved the way for east atlanta now watch what I do after this

[Verse 1]
He said, "You think you're a lady, but I know you're a woman
We are as young as the night"
I said, "No telephones ringing, no company coming
Just the lap of the lake and the firelight"

[Chorus]
And the lonely loon and the crescent moon
What a pocket of heavenly grace
But in France they say every day
Love puts on a new face

[Refrain]
Love has many faces
Many, many faces

[Verse 2]
About a month or so later he said, "Why can't you be happy?
You make me feel helpless when you get this way"
I said, "I'm up to my neck in alligators, jaws gnashing at me
Each one trying to pull a piece away"

[Chorus]
Darling, you can't slay these beasts of prey
Some bad dreams even love can't erase
But in France they say every day
Love puts on a new face

[Refrain]
Love has many faces
Many, many faces

[Verse 3]
He said," I wish you were with me here, the leaves are electric
They burn on the river bank, countless heatless flames"
I said, "Send me some pictures, then, and I'll paint pyrotechnic
Explosions of your autumn 'til we meet again"

[Chorus]
I miss your touch and your lips so much
I long for our next embrace
But in France they say every day
Love puts on a new face
Love puts on a new face

[Refrain]
Love has many faces
Many, many faces
Prince

Let her go, let her go, let her go
You got to realize this is the wind-up
You're gonna feel much better once you made your mind up
Don't cry, joe
Let her go, let her go, let her go
So you lost your gal
It's happened many times before
So you sit and mope like a dope
What's that good for
Get a hold of yourself
Forget her
You lived long before you met her

There're lots of other girls
So I say
Don't cry, joe
Let her go, let her go, let her go

You'll soon forget your troubles, joe
If you'd only listen
So don't cry, joe
Let her go, let her go, joe, let her go
I know so many people who think they can do it alone
They isolate their heads and stay in their safety zone
Now what can you tell them?
What can you say that won't make them defensive?

Hang on to your ego
Hang on, but I know that you're gonna lose the fight

They come on like they're peaceful, but inside they're so uptight
They trip through the day and waste all their thoughts at night
Now how can I say it?
And how can I come on when I know I'm guilty?

Hang on to your ego
Hang on, but I know that you're gonna lose the fight

Now how can I say it?
And how can I come on when I know I'm guilty?

Hang on to your ego
Hang on, but I know that you're gonna lose the fight
I'm a heart breaker
Yeah!
This is Gucci
And I play to break your heart
Is just me not even you

[Hook:]
I'm cold hearted, (cold hearted)
They say I get it from my father (cold hearted)
I'm cold hearted (cold hearted)
More time I don't wanna be bothered (cold hearted)
No no, I've been some inner places chasing paper under the sun
Wanna start the family done I came but faithful to one
I got a problem, in the name like I don't feel for your fame
And I hate to see them tears on your face
But I can't erase all the memories we've made
Got my .. go crazy it's like I'm stuck in the mace
Don't lose your hope in me, but if you keep the faith
All you secrets is safe with me take the shit to the grave

[Hook:]
I'm cold hearted, (cold hearted)
They say I get it from my father (cold hearted)
I'm cold hearted (cold hearted)
More time I don't wanna be bothered (cold hearted)
No no, 'cause I'm a heart breaker (heart breaker)
I'm a heart breaker, heart breaker, heart breaker, (breaker)
Heart breaker, heart breaker, heart breaker, (breaker)
Heart breaker, heart breaker, heart breaker, (breaker)
I'm drinking champagne of the bottle
I'm drinking they should spray like that's your bottle water
I'm drinking they suspend like that's your bottle water
I got the preacher's daughter doing all the shit I taught her
Go so hard I'ma break them hoes
Dick so hard I'ma break the ..
Cold hearted I ain't got no heart
Go mission I don't want no job
I ain't gonna help the time get hard

[?] she got no car
Push button I ain't got no key
Want to marry me and take hair my stash
Break her heart but the bitch ahead
I hate these hoes, but I love my fans
We have a doubt, but the shit won't last
Play the crash to where I drop my best
Head to head to where I made this cash
I ain't tryin' to give it up so fast
Blessed blessed now you win my past
Hundred Benz used to wipe my ass
Aces spade don't need no glass
Got rice of the past so the hoes go this

[Hook:]
I'm cold hearted, (cold hearted)
They say I get it from my father (cold hearted)
I'm cold hearted (cold hearted)
More time I don't wanna be bothered (cold hearted)
No no, 'cause I'm a heart breaker (heart breaker)
I'm a heart breaker, heart breaker, heart breaker, (breaker)
Heart breaker, heart breaker, heart breaker, (breaker)
Heart breaker, heart breaker, heart breaker, (breaker)
I'm drinking champagne at the bottle
I can't stop lovin' you
So I've made up my mind
To live in memory
Of old lonesome times
I can't stop wantin' you
It's useless to say
So I'll just live my life
In dreams of yesterday
Those happy hours
That we once knew
Though long ago
Yeah they make me feel blue
They say that time
Heals a broken heart
But time has stood still
Since we've been apart
I can't stop lovin' you
Yes so I've made up my mind
To live in memory
Of old lonesome times
I can't stop wantin' you
It's so useless to say
So I'll just live my life
Live my life in dreams
Of yesterday
Baby, I've got a one-way ticket to nowhere
Ain't got hundreds, so I count money in this chair
Exit, stage right. Baby, I get stage fright
And my baby runs this show and she's got a big share

Sold my car and I got no transport in this town
One night, baby, you'll look for me. I won't be around
Exit, stage right. Baby, I get stage fright
And my baby runs this show and she's got a big share
I look out my window watch her as she passes by
I say to myself I'm such a lucky guy
To have a girl like her is a dream come true
And of all the girls in New York she loves me true

It was just my imagination, once again
Running away with me
It was just my imagination
Running away with me

Soon we'll be married and raise a family
Two boys for you, what about two girls for me
I tell you I am just a fellow with a one track mind
Whatever it is I want baby I seek and I shall find

I'll tell ya
It was just my imagination, once again
Running away with me
It was just my imagination
Running away with me
Every night I hope and pray
"Dear lord, hear my plea
Don't ever let another take her love from me
Or I will surely die"

Her love is ecstasy
When her arms enfold me
I hear her tender rhapsody
But in reality, she doesn't even know... me
Them that's got shall get
Them that's not shall lose
So the bible says and it still is news
Mama may have papa may have
But God bless the child
That got its own, that got its own

Yes the strong gets more
While the weak ones fade
Empty pockets don't ever make the grade
Mama may have, papa may have
But God bless the child
That's got its own, that's got its own

Money you've got lots of friends
Crowding around the door
When you're gone
And the spending ends
They don't come no more
Rich relations give
Crusts of bread and such
You can help your self
But don't take to much
Mama may have, papa may have
But God bless the child
That's got its own, that's got its own
Oh, baby you done lost your good thing now
Oh, baby, baby you done lost your good thing now
Way I used to love you baby
Baby thats the way I hate you now

You used to say that you loved me
And you would do anything I said
You used to say that you loved me baby
And you would do anything I said

But the way you treat me now baby
Baby, I would much rather be dead
You said at once that you love me
Honey, but now I believe you've changed your life

Oh you said that you love me baby
But now I believe you've changed your mind
But, but I dont blame you baby
Because you ain't what you used to be

Oh but let me, but let me love you one more time baby
Let me love you one more time anyway
Oh baby, let me love you one more time anyway
Oh you know you can't quit me now baby
Because you didn't mean me no good anyway
Yeah baby, baby you done lost your good thing now
Oh baby, you done lost your good thing now
Yeah I say the way I used to, the way I used to love you baby
Baby thats the way I hate you now
Sweet dream baby

Sweet dream baby (dream baby ah-huh-huh)
Sweet dream baby (dream baby ah-huh-huh)
Sweet dream baby
Down in the willow garden
Where me and my love did meet
As we set there a courtin'
My love fell off to sleep

I had a bottle of burgundy wine
My love she did not know
So I poisoned that dear little girl
On the banks below

I drew a saber through her
It was a bloody knife
I threw her in the river
Which was a dreadful sight

My father oft had told me
That money would set me free

If I would murder that dear little girl
Whose name was Rose Connelly
My father sits at his cabin door
Wiping his tear dimmed eyes
For his only son soon shall walk
To yonder scaffold high

My race is run beneath the sun
The scaffold now waits for me
For I did murder that dear little girl
Whose name was Rose Connelly
I'm 19 years old, I'm a young comedian
I hate that term, "young comedian", you know
I prefer "prodigy"
And people, they pigeonhole me as a comic
You know, which is so disingenuous cause I'm not a comic, I'm an artist
And I don't do comedy shows, I do one man shows
And I've been doing them, uh
1998 was actually my first one man show
It was a show about Jews in Nazi Germany called Under the Floor Boards
I'll do a scene from that, uh, right now
No no no
Watch and then judge
This is a scene from Under the Floor Boards
"Hey, shh"

And then '99
'99, I did a show called The Catholic Orgasm, I'll do a scene from that
(Moaning)
(Sobbing)

2000, I did a piece called The Inappropriate Musician, I'll do a scene from that
"Mike
Mike, back off the ledge, Mike, th-
Mike, think about your kids, do you want them to grow up without a father, is that what you want, Mike?! Mi-
Please listen to me, I'm your friend
No, Mike, don't jump!
No, Mike, no!
(Slide whistle down)
(Slide whistle up)
"He's saved"
2001, I did John Steinbeck's The Grapes of Wrath
Except I adapted it into a story about an intergalactic sexual predator called The Rapes of Grath

2002, I did a piece, if you're familiar with The Elephant Man
I did a piece based off that called Bulldog Man (Voice cracks when he says "man")
Oh, also known as Bulldog Man (Says "man" properly) for those who hit puberty
And I uh
I'll do a monologue from that right now
(Silence)
(Laughter)
For those listening on the CD, I kind of look like a bulldog

2003, 4? 3. Doesn't matter, I'm lying
2000-
2004, I did a piece called SmÃ©agol, from Lord of the Rings, Having Sex with a Black Chick, I'll do that
(Moaning as SmÃ©agol)
"Precious"
I actually got a Danza nomination for that, it was
Right after the Tony's

2000, uh, 5
2005, if I could get a blackout for this, I did a piece called Charlie Brown Getting Molested, so if we could blackout right now
"Hello?
Is anybody here?"
(Unintelligible trombone noises a la Peanuts cartoon)
"What the fuck are you doing?! Let go of me!"
(Unintelligible trombone noises)
"Good grief"
So, 2000, uh, bring the lights up
2007
2007, I did a piece called The Juggler's Wife, I'll do a scene from that
"Please
Stop JUGGLING!"

2008, I did a
Bit of a controversial piece because I played a slave in the 1780's, but I didn't wear make-up
Cause I feel as, you know, an artist I'm qualified to tell any story, and uh
It was a piece called Whiplashes and this was the climactic scene
It is hard, raw art, so if you're adverse to that, you might want to look away
But this is, um, the climactic scene from Whiplashes and I hope you enjoy it
"You'll have to answer to God for this"
(Whip crack)
"Ow
Ow
Ow
Ow
Ow
Ow
Ow
Ow
...You're a dick"

And then, uh, 2000-
...9, which is the last year before the piece I'm doing currently
I did a piece called, it's a very emotional piece, it means a lot to me so forgive me if I break down
But this is a, uh, a scene from it and the piece was called A Boy and His Dog
"Get out of here, alright?
Go, I can't afford to keep you anymore, I just
I can't, it's too
Please don't make this harder than it has to be, I
I hate you, is that what you need to hear from me?
Alright, I hate you
I hate you!
It's not just me
My dog hates Mexicans too"
You've given me a true love
And every day, I thank you, love
For a feeling that's so new
So inviting, so exciting

Whenever you're near
I hear a symphony
A tender melody
Pulling me closer and closer to your arms

Then suddenly
(I hear a symphony)
Oh, your lips are touching mine
A feeling that's so divine, 'till I leave my past behind
I'm lost in a world made for you and me, oh, yeah

Whenever you're near
I hear a symphony
Sweet and tenderly
Every time your lips meet mine
Baby, baby
I hear a symphony
A tender melody
Holdin' me closer and closer

Baby, baby
I hear a symphony
A tender melody
Uh, yeah, uh

Baby, baby
I hear a symphony
(So sweet, so sweet)
A tender melody
(A tender melody)
Livin' for you, live for me, baby
When the pain of love gets rough
Will you run away saying that you had enough
When the pain of love gets strong
Will you feel that you just can't carry on
Will you sigh will you cry will you die
Will you hang on and say "we can make it baby"
Will you give up and swear to God you've had enough
Tell me will you try to fake it baby

When the pain of love gets rough
Will you run away saying that you had enough
When the pain of love gets strong
Will you feel that you just can't carry on

When the road gets a little bit rocky
Will you turn your back girl and go the other way
When the road gets a little bit muddy
Will you feel you can try it on another day
Tell me is it fair when you care
To even dare take a heart and break it
Is it wise to apologize
Hang on strong and try to take it baby
When the pain of love gets rough
Will you run away saying that you had enough
When the pain of love gets strong
Will you feel that you just can't carry on

Will you sigh will you cry will you die
Will you hang on and say "we can make it baby"
Will you give up and swear to God you've had enough
Tell me will you try to fake it baby

When the pain of love gets rough
Will you run away saying that you had enough
Tell me now
When the pain of love gets strong
Will you feel that you just can't carry on

When the pain is so strong
Tell me that you got enough
When the pain is so strong
Baby tell me you can hold on
Maybe you like to give a kiss so sweet
Only for one night you belong to me
Maybe you go away and drive a car
But the taste of wine is worse than none at all

In that case I don't want no part
That would only break my heart
Well, if you feel like loving me and if you got the notion
I second that emotion

Maybe you think that love would tie you down
You ain't got the time to hang around
Maybe you think that love would make you a fool
So it makes you wise to break the rule

In that case I don't want no part
That would only break my heart
Well, if you feel like loving me and if you got that notion
I second that emotion
Well, if you feel like giving me a lifetime of devotion
I second that emotion
I turn and walk away then I come 'round again
It looks as though tomorrow I'll do pretty much the same
I must turn down your offer but I'd like to ask a break
You know I'm ready to give everything for anything I take
Someone called my name you know I turned around to see
It was midnight in the Mission and the bells were not for me
Come again, walking along in the Mission in the rain
Come again, walking along in the Mission in the rain
Ten years ago, I walked this street my dreams were riding tall
Tonight I would be thankful Lord, for any dream at all
Some folks would be happy just to have one dream come true
But everything you gather is just more that you can lose
Come again, walking along in the Mission in the rain
Come again, walking along in the Mission in the rain
All the things I planned to do I only did half way
Tomorrow will be Sunday born of rainy Saturday
There's some satisfaction in the San Francisco rain
No matter what comes down the Mission always looks the same
Come again, walking along in the Mission in the rain
In the blue of evening
When you appear close to me, dear one
There in the dusk we'll share a dream reverie

In the blue of evening
While crickets call and stars are falling
There 'neath the midnight sky you'll come to me

In the shadows of the night we'll stand
I'll touch your hand and then
Softly as your lovely eyes entreat
Our lips will meet again

In the blue of evening
Night winds above whispering, "I love you"
There will we find romance in the blue of evening

[Intro]
Oh yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na

[Verse 1]
Baby, let me tell you how I feel
This urge is seizing me, controlling, it's unreal
Ooh, ah, baby, I wanna let you know
You got me yearning, so baby, let me show you

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, I want you baby
Gotta let you know I need you here with me (Alright)
(Right here and nowhere else, honey)
This ain't the right way
Gotta find another way to earn your love
Just give me a clue 'cause you know

[Chorus]
Sympin' ain't easy
Get on your hands and knees and lift your eyebrows
Sympin' ain't easy
And if you wanna get it, you know you gotta be willing
To cry and beg and plead when you need

[Verse 2]
Pardon my expression (You're excused)
But the feeling I have is so strong
I guess you know this isn't easy to do
I keep trying and trying to give my love to you

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, I want you baby
Gotta let you know I need you here with me
(Right here, right here, oh)
This ain't the right way
Gotta find another way to earn your love
Just give me a clue 'cause you know

[Chorus]
Sympin' ain't easy
Get on your hands and knees and lift your eyebrows
Sympin' ain't easy
And if you wanna get it, you know you gotta be willing
To cry and beg and plead when you need
Sympin' ain't easy
Get on your hands and knees and lift your eyebrows
Sympin' ain't easy
And if you wanna get it, you know you gotta be willing
To cry and beg and plead when you need

[Verse 3]
I'm always on my knees and, baby, baby, please
And the teasin' has to stop
Sweat on sweat, I made a little side bet
That if I knocks the boots, you'll be limpin'
Sympin' and sympin', never ever again
The B-I-V down with Boyz II Men
Cooley High School, yeah, I know your teacher
Lisa with the loops, it was nice to meet you

[Bridge]
Ooh, I want you baby
Gotta let you know I need you here with me
Yeah, yeah, yeah, this ain't the right way
Gotta find another way to earn your love
Just give me a clue 'cause you know

[Verse 4]
Sympin' ain't easy, I won't lie
I wanna get with you tonight
You know you want this, don't deny
Name's Michael, Shawn and Wan'
Don't have much time to get it on
So make the best with me, I'll do you right

[Verse 5]
Yeah, I know you like the way we came outta that bridge
And just in case you didn't know
It was another superproducer Rico dance show
So we're gonna let you just ride this groove
Another white man can't jump song
Biv Entertainment goin' to the movies and I'm gone
Gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone
Oh say can you see
By the dawns early light
What so proudly we hail
And the twilights last gleaming
Whose broad stripes and bright stars
Through the perilous fight
For the ram-parts we watched
Where so galantly streaming
My country tis of thee
Sweet land of liberty
Of thee I sing
Land where my fathers died
Land of the Pilgrim's pride
From every mountain side
Let freedom ring
And the rocket's red glare
The bombs bursting in air
Gave proof through the night
That our flag was still there
Oh say does that star spangled banner yet wave
For the land of free
And the home of the brave!
I got you, I'll be right here
Come stop your crying
It will be all right
Just take my hand
Hold it tight now

I will protect you
From all around you
I will be here
Don't you cry

For one so small
You seem so strong now
My arms will hold you
Keep you safe and warm

This bond between us
Can't be broken
Said I'm gonna be here
Don't you cry
'Cause you'll be in my heart
You'll be in my heart yeah
From this day on
Now and forever more
For more no no no no(hahaha, come on, yeah)

Why can't they understand the way we feel
They just don't trust what they can't explain
I know we're different
But deep inside us
We're not that different at all

You'll, you'll be in my heart
Yes you'll be in my heart
From this day on
Now and forever more (forever more)
From this day on
Forever more, you'll be

You'll be in my heart
No matter what they say
You'll be right here in my arms, always
Always

Don't listen to them
'Cause what do they know
We need each other to have to hold
They'll see in time
I know
We'll show them together
You'll be in my heart (you'll be in my heart, I'll always be there)
Yes you'll be in my heart (You know that from)
This day on
Now and forever more (now and forever more)
You'll be in my heart
No matter what they say
You'll be right here in my arms, always
Always

Just look over your shoulder
Listen, no matter what they say, no no
Look over your shoulder
Just look over your shoulder
I'll always be there

Just look over your shoulder
I'll be right there
I'll always be there
Know that I got you

Just look over your shoulder
No matter what no matter what no matter what
Just look over your shoulder
No matter what they say, no no

[Verse 1]
"I'm all alone," said she
"No one to phone, no one to touch me"
"I'm on my way," said the man in the long leather coat
As he started his car

[Verse 2]
"I'm glad you came," said she
"You got my note, you understood it"
He smiled as he hung up his long leather coat
On the back of the door

[Chorus 1]
Stroll on baby, step right in
Help yourself to a handful of everything in sight
Let the party begin
Stroll on baby, step right in
Help yourself to a handful of everything in sight
Let the party begin

[Verse 3]
"Oh, I love your coat," said she ("Oh, I love your coat," said she)
He said, "Well, thank you" (He said, "Well, thank you")
"In your note you said you had" ("In your note you said you had")
"No one to touch you" ("No one to touch you")
"So shall I go through?" ("So shall I go, so shall I go
So shall I go, so shall I go?")

[Bridge]
Why, yes, she said, you can go on ahead
Then she took out her key
And she locked him into the bedroom
Oh, oh, oh

[Verse 4]
"Now I am alone," said she
She took a can of really red paint
And she sprayed up and down on the long leather coat
On the bloody red floor

[Chorus 2]
So long, baby, I took you in
Just to show you that your long leather coat
Is really nothing but a handful of skin
Stroll on, baby, step right in
Help yourself to a handful of everything in sight
Let the party begin!

[Outro]
Let the party begin!
Oo-oo-oo-oo
Oo-oo-oo
Well, let the party, the party begin
I looked at you baby
And what did I see
I saw love in your eyes
Made me feel so warm inside

Now look at me baby
And what do you see
You see love in my eyes
Gleaming just for you

And now we know it's
Time to get alone
To get alone
And just be together
We'll only be together

Come and do a couple days
Just a ways
Away from the people
And safe from the people
The pine-scented air
Smells so good in the snow
In our toboggan we'll go
Screaming down the mountainside

The touch of your cheeks
When they're rosy and cold
Feels so cozy to hold
Just to take you close
And make you warm and

Time to get alone
To get alone
And just be together
We'll only be together

Come and do a couple days
Just a ways
Away from the people
And safe from the people

Lyin' down on our backs
Lookin' at the sky
Looking down through the valley so
Deep and wide
Aren't you glad we finally got away
Glad we finally got away
Aren't you glad we finally got away

Now I looked around baby
And what do I see
I see love in your eyes
And I'm so glad that we
Finally had some

Time to get alone
To get alone
And just be together
We'll only be together

Come and do a couple days
Just a ways
Away from the people
And safe from the people
Oh you killed it on this one dawg

I try but I can't seem to get myself to think of
Anything but you
Your breath on my face, your warm gentle kiss
I taste the truth, I taste the truth
You know what I came here for, so I won't ask for more
I wanna be with you, if only for a night
To be the one who's in your arms, who holds you tight
I wanna be with you there's nothing more to say
There's nothing else I want more than to feel this way
I wanna be with you
So I'll hold you tonight like I would if you were mine
To hold forever more
And I'll savor each touch that I wanted so much
To feel before, to feel before
How beautiful it is just to be like this
I wanna be with you, if only for a night
To be the one who's in your arms, who holds you tight
I wanna be with you there's nothing more to say
There's nothing else I want more than to feel this way
I wanna be with you
(I wanna be with you)
I wanna be with you
Oh, baby, I can't fight this feeling anymore
It drives me crazy when I try to
So call my name, take my hand
Can you make my wish, baby, your command
I wanna be with you there's nothing more to say
There's nothing else I want more than to feel this way
I wanna be with you
(I wanna be with you)
I wanna be with you
I wanna be with you, yeah
(I wanna be with you)
I wanna be, I wanna be with you
I wanna be, I wanna be, I wanna be
I wanna be with you
I wanna be baby, I wanna be with you
I wanna be, I wanna be, I wanna be
(I wanna be with you)
I wanna be baby, I wanna be with you
I wanna be, I wanna be, I wanna be
I wanna be with you, I wanna be with you, I wanna be
(I wanna be with you)
I wanna be with you, I wanna be with you
Yeah, feel real good

Cameras on the ceiling
Cameras on the corners of my bed
I barely know you but I'm feeling
Like you really did something to my head

It's close to midnight
And I just want to be up in your hair
And I'll be alright
Long as I feel your body right there
It seems so crystal clear, I know that

Everybody's somebody's freak
Say it again, say it again
Everybody's somebody's freak
The question is, whose are you?

Well, can I be your, your, your, your, your freak?
Can I be your, your, your, your, your freak?
Don't need no television
I'll just watch your body going down
I'll touch you with precision
Go crazy when you make those sounds

Feels like a wet dream
This time, baby, you can be the star
A freaky sex dream
Visualize, make sure you play your part
And when I get nice and hard, turn the lights on

Everybody's somebody's freak
Say it again, say it again
Everybody's somebody's freak
The question is, whose are you?

Can I be your, your, your, your, your freak?
Can I be your, your, your, your, your freak?
Can I be your, your, your, your, your freak?
Can I be your, your, your, your, your freak?

Vases, chandeliers, glass of wine, can of beer
Alcohol can't end the fear, here's the wheel, can you steer?
Don't need tickets in the Lear, you perform I would share
You can scream, no one hears, feed your face, no one cares
The floor appears to be yours
Go 'head, pop the champagne
Just like we're on a world tour
Sex would be a campaign

'Cause everybody's somebody's freak
Say it again, say it again
Everybody's somebody's freak
The question is, whose are you?

Can I be your, your, your, your, your freak?
Can I be your, your, your, your, your freak?
Can I be your, your, your, your, your freak?
Can I be your, your, your, your, your freak?

I think that's enough
Yeah, turn the lights on
B.B. boogie darlin'
The B.B. boogie baby
Do the B.B. boogie, if it takes you all night long

Well I looked at the clock
The clock said four
My baby jumped up
She said, "B., let's go"

Do the B.B. boogie baby
B.B. boogie darlin'
Do the B.B. boogie, if it takes you all night long

Grabbed my bay turned her round and round
She said, "B.'s the boogiest man in town"

B.B. boogie darlin'
The B.B. boogie baby
Do the B.B. boogie, if it takes you all night long

I grabbed my baby and I held her tight
Me and my baby do the boogie all night
B.B. boogie darlin'
The B.B. boogie baby
Do the B.B. boogie, if it takes you all night long

I grabbed my baby and I held her tight
She said, "love me baby and squeeze me tight"

The B.B. boogie
B.B. boogie darlin'
B.B. boogie, if it takes you all night long

[Intro]
I'm about to make it real hot
(TP-2, TP-2, TP-2)
12 Play 2000

[Verse 1]
Hit it hard from the back
Roll around on the front
I know you've heard a lot of tracks
But 12 Play's what you want
Just let me call the studio
Then we can go all night
Girl, I hope you can hang
'Cause I'm horny as hell tonight

[Chorus]
One, taking off your Secrets with my teeth
Two, slightly rough to let you know it's about to get kinky
Three, blind your eyes, then I walk you to my bedroom
Four, now open your eyes, surprise you've entered 12 Play two

[Verse 2]
Stop, we need to catch our breath
We've been going for a while
It's been about two hours
And we're still going round for round
The water's getting cold
And the movie's going off
This is how we do in TP-2

[Chorus]
Five, I'm about to take you for a ride, now feel it come inside
Six, baby, it's as hard as a brick, tell me can you feel this sh, sh, sh
Seven, that's when I slow it down 'cause I'm not ready to
Eight, we're almost at the peak 'cause I'm feeling tingly

[Verse 3]
Now flex your body like, what (what, what)
It's like diamonds with the cut (cut, cut)
The hottest out of your friends
The way you take it from me
Girl, you put it on me like draws
Moaning when you talk
I'm about to tear your shit out
New millennium style

[Chorus]
Nine, looking you in your eyes as I'm about to do that thing
Ten, then on down to your thighs, I'm gonna make you scream
Eleven, now put your body on top of me, I'm about to grab your waist
Twelve, now quick before we get to thirteen, set it on my face
Once I was a slave at the sawmill
Talk about a poor boy, talk about a poor boy
Let me have a dollar bill
My work was so hard at the sawmill
Talk about a poor boy, talk about a poor boy
Let me have a dollar bill
See my teardrops falling down my wife left this sawmill town
She said sawmill's life had been a sin
The gravy were much too thin
I can't work no more at the sawmill
Talk about a poor boy, talk about a poor boy
Let me have a dollar bill
If you take your wife to the sawmill
How you gonna please her, how you gonna please her
When she wants a dollar bill
She'll run away and leave you at the sawmill
Women like a dollar, women like a dollar. Yes and women always will
See my teardrops falling down my wife left this sawmill town
She said sawmill's life had been a sin
The gravy were much too thin. I can't work no more at the sawmill
Yes and women like a dollar, yes and women like a dollar
Yes and women always will

[Verse 1]
There was a California earthquake, in the year of '83
It shook the living daylights out of the Owens County Seat
Not a building was still standing when the dust had cleared away
And there was a rumble in the distance all the way to San Andrea

[Verse 2]
Sherman Buck was driving his old mule into town
When a big one came and shook so hard, that it knocked him to the ground
Lord there opened up a hole so big, he thought his time was up
And it swallowed up that poor old mule and it just missed Sherman Buck

[Chorus]
California earthquake you just don't know what you've done
We may fall off in the ocean, but you'll never make us run
You're a partner to the devil, but we ain't afraid of him
We'll build ourselves another town so you can tear it down again

[Verse 3]
Then came the quake of '99 that levelled Mission Creek
The earth was like an ocean churning, with waves of twenty feet
Lord it sounded like a thousand trains were screaming underground
All the way to San Joachim they heard that mournful sound

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
Then came one day the holocaust on San Franciso Bay
Miles of walls came down like old Jericho that day
Might near everything the earthquake missed, a holy fire consumed
And left 'em smoke and the ashes of the dreams that can't be ruined

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Build ourselves another town so you can tear it down again
Well
You know you make me wanna (Shout)
Kick my heels up and (Shout)

[Verse 1]
Sisotowbell Lane, Noah is fixing the pump in the rain
He brings us no shame, we always knew that he always knew
Up over the hill, jovial neighbours come down when they will
With stories to tell, sometimes they do, yes sometimes we do

[Chorus 1]
We have a rocking chair, each of us rocks his share
Eating muffin buns and berries
By the steamy kitchen window
Sometimes we do, our tongues turn blue

[Verse 2]
Sisotowbell Lane, anywhere else now would seem very strange
The seasons are changing every day in every way
Sometimes it is spring, sometimes it is not anything
A poet can sing, sometimes we try, yes we always try

[Chorus 2]
We have a rocking chair, some days we rock and stare
At the woodlands and the grasslands
And the badlands 'cross the river
Sometimes we do, we like the view

[Verse 3]
Sisotowbell Lane, go to the city, you'll come back again
To wade through the grain, you always do, yes we always do
Come back to the stars, sweet well water and pickling jars
We'll lend you the car, we always do, yes sometimes we do

[Chorus 3]
We have a rocking chair, someone is always there
Rocking rhythms while they're waiting
With the candle in the window
Sometimes we do, we wait for you
I pulled in to Nazareth, I was feeling about half past dead
I just need some place where I can lay my head
"Hey, Mister, can you tell me where a man might find a bed"
He just grinned, shook my hand, "No" was all he said

Take a load off, Fanny
Take a load for free
Take a load off, Fanny
Andâ¦ you put the load right on me

I picked up my bag, I went looking for a place to hide
When I saw Carmen and the devil walking side by side
I said, "Hey, Carmen, come on, let's go downtown"
She said, "I got to go, but my friend can stick around"

Take a load off, Fanny
Take a load for free
Take a load off, Fanny
Andâ¦ you put the load right on me

Go down, Miss Moses, there's nothing you can say
It's just old Luke, and Luke's waiting on the judgement day
"Well, Luke, my friend, what about young Anna Lee"
He said, "Do me a favor, son, won't you stay and keep Anna Lee company"
Take a load off, Fanny
Take a load for free
Take a load off, Fanny
Andâ¦ you put the load right on me

Crazy Chester followed me and he caught me in the fog
He said, "I will fix your rack, if you'll take Jack my dog"
I said, "Wait a minute, Chester, you know I'm a peaceful man"
He said, "That's okay, boy, won't you feed him when you can"

Take a load off, Fanny
Take a load for free
Take a load off, Fanny
Andâ¦ you put the load right on me

Get your cannon ball now, to take me down the line
My bag is sinking low, and I do believe it's time
To get back to Miss Fanny, you know she's the only one
Who sent me here with her regards for everyone

Take a load off, Fanny
Take a load for free
Take a load off, Fanny
Andâ¦ you put the load right on me

I pulled in to Nazareth, I was feeling about half past dead
I just need some place where I can lay my head
"Hey, Mister, can you tell me where a man might find a bed"
He just grinned, shook my hand, "No" was all he said
Take a load off, Fanny
Take a load for free
Take a load off, Fanny
Andâ¦ you put the load right on me
You put the load right on me
Yeah
Will you take part in my life, my love
That is my dream
Life is but a dream; it's what you make it
Always try to give; don't ever take it
Life has its music, life has its song of love, love
Life is but a dream, and I dream of you
Strange as it seems, all night I see you
I'm tryin' to tell you just what you mean to me
I love you with all my heart
I adore you and all your lovin' charms
I want you to do your part
Come here to my open arms
Life is but a dream, & we can live it
Oh we can make a love none to compare with
Oh will you take part in my life, my love
That is my dream

[Verse]

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Meek Mill]

[Hook]
If I leave here tomorrow
Would you still remember me?
For I must be travelling on now
There's just too many places I've got to see

But if I stay here with you, girl
Things just couldn't be the same
'Cause I'm as free as a bird now
And this bird you cannot change
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

And this bird you cannot change
And this bird you cannot change
Lord knows I can't change

Bye bye, baby, it's been a sweet love yeah, yeah
And though this feeling I can't change
But please don't take this so badly
'Cause Lord knows I'm to blame

But if I stay here with you, girl
Things just couldn't be the same
'Cause I'm as free as a bird now

Lord knows I can't change
Lord, help me, I can't change

Lord, I can't change
Won't you fly high free bird?
Yeah
I hear the train a comin'
It's rollin' 'round the bend
And I ain't seen the sunshine
Since, I don't know when
I'm stuck in Folsom Prison
And time keeps draggin' on
But that train keeps a-rollin'
On down to San Antone

When I was just a baby
My Mama told me, "Son
Always be a good boy
Don't ever play with guns,"
But I shot a man in Reno
Just to watch him die
When I hear that whistle blowin'
I hang my head and cry

I bet there's rich folks eatin'
In a fancy dining car
They're probably drinkin' coffee
And smokin' big cigars
But I know I had it comin'
I know I can't be free
But those people keep a-movin'
And that's what tortures me
Well, if they freed me from this prison
If that railroad train was mine
I bet I'd move out over a little
Farther down the line
Far from Folsom Prison
That's where I want to stay
And I'd let that lonesome whistle
Blow my Blues away
Everybody makes mistakes
But I feel alright when I come undone
You're not making me wait
But it seems alright as long as something's happening
I try to make you late
But you fight me out like a fighter does
You try making me wait
But it feels alright as long as something's happening

Get your payments from the nation
For your trials and tribulations

You try to make me wait
You come around when it's come undone
Everybody makes you late
And it's never you, because you're always thinkin'
I try making you wait
And you give me some like you give it good
Everybody makes mistakes
But it seems it's mine that always keep on stingin'
Get your payments from the nation
For your trials and tribulations
Get your payments from the nation
For your trials and tribulations

You try making me wait
But you come undone when you come undone
Everybody makes mistakes
But it's always mine that seem to keep on stickin'

Get your payments from the nation
For your trials and tribulations
Get your payments from the nation
For your trials and tribulations
Get your payments from the nation
For your trials and tribulations
Get your payments from the nation
For your trials and tribulations
Get your payments from the nation
For your trials and tribulations
Well, it feels alright, 'n' ev'rything is really ok
Well, it feels alright, 'n' ev'rything is really ok
Well, and the love of my baby, whoo, make me feel this way

Well, she got great big legs, whoo, and the cutest little feet
Yeah, she got great big legs, man, and the cutest little feet
Hey, she upsets ev'rybody, ev'ry man she meet
Alright!

Look out, well, help me, somebody
I love ya baby, oh, sweet like heaven up above
Well, I pray to the Lord, you're the only one I love

If Loveliness Were Music
If loveliness were music
I'd hear a symphony every time I look at you
If loveliness were music
I know your charms would be heavenly to listen to
I'd hold you near, and then I'd hear the ringing, singing
Of themes from angels' dreams
If loveliness were music
The sight of you would fill
Al the world with songs that thrill
Earth and heaven too
Would echo songs of you
(musical interlude)
I'd hold you near, and then I'd hear the ringing, singing
Of themes from angels' dreams
If loveliness were music
The sight of you would fill
All the world with songs that thrill
Earth and heaven too
Would echo songs of you
They say a fool never learns
You agree I'm not superstitious
You know unlucky as I've been
I'm still around
And you can tell me to go
I've been reading your true confessions
But then you don't believe I'd let
This chance go by I, I...

Show me inside
Sorry that I've been so far away
You know I'm only human
It's the call of the wild
It's the law of the jungle
Don't say no...

Wanna be with you
Won't you stay with me overnight
Give a little bit to you
Won't you stay with me stay
Pulling me to you
Won't you stay with me overnight
It'll be forever if you stay with me
Stay with me, stay...
As long as time will allow
You'll be losing your inhibitions
One night is not enough
For all the love to grow
And baby you and I rule the world
Maybe I could be your magician
Just give me long enough
My spell will hypnotize, I, I...

Show me inside
Live in every corner of your heart
You know I'm only human
It's the call of the wild
It's the law of the jungle
Don't say no...

Wanna be with you
Won't you stay with me overnight
Give a little bit to you
Won't you stay with me stay
Pulling me to you
Won't you stay with me overnight
It'll be forever if you stay with me
Stay with me, stay...

Stay with me overnight
Stay
Stay with me overnight
Stay
Stay with me overnight
Stay
Stay with me stay...
Stay with me stay...
Stay with me stay...

Letâs try getting to the sky, hang on or youâre going to die
Sour life can turn sweet, itâs laying at your feet
Sweet child with an innocent smile watches closely all the while
Donât be fooled when he cries, keep looking at the eyes

Good life is contradiction because of the crucifixion
If youâre ready and have the need, I will take your soul and plant my seed

You just gotta listen to the night at the ending of the day
You just gotta listen to the night as safety slips away
Moving out of sight are the things you need to see to feel
And as they slip away becoming so unreal unreal
You just gotta listen to the night as youâre going up the stairs
You just gotta listen to the night and donât forget to say your prayers
And as you lose control to the eyes in dark disguise
And icy fingers send electric lies

[Chorus]
Weâre disturbing the priest, wonât you please come to our feast
Do we mind disturbing the priest, not at all, not at all, not in the least
Do we mind disturbing the priest
Not at all, not at all, not in the least
The force of the devil is the darkness the priest has to face
The force of the night will destroy him but will not disgrace
To get into his mind and to his soul you gotta set alight
The flames of doubt so deep inside inside
The devil and the priest canât exist if one goes away
Itâs just like the battle of the sun and the moon and night and day
The force of the devil, thatâs weâre all told to fear
Watch out for religion when he gets too near too near

[Chorus]
Weâre disturbing the priest, wonât you please come to our feast
Do we mind disturbing the priest, not at all, not at all, not in the least

Good life is contradiction because of the crucifixion
If youâre ready and have the need, I will take your soul and plant my seed

Letâs try getting to the sky, hang on or youâre going to die
Sour life can turn sweet, itâs laying at your feet
Sweet child with an innocent smile watches closely all the while
Donât be fooled when he cries, keep looking at the eyes

Disturbing the priest
I'll tell you every single-- We all have gifts, you know, and um, like special gifts. And there's this voice inside of us that says "don't do that," you know. "Why you gonna get up there with that guitar? You're gonna like like a, a hip hop folk singer. What are you, you know, what are you?..."

(Laughter)

And I really went through, I mean, I'm serious, I mean I can laugh about it now, but it took a long time for me to understand that, you know, what I am is what I am.

I can't be afraid to, you know, to expose that to the public. You know, always-get in trouble trying to make it, tryin' to dress it up, you know what I'm sayin'? Just tired of that, you know. Just tired of that. Tired of frontin'. Tired of that.

And until I find a group of people that are as passionate about it as I am, I just roll alone until such time, you know? It's all good. God is faithful.

Y'all still get to hear it, so... you know? 'Cause see that enemy he would tell me, you know "You don't have the 20 piece band, you can't do nothin'." I said, "Yeah, sure... Keep talkin'."

'Cause somebody's gon', they gonna see me and they gonna know "Oh I, there's somethin' that God's been tellin me to do. I can do it, too. I can do what I'm supposed to be doin'. I don't need an entourage. What do I need a crew for?" That doesn't validate you. Okay, let's see. Mmmm...
The fox went out to the chase one night
Prayed to the moon to give him light
He had many a mile to go that night
Before he reached the town-o, town-o town-o
Many a mile to go that night before he reached the town
Many a mile to go that night before he reached the town
He ran 'til he came to a great big pen
Where the ducks and the geese were kept there in
Said a couple of you gonna grease my chin
Before I leave this town o, town o, town o
Couple of you gonna grease my chin before I leave this town
Couple of you gonna grease my chin before I leave this town
He grabbed the grey goose by the neck
Throwed a duck across his back
He didn't amind with the quack, quack quack
And the legs all dang-ling down-o, down-o, down-o
Didn't amind with the quack, quack quack
And the legs all dang-ling down-o, down-o, down-o
Didn't amind with the quack, quack quack
And the legs all dang-ling down-o, down-o, down-o
Old mother Flipper Flapper jumped out of bed
Out of the window she cocked her head
Cryin' John, John the grey goose is gone
And the fox is on the town-o, town-o, town-o
John, John the grey goose is gone
And the fox is on the town-o
John, John the grey goose is gone
And the fox is on the town-o
Well, the fox he came to his own den
There were the little ones, eight, nine, ten
Saying Daddy you better go back again
'Cause it must be a mighty fine town-o, town-o, town-o
Saying Daddy you better go back again
'Cause it must be a mighty fine town
Saying Daddy you better go back again
'Cause it must be a mighty fine town
Well, the fox and his wife without any strife
Cut up the goose with a carving knife
They never had such a supper in their life-acapo
Come they told me (pa-rum pum pum pum)
A newborn King to see (pa-rum pum pum pum)
Our finest gifts we bring (pa-rum pum pum pum)
To lay before the King
So to honor Him (pa-rum pum pum pum)
When we come

Little baby (pa-rum pum pum pum)
I am a poor boy too (pa-rum pum pum pum)
I have no gift to bring (pa-rum pum pum pum)
That's fit to give our King
Shall I play for you (pa-rum pum pum pum)
On my drum?

Mary nodded (pa-rum pum pum pum)
The ox and lamb kept time (pa-rum pum pum pum)
I played my drum for Him (pa-rum pum pum pum)
I played my best for Him
Then He smiled at me (pa-rum pum pum pum)
Me and my drum
(Ha ha, ay man, what they call you man?)*

[Chorus:]

And I'm a keep it ghetto
Cause I stick with it just like velcro
Cause I'm mellow 

[x9]
I'm just a mellow fellow

[Verse 1:]
I'm real calm cool and collective
So when I walk in they know what to expect it's
B.o.B. in the session
Stand in and mister all this hate so it effect it
Now that's what I call interesting
I gotta gameplan but they can't intercept it
They can't do nothing but respect it
Because my flow is anorexic, sick, it's infected
(Haha yeah it's B.o.B. man, I'm just a mellow fellow stay real still like jello)

[Chorus:]
Hello I'm just a mellow fellow

What does that mean?
Hah jaknow me and bread go together like hansel and gretel
Well in the ghetto
The cycle is a merry go round so you curse when they cut off your umbilical
I remember when life used to be miserable
But since my 

[? ] changed I've been seeing miracles
(Haha yeah man real talk
Treat life good it treat you good back)

[Chorus: x2]
Hello I'm just a mellow fellow

Cause I stick with it just like velcro
Cause I'm mellow 

[x9]
I'm just a mellow fellow
Ohh. This is just for me. (Laughs)
Kick off my shoes and relax my feet
Hit the kitchen grab a bite to eat
It's been one of those crazy weeks

And I gotta do something special for me
See, hit the salon get a mani and a pedi
Have a massage, get a sip and then I'm ready
Gotta take time out

And my real ladies know what I'm talking about
Sing. Oooooooh, baby baby
You don't know what I've been going through
Sing it again now. Oooooooh, baby baby

It's obvious to see exactly what I need
One of those days
When the sun is shining bright
And my life is going right

And the simple things are not wasted
One of those days
When you're cruising in your car
And you're out to see the stars
And it's warm outside and beautiful
Tonight, it's all about me
Just wanna set my body free
Never mind the TV

Tonight I'll just let a little TV watch me
Light the candles, aroma therapy
Hot tub bubbles surrounding me
Mr. Big is in the background

The Isley Brothers gonna hold it down... sing

I need one of those days
You don't know what...
Warm and beautiful

[Verse 1]
Have hung up the mistletoe, yeah
And outside it looks like snow, yeah
Got some logs to make a fire
Caviar and Cordon Bleu
And the stereo is filled with yuletide carols old and new
The stockings are hung with care
Two together, two together, two together
The presents are here, everywhere
And a box of chocolate cherries
And a magnum of champagne

(As I look into my life)
(Searching for that paradise)

[Verse]
Oh Lord, will you help me find me
Take this crazy, crazy past of mine
And put it all behind me
Look down on the ghetto man
And change his mission
And put it in the hearts of many
To stop confusion
(As I look into my life)
(Searching for that paradise)
We need to moan for love
My sisters, brothers
Let's put these hands together
(As I look into my life)
We need to stop chokin' on the truth
(Searching for that paradise)
And start smokin' on a plan
Man love and respect that woman
And bring her happiness
(As I look into my life)
I'm talkin' to the ghetto
(Searching for that paradise)
For each other we should help
While our babies are dying in the street
We've got to be saying to ourselves
(As I look into my life)
(Searching for that paradise)

[Verse 1]
Girl, I want to be alone with you
Just to see what you can do
Ooh, you're dancing all over me

The way you move, you're teasing, girl
So tonight, I want you in my world

Or have you ever had the sense
That weve been lying just a little?
I mean come on
Its not like weve known ourselves that long

And i can't say i really blame you for being bored with the beginning
Always staring at the score to figure out whos barely winning
But dont you know
There is a reason strong moves slow

And im okay
If youre okay with wasting time
But when you trace
You always see the bottom line

We are tracing
I hope you know
We are tracing
And if you want to know the moment
I knew that i was still alone
I found i never learned your number
I only stored it in my phone
Youd think by now
Id know the shape of calling home
And im okay
If youre okay with wasting time
But when you trace
You always see the bottom line

We are tracing
I hope you know
We are tracing
Were both alone
We are tracing
We are tracing

Did you ever get the feeling
That we started in the middle?
Or have you ever had the sense
That weve been lying just a little?
I mean come on
Its not like weve knew ourselves that long
Spoken:
A tune from Cole Porter perhaps. Now there's a guy who writes for keeps. His tunes not only become hits, they stay hits. Begin the Beguine was written in 1935, and it's still very popular

When they begin the beguine, it brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor, it brings back a memory ever green
I'm with you once more under the stars, and down by the shore an orchestra's playing
Even the palms seem to be swaying, when they begin the beguine
To live it again is past all endeavor, except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever, and promising never, never to part
What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds come along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean
So don't let them begin the beguine, let the love that was once a fire remain an ember;
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember when they begin the beguine
Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, Darling, I love you!
And we suddenly know what heaven we're in, when they begin the beguine
When they begin the beguine

To save you, oh oh

These hands have been longing to touch you baby
And now that you've come around, to seein' it my way

Come here, baby
Let me wrap you around my fingers
I want you so much
And love's just a touch away
So touch me, baby
And you'll feel a man on fire
Just hold on to me
'Cause it's gonna be one of those nights

Oh one of those nights
When love has us right in its hands
Oh here in the dark
What you do to my heart
Woman, your wonder don't end
And it's one of those nights
One of those nights again

Darling, I know
I know this ain't no time for talking
But you know I've just got to tell you
I just have to tell you
How I feel right now
And I wanna say, baby, you're something
And I'm wrapped around your finger
I want you again
'Cause I'm so far into one of those nights
Oh one of those nights
When love has us right in its hands
Oh here in the dark
What you do to my heart
Woman, your wonder don't end
And it's one of those nights
One of those nights again
There are many ways of being in this circle we call life
A wise man seeks an answer, burns his candle through the night
Is a jewel just a pebble that found a way to shine
Is a hero's blood more righteous than a hobo's sip of wine

Did I speak to you one morning on some distant world away
Did you save me from an arrow, did you lay me in a grave
Were we brothers on a journey, did you teach me how to run
Were we broken by the waters, did I lie you in the sun

I dreamed you were a prophet in a meadow
I dreamed I was a mountain in the wind
I dreamed you knelt and touched me with a flower
I awoke with this: a flower in my hand

I know that love is seeing all the infinite in one
In the brotherhood of creatures; who the father, who the son
The vision of your goodness will sustain me through the cold
Take my hand now to remember when you find yourself alone

And the spirit fills the darkness of the heavens
It fills the endless yearning of the soul
It lives within a star too far to dream of
It lives within each part and is the whole
It's the fire and the wings that fly us home
Fly us home, fly us home
Be not so nervous
Be not so frail
Someone watches you
You will not fail
Be not so nervous
Be not so frail
Be not so nervous
Be not so frail
Be not so sorry
For what you've done
You must forget them now
It's done
When you wake up
You'll find that you can run
Be not so sorry
For what you've done
Be not so sorry
For what you've done
Be not so fearful
Be not so pale
Someone watches you
You will not leave the rails
Be not so fearful
Be not so pale
Be not so fearful
Be not so pale
Be not so sorry
For what you've done
You must forget them now
It's done
When you wake up
You'll find that you can run
Be not so sorry
For what you've done
Be not so sorry
For what you've done
(I want to be near you) I want to hear what you have to say
(As long as I'm near you) Nothing will seem to pass away
Long as I'm near you, longing to hear you
Long as I'm near you

(I want to believe you) When you say the things you do
(And so I believe you) You make it all appear so true
Glad that I found you, it's good to be around you
Good to be near you

When it comes to making time
Little girl, you sure made mine
You made my day, you made my way to stay

(I want to be near you) You're my all, you're my everything
(As long as I'm near you) There's a song in my heart to sing
The song of your laughter is all that I'm after
I want to be near you

Love is such a happy song
And when love comes along
It's good to be alive, it's good that you arrived on time
(I want to be near you)
I want to be near you, I want to be near you
(As long as I'm near you)
As long as I'm near you, as long as I'm near you

(I want to believe you)
I want to believe you, I want to believe
(And so I believe you)
And so I believe you, and so I believe you

(I want to believe you)
I want to believe you, I want to believe
(As long as I'm near you)
As long as I'm near you, as long as I'm near you
Somewhere in your heart
Try to save a place for me
Somewhere in your heart
I don't care where it might be

One little corner
May not mean that much to you
But one little corner
Will be enough to see me through

Somewhere in your dreams
Let my lips come close to you
Though they're only dreams
Someday they may all come true

Is it so much to ask
For such a tiny part?
Won't you save a place for me
Somewhere in your heart?
Still got to work that eight hour day
Whether you like that job or not
You'd better keep it on ice
While you're lining up your long shot

Which is to say, hey, hey

Keep your day job, whatever they say
Keep you day job, don't give it away
Keep your day job 'till your night job pays

Steady boys study that eight day hour
Never underrate that paycheck power
By now you know that the face on your dollar
Got a thumb on its nose and a hand on your collar

Which is to say, hey, hey

Keep your day job, whatever they say
Keep you day job, don't give it away
Keep your day job 'till your night job pays
Daddy may drive a V-8 'Vet
Mama may bathe in champagne yet
God bless the child that's got his own stash
Nine to five and a place to crash

Which is to say, hey, hey

Keep your day job, whatever they say
Keep you day job, don't give it away
Keep your day job 'till your night job pays

Keep your day job, whatever they say
Keep you day job, don't give it away
Keep your day job 'till your night job pays

Keep your day job, whatever they say
Keep you day job, don't give it away
Keep your day job 'till your night job pays

[Verse 1: Ronald Isley]
Who's that girl that considers herself a super woman?
And who's that girl thats independent and hard working?
And who's that girl that can cook and got some good lovin'?
And who's that girl that can take a down and out man and turn him into something?

[Chorus: R. Kelly & (Ronald Isley)]

Tell me, who's that man with them 20 inches under that wide body Benz?

Tell me y'all, who's that man that considers himself to be full grown?
And who's that man that claims the world to be his own?
And who's that man with a gentle heart and a pleasant tone?
But when you mess with his money
He's quick to go upside your dome

[Chorus: R. Kelly & (Ronald Isley)]
You're a superstar (You are)
That's what you are (You're a superstar)
Money, clothes and fancy cars (Believe me now)

Just take the key and unlock the door

[Chorus: R. Kelly & (Ronald Isley)]
You're a superstar (You are)

[Outro: Ronald Isley (Over Chorus)]
Shining bright for the world to see
You are a diamond when it's crystal clean
You make the world go around and round
You took music and melody and gave it a soulful sound, ow
(Hold... hold... hold onto your wits!) {sample}

Break down
This is a bust (Hold onto your wits!)
All U sorry motherfuckers up against the wall
If U don't play, bite the dust
Cuz in a couple of simple fuckin' phrases
I'm gonna hip U 2 the fuckin' place of
The brand new mad style, uh
Cuz these are the days of wild - hit me!
(Hold onto your wits!) {x2}

Pop guns and weed? Brother please!
We're 2 wise 4 now, since the other 90's was better suited 4 that biz
Back when Dick was fuckin' Liz
Before soda pop had fizz
Don't blame it on a jockstrap full of jizz
Mentality so insane
I got a Tech-9 2 and it's called my brain
Shoot another brother? Not 2day
Death from envy is the only way
Here I can tear shit up cuz that's my style
And these are the days of wild - hit me! (Hold onto your wits!)
These are the days of wild (Hold onto your wits!)
These are the days of wild
Hooker, bitch and ho, I don't think so
I only knew one and never told her though

But that's the kind of shit that make U check your mind
Is your blood type the type that flows
Or is your blood type the type just stereo?
A woman every day should be thanked
Not disrespected, not raped or spanked
And if a woman ever said I did
Uh, she's a motherfuckin' liar and I'm a set-up kid
And I can tear shit up y'all cuz that's my style
And these are the days of wild - hit me! (Hold onto your wits!)
These are the days of wild (Hold onto your wits!)

Oh oh oh, by the way, I play guitar!

Tennis shoes and caps, now that's phat
Up until the day another wanna laugh behind your back
Sayin' we all look the same, huh
God bless America, home of the brave
I'd rather dress 2 make a woman stare
I'm puttin' on somethin' that another won't dare
It's a freezer burn compared 2 cool
And if U still got loot, then who's the fool?
Everybody wanna take the stand
Mind your own motherfucker, let a man be a man
I can tear shit up y'all cuz that's my style
And these are the days of wild - hit me! (Hold onto your wits!)
These are the days of wild - hit me! (Hold onto your wits!)

Baddest, freezer burnin', head turnin', make a brother yearnin'
Sister walkin' the face

Hit me! {repeat 2 fade}
Asked a girl what she wanted to be

But you can do something in between

Baby you can drive my car
Yes I'm gonna be a star

[Verse 1]
It must be love
Because we are too afraid to say
It must be love
And so we paint everything in gray

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Let's not lose this chance
Hold onto my hands
Let's not waste this time

[Chorus]
'Cause today is a great day for falling in love
'Cause today is a great day for falling in love
Falling in love

[Verse 2]
It must be hard
To know that we'll never be the same
It must be hard
To take this honored leap of faith

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Let's not lose our way
Let's not wait to say
How we feel inside

[Chorus]
'Cause today is a great day for falling in love
'Cause today is a great day for falling in love
Falling in love, falling in love
Falling in love, falling in love, yeah
'Cause today is a great day for falling in love
Falling in love

[Bridge]
When you're falling, falling
Just don't let go
When you're falling, falling
Just don't let go

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Let's not lose this chance
Hold onto my hands
Let's not waste this time

[Chorus]
'Cause today is a great day for falling in love
'Cause today is a great day for falling in love
Falling in love, falling in love
Falling in love, falling in love, yeah
'Cause today is a great day for falling in love
Falling in love
I know you don't love me no more
You're not the kind that would tell me so
Be a woman and talk to me
That's the way I'd rather it be
Feeling sorry for me in your own way
You've got to hurt me by telling me one day
So you get it over baby
Please stop leadin' me on

You're miserable and I'm the cause
Feeling sorry won't help you at all
I hate to see you live this way
So you go on baby, I'll make it someday

Ahh, yes I know you don't love me no more
Yes, you're not the kind that would tell me so
Get it over baby
Please stop leadin' me on

You're miserable and I'm the cause
Feeling sorry won't help you at all
I hate to see you living this way
So you go on baby, I'll make it someday
Yes I know you don't love me no more
You're not the kind that would tell me so
So you go on baby
Please stop leadin' me on
Please stop leadin' me on
Can you hear me baby
Please stop leadin' me on

F... that noise, come on y'all, let's go dance the night away
Let's do it {x2}
(Are U ready?)
Are U ready 4 the ryde dyvine?
Let's do it
Are U ready 4 the ryde dyvine? (Hey)

Are U ready 4 the ryde dyvine?
Then get on up and let it move your mind
What U get is what U think U see
If U're ready come explore your mind and be
Let's do it
Explore your mind and be
Let's do it {fade out}
(Allen Collins -- Gary Rossington -- Ronnie VanZant)

I'd like to tell y'all a story
About a friend of mine
Who liked to drink good whiskey, oh Lord
And have a real good time
His woman, you know she left him
And stole that boy's brand new car
And ran out of town with a guitar picker
Said he gonna be a superstar
Sure you are

(Chorus)
You can't alway trust your woman
You can't always trust your best friend
Beware of the ones that you need y'all
'Cause those might be the ones that do you in

Don't talk no stuff to no slicker
Don't tell your feelings to your friend
Don't tell your woman that you love her, because
That's when your trouble begins
There are many ladies here among us
That'll stab you in the back when you ain't around
There are many, so many of your very best friends
That'll kick you in the head when you are down
Yes they will
(Chorus)
Don't you backtalk the police
'Cause its his job to put you in the jail
They'll lock you up, boy and throw away the key
And your best friend won't even go your bail
There are many slickers here among us
That are all dressed up in suits and ties
But don't you show your pain, Lord in front of them
'Cause if you do you kiss yourself goodbye, alright

(Chorus)

[Intro]
Don't wait for the water
Don't wait for the water

[Verse 1: Wanya Morris]
We don't even talk anymore
And we don't even know what we argue about
Don't even say "I love you" no more
'Cause saying how we feel is no longer allowed

[Pre-Chorus: Nathan Morris]
Some people will work things out
And some just don't know how to change

[Chorus: Boyz II Men]
Let's don't wait 'til the water runs dry
We might watch our whole lives pass us by
Let's don't wait 'til the water runs dry
We'll make the biggest mistake of our lives
Don't do it, baby
Ooh

[Verse 2: Wanya Morris]
Oh, now they can see the tears in our eyes, yeah
But we deny the pain that lies deep in our hearts
Well, maybe that's a pain we can't hide
'Cause everybody knows that we're both torn apart

[Pre-Chorus: Nathan Morris]
Why do we hurt each other?
Why do we push love away?

[Chorus: Boyz II Men]
Let's don't wait 'til the water runs dry
(No, no, baby)
We might watch our whole lives pass us by
(We might watch our whole lives)
Let's don't wait 'til the water runs dry
We'll make the biggest mistake of our lives
Don't do it, baby
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh (Don't wait)
Hey, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh (Don't wait)

[Bridge: Boyz II Men]
Don't do it, baby
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh (Don't wait)
Hey, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh (Don't wait)
Don't do it, baby
Don't wait for the water
Don't wait

[Pre-Chorus: Nathan Morris]
Some people will work things out
And some just don't know how to change

[Chorus: Boyz II Men]
Let's don't wait 'til the water runs dry
(No, no)
We might watch our whole lives pass us by
(Oh, pass us by)
Let's don't wait 'til the water runs dry (Dry)
We'll make the biggest mistake of our lives
Don't do it, baby
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh (Don't wait)
Hey, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh (Don't wait)

[Outro: Boyz II Men, Nathan Morris]
Don't do it, baby
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh (Don't wait for the water)
Hey, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh (Don't wait for the water)
Don't do it, baby

No, no, baby
We might watch our whole lives
(Don't wait for the water)
(Don't wait for the water)
There ain't no time
No time for sorrow
And we ain't got time no time
Ah time to be sad
And maybe the world ain't what it could be
But to understand why is to know reality
Ah don't give in (hang on in there)
Ah I said hang on (hang on in there)

How many times did you hear your mom and daddy?
Say oh child I never had it so good
I wanna say thank you, thank you for the start
Cause deep in my soul, I know you did all that you could
I'm just a part of your dreams this I know
But I'll do what ever possible to make this thing grow
Ah don't give in (hang on in there)
I said hang on (hang on in there)

Ah now say tomorrow you woke up a king
Now tell me just how would you fix everything?
You walk around complaining about how things are
But what have you added to this world so far
Check out your mind, and see what the answer is
And tell me how much did you give
Ah don't give in (hang on in there)
I said hang on (hang on in there)
There are plenty of things still left to live for
A child, a friend, and a wife

They all want to share your life
Ain't that enough to make you want hang on
Hang on, hang on (hang on in there)

The sign said "America love it or leave" well has it really come to that?
And beside, I don't want to and you can't make me love

I've got too many friends, that have she'd their blood
I've got too many relatives here born on this land
So you can't make me leave
I say this is my county and you can't make me leave
You can't make me love the way you treat me
And you can't make me love the way you beat me

Hang on in there, I'm gonna hang on
No matter you do or what you say
Is just wanna let you know you can't drive me away

I'm gonna ay hang
I'm not gonna throw up my hand
I'm not gonna throw up my hand

Any you can't drive me from my home land
If the smog from the cars and so many live we have lost
Still no matter what I'm gonna hang on
Kansas City, Kansas City here I come. Kansas City, Kansas City here I come
Got some pretty little women there, I'm gonna get me one
Standing on the corner, crawl straight in my hand
With my Kansas City Baby, now by the Kansas City world
Well the water in the city, well, taste like Georgia Pie
Going to Kansas City where it tastes like sugar, oh I know it
Kansas City, Kansas City here I come
Got some pretty little women there, I'm gonna get me one
Kansas City, here every night you gave me none
Kansas City, surely looked like they were done
You know they turned it around now Baby, gonna scratch it, gonna run
And rock with my Baby, rock with my Baby, one more time
Rock with my Baby, Kansas City Baby, one more time
Went to the city for, for this souvenir in my hand
Well I might take a plane, might take a train
If I have to walk you won't grind in the same
Oh, Kansas City, Kansas City here I come
Got some crazy little women there, I'm gonna get mo one
I'm coming round and now my vision is so clear
If I could change my state of mind, then I would disappear
The love I get from you is something I can't chance
And I could let you slip away, without a second glance

Why can't I realize I'm fighting for my life?
Woaaaah, Woaaaah!
Why can't I realize I'm fighting for my life?
Woaaaah, Woaaaah!

This is like a flashback
This is like a dream
This is like all the things you can fit inside a memory x2

This is like a flashback
Flashback
This is like a flashback
Flashback

Why can't I realize I'm fighting for my life?
Woaaaah, Woaaaah!
Why can't I realize I'm fighting for my life?
Woaaaah, Woaaaah!
This is like a flashback
This is like a dream
This is like all the things you can fit inside a memory x2
You let me down
All over town
I guess by now I should be gone
Yet here I stand
Still in your hands
Cause you're the best I've ever known

I try and try to say good-bye
I just can't leave your love alone
And after you what will I do
I just can't leave your love alone

I walk away most everyday
Don't need a love that hurts me so
Then every night you get it right
Until I'm moaning soft and low

I try and try to say good-bye
I just can't leave your love alone
And after you what will I do
I just can't leave your love alone

[Intro]
Run, Charlie , run
Look, the niggers are coming
Uh, the niggers is coming?!
Run, Charlie , run
Look, the niggers are coming
The niggers is coming?!

[Verse 1]
I watch you go to church on Sunday
But you forget all you learned on Monday
Well, you see your smiling face can't hide
Well well well, how you hate your brother inside
So I'ma telling you

Run, Charlie, run
Look! The niggers is coming!
(The niggers is coming?!)
Run, Charlie, run
Look! The niggers are coming!
The niggers is coming?!

[Verse 2]
But the greatest wrong you know you've done
Is to pass this sickness onto your son
Your one and only boy
He came into this world with a mind so clean
You took it, molded it, and made it mean
So I'ma telling you

[Chorus]
Run, Charlie, run
Look! The niggers are coming!
The niggers is coming?!
(Don't stop, don't stop now)
Run, Charlie, run
Look! The niggers are coming!
The niggers is coming?!

[Verse 3]
You built this great big beautiful city
But you ran away and left it to die - oh, what a pity
You could have made friends with your neighbors, yeah
But you are much too prejudiced to try; tell me why

[Chorus]
Run, Charlie, run
Look! The niggers are coming!
The niggers is coming?!
Run, Charlie, run
Look! The niggers are coming!
The niggers is coming?!

[Verse 4]
Oh, don't try to leave what's part of you
'Cause it can't be done, yes, that is true
So God bless the hand that's calling you back, brother, well well
Whether it's gonna be red or black, oh

[Chorus]
Run, Charlie, run
Look! The niggers is coming!
The niggers is coming?!
Run, Charlie, run
Look! The niggers are coming!
The niggers is coming?!

[Outro]
Run, Charlie, run
Well, now, you better keep on running, Charlie
Run, Charlie, run
Run on, run on now
Run, Charlie, run
Well well, you better keep on running, well
Run, Charlie, run
Run run run run, try again, y'all
Run, Charlie, run
Hey hey hey, you better keep on running
Run, Charlie, run
I pick up by the handful
The somber heap at my feet
Eyes closed to see the hopeful
Trusting my deepest instinct
I pick up by the handful
The somber heap at my feet
Eyes closed to see the hopeful
Trusting my deepest instinct

But I go on
Dawning light
Task of hope
In a dawn light
Task of hope
These are stars

At last dare to raise my eyes
I saw the ship in the stars
Strong of glittering fleet
Bringing light to the new born
I pick up by the handful
The somber heap at my feet
Eyes closed to see the hopeful
Trusting my deepest instinct
At last dare to raise my eyes (But I go on)
I saw the ship in the stars (Task of hope)
Strong of glittering fleet (Dawning light)
Bringing light to the new born
I-I love the colorful clothes she wears
And the way the sunlight plays upon her hair
I hear the sound of a gentle word
On the wind that lifts her perfume through the air

I'm pickin' up good vibrations
She's giving me excitations (Oom bop bop)
I'm pickin' up good vibrations (Good vibrations, oom bop bop)
She's giving me excitations (Excitations, oom bop bop)
Good, good, good, good vibrations (Oom bop bop)
She's giving me excitations (Excitations, oom bop bop)
Good, good, good, good vibrations (Oom bop bop)
She's giving me excitations (Excitations)

Close my eyes, she's somehow closer now
Softly smile, I know she must be kind
When I look in her eyes
She goes with me to a blossom world

I'm pickin' up good vibrations
She's giving me excitations (Oom bop bop)
I'm pickin' up good vibrations (Good vibrations, oom bop bop)
She's giving me excitations (Excitations, oom bop bop)
Good, good, good, good vibrations (Oom bop bop)
She's giving me excitations (Excitations, oom bop bop)
Good, good, good, good vibrations (Oom bop bop)
She's giving me excitations (Excitations)
(Ahh)
(Ah, my my, what elation)
I don't know where but she sends me there
(Oh, my my, what a sensation)
(Oh, my my, what elation)
(Oh, my my, what)

Gotta keep those lovin' good vibrations a-happenin' with her
Gotta keep those lovin' good vibrations a-happenin' with her
Gotta keep those lovin' good vibrations a-happenin'

(Ahh)

Good, good, good, good vibrations (Oom bop bop)
(I'm pickin' up good vibrations) (Oom bop bop)
She's giving me excitations (Excitations, oom bop bop)
Good, good, good, good vibrations

Na na na na na, na na na
Na na na na na, na na na (Bop bop-bop-bop-bop, bop)
Do do do do do, do do do (Bop bop-bop-bop-bop, bop)
Do do do do do, do do do (Bop bop-bop-bop-bop, bop)
Well, I wait around the train station
Waitin' for that train
Waitin' for the train, yeah
Take me home, yeah
From this lonesome place
Well, now a while lotta people put me down a lotta changes
My girl had called me a disgrace

Dig
The tears burnin'
Tears burnin' me
Tears burnin' me
Way down in my heart
Well, you know it's too bad, little girl
It's too bad
Too bad we have to part (have to part)

Dig
Gonna leave this town, yeah
Gonna leave this town
Gonna make a whole lotta money
Gonna be big, yeah
Gonna be big, yeah
I'm gonna buy this town
I'm gonna buy this town
An' put it all in my shoe
Might even give a piece to you
That's what I'm gonna do
What I'm gonna do
What I'm gonna do
No tears, no fears
Remember there's always tomorrow
So what if we have to part
We'll be together again

Your kiss, your smile
Are memories I'll treasure forever
So try thinkin' with your heart
We'll be together again

Times when I know you'll be lonesome
Times when I know you'll be sad
Don't let temptation surround you
(And) don't let the blues make you bad

Someday, someway
We both have a lifetime before us
For parting is not goodbye
We'll be together again

Times when I know you'll be lonesome
And times when I know you'll be sad
But don't let temptation surround you
Don't let the blues make you bad
Someday, someway
We both have a lifetime before us
For parting is not goodbye
We'll be together again
One, two, one, two, three

Well I travel at the speed unknown to man
So I brang you a message from the mirrors of my hand
I said a message of love don't you hid away
Face the mirrors of your mind
Face the truth today

Well I am what I am thank god
Lord some people just don't understand
Help them god
I said find yourself first
And then your tool
Find yourself first
Just don't be no fool

I see a woman comin'
I see ya layin' on your back
For the birth of pleasure
I see you on the right track
Free is free
You ain't supposed to be
Now don't rely on no man
Try to argue instead
I said find yourself first
And then your talent
Work hard in your mind
Go come alive
And proove to the man
Your as strong as him
In the eyes of god
Everybody come alive
Everybody come alive
Everybody come alive
Everybody love a lot
Everybody love a lot
Everybody love a lot
Everybody love a lot
Moon River wider than a mile
I'm crossing you in style someday
Oh dream maker, you heartbreaker
Wherever you're going I'm going your way
Two drifters off to see the world
There's such a lot of world to see
We're after the same rainbow's end
Waiting round the bend
My huckleberry friend, Moon River
And me
"Um... this song was written by... erm, erm..."
What would you sell?
Loose glasses and suit
Heart and soul
Won't wear out

That's not enough!
I wonder what's inside
Fish fillet knife
Can cut
Right through my eye...

I'm looking for some words
To call my own
Worn-out phrases
And a hand-me-down

They'll knock me
Under where I stand
Sad on his back
In a corned beef pan
Going under
You can feel them pulling me down

To the rust inside...

This is the way...
Franken-star is born

Bits and pieces
Others have worn
All held together by a management glue
Too much glue
Watch the stars turn blue
Turn blue
Turn blue
Turn blue
Turn blue

I'm going under
You can feel them pulling me down
To the halls of rust
Eeh...

I, I, I, I, I...

Thankyou...

Now, when the night begins, whoa, I'm at an end
Because I need your love so bad

And when the lights are low - and it's time to go
That's when I need your love so bad
So why don't you give it up, baby and bring it home to me
Or write it on a piece of paper, woman - so it can be read to me
Tell me that you love me - and stop drivin' me mad
Whoa, because I - I need your love so bad
Need a soft voice - just to talk to me at night
Don't want you to worry, baby
I know we can make everything alright
Listen to my plea, baby, come on bring it to me
'Cause I need - your love so bad
Baby, I need, I need - woman, I need your love so bad

"Make a list and afterwards we'll go to the shop and buy matches and (*buy?) candles and buns." "There's no more paper to write on, Podgy" "No need to worry, Jasper. You keep saying to yourself 'matches' and I'll keep saying 'candles' until we reach the shop. Then we won't need to write it down. We'll remember." "Who'll remember the buns, Podgy?"

(P): (Singing)
Please don't bring your banjo bag,
I know where it's been.
I wasn't hardly gone a day
When it became the scene.
Banjos, banjos all the time,
I can't forget that tune.

It was December 6 Times Square Manhattan
Teddy wasn't ready for what was about to happen
He thought today was goin be a good day
He thought that every man in the world looked at life in a good way
Woke up and took a shower brushed his teeth while he singing
Somebody was talking bout him cause his ears was ringing
Thinking, he finally made it
Doing something that'chu didn't need good grades in
Housekeeping came in say "do you want me to clean your room? " He said "naw"
But as I feel shawty I clean for you but I'm cool
So he went downstairs
Put the white shades on and let down his hair
Cause he was big but he didn't know
People did dig him though when he dress like he did in that E-40 video
Huh, it's time to hit the radio station
It's all he been wanting he been patiently waiting
Yeah, plus he was bugging out
Cause the next day his very first album Rappa Ternt Sanga was coming out
Damn, he was so exuberant
Half fame and didn't know what to do with it
He went and got a fresh fit from Belly Bone
Black T-shirt prokeheads New York fitted on
Ready to get it on
He so crunk and reckless
And Brianna called it said it dumb with the necklace
Now he walking New York gym up
Ready to hit the club later on and go get bin up
Cause at 12 O'clock it's bout to be on
All that first album nervousness he had was about to be gone
And he ain't need a stunna kit
Just his cause cap with the letters NYPD on the front of it
Cause he ain't never seen it, he ain't believe it
He thought he never seen it if it wasn't on TV and shit
Now he finally got a lil bread
Seven dollars out his pocket police hat up on his head
Errbody giving em salty looks now
Errbody try to insult and put him down
But it went in the left and out the right
All he know is nigga we going out tonight
Then the sun goes down and the moon comes up
The blunts go round errbody getting drunk
Ready to hit the club get on stage snatch a mic or two
Three single under my belt
I feel like I can do anything
Let's go and get the chain from Game
I got visions of letting that bitch hang from the stage
Hit the Diamond District, and what a sight
It's a T-Pain chain that'll light up the night
Now I'm happy than a mug the chain big as a bitch
I done finally made the switch from fake to real shit
And I ain't have to work to hard
I got a baby girl but I ain't have to work two jobs
I'm just doing what I believe in and show 'em respect
Now I'm bout to put somebody salary around my neck
But Game told me not to take it out there
The rogues ass niggas a take it out there
But shit niggas I got security
Ain't nobody taking my jewelry
Pause...

[Interlude 1]

[Two of the guys talking as one plans to rob T-Pain]

[Verse 2]
Take two
Walk out the Avianne store with a mean mug
Team tough TP clean up with his brand new ice
Can't tell her nothing like Yeezy
Please believe be easy and yeen ain't gotta ask him twice
Cause you can see how good he feel good as he walked in the spot
Seem like he was the only one that knew he was hot
But he had the biggest chain on so he ain't give a fuck
Just give him a bottle and a muhfuckin' cup
Drink and celebrating his album droppin
Not knowing niggas in the club was plottin
So we kept on shinin, blinding muhfuckas
Letting niggas know that he was high as a muhfucka
Flossin, put his chain up in the air
If a nigga couldn't see it Pain stood up in the chair
Now niggas is getting mad and they want what he got
Shit nigga thinking he ballin he thinking he hot
Like that shit he disrespected my CD son
I'll lay his ass down if he try me I get em done
Errbody shaking his hand wishing him luck
He don't know I'm bout to fuck his ass up
Watch this son check this shit out

[Interlude 2]

[Guy thanks T-Pain for the album release then snatches his chain as crowd screams]

[Outro]

[Two guys talking until song fades]
Invisibly a vagabond
Yeah, just tag along
Not one single care in the world
Not even in to carry on

They said there's a future ahead so
Gonna fly out there and see
Heh, I just smiled and said hello
And sat right next to destiny
I leaned over and asked him,"Would we be okay?"
He said that he wasn't at liberty to say

(Chorus)
Send me an angel, an angel
No sign of the times, instead I'll take it to mean
I'm a stranger, to danger
But I'm scared 'cause I swore
I saw a snake on a plane

"I'm tired of these mothafuckin' snakes on this mothafuckin' plane... I'm tired... I'm tired... I'm tired..."
I don't really have to know
Because I do have to go
You see, I understand that it's all in the plan
Just bask in the afterglow

I lie down terrified
It's not like I've never cried
I hope you know what you're doin'
I'm only human, damn, I've never died...

What can happen might
This could be my night
But actually, I'm havin' the time of my life

Chorus

I feel like a helpless child, As I taste the aisle- It's too bad to be true
Oh, maybe I could help, I'd fly this plane myself- That's the least I can do
As we descend slow, looked out my window, What a wonderful view
Oh, be patient, baby, keep on a-waitin, baby...I'm gonna make it to you

Chorus

"I'm tired of these mothafuckin' snakes on this mothafuckin' plane... I'm tired... I'm tired... I'm tired..." (Send me an
An-an-an...)
"I'm tired of these mothafuckin' snakes on this mothafuckin' plane... I'm tired... I'm tired... I'm tired..."
Chorus x2
In Your Mind
In your mind
One foot on Jacob's ladder and one foot in the fire
And it all goes down in your mind
Livin' at the bottom of the stairs of life
Never a smile knockin' on your door
The air is blue and so are you
Prehistoric monsters on the floor
Last verse of your last song
And God don't hear dead men
The end of the line is in your mind
Then you'll be stayin' in
In your mind
In your mind
Bone for bone and skin for skin
Eye for eye and tooth for tooth
Heart for heart and soul for soul
Somebody said "What is truth"?
Lock it up and close it down
The sound of mournin' like a dove
High beyond the rattlin' roar
Lookin' to the face of love
In your mind
In your mind
It all goes down in your mind
One foot on Jacob's ladder and one foot in the fire
And it all goes down in your mind
In your mind
In your mind
Sunday words are back again
And you eat your fundamentalist pie
But just a piece you understand
You get the rest up in the sky
Praise and glory, wounded angels
Shufflin' 'round the room
Eternity is down the hall
And you sit there bendin' spoons
In your mind In your mind
Father, Son, and Holy Ghost
Sacrificial drops of pain
On a silver plated cross
Sanctification on a chain
Thay say redemption draweth nigh
The storms of silence from above
Stop your ears and close your eyes
And try to find the face of love

In your mind
In your mind
It all goes down in your mind
One foot on Jacob's ladder and one foot in the fire
And it all goes down in your mind
In your mind
In your mind
It all goes down in your mind
One foot on Jacob's ladder and one foot in the fire
And it all goes down in your mind
To love - and be loved
That's what life's - all about
Keeps the stars - coming out
What makes a sad heart sing - the birds take wing

To love - and be loved
That's what living - is for
Makes me want you the more - the more we cling

Let others race - to the moon
Through time and space - to the moon
My goal is greater than this
To reach your lips - to share your kiss

To stay - in your arms
Is the dream - I pursue
To be sheltered - and safe - from the storm
To be cozy - and ever - so warm

And for always - to love
And be loved - by you
Uh uh oh ahhhhhhh radio killa
Taking back my love
Taking back my love
Taking back my love
Taking back my love

You said you changed, but still nothing
You're still the same, I'm just a part time lover

And I'm the blame, should've went away
But yet I stayed, with a part time lover

See, some days you will love me
Then you don't, then you do, then you won't
Then you're here, then you're gone
I'm alone

Now you got me stressing out on the phone
But it's the last time, I'm movin' on
I'm throwing on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins

I left the state, changed everything
No more 818, for the part time lover

What goes around, comes back around
And then you get what you deserve
You part time lover

See, some days you will love me
Then you don't, then you do, then you won't
Then you're here, then you're gone
I'm alone

Now you got me stressing out
On the phone
But it's the last time, I'm movin' on
I'm throwing on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins

Watch these red bottoms, and the back of my jeans
Watch me go, bye baby
Don't know what you got until it's gone

Tail Lights is all you'll see
Watch this Benz exit that driveway

I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (eh hey eh)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (eh hey eh)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (eh hey eh)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (eh hey eh)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (eh hey eh)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (eh hey eh)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (eh hey eh)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (eh hey eh)

Watch me walk it out
Walk it out, walk it out
Walk this right up out the house
Walk it out watch me walk it out
Walk it out walk this right up out the house
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (out the house)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (out the house)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (out the house)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (out the house)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (out the house)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (out the house)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (out the house)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (out the house)
See here's the thing

[Chorus: Patrick Stump]
We have to take our clothes off
(So sexy)
We have to party all night
We have to take our clothes off
To have a good time
Oh no no no

[Verse]
Excuse me miss
I couldn't help but to notice how alone you are
I dig the attitude and how you're actin' like you own the bar
Got me flashing keys and I don't even own a car
Like you ain't feeling my charm, because I know you are
I'm trying to see how your lips feel
Oh I'm sorry, my name is Travie and I'm pretty much a big deal
Oh, you've never heard of me?
Hmm, that sounds absurd to me
The way you stole my attention was flat out burgulary
What do you say let's exit stage left so me and you can
Possibly reconvene and play some naked peekaboo
Cause after all the blouse you're wearing is kinda see through
And it's obvious I'm heading wherever you're leading me too
Such an angel with a devilish angle
I'm quite the certified sweet talker
And you're buying every line of it girl
And I don't really blame you
If I was in your shoes I'd probably do the same too

[Chorus: Patrick Stump]
We have to take our clothes off
(So sexy)
We have to party all night
It's alright
And we have to take our clothes off
To have a good time
Oh no no no

[Verse]
Now here's another bar, I'm coming for the slow gunners
Put your helmets on and take a seat on the short bus
Next stop, right around the corner from your mom and 'em
No turning back so you better buckle up
Shit, don't be concerned with mine
I feel like a Speak and Spell way I got you learning my lines
Fine, pull the string, replay that shit
I change my name to "Did He Really Just Say That Shit?"
Yep
I'll take a mile if you let me
6-5, 200 plus and so sexy
My legs going numb for keeping my phone on vibrate
To hide the fact your girlfriend keeps textin' me
And I've been tryin' to never mind it man
But every time I get a new number, she finds it damn
And you thought you had it sewn up
Until right around amazing o'clock when I showed up

[Chorus: Patrick Stump]
We have to take our clothes off
(So sexy)
We have to party all night
It's alright
And we have to take our clothes off
To have a good time
Oh no no no

Got chicks, all hot chicks
And you rock chicks, datin' hip hop chicks
Slim chicks, round chicks
Black, white, yellow, and brown chicks
Got chicks, all hot chicks
And you rock chicks, datin' hip hop chicks
Slim chicks, round chicks
Black, white, yellow, and brown chicks

[Verse]
Good god girl, you're giving me goosebumps
Standing there in your underwear and new pumps
It's like the more time we waste and less time I get to taste you
Honestly I could easily replace you
It's not a scam girl
That's how I am girl
Peter Pan, I'm a sucker for Smucker's jam girl
It's clear I'm only here for good clean fun
Shut up and kiss me like the antidote's under my tongue
Whoa

[Chorus: Patrick Stump]
We have to take our clothes off
We have to party all night
It's alright
And we have to take our clothes off
To have a good time
Oh no no no
We have to take our clothes off
(So sexy)
We have to party all night
It's alright
And we have to take our clothes off
To have a good time
Oh no no no

Got chicks, all hot chicks
Indie rock chicks, and hip hop chicks
Slim chicks, round chicks
Black, white, yellow, and brown chicks
Got chicks, all hot chicks
Indie rock chicks, and hip hop chicks
Slim chicks, round chicks
Black, white, yellow, and brown chicks
Damn
I cover the waterfront
I'm watching the sea
Will the one I love be coming back to me?

I cover the waterfront
In search of my love
And I'm covered by a starless sky above

Here am I patiently waiting, hoping and longing
Oh, how I yearn!
Where are you?
Are you forgetting?
Do you remember?
And will you return?

I cover the waterfront
I'm watching the sea
For the one I love must soon come back to me

[Verse 1]
When will you learn
I'm never gonna leave you, girl
Please open your eyes and see
You're the only one for me, baby
Of all the things we've been through
It's made my love strong for you
We all need someone to depend on
You can count on me, baby

[Chorus]
My love is true
My love is true
My love is true, ooh
Truly, truly, truly for you

[Verse 2]
Girl, don't you know
We're standing underneath a halo
We've been blessed to have this love affair
I can't let go, go nowhere
Blessing comes in many disguises
I'm so glad I recognize it
You're something special and very rare
What we got, baby, you don't fine anywhere

[Chorus]
My Love is true (Only for you)
My love is true
My Love is true (Oh baby)
Truly, truly, truly for you

[Verse 3]
So girl, take my love
(Take my love)
No matter where your heart may roam
Deep down inside of me baby, yeah
Your love will always have a home
If ever a story should be told
Whatever time may unfold
Let it be said, girl, I always loved you
You can count on me, baby
'Cause my love is true

[Chorus]
My love is true
My love is true
My love is true
You can always count on me, baby
Truly for you
Truly, truly, truly for you
My love is true
My love is true, baby
My love is true, ooh
Only for you
Truly, truly, truly for you
All my love is true
My love is true
Love is forever with you, baby
My love is true, ooh
Oh yeah
Truly, truly, truly for you

[Spoken Outro]
Yes, I know that time bring by a change
But there's one thing that will remain the same
And that's how I truly, truly love you
You're my world, you're my girl, you're my all and all and all
You're my pot of gold
At the end of loves rainbow
And I couldn't dream of coming home
At the end of the day and you not be there
Love
This is my song
This is my song, my serenade to you
The world
Cannot be wrong
If in this world
There is you
I care not what the world may say
Without your love there is no day
So love
This is my song
This is my song, my serenade to you
I care not what the world may say
Without your love there is no day
So love
This is my song
This is my song
My serenade
To you
Well she met him as she promised
Up at Adam's this spring
Expecting some money
Or some other fine thing
No money, no money
To flatter the case
"We'll have to get married
So there'll be no disgrace."
"So jump you up Omie
And away we will ride
To yonder fair country
Where the cool waters glide."
She jumped up behind him
And away they did ride
To yonder fair country
Where the deep waters glide
"Now jump you down Omie
And i'll tell you my mind
My mind is to drown you
And to leave you behind."
She begged and she pleaded
"Oh, don't take my life
And i will deny you
And i'll never be your wife."
There she kicked and he cuffed her
To the worst understand
And he threw her in deep water
That flows through the land
They found her poor body
The following day
The preacher and the reverend
Lord, they all begun to pray
And up spoke her mother
With a voice so a-sting
"Nobody but John Lewis
Could've done such a thing."
They traced him up the waters
To Dutch Charlie's Bend
Where they found him in jail
For killin' a man
"Go hang him, go hang him."
Was that mother's command
"And throw him in deep waters
That flows through the land."

[Intro: Prince and Kim Basinger]

The Snow Goose swept off course by a sea
Storm just reaches the Essex coast. Fritha
Finds her exhausted and wounded on the
Beach and gently cradles her, for she has
Heard that nearby lives a man who is a great
Healer of birds
Ain't she sweet? See her walking down that street
Yes, I ask you very confidentially, ain't she sweet?
Ain't she nice? Look her over once or twice
Yes, I ask you very confidentially, ain't she nice?

Just cast an eye in her direction
Oh me, oh my, ain't that perfection?
Oh, I repeat, well, don't you think that's kinda neat?
Yes, I ask you very confidentially, ain't she sweet?

Ain't she sweet? See her walking down that street
Yes, I ask you very confidentially, ain't she sweet?
Ain't she nice? Look her over once or twice
Yes, I ask you very confidentially, ain't she nice?

Just cast an eye in her direction
Oh me, oh my, ain't that perfection?
Oh, I repeat, well, don't you think that's kinda neat?
Yes, I ask you very confidentially, ain't she sweet?

Ain't she sweet? See her walking down that street
Yes, I ask you very confidentially, ain't she sweet?
Ain't she nice? Look her over once or twice
Yes, I ask you very confidentially, ain't she nice?
Ain't she nice? Look her over once or twice
Yes, I ask you very confidentially, ain't she nice?
Seems like everybody in the whole world
Is down on me
Down on me
Sown on me
Seems like everybody in the whole world
Is down on me

[Intro: Pitbull (Anjuli Stars)]
(Umm... Umm... Umm... Umm...)
Anjuli Stars... Pitbull...
This is dedicated to anybody that's lost somebody important in their life
Don't worry they in a better place now

[Verse 1: Anjuli Stars]
I fear not what the future holds
But more what the future unfolds
Cause I'm dying each time that I breath in life with out you
Every hour is solemn I need you
I'm devoured, I've fallen now what can I do
There is so much to give
If only I had my hands to fix what you did
So I hold it inside
Watch as it dies
I can't even look at the sky
It's burning my eyes
Similar to cigarette smoke
I wish I could float far away from here

[Hook: Anjuli Stars]
Raindrops, I hope one day that this pain stops no, no
Raindrops, I hope one day that this pain stops
Washing me away, Washing me away
Washing me away, Washing me away

[Verse 2: Pitbull]
Still dealing' with the death of my father
Still dealing with the death of my best friend
Eddie I'm a miss you dog
But you know I'm a ride to the end, I love you
I ain't cry when you died
But i'm a let my tears fall on the track
My brother Uly just came home
And it feels good to have him back
Welcome home dog
See everything happens for a reason
You don't know what you have till it's gone
That's why I'm a take advantage of the fact I'm breathing
And the words of this song
Are dedicated to Eddie and Barilla
But I know in the future I'm a see ya
I know you both looking down on me proudly
I know ya'll both love me

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Pitbull]
See in Life things go wrong
If it don't kill it's only gonna make you strong
So you must hold on
If everything was right then there is something wrong
Ironic ain't it, that's just the way life is
That's why I thank God any chance that I get
For blessing me with beautiful kids
What's victory with no loss
What's smiling with no tears
What's love with no hate
What's courage with no fear
Just think about it , and apply it to your life
And no matter what the problem is, don't worry baby
Keep your head up it's gonna be alright

[Hook]

[Intro]
Trade in my life
Oh for you, oh yes, oh yes
Trade in my life for you

[Verse 1]
Sittin' here wonderin' how did things go wrong
Every night asking myself what happened to our happy home
Will I ever see you again, I need to know my friend
Now the past has gone away but tomorrow's on it's way
Though the sun is going down, I need you around
I'm willing to trade in my life

[Chorus]
Trade in my life
Oh for you, oh yes, oh yes
Trade in my life for you
Now I'm sitting here

[Verse 2]
Reminiscing on what we used to share
And how we used to be such a happy pair, oh yeah
I cannot believe we've thrown it all away
Tell me will I see you again someday?
Now the past is gone away
But tomorrow's on its way
Though the sun is going down
And I need you around - trade

[Chorus]
Trade in my life
Oh for you, oh yes, oh yes
Trade in my life for you

[Verse 3]
We both know that we made a vow
Said we'd always be together
That our love would endure, yes
But now you're gone and I'm all alone
But I need you here and I'm willing to trade it

[Chorus]
Trade in my life
Oh for you, oh yes, oh yes
Trade in my life for you
I mean it from the bottom of my heart
Tell me are you with me, are you willing to trade it

[Verse 4]
And I don't even have to think about it twice
Hey, I'll trade it
Somebody help me say I'll trade it
Until you return to me
I'm gonna stay on my hands and knees
And when I see you I'm gonna stand up
And reach my hands out to you, and trade it
Said I love my music and I love my fans
But I've got to step back
Look at this thing like it sure enough is
Tell me do you remember when we used to say
Everything is in their love tell me
What does it profit a man
To gain the world and lose his soul?
I'm gonna trade it to be with you

[Verse 1]
Who took your love away?
Who made you cry that day?
What kind of fool would steal your heart
Then turn and lie?
Well, I know one thing is true
This I can say to you
'Cause I am the one who's here
To take the pain away

[Pre-Chorus]
You gave all you had and a few cents more
He turned his back and he's walking out the door
But that's alright, it's alright, go on and let him go

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm here
I'm here to show you love
Like you've never known
With all my heart, my mind, my body and soul
(My heart, my mind, my body, and my soul)
I'm here to show you love
Here to show you love
That you never knew
Would cause you to want someone
As much as they want you

[Verse 2]
Just let me lay with you
I promise I'll stay with you
'Cause what kind of fool would let
The prize of your love die?
And since he neglected you
Kept on forgetting you
Had your wants, your needs, your desires to fulfill

[Pre-Chorus]
You don't have to feel guilty now
'Cause this is the place and this is how
I'll help you face the fact that you deserve much more

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm here
I'm here to show you love
Like you've never known

Said it's alright, it's alright, it's alright

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm here

('Cause I'm gonna show you love)

[Chorus]
I'm here to show you love

That you never knew
I've got the village I love
I walk along beside the garbagemen and I dig everything
I wave to the policemen, but they don't wave back
They don't dig anything
Ain't had a job for a year or more and I don't know a thing
Everything's spent and I dig everything
Everything's spent and I dig everything
Dig

I feed the lions in Trafalgar Square and I dig everything
I've sit just behind my window, till my cigarettes were low and dug
Everything
Got a backstreet room in the bad part of town and I dig everything
I'd see people in the street below, who don't know where they're going
They don't dig anything
Everything's spent and I dig everything
Everything's spent and I dig everything
Dig

I've got more friends than I've had hot dinners
Some of them were losers, but the rest of them are winners
Rick, John, Sally, a connection named Paul
Holy low on money, their intentions are tall
We smoke and talk in my room and we dig everything
Dig
I've made myself at home
I've made good friends which the time-check girl on the end of the phone
All the movie shows
I sunbathe for love
Even when it's not too hot
'Cause I dig everything
Oh yeah
Our Father, who art in heaven, hollowed be thy name
Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done on earth, as it is in heaven
Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses
As we forgive those who trespass against us
And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil
For yours is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory forever
Amen

(In the original Latin)
Pater noster qui es in coelis, sanctificetur nomen tuum
Adveniat regnum tuum, fiat voluntas tua, sicut in coelo et in terra
Panem nostrum quotidianum da nobis hodie
Et dimitte nobis debita nostra, sicut et nos dimittibus debitoribus nostris
Et ne nos in ducas in tentatiomen, sed libera nos a malo
Amen

[Verse 1: Brian]
Baby, please try to forgive me
Stay here don't put out the glow
Hold me now don't bother
If every minute it makes me weaker
You can save me from the man that I've become, oh yeah

[Chorus: All]
Looking back on the things I've done
I was trying to be someone
I played my part, kept you in the dark
Now let me show you the shape of my heart

[Verse 2: A.J.]
Sadness is beautiful; loneliness that's tragical
So help me I can't win this war, oh no
Touch me now, don't bother
If every second it makes me weaker
You can save me from the man I've become

[Chorus: All]
Looking back on the things I've done
I was trying to be someone
I played my part, kept you in the dark
Now let me show you the shape of my heart

[Bridge: Nick]
I'm here with my confession
Got nothing to hide no more
I don't know where to start
But to show you the shape of my heart

[Chorus: All]
I'm lookin' back on things I've done
I never wanna play the same old part
I'll keep you in the dark
Now let me show you the shape of my heart
Looking back on the things I've done
I was trying to be someone
I played my part, kept you in the dark
Now let me show you the shape of my heart
Looking back on the things I've done
I was trying to be someone
I played my part, kept you in the dark
Now let me show you the shape of

[Outro: A.J.]
Show you the shape of my heart

Cause of fear is fear itself
Check out your own back yard
Before you check out someone else
Railroad tracks in my neighborhood
Ain't no trains around, that boy just ain't no good

Wanna know what's going down
And the pimp on the corner
Looks like the sharpest cat in town

Jungle rule, can't be no fool
Might get caught by the hook or the crook
Hot time for cool (hot time for cool)
Look out Jake what you say
What you carrying brother
I hope you're clean cause the man is mean
Don't have another brother

We all know the answer will come out in time
I might even carry some of your load along with mine
Thank you ma'am, mister please
But I must be Hercules (must be Hercules)
Must be Hercules (must be Hercules)
Like a bird on the wing
I just wanna be free enough to do my thing
I can feel the pressure on every side
If you not gonna help, don't hurt, just pass me by

Hercules (Hercules)
Must be must be Hercules (must be must be Hercules)

Jungle rules, can't be no fool
The devil is on the loose, no cool
Got your feet in the sand
Got to be down with the cats around
And you still gotta face that man

Talk about me if you please
Must be Hercules (must be Hercules)
Must be Hercules (must be Hercules)

Pitching rocks catching stones
Living, How can I survive, what's going on
Beg, steal, borrow
Somehow I've gotta make it 'til tomorrow
Just like Hercules (just like Hercules)

Thank you ma'am, mister please
Must be Hercules (must be Hercules)
Must be Hercules (must be Hercules)
Talk about me
Must be Hercules (must be Hercules)

Gravity
Is working against me
And gravity
Wants to bring me down

I'll never know what makes this man
With all the love that his heart can stand
Dream of ways to throw it all away

Gravity
Is working against me
And gravity
Wants to bring me down

Twice as much ain't twice as good
And can't sustain like one-half could
It's wanting more that's gonna send me to my knees

Gravity
Stay the hell away from me
Gravity
Has taken better men than me
Now how can that be?
Just keep me where the light is
Keep me where the light is

[Intro]
Wooh!
Wooh!
Wooh!
All right!

[Verse 1]
I wanna be your teacher in the team
Get to come in naked, 'cause it's clean
I wanna be your maker with the seam
Just take a shaker, make it mean

[Chorus 1]
I won't get over the damn
'Cause it's just like that old mile
Every four o' clock in the morning
I think I'm gonna die
Check, I'll hold you
I wish it was you

[Verse 2]
Gotta get a cat up a CK, 'cause that's where we're at
Gotta give a car The Beatles 'cause they're just sad

[Chorus 2]
But I won't get over it now
'Cause it's half-drawn on the shout
It could be four o' clock in the morning
If you wish it'd got no style
I gotta shit out like I was never
On the fallest town to be
I could wish this way forever
But I ever gonna be clean

[Bridge]
No, I can't get shot, albeit, no!
I can't get shot, albeit, no!
I can't get shot!
Wooh!

[Verse 3]
Wanna grow to keep it in June
Gonna make it easy for you
Wanna be the carrier in the coal
Just get this on with everything the kids enjoy

[Chorus 3]
But I won't get over it soon
'Cause there ain't light at full noon
'Cause at four o' clock in the morning
I got cheering up to do
If not, you get a real shot
It's just like walls I never drived

[Outro]
But I go: "Wooh!"
I just go: "Wooh!"
We all go: "Wooh!"
Yeah!
We all go: "Wooh!"
All right!
Listen to me people
I ain't got time to think about
Money or what it can buy
And I ain't got time to sit down and wonder
What make the birdies fly

And I don't have time to think about
What makes the flowers grow
Ain't never give it a second thought
To where the rivers flow

And I ain't got time for nothin' else

Now I ain't got time to discuss the weather
And how long it's going to last
And I ain't got time to do no studying
Once I get out of class

I'm telling you I'm just a fellow with a one track mind
And when it comes to thinkin' about
Anything but my baby
I just don't have the time
Oh yeah
And I ain't got time for nothin' else
Don't you know I, I'm thinking about my baby
I ain't got time for nothin' else

Yeah the world could ever match her wealth
She's some kinda wonderful
Got heaven right here on earth

'Cause I'm just a fellow with a one track mind
And when it comes to thinkin about
Anything but my baby
I just don't have the time

I'm too busy thinkin' about my baby
Oh I ain't got time for nothin' else
Too busy thinkin' about my baby
Ain't got time for nothing else

Oh yeah
Oh yeah
I ain't go, I ain't got no time
Celebrate morning
The cry of a loon on a lake in the night
The dreams that are born in the dawn's early light
Celebrate morning

Celebrate living
The laughter that sings in the heart of a child
The freedom that flies at the call of the wild
Celebrate living

Celebrate evening
The stars that appear in the loss of the sun
Whispering winds, "We are one, we are one?...

Celebrate earth Day, every day
Celebrate earth Day, every day
Celebrate land and sea
Celebrate you and me

Celebrate earth Day, every day
Celebrate land and sea
Celebrate you and me
Celebrate earth Day, every day, every day, every day, every day
I'd like to get away, Junior
Somewhere alone with you
It could be oh, so gay, Junior
You need a laugh or two

A certain place I know, Frankie
Where funny people can have fun
That's where the two will go, Darling
Before you can count up
One, two, three. For ...

There's a small hotel
With a wishing well
I wish that we were there together
There's a (no) bridal suite
One room bright and neat
Complete for us to share together

Looking through the window
You can see a distant steeple
Not a sign of people â who wants people?
When the steeple bell says
"Good night, sleep well,"
We'll thank the small hotel together
Pretty window curtains made of chinz
In a make believe land
On the wall are several cheerful prints
Of Grant and Grover Cleveland

Look out into the parlor and feast your eyes
On the moose head on the wall
Perhaps you'd like to play the organ
They tune it every other fall

When the steeple bell says
"Good night, sleep well,"
We'll thank the small hotel
We'll creep into our little shell
And we will thank the small hotel together

[Verse 1: Taio Cruz]
I could dream of ways to see you
I could close my eyes to dream
I could fantasize about you
Tell the world what I believe
But whenever I'm not with you
It's so hard for me to see
I need to see a picture of you
A special picture just for me, yeah

[Chorus: Taio Cruz & Ke$ha]
So take a dirty picture for me
Take a dirty picture
Take a dirty picture for me
Take a dirty picture
Send a dirty picture to me
Send a dirty picture
Send a dirty picture to me
Send a dirty picture
Picture, picture, picture, picture

Snap

Please don't get me wrong, I just wanna see a picture

Take a dirty picture

[Verse 3: Ke$ha]
Whenever you are gone, I just wanna be wit ya
Please don't get me wrong, I just wanna see your picture
Take a dirty picture for me
Take a dirty picture
Take a dirty picture for me
Take a dirty picture

[Pre-Chorus: Taio Cruz with Ke$ha]
I could dream of ways to see you
I could close my eyes to dream
Fantasize about this with you
But the way is never seen, oh

[Chorus: Taio Cruz & Ke$ha]
Take a dirty picture for me
Take a dirty picture
Take a dirty picture for me
Take a dirty picture

Every day there's something new
Honey, to keep me lovin' you
And with every passin' minute
Ah baby, so much joy wrapped up in it

Heaven must have sent you from above
Whoa, heaven must have sent your precious love

And I, I've got a song to sing
Tellin' the world about the joy you bring
And you gave me a reason for livin'
And ooo, you taught me, you taught me the meaning of givin'

Heaven must have sent you from above
Whoa, heaven must have sent your precious love

To find a love like ours is rare these days
'Cause you've shown me happiness, yes, in so many ways
I look in the mirror, and I'm glad to see
Laughter in the eyes where tears used to be
What you've given me I could never return
'Cause there's so much, girl, I have yet to learn
And I wanna show, I wanna show my appreciation
'Cause when I found you, I found a new inspiration

Heaven must have sent you from above
Whoa, heaven must have sent your precious love
Rain comes from the east one night
We watch it come
To hang like beaded curtains
Till the morning sun
Water dripping from our clothes
You with raindrops on your nose
Ask me sadly "Please don't go away now"
Till the rain is done, I say
"I'll stay now"

Rain outside but inside we don't mind at all
Shadows by the fire slowly climb and fall
Kisses fade and leave no trace
Whispers vanish into space
The dawn will send me on a chase to nowhere
Why cry as if I were the first to go there

And I know I shouldn't be here
Yes, I know I should go home
But that eastern rain drones in my brain
And I'm so all alone, so all alone
Morning comes up from the east
We watch it come
And far away now rolls the ancient rain God's drum
You with daybreak in your eyes
Afraid to speak for telling lies
I watch you search for some reply to lend me
But when the rain is done
There's no pretending

And I know I shouldn't be here
Yes, I know I should go home
But that eastern rain drones in my brain
And I'm so all alone, so all alone

[Verse 1: Shawn]
I've been searchin'
For the girl of my dreams (for the girl of my dreams)
The one who'll give all of her love to me (all of her love to me)
You've been there as a friend indeed
Someone that I could depend
Through thick and thin
My strength when I wanted to give in

[Pre-Chorus]
You're special to me
Made it easy when I felt lonely
If I only knew then what I know now
My search would've ended long ago

[Chorus]
I finally know who she is
The girl you've been trying to help me find
And all of this time she's been right here
She's only around me when you are near
And you spend your time with her every day
So you know she's perfect in every way
I've been looking for love, and she's looking at me
If you look in the mirror, you'll see what I see

[Verse 2: Wanya]
Now I'm in a predicament
And I don't know how to explain
To a friend that's been a friend for so so long
Should I tell you how I feel or leave it alone?
Oh oh, it's amazing how intimidating
I never knew that it was you
And after all this time, it never crossed my mind
That in a friend, a love I'd find

[Pre-Chorus]
You're special to me
And I hope that we can be much more
My heart is in your hands
So why don't we give love a chance?

[Chorus]
I finally know who she is
The girl you've been trying to help me find
And all of this time she's been right here
She's only around me when you are near
And you spend your time with her every day
So you know she's perfect in every way
I've been looking for love, and she's looking at me
If you look in the mirror, you'll see what I see

[Bridge]
I'm waiting on a love
A love that stands through anything (anything)
And everything (everything)
With open arms, I (I'm giving you my all)
And every part of me (every part of me)
'Cause I know you're my destiny (know you are my destiny)
You'll see finally (now I see finally)

[Chorus]
I finally know who she is
The girl you've been trying to help me find
And all of this time she's been right here
She's only around me when you are near
And you spend your time with her every day
So you know she's perfect in every way
I've been looking for love, and she's looking at me
If you look in the mirror, you'll see what I see
I finally know who she is
The girl you've been trying to help me find
And all of this time she's been right here
She's only around me when you are near
And you spend your time with her every day
So you know she's perfect in every way
I've been looking for love, and she's looking at me
If you look in the mirror, you'll see what I see

[Ad-Libs]
I finally know
I finally know
And I'm so glad He told me so
I thank you Lord for showing me the one
And now my search is done

[Outro]
And you spend your time with her every day
So you know she's perfect in every way
I've been looking for love, and she's looking at me
If you look in the mirror, you'll see what I see
Melancholy mood forever haunts me
Steals upon me in the night, forever taunts me
Oh, what a lonely soul am I, stranded high and dry
By a melancholy mood

Gone is every joy and inspiration
Tears are all I have to show, no consolation
All I can see is grief and gloom, till the crack of doom
Oh, melancholy mood

Deep in the night I search for a trace
Of a lingering kiss, a warm embrace
But love is a whimsy, as flimsy as lace
And my arms embrace an empty space

Melancholy mood, why must you blind me
Pity me and break the chains, the chains that bind me
Won't you release me, set me free, bring him back to me
Oh, melancholy mood
Tenderly william kissed his wife
Then he opened her head with a butcher knife
And the swan on the river goes gliding by
The swan on the river goes gliding by
Lady margaret's pillow was wet with tears
Nobody's been on it for 20 years
And the swan on the river goes gliding by
The swan on the river goes gliding by
Little billy brown will shake with fright
He's got a new daddy and mommy every night
And the swan on the river goes gliding by
The swan on the river goes gliding by
"i've got a sad surprise" the doctor said
"a 20 pound baby without any head"
And the swan on the river went lookin'.....
You gonna do somethin' to
Who (who), What (what), When (when)
Never that
If they got a problem
Tell em call me we can settle that
Matter of fact
You ain't gotta them em
I'll tell em that (I'll tell em)
And if these niggas sigh we gon slide down where they mother at
Ak-47 with the double strap
How your shit stay at the funeral
Bring my rubber back
Chicks are fuckin' with the wrong one
Yea I gotta show
Tell em but I got a long gun
Call the mac the chicken wing cause it got it's own drum
I know these niggas sick of me
'Cause I done had a long run
Countin' all this money
Fuckin' all these hoes
They was lookin' at me funny
When I pulled up in that rose
Ya'll good for talkim' on Twitter (twitter)
We good for sparkin' on niggas (sparkin')
Broad day
Walk up on a niggas head and homicide
You gonna put the chopper on a nigga

[Chorus]
Hey, you gon do somethin to
Who, what, when
You say you want it with
Who, what, when
Them shots come in with
Who, what, when
You were sayin that to
Who, what, then, fuck nigga
You'd better get that fuck shit off your mind
'Cause I'm a up that strap
You crossed the line
Cut these apples out you niggas startin spreadin the new
When I choose shit on a corpse
Hide head with the two

Where you can find me
You can find me
At the top of the list
And if they ever let me in I ain't stoppin for shit
See that motivation make you say I'm cocky as shit
Watever, fuck it tell em suck and help part of my dick
Now a day, play, I coulda possibly get em, get paid
Get out the Maybach and go hop in the jet
Know they hatin on the rise and the chilled I spin
In the Phantom, I'm lookin fly in whatever I'm in
Mostly you big niggas soft like the Michelin man
When you see other niggas standin with a pencil in hand
Carry me on stage rappin with my dick in my hand
Tryna distiguish the difference between a bitch and a fan
Outa bed, rolled one homie, never again
Cause I sold dough once now I sell it again
Fur weed 500, I sell it again
Tell the mice mane win let the elfs keep sayin

[Chorus]
Hide head with the two

I'm ballin half around, half a jet, nigga pound for pound
Only time we showin up, the shut this motha fucker down
Ridin round in the Kia, no spare tires
Chopper round shots fired
Nigga flatlines zip came to it and keep the powder savoral
Drive bys on dirt bike with Meek Milli O
Crow rock shells
I bleach em and watch em fade away
And leave a nigga block
Wetter than a rainy day
West beat Beavis when you scared to leave the crib
Guzzi and he inspired for some of the dolla mill
I'm worth mills and I beat a niggas ass still
Ya'll niggas get wasted I ain't talkin spilled bills
School a hunt knox I'm a hate a cheetah
One ya a dick sucka get your head up with the nina
And YM still strapped snookin with the cleava
Ya best bet: to run the other way when I see ya

[Chorus]
Give me that old time religion
Give me that old time religion
Give me that old time religion
It is good enough for me

It was good for my old mother
It was good for my old mother
It was good for my old mother
And it's good enough for me

It was good for the hebrew children
It was good for the hebrew children
It was good for the hebrew children
And it's good enough for me

It was good for Paul and Silas
It was good for Paul and Silas
It was good for Paul and Silas
And it's good enough for me

Give me that old time religion
Give me that old time religion
Give me that old time religion
It is good enough for me
It was good for my old father
It was good for my old father
It was good for my old father
And it's good enough for me

Give me that old time religion
Give me that old time religion
Give me that old time religion
It is good enough for me

It was good for the hebrew children
It was good for the hebrew children
It was good for the hebrew children
And it's good enough for me

I want that old time religion
I want that old time religion
I want that old time religion
It is good enough for me

Yea niggas, Welcome to Dade County
Where we slang rocks that claim blocks
And those red and blue lights just keep our streets hot
C'mon and ride with a nigga so I can show you what Dade County really got
See don't be fooled by South Beach
Thinking when you come to the Bottom you can just run these streets
You and your jewels are like a menu
And trust me nigga we intend to eat
F**k around and cross that I-395
You just run into a bunch of dead end streets
Niggas with wifebeaters and bare feet
That's right, I'm talking straight goon style
Go beyond that about 3 miles and you're now entering the infamous Lil Havana
Now I know yall studio gangsters be vibing off the movie "Scarface"
But the wrong move in this place, you'll f**k around and meet the real Tony Montana
So f**k them palm trees
I got shit for you to really see
Like there's a graveyard with bury sub with niggas buried 4 generations deep
And I ain't even talking about sister lined next to brother
I'm talking granddaddy to grandmother piled up on top of each other
And all that rap about you're Lil Haiti connections?
Nigga you don't even know a real zo
But I can introduce you to one that'll kick in your door
Put you faced down on the floor
And have your whole family wiring money from Chicago
But you a star, though
Okay, nigga if you a real G
This is where you tell your car to go
Opa Locka
Where there is continuous spotlight helicopters and a triangle full of choppers
Carol City will make holes in you so big, they can't be plugged by doctors
Nigga, this is the real Dade County
Where we are soldiers from birth to the hurst
That's why my childhood consisted of a bulletproof vest and a pyrex
Nigga, you haven't even seen the real Miami, yet
So Welcome to Miami-Dade County, the real Miami
Where we live and die, for life
I was in a tunnel
And couldn't see the light
And whenever I'd look up
I couldn't see the sky
Sometimes when I'm standin'
It seems like I done walked for miles
And my heart could be cryin'
Dead in the middle of a smile
But then I climbed the hills
And saw the mountains
I hollered help 'cause I was lost
Then I felt the strong wind
Heard a small voice sayin'
The storm is over
(The storm is over now)
And I can see the sunshine
(Somewhere beyond the clouds)
I feel Heaven, yeah
(Heaven is over me)
Come on and set me free, whoa
Now in the midst of my battle
All hope was gone
Downtown in a rushed crowd
And felt all alone
And every now and then
I felt like I would lose my mind
I've been racin' for years
And still no finish line, oh
But then I climbed the hills
And saw the mountains (Mountains)
I hollered help 'cause I was lost
Then I felt the strong wind
And then a small voice sayin'
The storm is over
(The storm is over now)
And I can see the sunshine
(Somewhere beyond the clouds)
I can feel Heaven, yeah
(Heaven is over me)
Come on and set me free
Somehow my beginning stepped right in (Right in)
Then faith became my friend (My friend)
And now I can depend
On the voices of the wind
When it's sayin' (Sayin')
The storm is over
(The storm is over now)
And I can see the sunshine
(Somewhere beyond the clouds)
I can feel Heaven, yeah
(Heaven is over me)
Won't you come and set me free
Won't you set me free
The storm is over
(The storm is over now)
And I can see the sunshine
(Somewhere beyond the clouds)
I can feel Heaven, yeah
(Heaven is over me)
Won't you come and set me free

I'm goin' down to New Orleans, baby, behind the rising sun
Goin' down to New Orleans, baby, behind the rising sun
Lord, I've just found out, my trouble has just begun

Oh, went to see a gypsy woman, have my fortune told
Went to see that gypsy woman, have my fortune told, have my fortune told
She said: "You're a good boy, Bobby. Man, you just got a bad luck soul."

I got a 32 special built on a cross of wood
I got a 32 special built on a cross of wood
I got a 38-20 well, it's twice as good

I'm goin' down to New Orleans, mama, with my hat in my hand
Goin' down to New Orleans, mama, with my hat in my hand
Now, I hate to leave you, but you just don't understand

I'm goin' down to New Orleans, baby, behind the rising sun
Goin' down to New Orleans, baby, behind the rising sun
Lord, I've just found out, my trouble has just begun
It starts with just a little glance now
Right away you're thinkin' 'bout romance now
You know you ought to take it slower
But you just can't wait to get to know her

A brand new love affair is such a beautiful thing
But if you're not careful think about the pain it can bring

It makes you feel so bad
It makes your heart feel sad
It makes your days go wrong
It makes your nights so long

You've got to keep in mind love is here today
And it's gone tomorrow
It's here and gone so fast

Right now you think that she's perfection
This time is really an exception
Well you know I hate to be a downer
But I'm the guy she left before you found her
Well I'm not saying you won't have a good love with her
But I keep on remembering things like they were

She made me feel so bad
She made my heart feel sad
She made my days go wrong
And made my nights so long

You've got to keep in mind love is here today
And it's gone tomorrow
It's here and gone so fast

Keep in mind love is here today
And it's gone tomorrow
It's here and gone so fast

Love is here today
And it's gone tomorrow
It's here and gone so fast

[Intro]
Y'all niggas ready? Are y'all ready?
Stop! Drop! Shut 'em down, open up shop!
Oh, no! That's how Ruff Ryders roll!
Stop! Drop! Shut 'em down, open up shop!
Oh, no! That's how Ruff Ryders roll!
Stop! Drop! Shut 'em down, open up shop! (What? What? What?)

Stop! Drop! (What? What?) Shut 'em down, open up shop! (Uh-huh!)
Oh, no! That's how Ruff Ryders roll!

[Verse 1]
Niggas wanna lie, niggas wanna try
Then niggas wonder why, niggas wanna die
All I know is pain, all I feel is rain
How can I maintain, with mad shit on my brain
I resort to violence, my niggas move in silence
Like you don't know what are style is
New York niggas the wildest!
My niggas is wit' it; you want it? Come and get it
Took it, then we split it
You fuckin' right we did it!
What the fuck you gonna do, when we run up on you
Fuckin' wit' the wrong crew
I'ma have ta show niggas how easily we blow niggas
When you find out there's some more niggas, that's runnin' with your niggas
Nothin' we can't handle, break it up and dismantle, light it up like a candle
Just cause I can't stand you
Put my shit on tapes, like you bussin' grapes
Think you holdin' weight?
Sing that shit!

[Hook]
Stop! Drop! Shut 'em down, open up shop! (What? What? What?)
Oh, no! That's how Ruff Ryders roll! (I can't hear you!)
Stop! Drop! Shut 'em down, open up shop!
Oh, no! That's how Ruff Ryders roll!

[Verse 2]
Man, Is ya'll niggas crazy?
I'll bust you and be Swazy
Stop actin' like a baby
Mind your business, lady!
Nosy people get it too, when you see me spit at you
You know I'm trying to get rid of you
Ya I know it's pitiful
That's how niggas get down
Watch why niggas spit round
Make ya'll niggas kiss ground, just for talkin' shit clown
Oh you think it's funny? Then you don't know me money
It's about to get ugly, fuck it dog, I'm hungry!
I guess you know what that mean, come up off that green
Five niggas or a fiend, don't make it a murder scene
Give a dog a bone, leave a dog alone
Let a dog roam and he'll find his way home
Home of the brave, my home is a cage
And yo I'ma slave til' my home is a grave
I'ma pull paper, it's all about the papers
Bitches caught the vapors, then how they wanna rape us

[Hook]
Stop! Drop! (What? What?) Shut 'em down, open up shop! (Uh-huh!)
Oh, no! That's how Ruff Ryders roll!  (What? What? I can't hear you!)
Stop! Drop! (What?) Shut 'em down, open up shop! (Uh-huh!)
Oh, no! That's how Ruff Ryders roll!

[Outro]
Where my dogs at?

[Verse 1]
It's the darkest hour, you're twenty-two
The voice of youth, the hour of dread
The darkest hour and your voice is new
Love is lost, lost is love

[Verse 2]
Your country's new, your friends are new
Your house and even your eyes are new
Your maid is new and your accent too
But your fear is as old as the world

[Verse 3]
Say hello to the lunatic men
Tell them your secrets, they're like the grave
Oh, what have you done?
Oh, what have you done?
Love is lost, lost is love

[Verse 4]
You know so much, it's making you cry
You refuse to talk but you think like mad
You've cut out your soul
And the face of thought
Oh, what have you done?
Oh, what have you done?

[Chorus]
Say goodbye to the thrills of life
When love was good, when love was bad
Wave goodbye to the life without pain
Say hello, you're a beautiful girl

[Verse 3]
Say hello to the lunatic men (Say hello, hello)
Tell them your secrets, they're like the grave (Tell them all you know)
Oh, what have you done?
Oh, what have you done?
Love is lost, lost is love (what have you done, the grave)

[Verse 4]
You know so much, it's making you cry (You know, you know)
You refuse to talk but you think like mad (You know, you know)
You've cut out your soul (You know, you know)
And the face of thought
Oh, what have you done?
Oh, what have you done?

[Refrain]
Oh, what have you done?
Oh, what have you done?

What have you done?

[Outro]
(Say hello, hello)
(Tell them all you know)
(Say good-bye to the grave)
(Love is lost)
(You know, you know)
(You know, you know)
(You know, you know)
(You know, you know)
(What have you done?)
Oh, what have you done?
(What have you done?)
(What have you done?)
(What have you done?)
(What have you done?)
There's no guy in France, for in France there's no romance
Since Marie has left Paree
Every ship that sails took the cargo full of mail
'Cause Marie has left Paree
No amour, no more like they used to have before
There's no Marie, she moved to gay Napoli
Say bon voyage, I got to go
Where's my corsage? Where's my chapeau?
Bye bye Paree, I'm off to Napoli

[musical interlude]

There's no Marie, she flew off to Napoli
Say bon voyage, I got to go
Where's my corsage? Where's my chapeau?
Bye bye, 'cause Marie has left Paree
Bye bye Paree, I'm jumping off to Napoli
The storms of life will blow
They're sure to come and go
They meet me at a time when I'm calm and doing fine
But the captain of my soul, he's always on board
He rocks me in his arms
While riding through the storm

While riding through the storm
Jesus holds me in his arms
I am not afraid of the stormy winds and the rains
Though clouds become high
He holds me while I ride
I found safety in his arms
While riding through the storm

I have no fear of the raging sea
Knowing Jesus is there with me
He can speak to the winds and the waves
And make them behave
All power's in his hand
On sea or dry land
I found safety in the master's arms
While riding through the storm
While I'm riding through the storm
Jesus holds me in his arms
No, I'm not afraid of the stormy winds and the rains
Though the tide becomes high
He holds me while I ride
I found safety in the master's arms
While riding through the storm

While riding through the storm?
While riding through the storm?
Yeah, while I'm riding through the storm
Jesus holds me in arms while I'm riding through the storm
Let the winds blow, I don't care, I'm riding through the storm
Let the rains fall down, I'm riding through the storm with Jesus
Jesus is the captain of my soul, yes, yeyeyes
He is the captain of my soul?
The dream I'm building is Early American
Something that won't go out of style
It makes you feel that life's worth living
The way they must have felt that first Thanksgiving
You sure get sold on this Early American
After you've looked around a while
So I'm building a dream for someone who
Like Early Americans do
The dream I'm building is Early American
Something that won't go out of style
It makes you feel that life's worth living
The way they must have felt that first Thanksgiving
You sure get sold on this Early American
After you've looked around a while
So I'm building a dream for someone who
Like Early Americans do
I am your trash man-
Throw out all your trash today-
Clean out your mind today-
Please pass the weed
And please take some heed
Take your fast glass guns and
Throw them away
There he goes, hey
I just the gypsy bandit

Gypsy talk-
She has been here 3 times and
The 4th time, she was emptied in from
The mouth of a bottle
Seems like I seen you somewhere before-
And her dog named pig had a red
Neck shaped just like a cracker
Dipped in rot hole

Address 3rd trash can from the
Left. that's where I'll be-
Just take all your blues
And throw them at my feet
-oh that's what friends are for
Yes I sing the blues for me and you
Let me do changes and come back
And tell you. so it won't be so hard
When it's time for you to go through
Anything is possible after an
Embarrassing situation-

And once you take but all that
Rubbish and hate and-
Load it on my truck
But don't make me work late-
I am your trashman-
And don't forget I also want

To live- not just survive-
I ain't your black slave- just
Because I just might try to
Wash out your mind- it's up to
Your friend-
To get up off your rusty behind

And please pass me the peace weed
And take some heed-
Throw all that mixed up speed
Away- all that dirt is gonna clog and
Hurt- man you reach 100 years old in a day-
I am your trashman-
I am your trashman-
I come to keep your houses clean
I am the trashman-
Take out all your dirty blues and
Dreams-
Well when I come around to
Collect for the bill
That's when I come around for
My pleasure kill...
I am the trashman
You must have seen me in
Your t.v
I'm here to clean up-
All your hang ups or
Come downs, I'm gonna kill...
That's my duty
So please don't try to make
Me crawl up no hill

May I whisper in your ear...
Say something you ought to hear...
Lots of people so dear
They're getting hurt...
If I were not upon the stage
If I were not upon the stage

"hey! hey! no! no! hey! no! hey! no! no! that's...that's not the one I meant, no! no! no, we don't want that one! what I meant to say, what I meant to say..."
Me and my uncle went a ridin' down
From Colorado West Texas bound
We stopped over in Santa Fe
The part of being about half way
Besides it was the hottest part of the day

We led our ponies into a stall
Went to a bar, boys, bought drinks for all
Two days in the saddle, my body hurt
And being summer, took off my shirt
And tried to wash off some of that dusty dirt

West Texas cowboys all over town
With gold and silver, their loaded down
Just in for round up, you know it seemed a shame
And so my uncle starts a friendly game
It's "Hi-lo Jack", the winner takes the game

From the beginning my uncle started to win
Them Texas cowboys they was mad as sin
Some said he's cheatin', ah, but that can't be
Because my uncle, well, he's as honest as me
I'm about as honest as a Denver man can be
One of them cowboys, you know he started to draw
I grabbed a bottle, slapped him on the jaw
I had to shoot another now he won't grow old
In the confusion my uncle grabbed the gold
We hightailed it down to Mexico

God bless cowboys, god bless gold
God bless my uncle, God rest his soul
He taught me well, boys, he taught me all I know
Taught me so well that I grabbed the gold
Left him lying there by the side of the road
Sing songs of the sunrise into the night
The stars as your timepiece, make it all right
Make friends with the darkness, talk to the moon
And when the light lifts, you can let out a tune

I've been to the mountains, climbed through the sky
Shouldered their whiteness, watched their gold fly
Shared in their treasures, shook at their might
Spoke softly of wonders, Cowboy's Delight

Sing songs of the sunrise into the night
A song of the mountain, Cowboy's Delight
The stars as your timepiece will make it all right
Sing songs of the mountains, Cowboy's Delight
Never let me go
Love me much too much
If you let me go
Life would lose its touch
What would I be without you
There's no place for me without you

Never let me go
I'd be so lost if you went away
There'd be a thousand hours in the day
Without you I know

Because of one caress
My world was overturned
At the very start
All my bridges burned
By my flaming heart
You'd never leave me would you
You couldn't hurt me could you

Never let me go.. never let me go
Because of one caress
My world was overturned
At the very start
All my bridges burned
By my flaming heart
You'd never leave me would you
You couldn't hurt me could you

Never let me go.. never let me go
Now comes the morning
Wet with the kiss of evening
Shadows fade sulking away
Sunshine for dreaming
Beckon magic to believe in
Spectrums and rainbows and days
I never saw a sky so free
Never so blue
Morning with mystic pagaentry
Unveils a time for sharing love with you

Come to the sunshine
Share in the quiet of knowing
No need for telling you sometimes
When all the answers are
So plainly showing

Teach me to tell you
All the feelings I've been learning
Tell me to teach you my heart
New words are crazy
Old love words keep returning
All words seem wrong from the start
So I will tell with my eyes
Say it with a kiss
Silence that asks and looks so wise
And needs no answer on a day like this
Come to the sunshine
Share in the quiet of knowing
No need for telling you sometimes
When all the answers are
So plainly showing

[Verse 1]
I know that your heart has been so heavy lately
Trying to find peace of mind
Thinkin' 'bout him all the time
You've got to clear those guilty feelings lady
Gave him everything you had
That's no cause for feeling bad

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl I know you
You're too strong to
Let a man who don't understand
Turn it around on you
So don't take
All the weight
You can still be who you want to be
If you have it in your heart

[Chorus]
Know what you want
Don't let him break your heart
Don't let him trick you into
Thinking that it's all your fault
'Cause you've got a right, baby
To want to love
Who will be anything and everything
Anytime you want

[Verse 2]
I understand your frustrations lady
You've been there far too long
For him to ever to treat you wrong
Now you've gotta learn to live for you lady
Let your mind be inspiration now
'Cause your heart alone won't do

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl I know you
You're too strong to
Let a man who don't understand
Turn it around on you
So don't take
All the weight
You can still be who you want to be
If you have it in your heart

[Chorus]
Know what you want
Don't let him break your heart
Don't let him trick you into
Thinking that it's all your fault
'Cause you've got a right, baby
To want to love
Who will be anything and everything
Anytime you want

[Bridge]
Baby it's no how and no way
I'll never make your heart break
Never let you go astray
Girl you deserve the very best
That love has to give
I won't put up a fight
I'll do everything right
As long as I live
I'll give all I can give

[Chorus]
Know what you want
Don't let him break your heart
Don't let him trick you into
Thinking that it's all your fault
'Cause you've got a right, baby
To want to love
Who will be anything and everything
Anytime you want
Know what you want
Don't let him break your heart
Don't let him trick you into
Thinking that it's all your fault
'Cause you've got a right, baby
To want to love
Who will be anything and everything
Anytime you want

[Outro]
Hold on tight and be strong babe
Cause I know you can make it
Hurry sundown, let the weary day be over
I'm so tired of hurt, I've been taken
My heart has been aching so
Don't mind struggling, don't mind livin' a little

If someday my kids are laughing together
And have things I never own
I can feel many changes are coming

Beat them drums in a distance, a drumming
Telling the world a new future has begun
Yes, you got to hurry sundown
I can't wait to see the morning

There's a lot of work I must lend a hand to
So bring on that brand new day
Afraid tomorrow is on it's way
So hurry down, hurry down sweet sun
Well when I, when I was just a little baby boy
Every night I would call, your number brought me joy
I called your house, every night since then
But I ain't never, no no never heard you calling me
Come on and call me back again... Call me back again
I've heard your name every night since then
But I ain't never, no no never....
Well when I, when I was just a little baby boy
Every night, every night I would call because your
Number brought me joy
Oh - I've called your name every night since then
But I ain't never......... Etc
Days into weeks
Weeks into months
Months into years I'm blue
I'm cracking up over you

I can't survive
I need you here by my side
Every word I say is true
I'm cracking up over you

When I can see you again
Don't know just when that will be
But baby, just look
Can't you see what you're doin' to me?

Why do you torture me?
Never give me a smile
That brings tears from my eyes
I'm cracking up over you

My heart suffers, suffers pain
Nothin' seems to be the same
But with you baby, I'll suffer again
I'm cracking up over you
I meant to fight it to the finish but you made me forget
And though it's possible I'm dreaming, don't wake me yet
You know I love you, I can't see the day for night

You know I twist around and turn around and then I give in
You end up in control of me it's really a sin
I don't know what you're doing to me
But I know it's a crime

And baby I can't last another night
And every moment is eternity
And from the depth of my soul
Can't let another day go by

I follow my heart right up to the end
As far as the eye can see
I'm faithful and true and livin' up to
Your sacred trust in me
I'll never give out to somebody else
I know where my arms should be
I'm faithful and true and makin' it through
Your sacred trust in me
Your sacred trust in me
You take me and you break me and you do what you please
I stumble and I tremble and I'm weak at the knees
The vision that lies before me is not reality

I tell you I can't wait another night
For every secret that your soul reveals
And you and I may get to know
That it's real, that it's real

I follow my heart that leads me to you
And all that my love should be
(You know I'm talkin' to you)
And you can be sure I'm doin' it for
Your sacred trust in me
I'll never give out to somebody else
(Callin' me)
There's nowhere my heart should be
(You know I'm callin' to you)
I'm faithful and true and livin' up to
Your sacred trust in me
(Your scared trust)
Your sacred trust in me

I follow my heart right up to the end
As far as the eye can see
I'm faithful and true and livin' up to
Your sacred trust in me
I'll never give out to somebody else
I know where my arms should be
I'm faithful and true and makin' it through
Your sacred trust in me
Your sacred trust
I follow my heart that leads me to you
(Follow me)
(Oh yeah)
And all that my love should be
(You know I'm callin' to you)
And you can be sure I'm doin' it for
Your sacred trust in me
(Hey when)
I'll never give out to somebody else
(Callin' me)
There's nowhere my heart should be
(You know I'm callin' to you)
I'm faithful and true and livin' up to
(Oh yeah)
Your sacred trust in me
Your sacred trust

[Verse 1]
The feeling then gets to the brain
It means you got it coming and you ain't got a chain
Their only attire is a typical vice
But if it gets you well, well you ain't being nice, no
No!

[Verse 2]
So follow the lives till they cut up your eyes
You won't be even seeing if you ain't growing lies
Then bought all the shit that should never be sold
They put a gun above it and a narrow behold

[Chorus]
We are the happy landfill
We are the happy landfill
Alright!

[Verse 1]
The feeling then gets to the brain
It means you got it coming and you ain't got a chain
Their only attire is a typical vice
But if it gets you well, well you ain't being nice, no
No!

[Verse 2]
So follow the lives till they cut up your eyes
You won't be even seeing if you ain't growing lies
Then bought all the shit (we are happy landfill) that should never be sold
(We are happy landfill) they put a gun above it and a narrow behold
Alright!
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Let your heart be light from now on
Our troubles will be out of sight

Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Make the Yuletide gay
From now on our troubles will be miles away

Here we are as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore, faithful friends
Who are dear to us gather near to us once more

Through the years
We all will be together if the fates allow
Hang a shining star upon the highest bough
And have yourself a merry little Christmas now
What's 'morals' after all?
A set of rules from above
Moral panic calls for more censorship
While annihilating 'le perdure sens critique
Critique', moral panic calls for more censorship

What's 'morals' after all?
A set of rules from above
Morals which don't even tackle the real issues
Morals which seek intervention and control
Morals which don't even address the real problems

What's 'morals' after all?
A set of rules from above
Morals which don't even tackle the real issues
Morals which don't even address the real problems
Morals that just seek control over our lives

[Chorus]
Girl, let's fall in love, think it over, girl
Come a little closer, girl
Hey, let's fall in love, think it over, girl
Come a little closer, girl

[Verse 1]
All of my life
I've wondered when love would be
I like to spend my time
In your company, you and me

[Chorus]
Let's fall in love, think it over, girl
Come a little closer, girl
Hey, let's fall in love, think it over, girl
Come a little closer, girl

[Verse 2]
Everybody needs someone to love
Darling, it's you I've been dreamin' of
And I wanna be the one you love
The story's been told for me
By the stars above, stars above

[Chorus]
Fall in love, think it over, girl
Come a little closer, girl
Fall in love, think it over, girl
Come closer, girl

[Bridge]
Whenever you're near
Good feelings come over me, over me, baby
Now that I found your love
Life is so complete, so complete

[Chorus]
Girl, let's fall in love, think it over, girl
Come a little closer, girl
Hey, let's fall in love, think it over
Get a little closer, girl

[Verse 2 repeated]
Everybody needs someone to love
Darling, it's you I've been dreamin' of
And I wanna be the one you love
The story's been told to me
By the stars above, stars above

[Chorus]
Fall in love, think it over, girl
Come a little closer, girl
Fall in love, think it over, girl
Come a little closer, girl
Fall in love

But long as there are stars above you

God only knows what I'd be without you

If you should ever leave me
Though life would still go on believe me
The world could show nothing to me
So what good would living do me

God only knows what I'd be without you

If you should ever leave me
Though life would still go on believe me
The world could show nothing to me

Those far away places with strange-soundin' names
Far away over the sea
Those far away places with the strange-soundin' names
Are callin', callin' me

Goin' to China or maybe Siam
I want to see for myself
Those far away places I've been readin' about
In a book that I took from the shelf

I start gettin' restless whenever I hear
The whistle of a train
I pray for the day I can get underway
And look for those castles in Spain

They called me a dreamer, well maybe I am
But I know that I'm longin' to see
Those far away places with the strange-soundin' names
Callin', callin' me
Callin', callin' me

[Verse 1]
I feel like I'm losing my mind
Love is so hard to find
You led me on to believe you belong to me, oh
I'm going through difficult times
I always thought you were mine
Love doesn't feel like this
This is my final wish

[Pre-Chorus]
The next time your truck rolls by
No matter how hard I cry
Please don't stop in front of me
Cause your love's no longer sweet
The next time I bring you change
Baby, please pull back your hand
You know you're not what I need
Let me go, let me do Bey

[Chorus]
You've got me
Chasing after you like an ice cream truck
I try my luck and catch up but
It's always out of love
(And my heart just melts)
You've got me
Chasing after you like an ice cream truck
I try my luck and catch up but
It's always out of love
(And my heart just melts)

[Verse 2]
The faster and faster I ran
You sped up and then
Just as I thought I've caught up
I'm chasing you again, finally
You stopped and I jumped on
I realized the flavor was wrong
You thought I was still holdin' on
You looked and I was gone

[Pre-Chorus]
The next time your truck rolls by
No matter how hard I cry
Please don't stop in front of me
Cause your love's no longer sweet
The next time I bring you change
Baby, please pull back your hand
You know you're not what I need
Let me go, let me do Bey

[Chorus]
You've got me
Chasing after you like an ice cream truck
I try my luck and catch up but
It's always out of love
(And my heart just melts)
You've got me
Chasing after you like an ice cream truck
I try my luck and catch up but
It's always out of love
(And my heart just melts)

[Break]
You've got me
Chasin' you
I try my luck
I can't catch up
'Cause you got me
Chasin' you
My heart's melting
It's like ice cream
You've got me
Chasin' you
I try my luck
I can't catch up
'Cause you got me
Chasin' you
My heart's melting
It's like ice cream

[Bridge]
I've been chasin' after you
Now it's time to let you go
Yes, I try time and time again
You don't love me, it's got to end
I tried so hard, damn near lost my mind
'Cause real love is hard to find
Now my heart can't take no more
Now I know, boy you ain't mine

[Chorus]
You've got me
Chasing after you like an ice cream truck
I try my luck and catch up but
It's always out of love
(And my heart just melts)
You've got me
Chasing after you like an ice cream truck
I try my luck and catch up but
It's always out of love
(And my heart just melts)

[Chorus]
You've got me
Chasing after you like an ice cream truck
I try my luck and catch up but
It's always out of love
(And my heart just melts)
You've got me
Chasing after you like an ice cream truck
I try my luck and catch up but
It's always out of love
(And my heart just melts)

Bring the Bally Mena to the dock
And paint the Bally Mena black
Bring the Bally Mena to the dock
And paint the Bally Mena black

Brothers we were and brothers we'll be
I till the soil and you sail the sea
To the ship Bally Mena you gave your best
But a raging sea laid your soul to rest

Bally Mena, Bally Mena, Bally Mena in the harbor
Bring the Bally Mena to the dock
And paint the Bally Mena black

No more to hear, to hear the tale
Of how you tamed a mighty whale
And the girl who waited so patiently
Will walk no more by the sea
Bally Mena, Bally Mena, Bally Mena in the harbor
Bally Mena, Bally Mena, Bally Mena in the harbor
Bring the Bally Mena to the dock
And paint the Bally Mena black
Bring the Bally Mena to the dock
And paint the Bally Mena black

(Baby loves that way)
Yes, she does, yes, she does
(Baby loves that way)
Oh, I love my baby
(Baby loves that way)
Ooh, I gotta take her
(Baby loves that way)
Yep, I love her

[Verse 1]
Baby likes to go outside, so I let her
Wants to fool with other guys, so I let her
Wants to be bad, so I let her be bad
But fooling around, it will make me sad
She fools around with other boys and treat me like an unwanted toy

[Chorus]
(Baby loves that way)
Oh, I love my baby
(Baby loves that way)
Ooh, she does too much to me
(Baby loves that way)
And I can't think too much of her
(Baby loves that way)
Gotta take her, gotta take her

[Verse 2]
Gonna better leave her alone, put you down son
Treating her real fine, thus I'm home being a loner
Jeanny's my babe and that's alright, yeah
She treats me good, each and every night
She fools around with other boys and treat me like an unwanted toy

[Chorus]
(Baby loves that way)
I love my baby
(Baby loves that way)
Ooh, she's too much
(Baby loves that way)
Yes she does, yes she does
(Baby loves that way)

[Chorus]
(Baby loves that way)
I love my baby
(Baby loves that way)
Yeah, she's too much, yeah yeah
(Baby loves that way)
Ooh, I think she can live with me
(Baby loves that way)
Love her, love her, love her

[Verse 3]
Baby likes to go outside, so I let her
Wants to fool with other guys, so I let her
Wants to be bad, so I let her be bad
But fooling around, it will make me sad
She clings around with all the boys, who treat her like unwanted toys

[Outro]
(Baby loves that way)
Obviously this is the end
(Baby loves that way)
Gotta take her
(Baby loves that way)
Ooh yeah
(Baby loves that way)
Can't do enough
(Baby loves that way)
Lullaby and good night, with roses bestride
With lilies bedecked. 'neath Baby's sweet bed
May thou sleep, may thou rest, may thy slumber be blest
May thou sleep, may thou rest, may thy slumber be blest

Lullaby and good night, thy mother's delight
Bright angels around, my darling, shall guard
They will guide thee from harm, thou art safe in my arms
They will guide thee from harm, thou art safe in my arms

(and these are the original words of Brahms in German)

Guten Abend, gut' nacht! Mit Rosen bedacht
Mit NÃ¢â¬Å¾glein besteckt schlÃ¤Â¹Â¸f unter die Deck'!
Morgen FrÃ¤Â¹Â­, wenn Got will, wirst du wieder geweckt
Morgen FrÃ¤Â¹Â­, wenn Got will, wirst du wieder geweckt

Guten Abend, gut' nacht! Von Englein bewacht
Die zeigen in Traum, dir Christkindlein's baum
Schlaf' num selig und suss, schau' in Traum's Paradies
Schlaf' num selig und suss, schau' in Traum's Paradies
(without poetic embellishments, this is the direct translationof Brahms)

Good evening, good night, covered with roses
With tiny fingernails hidden, slipping under the blankets
Tomorrow morning, if God wills, you will wake again
Tomorrow morning, if God wills, you will wake again

God evening, good night, watched over by tiny angels
Who show the little Christ Child's tree in dreams
Sleep now, blessed and sweet, look at dream's paradise
Sleep now, blessed and sweet, look at dream's paradise
Oh baby
Babe, you know I go for you
Oh baby
Babe, you know I go for you
Aw, not because you dress so fine
Babe, but the little things you do

Oh, you're my all-day steady
Babe, you're my midnight dream
Oh, you're my all-day steady
Babe, you're my midnight dream
Oh, and without you, baby
Life ain't no good to me
Is there anyone who
Ever remembers changing their mind from
The paint on a sign?
Is there anyone who really recalls
Ever breaking rank at all
For something someone yelled real loud one time

Everyone believes
In how they think it ought to be
Everyone believes
And they're not going easily

Belief is a beautiful armor
But makes for the heaviest sword
Like punching under water
You never can hit who you're trying for

Some need the exhibition
And some have to know they tried
It's the chemical weapon
For the war that's raging on inside
Everyone believes
From emptiness to everything
Everyone believes
And no one's going quietly

We're never gonna win the world
We're never gonna stop the war
We're never gonna beat this
If belief is what we're fighting for

What puts a hundred thousand children in the sand?
Belief can
Belief can
What puts the folded flag inside his mother's hand?
Belief can
Belief can
I rolled into the smoke and there I lost my hope
I need someone to know me and to show me
The square peg fits the hole
Why haven't I been told?
I need someone to know me and to show me
Trafalgar, trafalgar, trafalgar, please don't let me down

Ten hundred people roam through the place I call me home

I need someone to know me and to show me
Sitting cross-legged on my own and yet I'm not alone
Don't need no one to show me
No one owns me
Trafalgar, trafalgar, trafalgar
Trafalgar, trafalgar, trafalgar, please don't let me down

Trafalgar

[Verse]
Do you recall?
I told you
This was just a matter of time
Do you recall?
I told you
We would end up saying goodbye
And it won't be long
Before you try to shoot me out of the sky
Do you recall?
I told you
This was just a matter of...

[Verse 1]
Here I lay, so close to you
Knowing that you'll see me through
Another night when we'll feel the joy
The joy that makes me smile more and more

[Chorus]
And every day I dream
Of holding you close to me
And every night I find
Me touching your lips with mine
Naahh oh, oh babe

[Verse 2]
It seems that time moves much too fast
Love is here and love will last
Your body's warm and sure to please
Lady of love, take all of me

[Chorus]
Every day I dream
Of holding you close to me
Every night I find
Me touching your lips with mine
No, ooh, oh

[Break]

[Chorus]
Every day I dream
Of holding you close to me
Every night I find
Me touching your lips with mine
Aaaah oh ooooh aaaah

[Verse 3]
And through the night, the touch of love will be
Forever strong and forever sweet
And giving in to passion's flow
Creates a world we want to grow

[Outro]
Every day I dream
Of holding you close to me
Every night I find
Me touching your lips with mine
Every day-hey-hey
Oh, every night
Every day-hey-hey
Whoa-oh, every, every night
Every day-hey-hey
No, oh, every, every night
Every day I dream, oh, I dream
No, oh, each and every night
You're moving me, soothing me, girl
Loving, touching, feeling, oh oh
And I'm feeling good
Oh, feels good
(Allen Collins - Ronnie VanZant)

I said baby mama, I don't know your name
But I said baby, sugar I can play your game
Every night when we leave the hall
I see you hanging around
You wanna ride in my big black car baby
Wanna go uptown

(Chorus)
I know who you are baby
I know what they call you girl
Never put you down baby
I'm just like you baby, I'm on the hunt

I know lady
People gonna talk about you and me
Let me say one thing mama, sugar I do as I please
And if you wanna love me baby, I'm your man
And all those high-falutin' society people
I don't care if they don't undertand
(Chorus)
My daddy told me a long time ago
Said there's two things son
Two things you should know
And in these two things you must take pride
That's a horse and woman, yeah
Well both of them you ride

[Verse 1]
The story hit the news from coast to coast
They said you beat the girl you loved the most
Your charitable acts seemed out of place
With the beauty with your fist marks on her face

[Chorus 1]
Your buddies all stood by
They bet their fortunes and their fame
That she was out of line
You were not to blame

[Verse 2]
Six hundred thousand doctors are putting on rubber gloves
And they're poking at the miseries made of love
They say they're learning how to spot the battered wives
Among all the women they see bleeding through their lives

[Chorus 2]
I bleed for your perversity
These red words that make a stain on your white-washed claim
That she was out of line
And you were not to blame

[Verse 3]
I heard your baby say when he was only three
"Daddy, let's get some girls, one for you and one for me"
His mother had the frailty you despise
And the looks you love to drive to suicide

[Chorus 3]
Not one wet eye around
Her lonely little grave
Said, he was out of line, girl
You were not to blame

[Verse 1]
Curiosity was far greater than our fear
It felt so simple and so prodigious at the same time

[Chorus]
Incredible things are happening in the world
Magical things are happening in this world

[Verse 2]
Across the river there are all kinds of magical instruments
While really we keep on living like monkeys

[Chorus]
Incredible things are happening in the world
Magical things are happening in this world, yeah
High school party, senior year
Boys and girls are all sippin' on beer
I like soda, where's the soda? Am I the only fucking person here that likes soda?

I see her from across the crowd
I said the party is bumpin' and the music is loud
You're really drunk and you're lookin' sad... It's like a date rape ad

Girl, then we start to dance and
Girl, baby this is romance
Girl, I'm startin' to grow down below
Shit, why did I wear sweat pants?

Girl, you're body's like what conjunction junction
That's a fine ass, butt (but)
I'm like a cashew in a lollipop
Just keep suckin' till you get to the nut

And I said let's rob an Asian kitchen
Or stroll down the block
Either way girl, we're takin' a wok (..Nothing?)
You're gonna love me the way my uncle did
Except you're not gonna go to court for doin' it
Be a guillotine or my girl instead
Either way you're givin' me head
I'm gonna love you, baby the right way
Shorty with a body lookin' hotty when I say girl
When I say girl

We go into the bedroom exchanging nervous laughter
Why's it called dry humping, if I always need a towel after?
You spread your naked legs and I see that wound that never healed
Even though you're yellin' for me, I can tell your lips are sealed
We're both aware of my erection, you ask if I have protection

I say:
"Well no, I tried to buy them once
I was in the convenience store
My old babysitter walked in
I had to hide them near the Tic-Tac's
I was so embarrassed, I peed myself a little bit"

Girl, girl

Insert a euphemism
A sexy mental prism
Increase my pelvic rhythm
Fill you with my syllogism
I know your body and I know how to please you
Don't thank me, thank Wikipedia
Guys don't go down, well I am-
What the fuck is that? I should have brought my diagram
Ooh... Did you feel that? That was an educated guess
Ooh... Did you feel that? Uh, that one was a sneeze, my bad

High school party, senior year
None of that happened 'cause I wasn't invited..
Following the path as it leads towards
The darkness in the North
Weary strangers' faces show their sympathy
They've seen that hope before

But if you want to stay for a little bit
Rest your aching limbs for a little bit
Before you, the night is beckoning
And you know you can't delay
You hear the night birds calling you
But you can't catch the words they say
Close your ears and eyes, be on your way

Mist is swirling, creatures crawling
Hear the roar get louder in your ears
You know, the folly was your own
But the force behind can't conquer all your fears

And if you want to stay for a little bit
Rest your aching limbs for a little bit
Before you, the night is beckoning
And you know you can't delay
You hear the night birds calling you
But you can't catch the words they say
Close your ears and eyes, be on your way
Pull your thoughts back many years
To the time when there was life with every morning
Perhaps a day will come
When the light will be as clear as on that morning

And if you want to stay for a little bit
Rest your aching limbs for a little bit
Before you, the night is beckoning
And you know you can't delay
You hear the night birds calling you
But you can't catch the words they say
Close your ears and eyes, be on your way

[Verse 1: Travie McCoy]
If the time is near
Then fine, I've been waitin' patiently for years
Fought lines in my mind
I'm more unstable than I fear
And I don't know, just take my hand
It's time to go
So just enjoy your blue moon, it'll be over soon
So we might as well have some fun
Right?

[Chorus: Travie McCoy]
It's getting critical
Takes a minute for it to set in
I'm unpredictable
And I'm dyin' just tryin' to feel alive again

[Verse 2: Travie McCoy]
If the time is near
Don't cry, look me in the eyes and dry your tears
Have a seat right here
While Los Angeles disappears
And I don't know, just take my hand
It's time to go
So just enjoy your blue moon, if we're gonna die soon
Then we might as well have some fun
Right?

[Chorus: Travie McCoy]
It's getting critical
Takes a minute for it to set in
I'm unpredictable
And I'm dyin' just tryin' to feel alive again
It's getting critical
Takes a minute for it to set in
I'm unpredictable
And I'm dyin' just tryin' to feel alive again

[Bridge: Tim William]
The clouds surround us, the light leaves us alone
And the sky falls in your hand
Embrace the moment 'cause now we're headin' home
It couldn't be a sweeter end

[Chorus: Travie McCoy]
It's getting critical
Takes a minute for it to set in
I'm unpredictable
And I'm dyin' just tryin' to feel alive again

[Outro: Tim Williams & (Travie McCoy)]
The clouds surround us, the light leaves us alone
(It's getting critical)
And the sky falls in your hand
(Takes a minute for it to set in)
Embrace the moment 'cause now we're headin' home
(I'm unpredictable)
It couldn't be a sweeter end
(And I'm dyin' just tryin' to feel alive again)
City sidewalks, busy sidewalks
Dressed in holiday style
In the air there's a feeling of Christmas
Children laughing, people passing
Meeting smile after smile
And on every street corner you hear

Silver bells silver bells
It's Christmas time in the city
Ring a ling, hear them ring
Soon it will be Christmas day
Hayley Williams
Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now
Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now

B.o.B
Yeah
I could use a dream or a genie or a wish
To go back to a place much simpler than this
'Cause after all the partyin' and smashin' and crashin'
And all the glitz and the glam and the fashion

And all the pandemonium and all the madness
There comes a time where you fade to the blackness
And when you're staring at that phone in your lap
And you hoping but them people never call you back

But that's just how the story unfolds
You get another hand soon after you fold
And when your plans unravel
And they sayin' "What would you wish for?"
If you had one chance
So airplane, airplane
Sorry I'm late
I'm on my way so don't close that gate
If I don't make that then I'll switch my flight
And I'll be right back at it by the end of the night

Hayley Williams
Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now
Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now

B.o.B
Yeah, yeah
Somebody take me back to the days
Before this was a job, before I got paid
Before it ever mattered what I had in my bank

Yeah back when I was tryin' to get a tip at Subway
And back when I was rappin' for the hell of it
But nowadays we rappin' to stay relevant
I'm guessing that if we can make some wishes outta airplanes

Then maybe yo maybe I'll go back to the days
Before the politics that we call the rap game
And back when ain't nobody listened to my mixtape
And back before I tried to cover up my slang
But this is for Decatur, what's up Bobby Ray?
So can I get a wish to end the politics
And get back to the music that started this shit?
So here I stand and then again I say
I'm hopin' we can make some wishes outta airplanes

Hayley Williams
Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now
Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now

B.o.B
I could really use a wish right now
I-I-I could really use a wish right now
Like, like, like shooting stars
I-I-I could really use a wish right now
A wish, a wish right now, right now
There's something special about it
Just what, I can't quite say
But there's no doubt that it's different
From any other day
There are no words to exactly describe
What I'm speakin' of
It's just a sweet Sunday kinda love

We'll read the funnies together
And watch some T.V. too
You can do something for me
And I'll do the same for you
We'll fill the hours with things
That we both most like to do
Spending a sweet Sunday lovin' you

Why don't we unplug the phone?
Let's pretend nobody's home, quietly
Just you and me, oh how nice that will be

All through the week I'll look back upon that
Sweet Sunday time
While looking forward to that special happiness
We'll find
When we awaken to hear from a songbird up above
Sounds of a sweet Sunday kinda love

[Verse 1]
Well if you ever plan to motor west
Just take my way, that's the highway, that's the best
Get your kicks on Route 66

[Verse 2]
Well it winds from Chicago to L.A
More than two thousand miles all the way
Get your kicks on Route 66

[Chorus]
Well it goes through St. Louie, Joplin Missouri
Oklahoma City, the toots look pretty
You'll see Amarillo and Gallup, New Mexico
Flagstaff, Arizona, Tulsa and Winona
Kingman, Barstow, San Bernardino

[Verse 3]
Would you get hip to this kindly tip
And take that California trip?
Get your kicks on Route 66

[Chorus]
Well it goes through St. Louie, Joplin, Missouri
Oklahoma City, looks so so pretty
You'll see Amarillo and Gallup, New Mexico
Flagstaff, Arizona, Tulsa and Winona
Kingman, Barstow, San Bernardino

[Outro]
Would you get hip to this kindly tip
And go take that California trip?
Get your kicks on Route 66
Get your kicks on Route 66
Get your kicks on Route 66
Get your kicks on Route 66
I give her all my love
That's all I do
And if you saw my love
You'd love her, too
I love her

She gives me everything
And tenderly
The kiss my lover brings
She brings to me
And I love her

A love like ours
Could never die
As long as I
Have you near me

Bright are the stars that shine
Dark is the sky
I know this love of mine
Will never die
And I love her
Bright are the stars that shine
Dark is the sky
I know this love of mine
Will never die
And I love her

[Verse 1]
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Let your heart be light
Next year all our troubles
Will be out of sight

[Verse 2]
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Make the Yuletide gay
Next year all our troubles
Will be miles away

[Bridge]
Once again, as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Will be near to us once more

[Verse 3]
Someday soon we all will be together
If the fates allow
Until then we'll have to muddle through somehow
So have yourself a merry little Christmas now

[Verse 1]
Quietly while you were asleep
The moon and I were talking
I asked that she'd always keep you protected
She promised you her light
That you so gracefully carry
You bring your light and shine like morning

[Verse 2]
And then the wind pulls the clouds across the moon
Your light fills the darkest room
And I can see the miracle
That keeps us from falling

[Verse 3]
She promised all the sweetest gifts
That only the heaven's could bestow
You bring your light and shine like morning

[Verse 4]
And as you so gracefully give
Her light as long as you live
I'll always remember this moment
The beauty of this creature could only be equaled by
The extent of its paradox only be equaled by
Because it wanted two things, opposite and conflicting
It wanted the light, it wanted everything in sight
Wanted to dominate or at least to participate
But only in comforts of its chair and its slippers

The curiosity of the extra-ordinary creature
Was indeed limited because it could not suffer
The unknown in any shape or form
At the same time of wanting to look everywhere
Set up at the top of its tower
The creature reveled in being a spectator
Through the glass, what a glorious view
Relishing the gift of so much transparence

Relishing the gift of so much transparence
Having had absolutely no influence
It starts with just a little glance now
Right away you're thinkin' 'bout romance now
You know you ought to take it slower
But you just can't wait to get to know her
A brand new love affair is such a beautiful thing
But if you're not careful think about the pain it can bring
It makes you feel so bad
It makes your heart feel sad
It makes your days go wrong
It makes your nights so long
You've got to keep in mind love is here today
And it's gone tomorrow
It's here and gone so fast
Right now you think that she's perfection
This time is really an exception
Well you know I hate to be a downer
But I'm the guy she left before you found her
Well I'm not saying you won't have a good love with her
But I keep on remembering things like they were
She made me feel so bad
She made my heart feel sad
She made my days go wrong
And made my nights so long
You've got to keep in mind love is here today
And it's gone tomorrow
It's here and gone so fast
Keep in mind love is here today
And it's gone tomorrow
It's here and gone so fast
Love is here today
And it's gone tomorrow
It's here and gone so fast
It was early one Monday mornin'
And I was on my way to school
It was early one Monday mornin'
When I was on my way to school
That was the mornin'
When I broke my mother's rule
I've been in love with you, baby
Before I learned to call your name
I've been in love with you, baby
Before I learned to call your name
Now you're in love with someone else
I know that's gonna drive me insane

Oh, baby, you sure look good to me
Oh, baby, you sure look good to me
Please tell me, pretty mama
Who can your great new lover be?
Lost and alone on some forgotten highway
Travelled by many remembered by few
Lookin' for something that I can believe in
Lookin' for something that I'd like to do with my life

There's nothin' behind me and nothin' that ties me
To somethin' that might have been true yesterday
Tomorrow is open and right now it seems to be more
Than enough to just be here today

And I don't know what the future is holdin' in store
I don't know where I'm goin', I'm not sure where I've been
There's a spirit that guides me, a light that shines for me
My life is worth the livin', I don't need to see the end

Sweet, sweet surrender
Live, live without care
Like a fish in the water
Like a bird in the air

Sweet, sweet surrender
Live, live without care
Like a fish in the water
Like a bird in the air
Lost and alone on some forgotten highway
Travelled by many remembered by few
Lookin' for something that I can believe in
Lookin' for something that I'd like to do with my life

There's nothin' behind me and nothin' that ties me
To somethin' that might have been true yesterday
Tomorrow is open and right now it seems to be more
Than enough to just be here today

And I don't know what the future is holdin' in store
I don't know where I'm goin', I'm not sure where I've been
There's a spirit that guides me, a light that shines for me
My life is worth the livin', I don't need to see the end

Sweet, sweet surrender
Live, live without care
Like a fish in the water
Like a bird in the air

Sweet, sweet surrender
Live, live without care
Like a fish in the water
Like a bird in the air

Sweet, sweet surrender
Live, live without care
Like a fish in the water
Like a bird in the air
Sweet, sweet surrender
Live, live without care
Like a fish in the water
Like a bird in the air

[Verse 1]
I'm standing in the shadows with an aching heart
I'm looking at the world tear itself apart
Minutes turned to hours, hours turned to days
I'm still loving you in a million ways

[Verse 2]
Well the devil's in the alley, there's a mule kicking in my stall
Say anything you wanna, I have heard it all
I was raised in the country, I've been working in town
I've been in trouble ever since I set my suitcase down

[Verse 3]
Well I ain't got nothing for you, I had nothing before
Don't even have anything for myself anymore
The sky is full of fire, pain is pouring down
There's nothing you can sell me, I'll see you around

[Verse 4]
Well I got here following the Southern star
I crossed that river just to be where you are
There's only one thing I did wrong
Stayed in Mississippi a day too long

[Verse 5]
Well I've been loving you too long, I know you ain't no good
Don't make a bit of difference to me, don't see why it should
I was thinking about the things that Rosie said
I was dreaming I was sleeping in Rosie's bed

[Verse 6]
Well I'm walking through the leaves falling from the trees
I feel like a stranger nobody sees
So many things we never will undo
I know you're sorry, I'm sorry too

[Verse 7]
Some people will offer their hand and some won't
Last night I knew ya, tonight I don't
I need something strong to distract my mind
I'm gonna look at you 'til my eyes go blind

[Verse 8]
Well everybody's moving, God knows where
But I'm still here, you're still there
Only one thing I did wrong
Stayed in Mississippi a day too long

[Verse 9]
Well my ship's been split to splinters and it's sinking fast
I'm drowning in the poison, got no future, got no past
But my heart is not weary, it's light and it's free
I got nothing but affection for those who have sailed with me

[Verse 10]
Winter goes into the summer, summer goes into fall
I look into the mirror, don't see anything at all
Stick with me, baby, stick with me anyhow
Things should start to get interesting right about now

[Verse 11]
My clothes are wet, tight on my skin
Not as tight as the corner that I've painted myself in
I know good fortune is waiting to be kind
So give me your hand and say you'll be mine

[Verse 12]
The emptiness is endless, cold as the clay
You can always come back, but you can't come back all the way
Only one thing that I did wrong
Stayed in Mississippi a day too long
Sunrise doesn't last all morning
A cloudburst doesn't last all day
Seems my love is up and has left you with no warning
It's not always going to be this grey

All things must pass
All things must pass away

Sunset doesn't last all evening
A mind can blow those clouds away
After all this, my love is up and must be leaving
It's not always going to be this grey

All things must pass
All things must pass away
All things must pass
None of life's strings can last
So, I must be on my way
And face another day

Now the darkness only stays the night-time
In the morning it will fade away
Daylight is good at arriving at the right time
It's not always going to be this grey
All things must pass
All things must pass away
All things must pass
All things must pass away
My baby's gone and left me - crying by myself
My baby's gone and left me - crying by myself
I loved another woman - I lost my best gal

She was a real good woman - she didn't me no harm
She was a real good woman - she wouldn't do me no harm
But I loved another woman - now she's up and she's gone

Well, come back baby - I know I treated you wrong
Well, come back baby - I know I treated you wrong
I loved another woman - now, I won't do that no more
Day by Day
Im falling more in love with you
And day by day
My love seems to grow
There isn't any end to my devotion
It's deeper, dear, by far
Than any ocean
I find that day by day
You're making all my dreams come true
So come what may
I want you to know
I'm yours alone
And I'm in love to this day
As we go through the years
Day by day

Im yours alone
And Im in love to this day
As we go through the years
Day by Day

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
It's nothin' fresher, they under pressure
Take your bitch and undress her
Go 'head and kill yourself
Fuck niggas, they'll be one less
More weed, less stress
Make a grocery store runs, in some old bathing ape sweats
Separate the bookies from vets
Out in the Bay, where they blowing cookies
Shout to Mr. Fabs
The revolution will be televised and I'll be hella high
The same jealous niggas will be jealous
Clip they wings, smash their propellers
Can't add to it, can't take from us
She at my spot fixing plates
That's why I fucks with her
I got a crib in every state
Tommy Buns living nigga get cake
Fuck is wrong with your posture little nigga? sit straight
No other choice, but to keep it real
These niggas soo fake
You can still smear the paint, ew

[Hook: Sayitaintone]
I got your bitch on my arm
Got the team on my back
Got the world on my lap
Got that P on my hat
Niggas sleeping on me and I like it like that
I done made a couple bands I did that while you napped
Still the same nigga
Shit ain't changed still wake and bake
Still got your bitch with us
Still Pac, ay still hit the dealer
Paint no limit to this shit like P. Miller

[Verse 2: Curren$y]
Mission never changed, stay all after the same
Jet life Taylor Gang rectify the game
From the 4, the big dog came rollin' joints with his paws, wearing pinky rings
Since he swang through things ain't been the same
Kinda close though, copping cats on my coats, yo
Can't duplicate the dope flow though they're tried
That shit too stepped on nigga, to get the people high
It's that strobe light, that 1975, Cadillac dash
Baby girl doing soul train lines
Never hate it, though I flow out my mind
Pockets breaded like they finna be deep fried
Out his head, dis a 100 times
Suckas still sleep on me, layin' in the lot, fool, let 'em be
Probably dead dead in that bed, let 'em rest in peace
Smoke another P, kill some more beats

[Hook: Sayitaintone]
It's getting better all the time

I used to get mad at my school
The teachers who taught me weren't cool
You're holding me down, turning me round
Filling me up with your rules

I've got to admit it's getting better
A little better all the time
I have to admit it's getting better
It's getting better since you've been mine

Me used to be a angry young man
Me hiding me head in the sand
You gave me the word
I finally heard
I'm doing the best that I can

I've got to admit it's getting better
A little better all the time
I have to admit it's getting better
It's getting better since you've been mine
Getting so much better all the time
It's getting better all the time
Better, better, better
It's getting better all the time
Better, better, better
I used to be cruel to my woman
I beat her and kept her apart from the things that she loved
Man I was mean but I'm changing my scene
And I'm doing the best that I can

I admit it's getting better
A little better all the time
Yes I admit it's getting better
It's getting better since you've been mine
Getting so much better all the time
It's getting better all the time
Better, better, better
It's getting better all the time
Better, better, better
Getting so much better all the time

[Intro]
Ray's Dad's Cadillac
Ray's Dad's Cadillac

[Verse 1]
Ray's Dad's Cadillac
Rollin' past the rink, past the record shack
Pink fins in the falling rain
Rollin' to the blue lights past the watermains

[Chorus]
Ray's Dad's Cadillac
Weekends we'd get Ray's Dad's Cadillac
Rock 'n roll in the dashboard
Romance in the back of Ray's Dad's Cadillac
Ray's Dad's Cadillac

[Verse 2]
Ray's dad teaches math
Zero, I'm a dunce, I'm a decimal in his class
Last night's kisses won't erase
Zero, I just can't keep the numbers in their place

[Chorus]
Ray's Dad's Cadillac
Last night we had Ray's Dad's Cadillac
Rock 'n roll in the dashboard
Romance in the back of Ray's Dad's Cadillac
Ray's Dad's Cadillac

[Bridge]
When it comes to mathematics, I got static in the attic
"No sir, nothin's clear!"
I'll be blackboard blind on Monday, dreamin' of blue runways
On the edge of here, a little atmosphere

[Verse 3]
Blue lights out on airport road
Motown in a field in a farmer's grove
Big planes comin' overhead
Low down, you can see the bolts, you can see the tire treads

[Chorus]
Ray's Dad's Cadillac
Weekends we'd get Ray's Dad's Cadillac
Oh, little darlin', rock 'n roll in the dashboard
Romance in the back of Ray's Dad's Cadillac

[Outro]
Ray's Dad's Cadillac
Ray's Dad's Cadillac
Ray's Dad's Cadillac
Way down the mountain I chased a moonbeam
On the beach I built sand castles too
My moonbeams faded my castles tumbled
All of this was meaningless 'cause happiness is you

No more chasing moonbeams or catching falling stars
I know now my pot of gold is anywhere you are
My heart won't miss you my heart goes with you
Loneliness is emptiness but happiness is you

I tried to doubt you and live without you
Tried to deny but I love you like a do
But I realize now and I'll admit it
You'll always be a part of me 'cause happiness is you
No more chasing moonbeams

[Verse 1]
Three days of snow in Birmingham
Thought you would wonder where I am
Rang our number all night long
It's no comfort on the telephone
Ran out and caught a midnight flight
Thought a little love would make everything all right
The landlord said you moved away
And left me all of your bills to pay
Look out baby, you might have made your move too soon

[Verse 2]
Left me with a Keno card
This life in Vegas sure ain't hard
I ran it up to about fifty grand
Cashed it in and held it in my hand
That kind of word can get around
And make a lost love come up found
I hear you knocking baby at my door
But you know you ain't living here no more
It's too bad
I think you made your move too soon

[Saxophone Solo]

[Verse 3]
I've been from Spain to Tokyo
From Africa to Ohio
I never tried to make the news
I'm just a man who plays the blues
I take my lovin' everywhere
I come back, and they still care you know
One love ahead
One love behind
One in my arms and one on my mind
It's one thing baby
I never make my move too soon

[Verse 4]
I've been from Spain to Tokyo
From Africa to Ohio
I never try to make the news
I'm just a man who plays the blues
I take my lovin' everywhere
I come back and they still care, you know
One love ahead. one love behind
One in my arms, one on my mind
And it's one thing people
I never make my move too soon

[Guitar Solo]
Do it, do it, do it, do it
Do it
Do it, do it, do it, do it
Do it, do it
Yeah
All right
Do it now
Lucille, yeah

[Verse 4]
I've been from Spain to Tokyo
From Africa to Ohio
I never try to make the news
I'm just a man who plays the blues
I take my lovin' everywhere
I come back you know they still all care
One love ahead an one love behind
One in my arms you know, one on my mind
And it's one thing people
I never make my move too soon
You need meat, go to the market
You need bread, try the bakery
If you need love, baby
Don't go no farther
Just come on home with me

I got to love somebody
I got to love somebody
I got to love somebody
I want somebody to love me

You need grits, go to the grocery
You need fish, go to the sea
You need love, baby
Don't look no farther
Just come on home with me

I got to love somebody
I got to love somebody
I got to love somebody
I want somebody to love me

You need money, go to the bank, dear
You need honey, look for the bees
You need love, baby
Don't go no farther
Just come on home with me

I got to love somebody
I got to love somebody
I got to love somebody
I want somebody to love me

I got to love somebody
I got to love somebody

I got to love somebody
I got to love somebody
I got to love somebody
I want somebody to love me
I said Lord up in heaven
Honey, what's been wrong with you
Just give me one good reason
For what we've been going through

Oh go on
'Cause you brought me to my knees
Go on, do just what you please
I'd rather you'd just leave me alone
So baby, go on

Are you sure you still love me
All you seem to want to do is fight
Always telling me
I can't do anything right

You'd better go on
You've got me on my knees
Go on, do just what you please
I'd rather you just leave me alone
So baby, go on
Go on, go on, go on, baby, go on
Go on
'Cause you brought me to my knees
Go on, do just what you please
You wanna lose your happy home
Then baby, go on

Now I've run out of patience
And the chances are slim
Since I walked around the corner
Saw you kissing on him
You said he's just a long lost friend
If you please
You'd better take him home now
So darling, where's the keys

Go on, got me on my knees
Go on, do just what you please
You wanna lose your happy home
Then baby, go on, go on
Go on, go on, go on, go on
I'd rather you just leave me alone
Baby, go on
Go on, go on, go on, go on
Go on, go on, go on, baby, go on
Go on, baby, go on, go on . . 
Pain in my heart, treating me cold
Where can my baby be, Lord no-one knows
Pain in my heart, won't let me sleep
I wake up at night in misery, yes I do
And when my days begin to get rough
Why don't you come back, come back, came back baby
I've had enough

Pain in my heart, won't let me be
Oh I wake up at night in misery
Pain in my heart, treating me cold
Where can my baby be, Lord no-one knows, no they don't
And when my days begin to get rough
Won't you love me, love me, love me baby
Cause I've had enough
I wonder why
Why do everything have to happen to me
I wonder why
Why do everything have to happen to me
Well, I'm blue and I'm lonesome
My heart is filled with misery

Oh, so many strange things
They happen to me all day long
Oh, so many strange things
They happen to me all day long
Yes, it seems like everything I do
Everything I do is wrong

I had a good reputation
The greatest man in town
But I'm having so much troubles
Till they 'bout to drag me down
I wonder why
Why do everything have to happen to me
Well, I'm blue and I'm lonesome
My heart is filled with misery
I got up on my feet
I had lots of friends
But bad luck had hit me
Now I'm down again
I wonder why
Why do everything have to happen to me
Well, I'm blue and I'm lonesome
My heart is filled with misery
(There's a boy in the tree who's watching you)
(Looking with big brown eyes at you)
(Boy in the tree and you can't run away)

I'm walking along in the USA
I'm thinking of how to be far away
Tryin' to find a game where I should play
And so I made up my mind, I should go by car
For goin' by foot, it was much too far
Lookin' around, I just didn't know what to say

Nothing seemed unreal
I soon realized
The boy in my tree

Boy in a tree who's watching you
Looking with big brown eyes at you
A boy in a tree and you can't run away
There's a boy in a tree who's watching you
Looking with big brown eyes at you
A boy in a tree and you can't run away
We go out in the world as a curious thing
I'm feelin' myself like a fairy tale king
I'm catched in a dream and I, I can't run away (Run)
I'm thinkin' about how to stop that dream
I wanna wake up through our hearts and beat
I'm catched in a dream and I, I can't run away

Nothing seemed unreal
I soon realize
The boy in my tree

Boy in a tree who's watching you
Looking with big brown eyes at you
A boy in a tree and you can't run away
There's a boy in a tree who's watching you
Looking with big brown eyes at you
A boy in a tree and you can't run away

Nothing seemed unreal
I soon realized
The boy in my tree

(Boy in a tree who's watching you)
(Looking with big brown eyes at you)
(Boy in the tree and you can't run away)
Boy in a tree who's watching you
Looking with big brown eyes at you
A boy in a tree and you can't run away
There's a boy in a tree who's watching you
Looking with big brown eyes at you
A boy in a tree and you can't run away

A boy in the tree
Someone really loves you
Guess who
Someone really cares
Guess who
S'open your heart
Oh, then surely you'll see
Oh, that the someone who really cares is me

Someone will wait eternally
Someone who'll want your love
Oh so desp'rately
Open your heart
Oh, then surely you'll see
Oh, that the someone who really cares
Who really cares is me
I've got sunshine
On a cloudy day
When it's cold outside
I've got the month of May

I guess you'd say
What can make me feel this way?
My girl, my girl, my girl
Talkin' 'bout my girl
My girl

I've got so much honey
The bees envy me
I've got a sweeter song
Than the birds in the trees

Well, I guess you'd say
What can make me feel this way?
My girl, my girl, my girl
Talkin' 'bout my girl
My girl
Ooo-ooo, hoo-ooo
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Ooh yeah

I don't need no money
Fortune or fame

One man can claim

Well, I guess you'd say
What can make me feel this way?
My girl, my girl, my girl
Talkin' 'bout my girl
My girl

(Talkin' 'bout my girl)
I got sunshine on a cloudy day with my girl
I've even got the month of May with my girl
(Talkin' 'bout my girl)
Talkin' bout, talkin' 'bout, talkin' 'bout my girl
I'm a ramblin' pony
Rollin' from town to town
I'm a ramblin' pony
Rollin' from town to town
I'm a looking for a sweet woman - make my love come down

She's a married woman, yeah
Only nine years old
She's a married woman, yeah
Only nine years old
I got a woman I'm loving - keeps me fishin' all day long

Now, I'm, thinking this old feeling
Crossing this countryside
Now, I'm, thinking this old feeling
Crossing the countryside
I've got a lover now - she won't let old Greeny ride

Now, I'm leaving this morning won't be back no more
Now, I'm leaving this morning won't be back no more
There ain't a rider in the city - keep me inside the door
I get the sweetest feelin' girl
When I look into your eyes, hey baby
I'm livin' in another world
When I look into your eyes, hey baby, baby

Oh, when you're close to me now
It's hard to say what I'm feelin'
Oh, on the inside, baby
Oh, I wanna get to know you
'Cause I know that you're so good, baby

Visions of me and you
When I look into your eyes, hey baby
How can I keep my cool
When I look into your eyes, hey baby, baby

Ooh, you know that I believe you
All I want is your love
Oh, in the meantime, baby
You know I'll never leave you
'Cause I know that you're so good, baby
Right now is the time, oh
You're gonna need my love, baby
Oh, so let me in your life, baby
Let me in, ooh, hey baby

I get the sweetest feelin' girl
When I look into your eyes, hey baby
I'm livin' in another world
When I look into your eyes, hey baby, baby

Oh, when you're close to me now
It's hard to say what I'm feelin'
Oh, on the inside, baby
I wanna get to know you
'Cause I know that you're so good, baby

Right now is the time, oh
You're gonna need my love
Oh so let me in your life, baby
And let me in

Let me in your life
Let me in your life
Let me in your life
You best let some things happen on their own
You better leave them alone
'Cause when they happen naturally
It's like standing in the rain

You're gonna get wet
It's gonna get all over you
So when it happens like that
Don't bother asking where it's from
You just take it as it comes

It was a great year for a fall
And it happened like that
With no direction there to give
Didn't matter much at all

Bells didn't ring
There was nothing calling me out there
Yet I was kinda grooving like that
Until it hit me like a shot
You're part of everything I've got
I felt the sun coming through
And it happened to be you
I had to look away to see
That you happened to be happening to me

It's that sensation when you're falling
And you stop in time
And in that moment you will hear
Just a matter of fact

It's gonna get wet
Gonna get all over you
Sometimes it happens like that
Now don't be asking where it's from
You just take it as it comes

I felt the sun coming through
And it happened to be you
I had to look away to see
That you happened to be happening to me

Bells didn't ring
There was nothing calling me out there
Yet I was kinda grooving like that
Until it hit me like a shot
You're part of everything I've got
I felt the sun coming through
And it happened to be you
I had to look away to see
That you happened to be happening to me

I felt the sun coming through
And it happened to be you
I had to look away to see
That you happened to be happening to me

I felt the sun coming through
And it happened to be you
I had to look away to see
That you happened to be happening to me
When you're down and out
Lift up your head and shout
There's gonna be a great day

Angels in the sky
Promise that by and by
There's gonna be a great day

Gabriel will warn you
Some early morn you
Will hear his horn ruditootin

It's not far away
Hold up your hands and say
There's gonna be a great day

Gabriel will warn you
Some early morn you
Will hear his horn ruditootin

It's not far away
Hold up your hands and say
Gonna be a great day

[Verse 1]
Shade, stay, know all
But they communicate
Try, fade
The leverage of space
Star, jay
The fall dawn aim to place
With shades on
The leverage of...

[Chorus]
Shade, shade, shade
The leverage of, the leverage of
Space, shade, shade
The leverage of, the leverage of

[Verse 2]
Hate breaks down
Mountains that we
Make so tame
Oh, the leverage of...

[Chorus]
Shade, shade, shade
The leverage of, the leverage of
Space, shade, shade
The leverage of, the leverage of

[Bridge]
When I was down upon myself
I walked a road that's always there
You and I were everywhere
And I'm alone
She would never know the reason
That I loved to come and see her
Where she sits, I'll never go
You know it's always there

[Outro]
The leverage of, the leverage of

[Verse 1]
Sally, you opened out your arms
To all those young men
And girl you had room for every one of them
You're the only girl on Bowery and Third
Sure as hell you're the only one who cared

[Chorus 1]
So put your hands together for Sally
She saved all those young men
Put your hands together for Sally
She's the one who cared for them
She's doing our dirty work
She's the only one who cares
Doing our dirty work
Thirsty world one angry day, in New York

[Verse 2]
Take a look at Dave, he was once seventeen
Zoot suit and shiny shoes
He ran around town and through his methylated laughter
Most of his memories drowned
But he remembers what his mommy used to shout
She used to shout
"One day surely, son
The streets are gonna tire you out"

[Chorus 1]
So put your hands together for Sally
She's the one who cared for him
Put your hands together for Sally
She was there when his luck was running thin
She's doing our dirty work
She's the only one who cares
Doing our dirty work
Thirsty world, one angry day, in New York

[Verse 3]
Tommy had a wife and family
But the needle came between the love and the hard times
Thank God for Sally, she was there through the misery
Just a place to lay his head, just about better off than dead

[Chorus 2]
She's doing our dirty work
She's the only one who cares
Doing our dirty work
Thirsty world, one angry dame

[Verse 4]
Vince came up from the country
Couldn't even find himself a room
Thinking about his babies
They're further away than the moon
With no money but his pride in his pocket
There's really no way he can go home
There's a picture of his woman in his locket
Most of all he doesn't want to be alone

[Chorus 1]
Put your hands together for Sally
She's the one who cared for him
Put your hands together for Sally
She was there when his luck was running thin
She's doing our dirty work
She's the only one who cares
Doing our dirty work
Thirsty world, one angry day, in New York

[Intro]
Doing me like you do, cause I know that's what you do (x 5)

[Hook: DMX]
Never been a sucker for love

[Verse 1]
Listen boo, youâs a bitch, you been a bitch
You know how niggas do
Run up in a bitch, fuck her well
And the bitch, you call them bitches
But then in a week or 2, fucking all them bitches
A nigga gotta fall back and take a breather
Shorty suck a mean dick but in the morning
Gotta leave her, wasn't trying to deceive her
I just wanted my dick sucked
She cute as a motherfucker
And she got a big butt
Now I'm like, what do I do from here
Cause sheâs acting like she ainât trying go nowhere
I ain't really trying to get attached to this bitch
Shit it's friday, I just want some ass in the bitch
Canât be mad at me, I'm just doing what niggas do
Got kids by him, and you wanna be a nigga's boo? What!? Really!?
Oh you think itâs like that?
Ok! Iâll be right back

[Hook]

So if it come down to you and me you know
S donât give a fuck, hit the next bitch like "wassup?"
Cause at the end of the day
You ainât never been nothing but a nut

[Verse 2]
It was summer time, I was in the slumps
Seen that chick from before, I was like wassup
Remember me? I was that kid
It was you, her and me, we just did what we did
How you expect me to respect you
When I know a police file of other niggas that you gave your sex to
I ainât never been a sucker, so if you think so
You got the wrong motherfucker
Whatâs my name? Ah ah, bitch! Whatâs my name?
You know what the fuck it is
Iâm a real nigga, thatâs gonna handle his

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I like the way you beat hits, oooh, that's that street shhh
Shorty can you keep a secret? ("Yes...")
You know what Iâm trying to creep with
Come on, cars outside, hotels up the block
Jump in the ride, you and me for the rest of the night
Itâs all good, click, ("Turn off the lights")
Back it up like that girl, ooh, that ass fat girl
We almost there baby, oh shit yeah baby!

[Hook x2]
Oh brother, I can't, I can't get through
I've been tryin' hard to reach you 'cause I don't know what to do
Oh brother, I can't believe it's true
I'm so scared about the future and I wanna talk to you
Oh I wanna talk to you

You could take a picture of something you see
And in the future, where would I be?
You could climb a ladder up to the sun
Or write a song nobody had sung
Or do something that's never been done

Are you lost or incomplete?
Do you feel like a puzzle, you can't find your missing piece?
Tell me how you feel
Well I feel like they're talkin' in a language I don't speak
And they're talking it to me

So you take a picture of something you see
And in the future, where will I be?
You could climb a ladder up to the sun
Or write a song nobody had sung
Or do something that's never been done
Do something that's never been done
So you don't know where you're going and you wanna talk
And you feel like you're going where you've been before
You'll tell anyone who'll listen, but you feel ignored
But nothing's really makin' any sense at all
Let's talk, let's talk
Let's talk, let's talk
Here you are again, sitting at our
Place with him
I can't believe that you would be
So cold
I know that you wanna be,with
Somebody new and that's cool with me
But this right here is just so cold

Didn't I give you all the things that I
Said I would
Didn't I take you all the places that
I said I would
Didn't I give you the love that I said
I would
Tell me how could you go, and...

[Chorus]
And Give my love away
And Give my love away
And Give my love away
And Give my love away
And Give my love away
And Give my love away
You're So cold

I'm hoping now my eyes deceive, cos
This really can't be what I see
I can't believe that you would be so cold
This house we bought for you and I, The
Bed we made love is where he lies?
Girl this right here is just so cold

Didn't I give you all the things that I said
I would
Didn't I take you to the places that I said
I would
Didn't I give you the love that I said I
Would
Tell me how could you go, and...

[Chorus x2]

[Verse 1: David Gilmour]
Hey Eugene, this is Henry McClean
And I've finished my beautiful flying machine
And I'm ringing to say that I'm leaving and maybe
You'd like to fly with me and hide with me, baby
Isn't it strange how little we change?
Isn't it sad we're insane?
Playing the games that we know end in tears
The games we've been playing for thousands and thousands
And thousands and...

[Pre-Chorus 1: Roger Waters]
Jumped into his cosmic flyer
Pulled his plastic collar higher
Light the fuse and stand right back
He cried, "This is my last goodbye"

[Chorus: David Gilmour & Richard Wright]
Point me at the sky and let it fly
(Point me at the sky and let it fly)
Point me at the sky and let it fly
(Point me at the sky and let it fly)
Point me at the sky and let it fly

[Verse 2: David Gilmour]
And if you survive till two thousand and five
I hope you're exceedingly thin
For if you are stout you will have to breathe out
While the people around you breathe in, breathe in
Breathe in, breathe in...

[Pre-Chorus 2: Roger Waters]
People pressing on my sides
Is something that I hate
And so is sitting down to eat
With only little capsules on my plate

[Chorus: David Gilmour & Richard Wright]
Point me at the sky and let it fly
(Point me at the sky and let it fly)
Point me at the sky and let it fly
(Point me at the sky and let it fly)
Point me at the sky and let it fly

[Outro: Roger Waters]
And all we've got to say to you is goodbye
It's time to go, better run and get your bags, it's goodbye
Nobody cry, it's goodbye

(Crash, crash, crash, crash, goodbye)
(Crash, crash, crash, crash, goodbye)
(Crash, crash, crash, crash, goodbye)
(Crash, crash, crash, crash, goodbye)
(Crash, crash, crash, crash, goodbye)
(Crash, crash, crash, crash, goodbye)
(Crash, crash, crash, crash, goodbye)
(Crash, crash, crash, crash, goodbye)
Every year about this time
My wife Melva made some wine
Every year about this time
The air is sweet as Melva's wine
And I sip her wine and I listen to the robins sing
And the river runs through Kingston Springs

Every year about this time
A few old friends come up to walk
Every year about this time
A few old friends stop by to talk
And we talk about the crops and weather and things
And the young folks here in Kingston Springs

I got the brother up Chicago way
He wants me to visit him someday and I may sometimes
But not as long as the robin sings
And the river runs through Kingston Springs

It was last year about this time
Melva made her last batch of wine
It was last year about this time
She left for me her warm sweet wine
She could sing as sweet as robins sing
Above her grape in Kingston Springs
'Cause it was last year about this time
That Melva made this glass of wine

I got the brother up Chicago way
He wants me to visit him someday and I may sometimes
But not as long as the robin sings
And the river runs through Kingston Springs

'Cause that was last year about this time
That Melva made this glass of wine
You might be old, about 90 years
But you ain't too old to shift them gears
You can shake it up and go (Shake it up and go)
Shake it up and go (Shake it up and go)
You good-looking people sure can shake it up and go

Mama killed a chicken, she thought it was a duck
She put it on the table with his legs sticking up
She had to shake it up and go (Shake it up and go)
Shake it up and go (Shake it up and go)
You good-looking people sure got to shake it up and go

I told my baby the week before last
The gait she had was just a little too fast
She had to shake it up and go (Shake it up and go)
Shake it up and go (Shake it up and go)
You good-looking people sure got to shake it up and go

Look here baby, you ain't treating me right
You go out everyday, stay out late at night
You got to shake it up and go, baby (Shake it up and go)
You got to shake it up and go (Shake it up and go)
You good-looking people sure got to shake it up and go
One, two, one, two, three

Oh yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Oooh!)
Oh yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Oooh!)

Never had much faith in love or miracles (Oooh!)
Never wanna put my heart on the line (Oooh!)
But swimming in your world is something spiritual (Oooh!)
I'm born again every time you spend the night (Oooh!)

'Cause your sex takes me to paradise
Yeah, your sex takes me to paradise
And it shows
Yeah, yeah, yeah

'Cause you make feel like
I've been locked out of heaven
For too long
For too long
Yeah, you make feel like
I've been locked out of heaven
For too long
For too long

Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Oooh!)
Oh yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Oooh!)

You bring me to my knees, you make me testify (Oooh!)
You can make a sinner change his ways (Oooh!)
Open up your gates 'cause I can't wait to see the light (Oooh!)
And right there is where I wanna stay (Oooh!)

'Cause your sex takes me to paradise
Yeah, your sex takes me to paradise
And it shows
Yeah, yeah, yeah

'Cause you make feel like
I've been locked out of heaven
For too long
For too long

Yeah, you make feel like
I've been locked out of heaven
For too long
For too long
Ohohoho
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Can I just stay here?
Spend the rest of my days here?

Ohohoho
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Can't I just stay here?
Spend the rest of my days here?

'Cause you make feel like
I've been locked out of heaven
For too long
For too long

Yeah, you make feel like
I've been locked out of heaven
For too long
For too long

Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Oooh!)
Oh yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Oooh!)
