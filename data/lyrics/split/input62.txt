My heart is beating and it won't stop

You, you got me feeling a second away

Ooh, we got this moment, don't let it slip away

Your touch got me off the ground
It's like we're living in a daydream
Skylines spinning 'round and 'round
And then you tell me that you love me

[Pre-Chorus]
You, you got me feeling a second away
You make me feel like I wanna scream out
Ooh, we got this moment, don't let it slip away
So tell me, now I gotta find out

[Narration]
And now a behind-the-scenes treat from the original voice-over session for "Thriller", with Michael and Vincent Price. You'll also hear the never-before-released second verse of Vincent's rap, written by Rod

[Bruce Swedien]
Okay, tape's rolling. Any--anytime you want

[Intro, take 1: Michael Jackson & Vincent Price]
Hi, this is Michael Jackson
This is Vincent Price
Michael Jackson is...
The Thriller!

[Segue: Michael Jackson, Vincent Price, Bruce Swedien]
*Vincent laughs*
Do we both say it?
Say it together?
"Inviting you to."
I say "inviting you to"? All right. Yeah
Okay
Any time. Tape's rolling

[Intro, take 2: Michael Jackson, Vincent Price, Michael Jackson & Vincent Price]
Hi, this is Michael Jackson
And this is Vincent Price, inviting you to...
The Thriller!

[Verse 1: Vincent Price]
Darkness falls across the land
The midnight hour is close at hand
Creatures crawl in search of blood
To terrorize your neighborhood
And whosoever shall be found
Without the soul for getting down
Must stand and face the hounds of hell
And rot inside a corpse's shell

[Verse 2: Vincent Price]
The demons squeal in sheer delight
It's you they spy, so plump, so right
For though the groove is hard to beat
Yet still you stand with frozen feet
You try to run, you try to scream
But no more sun you'll ever see
For evil reaches from the crypt
To crush you in its icy grip

[Verse 3: Vincent Price]
The foulest stench is in the air
The funk of 40,000 years
And grisly ghouls from every tomb
Are closing in to seal your doom
And though you fight to stay alive
Your body starts to shiver
For no mere mortal can resist
The evil of the Thriller

[Outro: Vincent Price]
Can you dig it?
Hmmm-Hahahahaha...
AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!
AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
Ahahahahahahah...

[Post-outro: Vincent Price & Bruce Swedien]
Hmmph, that's great fun!
Great, thank you. Cut
Okay. All right!

[Intro]
Ooh, ooh
Hey, oh yeah
Oh

[Hook]
Will you let me know?
Can you let me know?
I just wanna know
What can I know, oh
Help me try to, help me understand
Help me try to, want to understand
I been on this for too long
I been on it too long, to understand
I been on this for too long
I been on it too long, to understand
Can we do it before it hurts to breathe?
Can we do it before it hurts to breathe?
I just wanna breathe
I just wanna breathe

[Bridge]
Ehh, ehh, ohh
How will I know?
Ooh

[Hook]
Let me know, oh
Can you let me know? Yeah

Help me try to, help me understand
Help me try to, want me understand
I been on this for too long
I been on it too long, to understand
I been on this for too long
I been on it too long, to understand
You're in to it, baby
Ooh, before it hurts to breathe
Can we do it, baby
Ooh, before it hurts to breathe?
I been on this for too long
I been on it too long, to understand
I been on this for too long
I been on it too long, to understand

[Outro]
How will I
How will I
How will I know?

[Harmonizing]

[Intro: Travie McCoy]
Yeah, yeah, haha
It's Travie
Detail, whaddup?
Here we go, let's go

[Chorus: Kesha & (Travie McCoy)]
I love the crazy things you do
'Cause tonight's the night for me to play the fool
And the mood is right, plus you're so polite
(But you know that I really want you
Girl, you know that I really want you)

[Verse 1: Travie McCoy]
I'm sittin' here thinkin' about ways to confront you
Then dreaming 'bout how its gon' feel when I touch you
Girl, you know I really want you
You know how bad I really want you
But make it easy on me (Damn)
Take is easy on me (C'mon)
I'm fragile from girls in the past that did nothin'
But frontin' that crazy on me
But I can tell that you different
Swagger, brand new like an infant
Don't lie and act like you ain't tempted
To be honest with you, I'm kinda offended
See, I understand the policy
The least you can do is acknowledge me
You're harder to read than Japanese
And that look on your face is just screaming, "Don't bother me"

[Chorus: Kesha & (Travie McCoy)]
I love the crazy things you do
'Cause tonight's the night for me to play the fool
And the mood is right, plus you're so polite
(But you know that I really want you
Girl, you know that I really want you)
I really, really, really, really want you bad
Your lips got a smile that ain't ever sad
You bad bad boy, I ain't ever mad at you
(But you know that I really want you
Girl, you know that I really want you)
At you, boy

[Verse 2: Travie McCoy & (Kesha)]
Now give me some sort of sign
Just somethin' so I can be sure that you're mine
Now before you start lyin'
Just ask yourself, am I really that fine? (What?)
I happen to think that you are
In fact, I'm convinced that you're an angel
That somehow fell from the sky
You fly, but I don't get your angle
Now we can sit here and pretend
Like the feelings you have are non-existent
But it's so obvious you're dying inside to be my princess
Look at you now, you smilin'
But earlier you was whilin'
Like "I wouldn't fuck with that dude
If we was stuck on a deserted island"
(Oh, that's how you feel?)

[Chorus: Kesha & (Travie McCoy)]
I love the crazy things you do
'Cause tonight's the night for me to play the fool
And the mood is right, plus you're so polite
(But you know that I really want you
Girl, you know that I really want you)
I really, really, really, really want you bad
Your lips got a smile that ain't ever sad
You bad bad boy, I ain't ever mad at you
(But you know that I really want you
Girl, you know that I really want you)
At you, boy

[Bridge: Kesha]
I love the crazy things you do
Do something oh so naughty, cool
Tonight, I'm gonna play the fool
So what? I wanna get with you

[Chorus: Kesha & (Travie McCoy)]
I love the crazy things you do
'Cause tonight's the night for me to play the fool
And the mood is right, plus you're so polite
(But you know that I really want you
Girl, you know that I really want you)
I really, really, really, really want you bad
Your lips got a smile that ain't ever sad
You bad bad boy, I ain't ever mad at you
(But you know that I really want you
Girl, you know that I really want you)
I ain't ever mad at you, boy

[Verse 1]
Ask around about her
She don't get emotional
Kill off all her feelings
That's why she ain't approachable
She know her pussy got a fanbase
A couple niggas with a suitcase
Suit and tie niggas who play roleplay
When it comes to money she play no games

[Pre-Hook]
She lick it up just like a candy
She wanna make them leave their family
She trying to live a life so fancy
She wanna pull up in a Bentley
She ain't got time for lovin'
Louis Vuitton her husband
She rather die in lusting
She rather die in the club, till she

[Hook]
Six feet under she gon' get that fucking paper
Six feet under she gon' get that fucking paper
Six feet under she gon' get that fucking paper
You know how she get down, pop her for a check now
Six feet under she gon' get that fucking paper
Six feet under she gon' get that fucking paper
Six feet under she gon' get that fucking paper
You know how she get down, pop her for a check now

[Verse 2]
She don't depend on anybody
Know just what to do with her own body
Counting all that money like a hobby
She don't give a fuck about nobody
And she got her whole crew poppin'
And she bend it over like she got no back bone
Got a couple niggas blinging up a trap phone
She don't need nobody waiting back home, she got it

[Pre-Hook]
She lick it up just like a candy
She wanna make them leave their family
She trying to live a life so fancy
She wanna pull up in a Bentley
She ain't got time for lovin'
Louis Vuitton her husband
She rather die in lusting
She rather die in the club, till she

[Hook]
Six feet under she gon' get that fucking paper
Six feet under she gon' get that fucking paper
Six feet under she gon' get that fucking paper
You know how she get down, pop her for a check now
Six feet under she gon' get that fucking paper
Six feet under she gon' get that fucking paper
Six feet under she gon' get that fucking paper
You know how she get down, pop her for a check now

[Bridge]
Real love's hard to find
So she don't waste her time
So she don't waste her time, oooh
You ain't gon' catch her crying
She ain't gon' lose her mind
She ain't gon' lose her mind
Real love's hard to find
So she don't waste her time
So she don't waste her time, oooh
You ain't gon' catch her crying
She ain't gon' lose her mind
She ain't gon' lose her mind
Till she..

[Outro]
Six feet under she gon' get that fucking paper
Six feet under she gon' get that fucking paper
Six feet under she gon' get that fucking paper
You know how she get down, pop her for a check now
Six feet under she gon' get that fucking paper
Six feet under she gon' get that fucking paper
Six feet under she gon' get that fucking paper
You know how she get down, pop her for a check now

[Chorus]
Hello neighbor, why you are looking so uptight?
(Uptight, uptight)
I ain’t going to rob you, and I ain’t going to bother you
So, tell me neighbor, why you are looking so uptight?
(Uptight, uptight)
No, I ain’t better than drugs in your residence
Hello neighbor, why you are looking so uptight?
(Uptight, uptight)
I ain’t going to rob you, and I ain’t going to bother you
So, tell me neighbor, why you are looking so uptight?
(Uptight, uptight)
No, I ain’t better than drugs in your residence

[Verse 1]
We all mess up sometimes
But you can make corrections sometimes
Everybody needs to have directions sometimes
Cause you can only live this one time (oh shit)
Tell me neighbor, why you are looking so uptight?
Is it cause I’m fly, or is it because you despise
They fear young nigga getting bread to the skies
Don’t look at my clothes, it’s just a disguise
Somewhat we nap and root it, we got the baddest buddhist
We just be rapping music, you all will just be clapping to it
I get down, I get down, before this song is over
You’ll lose six pounds, six pounds
So how they do it to ya?

[Chorus]
Hello neighbor, why you are looking so uptight?
(Uptight, uptight)
I ain’t going to rob you, and I ain’t going to bother you
So, tell me neighbor, why you are looking so uptight?
(Uptight, uptight)
No, I ain’t better than drugs in your residence
Hello neighbor, why you are looking so uptight?
(Uptight, uptight)
I ain’t going to rob you, and I ain’t going to bother you
So, tell me neighbor, why you are looking so uptight?
(Uptight, uptight)
No, I ain’t better than drugs in your residence

[Verse 2]
Now look here! This what we finna do
All the neighbor headed neckles over there
And all the pum headed bitches over there
Now look here, say! The bills never lead up
You say we needs our betters
So why you still complaining if the government won’t help us
Quit with all the boo-hoo, go and take a doo-doo
Get that shit up out your system so you can be new-new
Why you gotta complain?
I know for who make chump change
Can still move out the hood
Hit the beach and catch a sun tan
So if you hear me, I said if you really hear me
Talking off the mirror so, uh, you can see clearer, man

[Chorus]
Hello neighbor, why you are looking so uptight?
(Uptight, uptight)
I ain’t going to rob you, and I ain’t going to bother you
So, tell me neighbor, why you are looking so uptight?
(Uptight, uptight)
No, I ain’t better than drugs in your residence
Hello neighbor, why you are looking so uptight?
(Uptight, uptight)
I ain’t going to rob you, and I ain’t going to bother you
So, tell me neighbor, why you are looking so uptight?
(Uptight, uptight)
No, I ain’t better than drugs in your residence

[Hook: Frenchie]
If you think I'm done trappin', cause I made it rappin'
Basically this is something that you don't really know about me
A ghetto superstar, riding through the six
Middle fingers up, screaming Sun Valley
I'm reppin' it, I'm reppin' it, I'm reppin' it
I'm reppin' it, I'm reppin' it, I'm reppin' it
I'm reppin' it, I'm reppin' it, I'm reppin' it

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
1470, on top of Sun Valley
Where a young nigga jumped off and started trapping
A nigga got killed last night, what happened?
Fucking with them double crossing bitches from the valley
Mountain Park apartments, everybody capping
Don't go to Triangle 'cause you might just get your ass kicked
Bottom of the hill shooting hoops, Sun Valley
Nigga wanna jump me and take my Starter jacket
13 years old but my big bruh packing
Let's just say they ain't take my Starter jacket
Flashback, '97, 5 dollar crap game, gambling in the store
Gusto, C-Note, Carlos, dameon and my nigga lil red
A's out, flash forward '08, million dollar crap game
Walking through the apartments, Nike Jordan shoe game
Versace glasses, I was only in the 9th grade
Triple gold D's by the 11th grade
Fuckin' all the teachers, all the teachers wanna fuck me
Got locked up 6 months I was 19, fresh outta high school
6 months in the county
10 cars mounted, 3 trucks, 6 hard tops mane
Four homes, two spots, two dogs
One a maltese and one a yorkie
Iced out dogs same size as the yorkie
If you touch this dog the owner start barkin'
Growlin', brawlin' reppin', ballin', stones not cloudy
Big boy ballin' Wilt Cham numbers on a bad day
Good day, 80, on a great day quarter
Starter, starter, gotta be a starter
Starter, starter, So Icy starter
Nigga you a bench warmer

[Hook: Frenchie]
Carry me back
Bury the hatch, pushing a tack in LA detach this beaten path
I'm losing track of all the days I'm wasting on winning one thought
I'm a real player but I forgot all the rearranging my Gordian knot

Carry me back, show me my past
Looking through rose glass
Missing my ma, missing my pa
I'm losing track of all the days I've wasted in Hollywood land
All the cars and pavement driving me mad
But there's still a place that I understand

Yes I must be patient
Playing this band, got a couple aces
Maybe a chance, but the lonely feeling... is it gonna last?
Daddy knows just what to do
When his hand becomes a pool
In his head he ain't a fool
Pushing weight in Hollywood

My gestalt is hanging on the edge of the fault
Learning tricks from Uncle Donnie
And Walt for our education

Sloganeering on the lot
He's a nascent vagabond
Motion picture Babylon
When I'm twisted and alone

My gestalt is hanging on the edge of the fault
Learning tricks from Uncle Donnie
And Walt for a revelation
And if you thought this paradigm was out of the box
This rare design is only a block in the tesselation
Lazy eye
Looks that could kill when I satisfy
All I can take
Feeling wry
Playin' a fool
In the paradise
I can see strange

You don't have to wait

Lately I've
Looked through the bills for an alibi
But they don't show
Easy guy
Maybe you took too much
Now you're dry
And on your own

Welcome to my show
If you'd like to know me well
I'm acquiescing this phase
Weighing me down with its waiting
Playing my silly little game
Watching the memory I saved

Tossing all my coins (in wishing wells)
Searching for the signs (in parallel)
Out on the lawn I'll be skipping tracing
Chasing the person I seem

I'm readdressing my fate
Keeping a tab on my wasting
Playing my silly little game
Watching the memory I saved

Tossing all my coins (in wishing wells)
Searching for the signs (in parallel)
Out on the lawn I'll be skipping tracing
Chasing the person I seem
It's just the chapel perilous
You can ride the bus for free
Surf's up, better get your stuff
When you catch a wave stay young

Reach out and have yourself a touch
When you wish upon a star
Your dreams come true
Come true, come true, come true

When you wish upon the star
Dreams come true

[Intro]
Bundles

[Verse]
Move just like Jason
Bitch, don't test my patience
Bitch, money my odor
I ball, check my floater
Gold grill in my mouth and my bitch by my side
Nigga, just like The Joker
She love how I stroke her
It's 2AM, I might pop up like the toaster
Pull up, Testarossa, John Gotti the city
Suck on my dick like a string of spaghetti
Ed, Edd and Eddy, pop off like confetti
These niggas ain't ready, I'on't give a fuck
One call, they kick in your door for a couple bucks
She talkin' guala then bitch nigga shut it up, flood it up
White wrists look like the light on a Jeep truck
G shit, nigga, I see shit
Pull up in a spaceship
Bitch came from Cali and she came with her face lit
Dick in her mouth, got her cheeks like a fat kid
Make the bankroll bend over like her back did
Run to the money like a mothafuckin' track kid
Bitch head so big, had to call her lemonhead
Get it in, get it out, just like Diner Dash
Ass so fat and her waist so thin
She was blamin' it on SlimFast
Youngest in the room but I prolly got the most cash
Walk in the club and Lil Boat change the forecast
I fuck with that bitch but my bitch got more...

[Intro]
I'm a motherfuckin' starboy

[Verse 1]
I'm tryna put you in the worst mood, ah
P1 cleaner than your church shoes, ah
Milli point two just to hurt you, ah
All red Lamb’ just to tease you, ah
None of these toys on lease too, ah
Made your whole year in a week too, yah
Main bitch out your league too, ah
Side bitch out of your league too, ah

[Pre-Chorus]
House so empty, need a centerpiece
20 racks a table cut from ebony
Cut that ivory into skinny pieces
Then she clean it with her face man I love my baby
You talking money, need a hearing aid
You talking bout me, I don't see the shade
Switch up my style, I take any lane
I switch up my cup, I kill any pain

[Chorus]
Look what you've done
I’m a motherfuckin' starboy
Look what you've done
I'm a motherfuckin' starboy
I'm a motherfuckin' starboy
Look what you've done
I'm a motherfuckin' starboy

[Verse 2]
Every day a nigga try to test me, ah
Every day a nigga try to end me, ah
Pull off in that Roadster SV, ah
Pockets overweight, gettin' hefty, ah
Coming for the king, that's a far cry, ah
I come alive in the fall time, I
No competition, I don't really listen
I’m in the blue Mulsanne bumping New Edition

[Pre-Chorus]
House so empty, need a centerpiece
20 racks a table cut from ebony
Cut that ivory into skinny pieces
Then she clean it with her face man I love my baby
You talking money, need a hearing aid
You talking bout me, I don’t see the shade
Switch up my style, I take any lane
I switch up my cup, I kill any pain

[Chorus]
Look what you've done
I’m a motherfuckin' starboy
Look what you've done
I'm a motherfuckin’ starboy

[Verse 3]
Let a nigga Brad Pitt
Legend of the Fall took the year like a bandit
Bought mama a crib and a brand new wagon
Now she hit the grocery shop looking lavish
Star Trek roof in that Wraith of Khan
Girls get loose when they hear this song
100 on the dash get me close to God
We don't pray for love
We just pray for cars

[Chorus]
Look what you've done
I'm a motherfuckin' starboy
Look what you've done
I'm a motherfuckin' starboy
Look what you've done
I'm a motherfuckin' starboy
Look what you've done
I'm a motherfuckin' starboy

[Intro: Lil Yachty]
I gotta tell ya Chad, feel good to be back in this bitch
My nigga C.J. in this bitch with me

[Verse 1: Lil Yachty]
I make you niggas uncomfortable, I can tell that y'all truly not feelin' me
12 just kicked in my back door, but my brother already stashed in the ceiling, b
This isn't the first or the second, my nigga this shit right here, this is the trilogy
She off the molly, so she into me
Without the molly, trust me, she still into me
Feelin like Drake with the enemies
Leveled up, I got the energy
You the Castro of catastrophe
I'm in the sky like astronomy, trust me I know y'all not finding me
That pussy is wet like a pond to me
My D.J. is Deano from 6 OD and he spin it back that's the recipe
Got an extra key for locked doors
Where the bad whores get fucked good
9/10 my niggas ain't gonna smoke with you if it ain't no Backwoods
I ran it up like I said I would
I fucked that bitch on the cardboard
All of my niggas from wish-you-woods
They totin' clips like a hard drive

[Hook: Lil Yachty]
Money's lookin' good, but now I'm really really ballin'
I was up before but now I'm really really ballin'
Ballin' like a Piston, bitch I'm ballin' like a Piston

[Verse 2: Lil Yachty]
Ballin' like the Piston's owner
Why you acting like a loner?
Niggas swear they be "skrr skrr" but when they hop in my whip, they be scared
None of my fights have been fair
Either got jumped
Or I jumped on a player
Took one L in my life but I promise, it won't happen no more
Got the choppa sittin' on the floor
Imma bust in at a nigga nose
I got way too, way too many hoes, chain on my neck, yeah, this shit real gold
I need to start doing more shows
I need to start buying more clothes
I already got a lot of clothes
But nigga I want more clothes
This shit here is flex music (huh)
Nigga gon' and flex to it (huh)
Double cup drinkin' fluids
Flyest shit, nigga you knew it
Nut on her face just like cool whip
Dive in that pussy like pool dip
Alot of these bitches say Yachty is igorant
But I can not change cause that shit is foolish
(Ahhh!)
I think... I think when it's all over it just comes back in flashes, you know? It's like a kaleidoscope of memories, it just all comes back. But he never does. I think part of me knew the second I saw him that this would happen. It's not really anything he said or anything he did, it was the feeling that came along with it. And the crazy thing is I don't know if I'm ever gonna feel that way again, but I don't know if I should. I knew his world moved too fast and burned too bright, but I just thought, how can the devil be pulling you toward someone who looks so much like an angel when he smiles at you? Maybe he knew that when he saw me. I guess I just lost my balance. I think that the worst part of it all wasn't losing him, it was losing me.

[Part I]

Only thing keepin' me by your side now

[Outro: Norma Rowe]
But see, Solána, if you don't say somethin', speak up for yourself
They think you stupid, you know what I'm sayin'?

[Verse 1]
Loosie, doosie, the jokes on you, I didn't grow up to Boosie
All I care about is feeding my family and getting out of that Camry
I'm in a Benz and I'm getting a Bentley
I'm reading texts from last night, she said "I love how you bent me"
I just bought a Benz and it said "please tint me"
You wanna buy it but you can't
So you're renting, you'll take it back in 6 months
If there's no denting
7K for the for VVS, white diamond dentals
They say "Yachty are you the nigga with the jingle bell rap?"
I'm cool with that, cause every bitch look at my jingle balls now, I fool with that
I finger roll the ABA in
Top floor, penthouse where I'm staying
I grew up watching Even Stevens
Now Steven ain't nearly as even
But I want to thank you for the entertainment that evening
Yeah, we all laughed at you
'Cause we all know you wouldn't say that if you saw me on your avenue
We all know you aren't built for this shit
I was taught "don't you dare buck if you can't back up your shit"
Every time I wake up, someone new is back on my dick
I used to get baffled, now I sit back and laugh like a bitch
Young as fuck and rich as hell, I can't get mad at this shit

[Interlude]
Hold up, let me change the topic real quick

[Verse 2]
We got a fallen soldier on the internet
Don't believe my net worth on the Internet
It's a lot larger, my dream girl's ex boyfriend drive a Charger
So I know I got a chance with that chick
I used dream about bitches who love all this shit
I used to dream about girls who love all the dick
I used to wear gold so fake, now I iced up the wrist
Hold up, aye, uh, aye, uh
Funkmaster Flex please stop talkin' 'bout me
Unless you're finna play my songs then don't talk about me
Uhm, old man, here's a bar
I hope you fall into a hole where there's no sun or stars

[Outro]
Uh, hold on, aye, uh, uh, aye, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on
I'm gonna stop, stop, stop, stop
I'm gonna stop
You can search the galaxy
But you’ll never find another me
And I’m cool on your attitude
You’ll be trying prove you don’t need me in your life
But you’d better wake up and starting giving me what i deserve

[Chorus]
You need to be loving me like money
I want you stuck like bees to honey
I need you addicted to this good love
That I'm giving don’t be fronting
You need to hold on and don’t let go
I wanna feel you take control
You don't wanna wake up one morning
To see you lost your heart and soul
You better get it right

Boy it’s time for you to get it right
You bout to make me walk up out your life

You can swim the ocean wide
But you won’t discover love like mine
I’ma need you to understand if you gonna be my man
Then you gotta show that you wanna be here
You better start acting like you know
Ooh

[Chorus]
You need to be loving me like money
I want you stuck like bees to honey
I need you addicted to this good love
That I'm giving don’t be fronting
You need to hold on and don’t let go
I wanna feel you take control
You don't wanna wake up one morning
To see you lost your heart and soul
You better get it right

Boy it’s time for you to get it right
You bout to make me walk up out your life

[Rap: Taraji P. Henson]
Had me playing with my head inception
Talking bout he loving me but I ain't feelin it
You's a bad joke yeah a crowd of smoke
So I’ma fall back in the rear coach gold
I gave him everything that he needed
Oh but now his phone number's been deleted
You couldn't get this right
Booking the next train up out of yo life

Ya better get it right

[Chorus:]

Boy it’s time for you to get it right (out of sight)
You bout to make me walk up out your life......
Do you see people being led, by the righteous hands?
Taking care of everyone like they run a piece of land;

Show me
Show me
Show me
Show me

Do you see people's lives being lost on the sacred land?
In the battle over water being fought, for the baby's hand;

Show Me
Show Me
Show Me
Show Me

When the women of the world are free to stand up for themselves
And the promises made, stop gathering dust on the shelf;

Show Me
Show Me
Show Me
Show Me
Well, I hear ya out there when you say what you have to say
I know how you feel, cause that's what made me this way
When heaven on Earth is improved by the hand of man
And people everywhere get together and join their hands;

Show Me
Show Me
Show Me
Show Me
Show Me

(Harmonica solo)

Show Me

[Verse 1]
Old Mister Jackson cuts his grass after church on his tractor, only after listening to the Country Countdown
He remembers all the three cord sessions, givin' lessons, never guessin', we'd go from dive bars to sold out
He just smiles, can't help but grin
When he turns that dial on the FM
Hears an old friend, he can't believe it
Ain't that what it's all about? What it's all about, yeah

[Chorus]
All I wanna do is make my hometown proud
Make 'em turn it up loud
Roll them windows down
All I wanna do is make my hometown proud
Gonna give 'em that sound

Still got that same old, same old southern voice
We're singing now
All I wanna do is make my hometown proud
Make my hometown proud
Make my hometown proud

[Verse 2]
All the whining through the years, all the grindin' of the gears, all the passion and the tears, man, it paid off
All the places that we see, all the people that we meet, it still feels like a dream that we're living on
It ain't the lights and fame
It ain't the smoke and flame
It's that sweet hearted smile on my mama's face

[Chorus]
All I wanna do is make my hometown proud
Make 'em turn it up loud
Roll them windows down
All I wanna do is make my hometown proud
Gonna give 'em that sound
Everybody's talking 'bout
We still them same old, same old southern boys
Still got that same old, same old southern voice
We're singing now
All I wanna do is make my hometown proud
Make my hometown proud
Make my hometown proud

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
In every song, every way
In every move I'd ever made
That's right, Northwest Georgia, where y'all at?
In every song, in every way
Every move I'd ever made
Chattanooga, Tennessee, turn it up
Come on

[Chorus]
All I wanna do is make my hometown proud
Make 'em turn it up loud
Roll them windows down
All I wanna do is make my hometown proud
Gonna give 'em that sound
Everybody’s talking 'bout
We still them same old, same old southern boys
Still got that same old, same old southern voice
We're singing now
All I wanna do is make my hometown proud
Make my hometown proud
Make my hometown proud

[Intro]
Look at you go
Okay, you bubblin'
Look, go, go
Look at you go
Okay, you bubblin', look

[Verse 1]
Yeah, one in the hand, one in the bag, bubblin'
Look at the cash, look at the cash comin' in
Come get your mans, this lil' nigga buggin' me
Just leave the bag, quit all that jaw-jackery
Don't even pass me that, I don't want none of it (Yeah)
These niggas mad about it, had enough of it
Woah, watch what you sayin', all that poppin' and shakin'
Got me hot as a laser, my posse deep and irate
And we act a fool for the paper, had a dream and I made it
El Camino on Dayton's, Vintage Guess over Bape
Put the bread on me, bitch, bitch, you bet I'ma bank it
Piggy flat in a blanket, I might just roll out today
I might just roll out to Vegas, head back to my old ways
Cop a room full of Asian hoes and do blow all day
Look at me, baby, look at me, baby
Don't I look like a million? I'm 'bout to clean out the safe
D-don't I look like somebody that just be bodyin' everything?
All that talkin' is great but I don't be talkin', I air it out
All the problems have gotten easy to bury
I'd rather drown them in Hendrick's, I'd rather kiss on my Mary
I been broker way longer than I been rich so until it levels out
I'ma take your mama to the Marriott and wear it out
Took me so long to get it, go on and spread it out
Let 'em know all about me when I'm dead and gone (woah)

[Chorus]
One in the hand, one in the bag, bubblin' (look at you go)
One in the hand, one in the bag, bubblin' (look at you go)
Look at the cash, look at the cash bubblin' (okay, you bubblin')
Look at the cash (look) bubblin' (go)
One in the hand (look), one in the hand (go)
One in the hand, one in the bag, bubblin' (look at you go)
Look at the cash, look at the cash bubblin' (okay, you bubblin')
Look at the cash (look) bubblin'

[Verse 2]
I'ma need all the fries you can give me
All the hot sauce, all the pie you can give me
Better be all or nothin', don't have me in the middle
You better be all you can, get higher than the limit, yeah
Simplify for the Dumbos, plenty slides, I can shuffle
Hit the cadence with my young bitch, Isaac Hayes, Billy Ocean
Bought my old hoe with the cane stick, left my slippers at the function
It's hard to run in Gucci slides
Chick, I thought you said you didn't have a husband
I'm a stud, no cuckold, Jackie Chan, no trouble
Can't clean it with a bib, blood drippin' from the cutthroats
No Lord, not me, I can never be the one you wanna stunt for
Money, money, that machine gun sprayed the Ferragamo store
R.I.P to times that I was broke, after life in 911 Porsche
Matte black lookin' clean, dead prezies in an envelope
Cookin up canard, waitin' for the antidote
Runnin' out of time, patience thinner than a pantyhose

[Interlude: Sample]
"Get over here and empty your pockets."
"I don't do that."
"You're my prisoner—you do what I tell you to do—get over here."
"Haha, he's gonna get nasty about it!"
"Fuckin' bitch!"
"Frank! Cool it, huh?"
"Stay the fuck outta this!"

[Chorus]
One in the hand, one in the bag, bubblin' (look at you go)
One in the hand, one in the bag, bubblin' (look at you go)
Look at the cash, look at the cash bubblin' (okay, you bubblin')
Look at the cash (look) bubblin' (go)
One in the hand (look), one in the hand (go)
One in the hand, one in the bag, bubblin' (look at you go)
Look at the cash, look at the cash, bubblin' (okay, you bubblin')
Look at the cash (look) bubblin'

[Verse 1]
How could I fall, fall for you?
When I've had it all from you
Before I been ready, it's on the road, it's now or never
The hottest thing since me, yeah
But I may say, I, girl, you already know
You'll be emotional 'cause I'm only yours
Please see the gang's involved
There ain't no in and outs

[Pre-Chorus]
Only believin' now
'Cause you said you loved someone
And I felt dead wrong
'Cause I been that one
And I said I'd hold you down
So cry here right now
Go ahead and look at you
Let it out

[Chorus]
You're still gone
Still you're gone
Let me know if he cut you off
See you around, adios
I know that I'm dead wrong

[?] see things, when they show you
What they want you to know
Watch what you don't see, on the TV
When they hide the truth

Feel, how it hurts you
When the truth hides, behind the scenes
Cry, from the broken - hearted melody
That you hear in your dreams

[?] meets a runaway
Can you catch him?
It's not in your hands

Slow, easy does it, when you find out, what deception means
Try, try to change it
Cause it hurts you
And it holds back your dreams

Dreams of the New World
Evolution of the species to survive, truth that screams:
Call, in the darkness
For the moment, a clear thinking joy
Laugh, when you find out, that the story that's spoken, has broken like a toy

Lost, in the sandbox
Just left there, for no one to enjoy
Found, by the police
Who killed him, where filmed on the phone

Texas Rangers, had to ride in, to the rescue of all that's well and good
Texas Rangers, in pickups, painted silver, with bulldogs on the hood
Texas Rangers, come to save you, come to rescue the bad and the good
Texas Rangers, on the free way, and in your neighborhood

Texas Rangers
Texas Rangers
Texas Rangers
Texas Rangers

[Verse 1]
Went back home in the winter
Moved into my parents’ house
And walked the hallways like a stranger
Still haven’t figured anything out

[Verse 2]
‘Cause I still don’t know what to do
Last year, I swore I’d make a noose in the lights
Hang out in the gutter
Decorate my neck with the colored bulbs
So that everyone would laugh at me
Laugh at me
Laugh at me
When you drive around the neighborhood in your SUV
Looking for a holiday display with your family
And there I’ll be, in the yard, dangling

[Verse 3]
Happier spending December
Fulfilling obligations
Without the red pin in my calendar
Or last call at the Greyhound station

[Verse 4]
‘Cause I can’t hurry up to you
End of every grueling day
And for the mundanity we suffer through
I won’t try to join the pile up on the freeway
Crash my car into a ditch, oh darling
I won’t even think of it… anymore

[Chorus]
‘Cause I loved you
I loved you
I loved you
More than I hate me
I hate me
I hate me

[Chorus]
I loved you
I loved you
I loved you
More than I hate me
I hate me
I hate me

[Chorus]
I loved you
I loved you
I loved you
More than I hate me
I hate me
I hate me

[Chorus]
I loved you
I loved you
I loved you
More than I hate me
I hate me
I hate me

[Verse 1: John Legend]
Fire and the ice colliding, I wanna go deep and dive in
It's heaven on Earth  but hell of a night to melt into one
She's never been afraid of sirens, head down but keep drivin'
Damn we might crash moving so fast but baby

[Chorus: John Legend & Brittany Howard]
Don't stop, I need it
Release me, it's too hard for me to hold
My heart beating, your touch, it thrills me to the bone
Oh Lord, forgive us, honest, we've lost control baby
Nothing can stop this love, nothing can stop this love
Never gon' get enough, nothing can stop it, oh

[Verse 2: Brittany Howard]
Darkness and light, streaming, the end of our life beginning
No longer alone, my will become gone, we melt into one
Both hands on the floor, you go low
Who was I before? I don't know
And who am I now? Your body shows how
The past just has no meaning

[Chorus: John Legend & Brittany Howard]
Don't stop, I need it
Release me, it's too hard for me to hold
My heart bleeding, your touch, it thrills me to the bone
Oh Lord, forgive us, honest, we've lost control baby
Nothing can stop this love, nothing can stop this love
Never gon' get enough, nothing can stop it, oh

[Bridge: John Legend]
Oh yeah, yeah

[Chorus: John Legend & Brittany Howard]
Oh, don't stop, I need it
Release me, it's too hard for me to hold
My heart bleeding, your touch, it thrills me to the bone
Oh Lord, forgive us, honest, we've lost control baby
Nothing can stop this love, nothing can stop this love
Never gon' get enough, nothing can stop it

[Verse 1: John Legend]
Yeah we used to flirt with freedom
'Fore everybody knew our name
We became their favorite secret
Love for love and not for fame
Oh when I was your user your FaceTime abuser
Dose after dose 'til we crashed
Now they bet on our game, say we'll go down in flames
It's too good but we never could last

[Chorus: John Legend  & Miguel]
But oh, we was undercover 'til it overflowed, over exposed
But oh, chained our love together, never took it slow
And now we know, life on overload, love, love...
Don't we always make a show of love , love, love, love, yeah...

[Verse 2: Miguel]
Let that cellphone ring, let that bluebird sing, let that message say unread
Let them talk about us, let them talk too much
While we rule the whole world from our bed

[Chorus: Miguel  & John Legend]
'Cause oh, we was undercover 'til it overflowed, over exposed
Oh, chained our life together, never took it slow
And now we know, life on overload
Don't we always make a show of love
Life on overload, must we make a spectacle of love?

[Bridge: John Legend]
Oh yeah, yeah

[Chorus: John Legend & Miguel]
'Cause oh, we was undercover 'til it overflowed, over exposed
Oh, chained our love together, never took it slow
And now we know, life on overload
Don't we always make a show of love
Life on overload, must we make a spectacle of love?

[Verse 1]
Go from zero to a hundred and up it crazy
Don't believe it when you say that you fuckin' hate me, no
Use your tongue to crucify me, you motivate me, oh I
Throwing down when it ends up with your legs around me
Your legs around me, oh
I rise, you fall, we wreck it all
My pride is at your beck and call

[Chorus]
That's what you do to me
That's what you do to me
That's what you do to me
That's what you do to me
That's what you do, you always do me right
Screaming through the night
Make me love and hate you at the same time
That's what you do to me
That's what you do to me, yeah
That's what you do, you watch me lose my mind
Make me feel like I...
I would die if you were out of my life
That's what you do to me

[Verse 2]
I could stop, I could leave, but no, I don't wanna
It's a mess I'm obsessed with your kind of torture
It's my kind of torture
Oh, I rise, you fall, we wreck it all
You kill me with every kiss and don't you know...

[Chorus]
That's what you do to me
That's what you do to me
That's what you do to me
That's what you do to me
That's what you do, you always do me right
Screaming through the night
Make me love and hate you at the same time
That's what you do to me
That's what you do to me, yeah
That's what you do, you watch me lose my mind
Make me feel like I...
I would die if you were out of my life
That's what you do to me

[Bridge]
I don't know how you take control of me baby
I don't know how you got a hold

[Chorus]
That's what you do to me
That's what you do to me
That's what you do, you always do me right
Screaming through the night
Make me love and hate you at the same time
That's what you do to me
That's what you do, you always do me right
Screaming through the night
(Yeah, that's what you do to me)
Make me love and hate you at....
That's what you do to me, yeah
That's what you do, you watch me lose my mind
Make me feel like I...
I would die if you were out of my life
That's what you do to me
What you do to me
That's what you do to me
What you do to me
Oh, that's what you do, you always do me right
Screaming through the night
Make me love and hate you at the same time, at the same time, at the same time
That's what you do to me
What you do to me
That's what you do to me
That's what you do to me
That's what you do, you watch me lose my mind
Make me feel like I...
I would die if you were out of my life
That's what you do to me

[Verse 1]
Will you live like me, in a world run by desire?
Will you wake from worldly dreams and not be tired?
Will you work like me to lift the conversation higher?
Will you be cool like water putting out the fire?
How can you be free from all this sorrow?
Will the ones you love today be gone tomorrow?

[Chorus 1]
And if angels don't have answers to your prayers
Oh, I will be there, oh I will be there

[Verse 2]
And if who you love don't want your love, well then...
Do you cut a deal with love and run again?
You see, love contains the meaning of despair
Will you think like me? Will you  have your mother's fire?
Maybe the way we are will not be how you're wired
Will we do right by you? Will you have what you require?
To make your days on this Earth be not so dire?

[Chorus 2]
Can you choose to lead if no one follows?
And if we fell today, must you tomorrow?
Sanctify your answer not your prayer
Oh, I will be there, yeah, I will be there
Yeah, I will be there

[Outro]
And even when it all becomes too much
When you're growing old and feeling out of touch
Listen to this song and just take care
And know that I will be there, yeah, I will be there
No, I swear that I will, yeah, I promise I will
Little girl, I'm cryin'

[Chorus]
How long can I survive with this mentality?
How long can I survive with this mentality?
Things fall down, but don’t stop now
Oh, can’t stop now
Oh, won’t stop now

[Verse]
Trials and tribulations I'm facing
In this age of information, I hate this shit
Cause niggas hit my phone when they want some shit
Bitches hit my phone when they want some dick
Damn it, won't be long 'fore I disappear
Damn it, won't be long 'fore I disappear
Damn it, won't be long 'fore I disappear
Damn it, won't be long 'fore I disappear
You call it runnin', I call it escapin'
Start a new life in a foreign location
Similar to my niggas duckin' cases
Can't take the possible time that he faces

[Chorus]
How long can I survive with this mentality?
How long can I survive with this mentality?
Things fall down, but don’t stop now
Oh, can’t stop now
Oh, won’t stop now

[Interlude]
My dad, he died—he got shot 'cause his friend set him up. And I didn't go to his funeral—and sometimes when I'm in my room, I get mad at my momma when she mean to me. And she—
And she say, "clean up"—I say—

[Bridge]
Nigga play me, never, give up my chain, never
Give up my pride, never, show 'em my pain, never
Dirt on my name, never, dirt on my name, never
Dirt on my name, never, dirt on my name, never
Nigga play me, never, give up my chain, never
Give up my pride, never, show 'em my pain, never
Dirt on my name, never, dirt on my name, never
Dirt on my name, never, dirt on my name, never

[Chorus]
How long can I survive with this mentality?
How long can I survive with this mentality?
Things fall down, but don’t stop now
Oh, can’t stop now
Oh, won’t stop now

[Outro]
I get mad and I slam my door and go in my room—
And then, I get mad and I say, "I wish my dad was here"

[Chorus]
That's what you do to me

And grow in his favor
Say yeah (yeah)

[Verse 1]
Yes, we can
Yours and mine, alchemy
Yes, we can
Are one and one equals three
Yes, we can
I feel it like lightning in the forest
Yes, we can
And they can know to pick a note to harmonize a chorus

[Pre-Chorus]
You're my woman, don't need another
Get behind the other, we can lift each other
Tornado weather, we another level

[Chorus]
Don't you know that we're able?

You ain't ever heard
You ain't ever heard oh
You ain't ever heard
You ain't ever heard oh
You ain't ever heard no
You ain't ever heard oh
You ain't ever heard no

You can never feel this feel I'm feeling till you take a motherfucking flight
You ain't ever heard about these bitches till these bitches met a nigga, right?
I'm the boss, the boss, I'm drippin sauce a nigga diamonds wet like I dun cried
Fuck the cost she got the paper -

She fuck me I swear just like dumb
Cook it all white like a dove
I'll send him to the sky like a dove
Thug are you rich nigga, duh
You used to hit licks nigga, duh
Would you turn up on this nigga, duh

[Intro]
Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this
Be like this, be like this
Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this

[Verse 1]
Yeah, life is a balance
You lose your grip, you can slip into an abyss
No doubt, you see these niggas trippin'
Ego in charge of every move, he's a star
And we can't look away due to the days that he caught our hearts
He's fallin' apart, but we deny it
Justifying that half ass shit he dropped, we always buy it
When he tell us he a genius but it's clearer lately
It's been hard for him to look into the mirror lately
There was a time when this nigga was my hero, maybe
That's the reason why his fall from grace is hard to take
'Cause I believed him when he said his shit was purer and he
The type of nigga swear he real but all around him's fake
The women, the dickriders, you know, the yes men
Nobody with the balls to say somethin' to contest him
So he grows out of control
Into the person that he truly was all along, it's startin' to show
Damn, wonder what happened
Maybe it's my fault for idolizin' niggas
Based off the words they be rappin'
But come to find out, these niggas don't even write they shit
Hear some new style bubblin' up, then they bite this shit
Damn, that's what I get for lyin' to myself
Well, fuck it, what's more important is he's cryin' out for help
While the world's eggin' him on, I'm beggin' him to stop it
Playin' his old shit, knowin' he won't top it
False prophets

[Chorus]
Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this
Be like this, be like this
Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this
False prophets (La-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la…)
Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this
Be like this, be like this
Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this
Yeah, false prophets

[Verse 2]
I got a homie, he a rapper and he wanna win bad
He want the fame, the acclaim, the respect that's been had
By all the legends, so every time I see him, he stressin'
Talkin' 'bout, niggas don't fuck with him, this shit is depressin'
And I know he so bitter he can't see his own blessings
Goddamn, nigga, you too blind to see you got fans, nigga
And a platform to make a classic rap song
To change a nigga's life, but you too anxious livin' life
Always worried 'bout the critics who ain't ever fuckin' did it
I write what's in my heart, don't give a fuck who fuckin' with it
But in a sense I can relate, the need to be great
Turns into an obsession and keeps a nigga up late
Writin' words, hopin' people observe the dedication
That stirs in you constantly, but intentions get blurred
Do I do it for the love of the music or is there more to me?
Do I want these niggas to worship me?
False prophets

[Chorus]
Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this
Be like this, be like this
Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this, be like this
False prophets (La-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la…)
Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this
Be like this, be like this
Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this
Yeah, false prophets

[Verse 3]
These rappers insecure
They talk about being a man so much
I finally understand that they ain't even sure
'Bout who they are and why they do this
Guess I'm included in that category as a nigga who done had the glory
My highest moments come from tellin' all the saddest stories
I've seen in my life, I be fiendin' to write
Songs that raise the hair on my arms
My lowest moments came from tryin' too hard
To impress some niggas that couldn't care if I'm on
Therefore from here on out, my hair grow out
I care nothin' 'bout opinions
I wanna give hope like the fountains you throw pennies in
Hit the store, take your diss, make your wish
This is dedicated to the ones that listen to me on some faithful shit
I'm on some thankful shit
But the real God is in you, not the music you coppin'
I hear my old shit and know I can top it
False prophets

[Chorus]
Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this
Be like this, be like this
Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this, be like this
False prophets (La-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la…)
Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this
Be like this, be like this
Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this
Yeah, false prophets

[Intro]
Yeah, we back
Back in Mohammad crib, nigga, top floor
The back room with just the one little small window, nigga
The light be comin' through it in the morning
Old-ass walls and shit
But it's just like I remember, just like I wanted it
Yeah, I'm workin'
Yeah, I'm workin', nigga

[Verse]
Look, it's the return of the Mr. Burn Suckers
Not herpes infested, just perfectly blessed with
A style that you can't F with, protection recommended
‘Cause Cole the definition of a weapon that can end it
You know, mass destruction when I mash the button
I take your favorite major rapper, left him independent
Cryin' in the corner
‘Cause I ain't into sorta kinda, dissin' niggas
I'm borderline addicted to slaughter
Line up niggas in order
Of who you think can really fuck with me most
Then I tuck the heat close, if he don't duck then he ghost
Ain't no need for discussion
If they weren't talkin' 'bout the bread these motherfuckers be toast
Clap at the fake deep rappers
The OG gatekeep rappers
The would-you-take-a-break-please rappers
Bunch of words and ain't sayin' shit, I hate these rappers
Especially the amateur eight week rappers
Lil' whatever – just another short bus rapper
Fake drug dealers turn tour bus trappers
Napoleon complex, you this tall rappers
Get exposed standin' next to 6'4" rappers
The streets don't fuck with you, you Pitchfork rappers
Chosen by the white man, you hit store rappers
I reload the clip, then I hit more rappers with that
Straight shittin' on these piss-poor rappers, I'm back
Never knew a nigga that was better
Revenue, I'm good at gettin' cheddar
Reminisce on days I didn't eat
If it's meant to be, then it'll be
If it's not, then fuck it, I'ma try
Ain't no need to ask the Father why, no
‘Cause one day everybody gotta die
One day everybody gotta die, oh
One day everybody gotta die
One day everybody gotta die, my nigga, my nigga

[Verse 1]
Leave behind
Just too delicate to
The time we had discovered it
Things; they seem different
In my mind, we were experimenting

[Chorus]
Life
Passes on the right
Still life
Takes you for a ride

[Guitar Interlude]

[Verse 2]
Ohh, ahh
Ohh, ohh
Ohh, ohh, ohh, ohh
Ohh
I just like to take a look for a while
It's such a pretty picture

[Chorus]
Life
Passes on the right
Still life
Takes you for a ride

[Intro]
Awwwww...haha

[Verse 1]
Now I was barely seventeen with a pocket full of hope
Screamin' "dollar and a dream" with my closet lookin' broke
And my nigga's lookin' clean, gettin' caught up with that dope
Have you ever served a fiend with a pocket full of soap?
Nigga I can tell you things that you probably shouldn't know
Have you ever heard the screams when the body hit the floor?
Flashbacks to the pain, wakin' up, cold sweats
Six o'clock in the mornin', gotta hit the BowFlex
Get my weight up on the block, keep watch for the cops
God they love to serve a nigga three hots and a cot
Nowadays crime pays like a part time job
And the drought got me prayin' for a Carl Thom vibe
Summer Rain come again
Numb the pain 'cause it's hard for a felon
In my mind I been cryin', know it's wrong but I'm sellin'
Eyes wellin' up with tears
Thinkin' 'bout my niggas dead in the dirt
Immortalized on this shirt

[Chorus]
Real niggas don't die
Forward with the plot
One-Seven-Forty-Five
Form at the plot
Real niggas don't die
Form on the block
Real niggas don't lie
Form in the plot
My niggas don't die
Form on the block
Real niggas don't die
Form on the block
Real niggas don't die
Real niggas don't die

[Verse 2]
Have you ever seen a fiend cook crack on the spoon?
Have you ever seen a nigga that was black on the moon?
Have you ever seen your brother go to prison as you cry?
Have you ever seen a motherfuckin' ribbon in the sky?
Nope, all I see is that C.R.E.A.M nigga, that green
I'm a black king, black jeans on my black queen
And her ass fat, too fat for a flat screen
I'm the type of nigga make the whole fuckin' trap lean
Kingpin nigga, put wings on a crack fiend
If they want a nigga, they gon' have to send a SWAT team
And I'm goin' out like Scarface in his last scene
A legend, what that mean—?

[Chorus]
Real niggas don't die
Forward with the plot
One-Seven-Forty-Five
Form at the plot
Real niggas don't die
Form on the block
Hood niggas don't lie
Form in the plot
My niggas don't die
Form on the block
Real niggas don't die
Form on the block
Real niggas don't die
Real niggas don't die

[Outro]
To die a young legend or live a long life unfulfilled
'Cause you wanna change the world, but while alive you never will
'Cause they only feel you after you gone, or I've been told
And now I'm caught between bein' heard and gettin' old
Damn, death creepin' in my thoughts lately
My one wish in this bitch, "Make it quick if the Lord take me"
I know nobody meant to live forever anyway
And so I hustle like my niggas in Virgini-A
They tellin' niggas, "sell dope, rap or go to NBA"
In that order, it's that sort of thinkin'
That been keepin' niggas chained at the bottom and hanged
The strangest fruit that you ever seen, ripe with pain, listen...
I want to see something that used to be in your eyes again
I'm waiting to see it
You know it's only a question of when
And I know how much I'm missing heaven
You know that its missing

And only you know
Where you have been to
Only you know
What you have been through
There's better things
You're gonna get into
And I wanna be there too

I know it's not easy for you to start to believe again
And when the day comes, don't let yourself be deceived again
Cause I know, how you've been waiting
Such a long time, that you've been waiting

And only you know
Where you have been to
Only you know
What you have been through
There's better things
You're gonna get into
And I wanna be there too
And I know how you've been waiting
Such a long time that you've been waiting

And only you know
Where you have been to
Only you know
What you have been through
There's better things
You're gonna get into
And I wanna be there too
Up from the pastures of boredom
Out from the sea of discontent
They come in packs like hungry hounds
Up seekers of the dark enchantment

They haunt the boulevards and bars
They pray to wishing wells and stars
They ride the hurricane of hope
Not looking back, but on they go
Toward the distance and deceiving
And all the while they keep believing
They are special and apart
The lovers, the lovers of the heart... the lovers

And when they pair off two by two
They feel they are the chosen few
And though their beds are made of straw
They feel like velvet in the night
And so the night is never ending
Its made of distance and pretending
Coz they're special and apart
The lovers, the lovers of the heart... the lovers
And when love goes away
And when love goes...
Goodbye...
Catches in their throats like cotton
Rises in their hearts like rain
The good times suddenly are all forgotten
The hunt begins again

They search the subways and the streets
Their faces tired, like their feet
Their bodies aching to be warm
And so they hide behind the moon
Their loneliness inside them growing
But they take comfort in just knowing
That they are special and apart
The lovers, the lovers of the heart... the lovers

And when love comes again
And when love comes
Hello...
Rises from their throats like singing
Catches in their hearts like wind
The good things
Strangers in their arms are bringing
Makes life all right again
They turn their faces to the light
No longer hiding in the night
So unashamed and unafraid
That they can face each others faults
And though the waltz will have its ending
There is no harm in just pretending
That they are special and apart
The lovers, the lovers of the heart... the lovers

[Intro]

[?], he on the track

Suckin' dick for a Ferrari, don't forget to lick the balls
Tell Young Metro don't trust me, tell my jeweler don't rush me
'Cause shit can get ugly, yeah, this nigga ugly

[Verse]
My bitch hot, tamale, hard

Nothin' but a whole lotta space, nigga
Question, 'cause I got a question
Will these new niggas this year still be around next year?
Got you a new chain, now you wanna diss a made man
My wrist talk like Puffy, hit you niggas with the mace dance
It's shiny suit time, brand new coupe time
The money fold up, stackin' foutons
Diamond coutons, barely two-tone
The pussy cracked, yeah, I hit it two times (Woo)
I'm just flexin' on a fuck-nigga (Fuck-nigga)
I'ma fuck my bitch soon as I'm done with ya (T-Raw)

Young Savage, why you reachin' so hard?
Why these niggas be T-Raw?
Why you got one car in a twelve car garage?
Suckin' dick for a Ferrari, don't forget to lick the balls (21)

[Snippet]
(Let me live, let me live, let me live)
Peak in my life, check if you like just what you see
Though you might disagree with my plight
This shit that I write is just like therapeutic for me
There's no shooters for me
Just some niggas that wanna prove to me they down
I rarely bring 'em 'round, cause they still stuck in their ways
Mindstate still the same
Can't help nobody till they ready to change
But I don't give up, I'll be here waiting for you the day you decide that you'll no longer be a slave to your pride
Until then, keep your head on a swivel
For my niggas that dibble, dabble in street life
Hopin' to get a nibble of American pie, equality
An arrogant lie
Told louder by the people that hold power
Listen, this is a setup
I know you feel the rush that niggas get when dollars switch hands
And you can say you got your bread up
But don't be short sighted
See, it's a war that's goin' on outside
Nigga, you got to know about this shit to fight it
I wanna help you through
I'm on the road to sanity with all humanity behind us
Hope they comin' too
These words I spoke are nothin' new
There's nothin' that I 

[...]
There's nothin' that you cannot do
The truth is right aside of you
Through troubled waters just canoe
Have faith for something greater than to guide you through
These words are for all, me and you

[Verse 1]
It could be a black dress
High heels
Ripped up, torn up Lucky jeans
Or the covers in the morning
Her boyshorts and my favorite tee
Unbuttoned flannel layin' on the floor
Lingerie hangin' on the back of the door
I swear it don't matter what it is

[Chorus]
She puts it on like it was made for her
The kind of thing you can't teach or learn
She puts it on on a Friday night
Everything she does, she does just right
It won't take long 'til you can't say no
She walks in she's gonna steal the show
She puts it on and on and on and on
'Cause she knows she can pull it off
Aw, yeah

[Verse 2]
The way she wears my flatbill way better than me
Got me wanting everything underneath
Those blue eyes lookin' back at me
Looks like that can change everything
I swear

[Chorus]
She puts it on like it was made for her
The kind of thing you can't teach or learn
She puts it on on a Friday night
Everything she does, she does just right
It won't take long 'til you can't say no
She walks in she's gonna steal the show
She puts it on and on and on and on
'Cause she knows she can pull it off, woo
Yeah, she knows she can pull it off

[Bridge]
Unbuttoned flannel layin' on the floor
Lingerie hangin' on the back of the door
I swear it don't matter what it is

[Chorus]
She puts it on like it was made for her
The kind of thing you don't teach or learn
She puts it on on a Friday night
Everything she does, she does it right
It won't take long 'til you can't say no
She walks in she's gonna steal the show
She puts it on and on and on and on
'Cause she knows she can pull it off, woo
Yeah, she knows she can pull it off
'Cause she knows she can pull it off
Yeah, she puts it on and on and on and on
'Cause she knows she can pull it off

[Verse 1]
A cement building
White cinderblocks
And faded red letters
The sign read "Cold Spot"
He worked behind the counter
To them, he was an old man
When my world was crumbling
My grandpa gave me his hand

[Chorus]
It was crickets, minnows, and kerosene
RC, MoonPies, and a softball team
Learned about life, learned about girls
Learned about livin' in this cold, cruel world
It's where you bought your tag for your white-tailed deer
Where the Southern baptist bought the most beer
A hole in the wall with holes in the wall
From behind this counter, you saw it all
At the Cold Spot

[Verse 2]
It was cool in July
Warm in December
If I live a hundred years
I'll always remember
The song and the hum to that old ceiling fan
And his north Georgia voice saying, "Buddy, you can"
Out here, I'm just a kid trying to make a name
I am who I am because he raised Kane

[Chorus]
Selling crickets, minnows, and kerosene
RC, MoonPies, and a softball team
Learned about life, learned about girls
Learned about livin' in this cold, cruel world
It's where you bought your tag for your white-tailed deer
Where the Southern baptist bought the most beer
A hole in the wall with holes in the wall
From behind this counter, you saw it all
At the Cold Spot
Oh yeah
At the Cold Spot

[Chorus]
It was crickets, minnows, and kerosene
RC, MoonPies and a softball team
Learned about life, learned about girls
Learned about livin' in this cold, cruel world
It was Heaven on Earth when my world was Hell
And the big stores came and the business failed
But all my memories are alive and well
At the Cold Spot
Oh yeah
At the Cold Spot
Take me back to the Cold Spot

[Verse 1]
Six months passed since we both said goodbye
Never thought that I'd run into you here tonight
And I can't ever think your smile's the same as it was
Back when I saw you every day
I probably shouldn't say it
What I'm about to say

[Chorus]
We could make a comeback if you come back
We were on top of the world, people wanted what we had
We could have it again don't you know that
We could make a comeback if you come back

[Verse 2]
You haven't stopped me yet so I guess I'll keep going on
Oh, and I haven't even deleted your number from my phone
I've been wanting to call you every single day
But I couldn't think how to rephrase everything
So just tell me, babe
If you feel the same way

[Chorus]
We could make a comeback if you come back
We were on top of the world
People wanted what we had
We could have it again don't you know that
We could make a comeback if you come back

[Bridge]
(Come back)
(Come back)
(Come back)
(Come back)
(Come back)
(Come back)
(Come back)
(Come back)

[Chorus]
We could make a comeback if you just come back
We could make a comeback if you come back
We were on top of the world, people wanted what we had
We could have it again don't you know that
We could make a comeback if you come back

[Bridge]
(Come back)
(Come back)
Come back
(Come back)
(Come back)
(Come back)
Come back
(Come back)

[Outro]
Six months passed since we both said goodbye

[Verse 1]
We take a drive just to sing along
To every word of them Rolling Stones
Stacy's mom had it going on
Lived three doors down, I can see her now
Her daughter had a heart that was wild and free
If you Blink-182, then you'd miss me and her
Every verse had a story
Yeah, them pocket lighter nights lit up our days of glory

[Chorus]
Back when the air guitars were the only sound
And you'd strum the chords and I'd put the pedal down
Two-man dashboard band rollin' through this town
Had that rearview shakin' to the kick-drum beat
Leaning West Coast deep in the bucket seats
All I ever wanted was right there in that car
Back when we were rockstars
(Yeah, we were runnin' all night, chasing down a dream)
(Howling at the moon, baby, you and me)
Back when we were rockstars
(We were runnin' all night, chasing down a dream)
(Howling at the moon, baby, you and me)

[Verse 2]
Nothin' like freedom two windows down
You singin' along, still hear it now
Way too loud and sometimes off key
But you sounded like an angel to me
You'd make fun of how I threw my head
And threw my fingers up in the air
Thought I was Kurt Cobain or Jimmy Page
You were side seat, center stage

[Chorus]
Back when the air guitars were the only sound
And you'd strum the chords and I'd put the pedal down
Two-man dashboard band rollin' through this town
Had that rearview shakin' to the kick-drum beat
Leaning West Coast deep in the bucket seats
All I ever wanted was right there in that car
Back when we were rockstars
Back when we were rockstars

[Bridge]
We never ended up on MTV
Or heard our voices on a CD
But in your eyes and in my arms
We were each other's rockstars

[Chorus]
Back when the air guitars were the only sound
And you'd strum the chords and I'd put the pedal down
Two-man dashboard band rollin' through this town
Had that rearview shakin' to the kick-drum beat
Leaning West Coast deep in the bucket seats
All I ever wanted was right there in that car
Back when we were rockstars
(Yeah, we were runnin' all night, chasing down a dream)
(Howling at the moon, baby, you and me)
Yeah, back when we were rockstars
(We were runnin' all night, chasing down a dream)
(Howling at the moon, baby, you and me)
Back when we were rockstars
(We were runnin' all night, chasing down a dream)
(Howling at the moon, baby, you and me)
You and me were rockstars
(We were runnin' all night, chasing down a dream)
(Howling at the moon, baby, you and me) Oh yeah
(Runnin' all night, chasing down a dream)

[Outro]
Yeah, we were runnin' all night, chasing down a dream
Howling at the moon, baby, you and me

[Verse 1]
Baby, if your dream is forty acres and a house
Porch going all the way around
I'ma buy it
Or if you'd rather see
City lights and a crowd

[Pre-Chorus]
I'ma move you uptown
It don't matter to me
Nah, it don't girl
Baby, I can see me livin' anywhere with you, so

[Chorus]
'Til the sky falls and the good Lord calls us up
You're the only girl I wanna love
'Til I'm pushing up daisies
Wanna stare into your green eyes, baby
'Til we're hand-in-hand walking down them streets of gold
Six feet below, you know
I'm gonna make your world a better place
'Til we're both in a better place

[Verse 2]
If all you wanna wear is faded blue jeans and a tee
Well, baby, that's fine with me
You look good in anything
Aw, but girl I swear
If you wanna hit the town in a dress, turn a few heads
I ain't gonna stop you
Baby, I got you, oh

[Chorus]
'Til the sky falls and the good Lord calls us up
You're the only girl I wanna love
'Til I'm pushing up daisies
Wanna stare into your green eyes, baby
'Til we're hand-in-hand walking down them streets of gold
Six feet below, you know
I'm gonna make your world a better place
'Til we're both in a better place

[Bridge]
Every night, every day
You're my everything
'Til we fade away

[Chorus]
'Til the sky falls and the good Lord calls us up
You're the only girl I wanna love
'Til I'm pushing up daisies
Wanna stare into your green eyes, baby
'Til we're hand-in-hand walking down them streets of gold
Six feet below, you know
I'm gonna make your world a better place
'Til we're both in a better place

[Outro]
(Woo)
'Til we're both in a better place
(C'mon)
It's a better place girl

[Verse 1]
I remember you in that rocking chair
I was in my boots and my underwear
Playing rodeo all night long
You used to count 'til it hit eight seconds
When you hit sixty's the time you left us
But you're in my heart, so I'll never be alone
I know you're watching over me

[Chorus]
I hope one day I'll be the man you used to be
Quick to love and slow to anger
No, you never met a stranger
I hope one day when you're looking down on me
I make you smile, I make you proud
I may not be there now
But I hope one day I'll be man enough to be sitting there
In my granddaddy's chair

[Verse 2]
You were eight track, tapes, and Conway Twitty
Road trip with Nana to Panama City
Everybody knew she was your girl
You taught me love, you taught me living
Cars and jokes and good catfishing
I gave you hell and you gave me the world
I'm sure missing you right now

[Chorus]
I hope one day I'll be the man you used to be
Quick to love and slow to anger
No, you never met a stranger
I hope one day when you're looking down on me
I make you smile, I make you proud
I may not be there now
But I hope one day I'll be man enough to be sitting there
In my granddaddy's chair
My granddaddy's chair

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Yeah, I hope one day when you're looking down on me
I make you smile, I make you proud
I may not be there now
But I hope one day I'll be man enough to be sitting there
In my granddaddy's chair
Oh, yeah
In my granddaddy's chair

[Outro]
Rest in peace, I love you, granddaddy

[Verse 1: Kane Brown]
You say, "What if I hurt you? What if I leave you?
What if I find somebody else and I don't need you?
What if this goes south? What if I mess you up?"
You say, "What if I break your heart in two, then what?"

[Pre-Chorus: Kane Brown]
Well, I hear you, girl, I feel you, girl, but not so fast
Before you make your mind up, I gotta ask

[Chorus: Kane Brown & Lauren Alaina]
What if I was made for you and you were made for me?
What if this is it? What if it's meant to be?
What if I ain't one of them fools just playin' some game?
What if I just pull you close? What if I lean in
And the stars line up and it's our last first kiss?
What if one of these days, baby, I go and change your name?
What if I loved all these what ifs away?

[Verse 2: Kane Brown & Lauren Alaina]
What if the sky falls (Sky falls)
Or the sun stops burnin'?
We could worry about them what ifs 'til the world stops turnin'
Or I could kiss you (You should kiss me)
What if you liked it? (Bet I'd like it)
Well, we ain't never gonna know unless we try it

[Chorus: Kane Brown & Lauren Alaina, Kane Brown]
What if I was made for you and you were made for me?
What if this is it? What if it's meant to be?
What if I ain't one of them fools just playin' some game?
What if I just pull you close? What if I lean in
And the stars line up and it's our last first kiss?
What if one of these days, baby, I go and change your name?
What if I loved all these what ifs away?
Aw, yeah
Come on

[Bridge: Kane Brown]
You say, "What if I hurt you? What if I leave you?
What if I find somebody else and I don't need you?"
Damn

[Chorus: Kane Brown & Lauren Alaina]
What if I was made for you and you were made for me?
What if this is it? What if it's meant to be?
What if I ain't one of them fools just playin' some game?
Yeah, what if I just pull you close? What if I lean in
And the stars line up and it's our last first kiss?
What if one of these days, baby, I go and change your name?
What if I loved all these what ifs away?

[Outro: Kane Brown & Lauren Alaina]
Away (Away)
What if?

[Intro]
Huh, ayy, put a finger in the sky if you want it, nigga
Ayy, put two fingers in the sky if you want her
Ayy, put a finger in the sky if you want it, nigga
Ayy, put two fingers in the sky if you want her
Ayy, put a finger in the sky if you want it, nigga
Ayy, put two fingers in the sky if you want her
Ayy, put a finger in the sky if you want it, nigga
Ayy, put two fingers in the sky if you want her

[Verse 1]
Sometimes you worry 'bout the things he can provide for ya
Whenever you around I seem to come alive for ya
I finally recognize the feelings that's inside for ya
Although I know your man and trust me he would die for ya
These quiet thoughts of you been going on for years now
I saw you in the party, soft lips, soft-spoken
I came and talked to you but homie interfered now
He introduced you as his girl and I was heartbroken
Some people talk about that love at first sight shit
To keep it real I don't know whether I believe it's true
But if it is then tell me if I'm wrong or right if
I fell in love with you before I ever even knew
I catch your eye then look away as if it never happened
At times I feel as though I'm caught up in a strange dream
If eyes could talk then mines would tell ya that I'm feeling you
Sometimes I swear your eyes be telling me the same thing

[Pre-Chorus]
She fuck with small-town niggas, I got bigger dreams (Bigger dream)
She fuck with small-town niggas, I got bigger dream (Bigger dream), hm listen
She fuck with small-town niggas, I got bigger dreams (Bigger dream)
She fuck with small-town niggas, I got bigger dream (Bigger dream), listen

[Chorus]
Club jumping, don't stop, off top
But you know we only go 'til 2 o'clock
Put yo motherfuckin' hood up, it's the weekend
Drop that, back that ass up and bitches get to freaking
Last call at the bar, ladies get a drink, nigga get some balls
Ain't no telling you gonna see that bitch tomorrow
Stop holding up the wall waiting for the right song
Better holla 'cause you know they 'bout to cut the lights on

[Verse 2]
And put my number in it—
I'm staring at you from afar
I'm wondering 'bout you, like where you from and who you are
'Cause you a star, no, not the type that snort the white lines
I mean the type that light the night time, I heard you got a man
But who in their right mind letting you out the house alone?
Tell me is your house a home?
Why you in the club looking like you out to zone?
Now be discreet and pull out your phone and put my number in it
Text a nigga when your man leave you unattended
On a scale from 1 to 10 that girl's a hundred and I want it
No question, I know destiny well
And though I sin the Lord blessing me still
Every saint got a past, every sinner got a future
Every loser gotta win and every winner gotta lose someday
They say it's just a matter of time
And if I had my way then you would be mine, huh

[Pre-Chorus]
She fuck with small-town niggas, I got bigger dreams (Bigger dream), yeah
She fuck with small-town niggas, I got bigger dream (Bigger dream), hm listen
She fuck with small-town niggas, I got bigger dreams (Bigger dream)
She fuck with small-town niggas, I got bigger dream (Bigger dream)

[Chorus]
Club jumping, don't stop, off top
But you know we only go 'til 2 o'clock
Put yo motherfuckin' hood up, it's the weekend
Drop that, back that ass up and bitches get to freaking
Last call at the bar, ladies get a drink, nigga get some balls
Ain't no telling you gonna see that bitch tomorrow
Stop holding up the wall waiting for the right song
Better holla 'cause you know they 'bout to cut the lights on

[Bridge]
I know you were made for me but
Darling don't you wait for me 'cause
I can see the promised land but
I can't do no promisin'
I know you were made for me but
Darling don't you wait for me 'cause
I can see the promised land but
I can't do no promisin'

[Outro]
Ayy, put a finger in the sky if you want it, nigga
Ayy, put two fingers in the sky if you want her
Ayy, put a finger in the sky if you want it, nigga
Ayy, put two fingers in the sky if you want her
Ayy, put a finger in the sky if you want it, nigga
Ayy, put two fingers in the sky if you want her
Ayy, put a finger in the sky if you want it, nigga
Ayy, put two fingers in the sky if you want her

[Intro]
I guess the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope, sellin' dope
Okay, the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope,  sellin' dope
Sellin' dope, sellin' dope, sellin' dope

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I don't want no picture with the president
I just wanna talk to the man
Speak for the boys in the bando
And my nigga never walkin' again
'pologize if I'm harpin' again
I know these things happen often
But I'm back on the scene
I was lost in a dream
As I write this, the team down in Austin
I been buildin' me a house
Back home in the South, ma
Won't believe what it's costin'
And it's fit for a king, right?
Or a nigga that could sing
And explain all the pain that it cost him
My sixteen should've came with a coffin
Fuck the fame and the fortune
Well, maybe not the fortune
But one thing is for sure though
The fame is exhaustin'
That's why I moved away, I needed privacy
Surrounded by the trees and Ivy League
Students that's recruited highly
Thinkin' "You do you and I do me"
Crib has got a big 'ol back 'ol yard
My niggas stand outside and pass cigars
Filled with marijuana, laughin' hard
Thankful that they friend's a platinum star
In the driveway there's no rapper cars
Just some shit to get from back and forth
Just some shit to get from back and forth
Welcome to the Sheltuh, this is pure
We'll help you if you've felt too insecure
To be the star you always knew you were
Wait, I think police is at the door

[Chorus]
Okay, the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope
Hm, I guess the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope, sellin' dope
The neighbors think I'm—neighbors think I'm—
(Don't follow me, don't follow me...)
I think the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope
(Don't follow me, don't follow me...)
I guess the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope, sellin' dope
Sellin' dope, sellin' dope, sellin' dope
Well, motherfucker, I am

[Verse 2]
Some things you can't escape:
Death, taxes, and a ra-
-cist society that make
Every nigga feel like a candidate
For a Trayvon kinda fate
Even when your crib sit on a lake
Even when your plaques hang on a wall
Even when the president jam your tape
Took a little break just to annotate
How I feel, damn, it's late
I can't sleep cause I'm paranoid
Black in a white man territory
Cops bust in with the army guns
No evidence of the harm we done
Just a couple neighbors that assume we slang
Only time they see us we be on the news, in chains, damn

[Bridge]
Don't follow me
Don't follow me
Don't follow me
Don't follow me

[Chorus]
Okay, the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope
Hm, I guess the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope, sellin' dope
The neighbors think I'm...neighbors think I'm—
(Don't follow me, don't follow me...)
I think the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope
(Don't follow me, don't follow me...)
I guess the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope, sellin' dope
Sellin' dope, sellin' dope, sellin' dope
Well motherfucker, I am

[Outro]
I am, I am, I am, I am
Well, motherfucker, I am
I think the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope
I am, I am, I am
Well, motherfucker, I am
So much for integration
Don't know what I was thinkin'
I'm movin' back to south side
So much for integration
Don't know what I was thinkin'
I'm movin' back to south side

[Intro: J. Cole]
Yeah (For your eyes)
For your eyes only (For your eyes)
For your eyes only, for your eyes only
(For your eyes, for your eyes)
For your eyes only

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Hey, niggas be dying on the daily
It seems my dreams faded for far too long
The consequences deadly
Can't visualize myself as nothing but a criminal
Control the block, serving up rocks and stay subliminal
'Cause young niggas is hardheaded, they letting off
Full of adrenaline, ignorant to what death can cause
Ain't no coming back, family dressed in black
Plus it's hot now, the cops outside, it's hard to flip a pack
And my daughter gotta eat, her mama be stressing me
Like I ain't the one who put them Jays on her feet
Like I ain't out in the field like that
I might be low for the moment but I will bounce back
Despite the charges, back to the wall, I fight regardless
Screaming, "Fuck the law," my life is lawless
That's what you call it, ain't got to be no psychic
To see this is like the farthest thing from heaven
This is hell and I don't mean that hyperbolic
I try to find employment even if it's wiping toilets
But these felonies be making life the hardest
Resisting the temptation to run up and swipe a wallet
Or run up on your yard, snatch your daughter bike and pawn it
That's why I write this sonnet
If the pressure get too much for me to take and I break
Play this tape for my daughter and let her know my life is on it
(For your eyes) Let her know my life is on it
(For your eyes) For your eyes only

[Chorus: J. Cole]
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes, do you understand me?
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes, do you understand me?
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes, do you understand me?
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes only

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
You probably grown now so this song'll hit you
If you hearing this, unfortunately means
That I'm no longer with you in the physical
Not even sure if I believe in God but because you still alive
He got me praying that the spiritual is real
So I can be a part of you still, my pops was killed too
So I know how part of you feels
Maybe you hate me, maybe you miss me, maybe you spite me
Life goes in cycles, maybe you'll date a nigga just like me
I hope not, I'm tired of dope spots
And fiends that smoke rocks
I've seen far too many niggas' hopes rot
I'm writing this because me and the devil had a dance
Now I see death around the corner, 'pologizing in advance
Don't know if I ever had a chance
At a glance, I'm a failure
Addicted to pushing paraphernalia
But Daddy had dreams once, my eyes had a gleam once
Innocence disappeared by the age of eight years
My Pops shot up, drug-related, mama addicted
So Granny raised me in projects where thugs was hanging
Blood was staining the concrete
Older niggas I loved talked like they was above
Maintaining a timesheet, that's slow money
Picked up the family business by the age of 13
Six years later was handed sentence
'Round the same time is when you came in this world
Me and your mama thinking:
"What the fuck we naming this girl?"
I told her "Nina," the prettiest name that I could think of
For the prettiest thing my eyes had ever seen, I was 19
Took me two felonies to see the trap
This crooked-ass system set for me
And now I fear it's too late for me to ever be
The one that set examples that was never set for me
I'm living fast, but not fast enough
'Cause karma keeps on catching up to me
And if my past becomes the death of me
I hope you understand

[Chorus: J. Cole]
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes, do you understand me?
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes, do you understand me?
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes, do you understand me?
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes only

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
It's several ways I could've went out, too many to count
Was it the trigger happy crackers that the badges give clout?
Was it the young niggas, blasting frustrated
'Cause the cash running out?
Niggas don't know how to act in a drought
See, baby girl, I realized
My definition of a real nigga was skewed
My views misshaped by new mixtapes
That confirmed the shit I learned in the streets was true
That real niggas don't speak when they beef with you
They just pull up on your street, let the heat achoo
And if a real nigga hungry, he gon' eat your food
I was a fool, spent all my time ducking school, ducking cops
Ducking rules, hugging blocks that don't love you
I pray you find a nigga with goals and point of views
Much broader than the corner, if not it's gon' corner you
Into a box, where your son don't even know his pops
And the cyclical nature of doing time continues
My worst fear is one day that you come home from school
And see your father face while hearing 'bout tragedy on news
I got the strangest feeling your daddy gonna lose his life soon
And sadly if you're listening now it must mean it's true
But maybe there's a chance that it's not
And this album remains locked
In a hard drive like valuable jewels
And I can teach you this in person
Like I'm teaching you to tie your own shoes
I love you and I hope to God I don't lose you
For your eyes only

[Chorus: CharGaux & J. Cole]
For your eyes, for your eyes only
For your eyes, for your eyes only
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes only

[Verse 4: J. Cole]
One day your daddy called me, told me he had a funny feeling
What he'd been dealing with lately, he wasn't telling
I tried to pick his brains, still he wasn't revealing
But I could feel the sense of panic in his voice
And it was chilling, he said:
"Jermaine, I knew you since we was children
I never asked for nothing, when times was hard
I never had discussions with you, begging you to help me
I dealt with the repercussions of my actions
I know you tried to steer me 'way from that shit
But that shit was in my blood, you know my life
I know your momma, nigga, send my love
In case I never get a chance to speak again
I won't forget the weekends spent sleeping at your crib
That's the way I wished my family lived
But my granny crib was in the 'jects"
I had to interject like:
"Nigga, what you talking 'bout? Fuck is you getting at?"
He said, "Listen, I got no time to dive into descriptions
But I been having premonitions
Just call it visions from the other side
I got a feeling I won't see tomorrow
Like the time I'm living on is borrowed
With that said, the only thing I'm proud to say, I was a father
Write my story down, and if I pass
Go play it for my daughter when she ready"
And so I'm leaving you this record, for your eyes only
Don't you ever scratch or disrespect it
This perspective is a real one, another lost 'Ville son
I dedicate these words to you and all the other children
Affected by the mass incarceration in this nation
That sent your pops to prison when he needed education
Sometimes I think that segregation would've done us better
Although I know that means that I would never
Be brought into this world 'cause my daddy was so thrilled
When he found him a white girl to take back to Jonesboro
With lil' Zach and Cole World, barely one years old
Now it's 30 years later, making sure this story's told
Girl, your daddy was a real nigga, not 'cause he was cold
Not because he was the first to get some pussy 12 years old
Not because he used to come through in the Caddy on some vogues
Not because he went from bagging up them grams to serving O's
Nah, your daddy was a real nigga, not 'cause he was hard
Not because he lived a life of crime and sat behind some bars
Not because he screamed, "Fuck the law"
Although that was true
Your daddy was a real nigga 'cause he loved you
For your eyes only

[Chorus: Mannie Fresh, Mannie Fresh & Lil Wayne]
We gon' start this shit off right
We got some bad ass bitches in the house tonight
We gon' start this shit off right
We got some bad ass bitches in the house tonight
We gon' start this shit off right
We got some bad ass bitches in the house tonight
We gon' start this shit off right
We got some bad ass bitches in my house tonight

[Post-Chorus: Mannie Fresh & Lil Wayne]
We got some bad ass bitches, bad ass bitches
Them bitches outside is some sad ass bitches
I know (Leggo, leggo, leggo)
And I know, I know
We got some bad ass bitches, bad ass bitches
Them bitches outside is some sad ass bitches
I know (Leggo, leggo, leggo)
And I know, I know (I know, I know, I know)

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne, Mannie Fresh & Christina Milian]
Yeah, just a watch and a mink coat (Yeah)
Even my biatch got a mink coat
Yeah, her pink purse match her pink toes
Let them hoes knock, we don't check the peephole
Yeah, just a watch and a mink coat
Say she love me long time like Chinese, ho
Yeah, her pink purse match flamingo
And when the water get too hot, I got a steamboat
(Luh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-huh) Told my doctor, "Don't prescribe no placebo"
I'm cooking raw, crack house like a Bistro
(Luh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-huh) Everybody throw a five, Carter Cinco
Thank you, Tune, it's been too dry and not a drink, oh
(Luh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-huh) Save us from all the monotony, our hero
When I die, please bury me in street clothes
(Luh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-huh) Slap the piss out a nigga like a P.O
Bad bitches in this bitch, but I ain't seen yours
(Luh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-huh)
Bad bitches in this bitch, but I ain't seen you
(Luh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-huh)
Pretty girl I want my third leg between yours
(Luh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-huh)
Yeah, bad ass dog by the screen door
(Luh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-huh)
And I'm walking 'round the house wearing nothing but a watch and a mink coat
(Luh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-huh) Yeah, now who gon' tell me something?
Nigga what, nigga huh? She don't tell me, "No"
(Luh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-huh) Woo, and she let me do whatever
But I just let her know, bitch, you better know
(Luh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-huh) Yeah, everybody throw a five
Throw a five, Carter Cinco
(Luh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-huh) This my last hoorah, so let me hear, "Hooray"
But before I'm finito

[Chorus: Lil Wayne & Christina Milian]
(Luh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-huh) We gon' start this shit off right
We got bad ass bitches in the house tonight
(Luh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-huh) Start this shit off right
Got bad ass bitches in my house tonight
Well, I was feeling sad and feeling’ blue
I didn’t know what in the world I wus gonna do
Them Communists they wus coming around
They wus in the air
They wus on the ground
They wouldn’t give me no peace

[Verse 2]
So I run down most hurriedly
And joined up with the John Birch Society
I got me a secret membership card
And started off a-walking down the road
Yee-hoo, I’m a real John Bircher now!
Look out you Commies!

[Verse 3]
Now we all agree with Hitler’s views
Although he killed six million Jews
It don’t matter too much that he was a Fascist
At least you can’t say he was a Communist!
That’s to say like if you got a cold you take a shot of malaria

[Verse 4]
Well, I woos looking everywhere for them gol-darned Reds
I got up in the morning and looked under my bed
Looked in the sink, behind the door
Looked in the glove compartment of my car
Couldn’t find them

[Verse 5]
I woos looking high and low for them Reds everywhere
I woos looking in the sink and underneath the chair
I looked way up my chimney hole
I even looked deep down inside my toilet bowl
They got away

[Verse 6]
Well, I woos sitting home alone and started to sweat
Figured they woos in my T.V. set
Peeked behind the picture frame
Got a shock from my feet, hitting right up in the brain
Them Reds caused it!
I know they did them hard-core ones

[Verse 7]
Well, I quit my job so I could work all alone
Then I changed my name to Sherlock Holmes
Followed some clues from my detective bag
And discovered they woos red stripes on the American flag!
That old Betsy Ross

[Verse 8]
Well, I investigated all the books in the library
Ninety percent of them gotta be burned away
I investigated all the people that I know
Ninety-eight percent of them gotta go
The other two percent are fellow Birchers just like me

[Verse 9]
Now Eisenhower, he’s a Russian spy
Lincoln, Jefferson and that Roosevelt guy
To my knowledge there’s just one man
That’s really a true American: George Lincoln Rockwell
I know for a fact he hates Commies because he picketed the movie Exodus

[Verse 10]
Well, I finally started thinking straight
When I run out of things to investigate
Couldn’t imagine doing anything else
So now I’m sitting home investigating myself!
Hope I don’t find out anything hmm, great God!
Come around you rovin’ gamblers and a story I will tell
About the greatest gambler, you all should know him well
His name was Will O’Conley and he gambled all his life
He had twenty-seven children, yet he never had a wife
And it’s ride, Willie, ride
Roll, Willie, roll
Wherever you are a-gamblin’ now, nobody really knows

He gambled in the White House and in the railroad yards
Wherever there was people, there was Willie and his cards
He had the reputation as the gamblin’est man around
Wives would keep their husbands home when Willie came to town
And it’s ride, Willie, ride
Roll, Willie, roll
Wherever you are a-gamblin’ now, nobody really knows

Sailin’ down the Mississippi to a town called New Orleans
They’re still talkin’ about their card game on that Jackson River Queen
“I’ve come to win some money,” Gamblin’ Willie says
When the game finally ended up, the whole damn boat was his
And it’s ride, Willie, ride
Roll, Willie, roll
Wherever you are a-gamblin’ now, nobody really knows
Up in the Rocky Mountains in a town called Cripple Creek
There was an all-night poker game, lasted about a week
Nine hundred miners had laid their money down
When Willie finally left the room, he owned the whole damn town
And it’s ride, Willie, ride
Roll, Willie, roll
Wherever you are a-gamblin’ now, nobody really knows

But Willie had a heart of gold and this I know is true
He supported all his children and all their mothers too
He wore no rings or fancy things, like other gamblers wore
He spread his money far and wide, to help the sick and the poor
And it’s ride, Willie, ride
Roll, Willie, roll
Wherever you are a-gamblin’ now, nobody really knows

When you played your cards with Willie, you never really knew
Whether he was bluffin’ or whether he was true
He won a fortune from a man who folded in his chair
The man, he left a diamond flush, Willie didn’t even have a pair
And it’s ride, Willie, ride
Roll, Willie, roll
Wherever you are a-gamblin’ now, nobody really knows

It was late one evenin’ during a poker game
A man lost all his money, he said Willie was to blame
He shot poor Willie through the head, which was a tragic fate
When Willie’s cards fell on the floor, they were aces backed with eights
And it’s ride, Willie, ride
Roll, Willie, roll
Wherever you are a-gamblin’ now, nobody really knows
So all you rovin’ gamblers, wherever you might be
The moral of the story is very plain to see
Make your money while you can, before you have to stop
For when you pull that dead man’s hand, your gamblin’ days are up
And it’s ride, Willie, ride
Roll, Willie, roll
Wherever you are a-gamblin’ now, nobody really knows

[Intro]
I see the, I see the—
I see the, I see the—
I see the rain
Pouring down
Before my very eyes
Should come as no surprise
I see the, I see the rain
Pouring down, uh
Before my very eyes
Should come as no surprise

[Verse]
I'm searching and praying and hoping for something
I know I'm gon' see it, I know that it's coming
Lord, huh
Lord, huh
But what do you do when there's no place to turn?
I have no one, I'm lonely, my bridges have burnt down
Lord
Lord

[Chorus]
The bells getting loud, ain't nowhere to hide
Got nowhere to go, put away my pride
Tired of feeling low even when I'm high
Ain't no way to live, do I wanna die?
I don't know, I don't know
Bells getting loud, ain't nowhere to hide
Got nowhere to go, put away my pride
Tired of feeling low even when I'm high
Ain't no way to live, do I wanna die?
I don't know, I don't know

[Outro]
Bells gettin' louder, louder
I see the rain
Pouring down

[Intro]
At six-
For some reason when I go to the app...

[Verse 1]
The comedy of man starts like this:
Our brains are way too big for our mothers' hips
And so nature, she devised this alternative:
We emerge half-formed and hope whoever greets us on the other end
Is kind enough to fill us in
And babies, that's pretty much how it's been ever since
Now the miracle of birth leaves a few issues to address
Like, say, that half of us are periodically iron deficient
So somebody's gotta go kill something while I look after the kids
I'd do it myself, but what, are you gonna to get this thing its milk?
He says as soon as he gets back from the hunt, we can switch
It's hard not to fall in love with something so helpless
Ladies, I hope we don't end up regretting this

[Chorus 1]
Comedy, now that's what I call pure comedy
Just wait until the part where they start to believe
They're at the center of everything
And some all-powerful being
Endowed this horror show with meaning

[Verse 2]
Oh, their religions are the best
They worship themselves yet they're totally obsessed
With risen zombies, celestial virgins, magic tricks
These unbelievable outfits
And they get terribly upset
When you question their sacred texts
Written by woman-hating epileptics
Their languages just serve to confuse them
Their confusion somehow makes them more sure
They build fortunes poisoning their offspring
And hand out prizes when someone patents a cure
Where did they find these goons they elected to rule them?
What makes these clowns they idolize so remarkable?
These mammals are hell-bent on fashioning new gods
So they can go on being godless animals

[Interlude]

[Chorus 2]
Oh comedy, their illusions they have no choice but to believe
Their horizons that just forever recede
And how's this for irony:
Their idea of being free is a prison of beliefs
That they never ever have to leave
Oh comedy, oh it's like something that a madman would conceive!
The only thing that seems to make them feel alive
Is the struggle to survive
But the only thing that they request
Is something to numb the pain with
Until there's nothing human left

[Outro]
Just random matter suspended in the dark
I hate to say it, but each other's all we've got

[Verse 1]
I was living on the hill
By the water tower and hiking trails
And when the big one hit I’d have a seat
To watch masters abandon their dogs and dogs run free
Oh baby, it’s time to leave
Take the van and the hearse down to New Orleans
Leave under the gaze of the billboard queens
Five-foot chicks with parted lips selling sweatshop jeans

[Verse 2]
These L.A. phonies and their bullshit bands
That sound like dollar signs and Amy Grant
So reads the pull quote from my last cover piece
Entitled "The Oldest Man in Folk Rock Speaks”
You can hear it all over the airwaves
The manufactured gasp of the final days
Someone should tell them ‘bout the time that they don’t have
To praise the glorious future and the hopeless past

[Verse 3]
A few things the songwriter needs
Arrows of love, a mask of tragedy
But if you want ecstasy or birth control
Just run the tap until the water’s cold
Anything else you can get online
A creation myth or a .45
You're going to need one or the other to survive
Where only the armed or the funny make it out alive

[Verse 4]
Mara taunts me 'neath the tree
She's like, "Oh great, that's just what we all need
Another white guy in 2017
Who takes himself so goddamn seriously."
She's not far off, the strange thing is
That's pretty much what I thought when I started this
It took me my whole life to learn to play the G
But the role of Oedipus was a total breeze

[Verse 5]
Still I dreamt of garnering all rave reviews
Just believably a little north of God's own truth
"He's a national treasure now, and here's the proof
In the form of his major label debut"
A little less human with each release
Closing the gap between the mask and me
I swear I'll never do this, but is it okay?
Don't want to be that guy but it's my birthday
If everything ends with a photo then I'm on my way

[Interlude]
Oh-hoh, oh-hoh, oh-hoh, oh-hoh

[Verse 6]
I watched my old gods all collapse
Were way more violent than my cartoon past
It's like my father said before he croaked:
"Son, you're killing me, and that's all folks."
So why is it I'm so distraught
That what I'm selling is getting bought?
At some point you just can't control
What people use your fake name for

[Verse 7]
So I never learned to play the lead guitar
I always more preferred the speaking parts
Besides there's always someone willing to
Fill up the spaces that I couldn't use
Nonetheless, I've been practicing my whole life
Washing dishes, playing drums, and getting by
Until I figured, if I'm here then I just might
Conceal my lack of skill here in the spotlight
Maya, the mother of illusions, a beard, and I

[Verse 8]
2000 years or so since Ovid taught
Night-blooming, teenage rosebuds, dirty talk
And I'm merely a minor fascination to
Manic virginal lust and college dudes
I'm beginning to begin to see the end
Of how it all goes down between me and them
Some 10-verse chorus-less diatribe
Plays as they all jump ship, "I used to like this guy
This new shit really kinda makes me wanna die"

[Interlude]
Oh-hoh, oh-hoh, oh-hoh, oh-hoh

[Verse 9]
My first memory of music's from
The time at JCPenney's with my mom
The watermelon candy I was choking on
Barbara screaming, "Someone help my son!"
I relive it most times the radio's on
That "tell me lies, sweet little white lies" song
That's when I first saw the comedy won't stop for
Even little boys dying in department stores

[Verse 10]
So we leave town in total silence
New Year's Day, it's 6 o'clock AM
I've never seen Sunset this abandoned
Reminds me predictably of the world's end
It'll be good to get more space
God knows what all these suckers paid
I can stop drinking and you can write your script
But what we both think now is...

[Intro: Kanye West]
I don't know why niggas tripping on a nigga
For clippers, I hate you niggas too
But I'm black and Mexican, we gon' change that, haha
I hate you niggas too!

[Chorus: Kanye West]
If you ain't had good pussy, nigga, try some
Your girl ain't got no ass, she need to buy one
Out west, Southwest, where you fly from
New Jersey, Teterboro where I fly from
You ain't got no Ghost, you need to drive one
That bitch is so broke, try to find some
And she ain't got no money, tryna find some
I swear these bitches funny, hahaha
Hahaha, hahaha
I swear these bitches funny, hahaha
Hahaha, hahaha
You still owe me money, nigga, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: French Montana]
Got a bad bitch at build-a-body
Get a bad bitch and build a body
When your pop, the slim nigga shady
When your pop was Slim, I was Baby
I came for them chips like I'm K.D
Came for them bricks like I'm Maisie
We hit up the trap which is booming
Hustle, French John Newman
Fuck making the move, we the movie
Fuck the whole group, I'm a groupie
All that money rolling through the lobby
VVS is dripping off my body
You can do what you want when you got it
Go get a bitch and then build her body
They wanted Versace Milan
We do what we want and then copy
Smack a Roley on my arm
Skrrr, middle fingers to the feds
Put a hundred dollars on your head
Price of life hit you
And all my dawgs gotta eat
And all the money get divided
Snipe game be the wildest
Get a bad bitch, build her body
Get a bad bitch, build her body, haan

[Chorus: Kanye West]
If you ain't had good pussy, nigga, try some
Your girl ain't got no ass, she need to buy one
Out west, Southwest, where you fly from
New Jersey, Teterboro where I fly from
You ain't got no Ghost, you need to drive one
That bitch is so broke, try to find some
And she ain't got no money, tryna find some
I swear these bitches funny, hahaha
Hahaha, hahaha
I swear these bitches funny, hahaha
Hahaha, hahaha
You still owe me money, nigga, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2: Cam'ron]
Harlem to the death, I'ma forever front
A problem with the kid is what you never want
That's what you want, I had my niggas waiting for you
Like you sitting at a table in a restaurant
Slice you like pizza, I keep six in the squeezer
My jewelry is nice, dressing is iced
It's how you can sit in the freezer
Keep my dick in the diva, word, no problem licking it either
Baby girl could be a believer, we could just kick it like FIFA
All the women heavy like pallbearer
That Henney got that cake like Carvel
Carvel, me, I'ma die
Inside the pussy, man, I know just how Lamar felt
My bitch sit on me flat without no tummy tuck
She no stripper but all she do is pick money up
Five-o called me over, word to my homie, I ain't tell 'em shit
He seemed aggy, so all I did was tell him this

[Chorus: Kanye West]
If you ain't had good pussy, nigga, try some
Your girl ain't got no ass, she need to buy one
Out west, Southwest, where you fly from
New Jersey, Teterboro where I fly from
You ain't got no Ghost, you need to drive one
That bitch is so broke, try to find some
And she ain't got no money, tryna find some
I swear these bitches funny, hahaha
Hahaha, hahaha
I swear these bitches funny, hahaha
Hahaha, hahaha
You still owe me money, nigga, yeah, yeah

[Intro: J. Cole]
My intuition is telling me there'll be better days, yeah
My intuition is telling me there'll be better days
I like this tone

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Yeah, my intuition is telling me there'll be better days
I sit in silence and find whenever I meditate
My fears alleviate, my tears evaporate
My faith don't deviate, ideas don't have a date
But see I'm growing and getting stronger with every breath
Bringing me closer to Heaven's doors with every step
As we speak I'm at peace, no longer scared to die
Most niggas don't believe in God and so they terrified
It's either that or they be fearing they gon' go to Hell
Asking the Father for forgiveness, got 'em overwhelmed (Please, God, I want to go to Heaven)
As if He's spiteful like them white folks that control the jail
See I believe if God is real, He'd never judge a man
Because He knows us all and therefore He would understand
The ignorance that make a nigga take his brother life
The bitterness and pain that got him beating on his wife

[Chorus: J. Cole]
I know you desperate for a change let the pen glide
But the only real change come from inside (Come from inside)
But the only real change come from inside (Come from inside)
But the only real change come from—
In cemeteries or in chains I see men cry
But the only real change come from inside (Come from inside)
But the only real change come from inside (Come from inside)
But the only real change come from—

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Yeah, my chosen religion
Jesus piece frozen from sinnin'
Doin' dirt, hoping to God, He know my intentions
To see a million 'fore I see a casket
I got a baby on the way, know he gon' be a bastard
I'm living fast like I'm in a drag race, how that cash taste
When I was a senior, I was ballin' on my classmates
Niggas put three bullets in my car, one hit the gas tank
Know I got a angel cause I'm supposed to have a halo
Right now, my lifestyle destined for a federal facility
For my ability to make them birds fly
Fiends wanna get higher than a bird's eye view
And who am I to tell a nigga what to do?
I just supply, it's economics
My business ain't got the suit and tie
Keep a pistol at all times, niggas want what's mine
I can't oblige, dog, I work too hard
So reach for it, get referred to God, I'm going hard, nigga

[Chorus: J. Cole]
I know you desperate for a change let the pen glide
But the only real change come from inside
But the only real change come from inside
But the only real change come from—
In cemeteries or in chains I see men cry
But the only real change come from inside
But the only real change come from inside
But the only real change come from—

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
Yeah, prodigal son, got a new gun
This one don't run out of ammo
Lately been working on my handles
Can I ball, become a star and remain my self?
If I fall, dust it off and regain my self
Fuck 'em all, they don't know all the pain I felt
I'm in awe, after all the fame I felt, I evolved
I no longer bury demons, I be a vessel for the truth until I'm barely breathing, I'm singing

[Bridge: Ari Lennox & J. Cole]
Life is all about the evolution
I give up, I give in, I move back a little
I live up, I look up, now I'm back for more
You can dream but don't neglect the execution
I give up, I give in, I move back a little
I live up, I look up, now I'm back for more
Time is short that's what somebody told me
I give up, I give in, I move back a little
I live up, I look up, now I'm back for more
Too short to keep following your homies
I give up, I give in, I move back a little
I live up, I look up, now I'm back for more

[Bridge: J. Cole]
I reminisce back to a time where niggas threw they hands
All of a sudden niggas pop a trunk and then we scram
Finger on trigger make a little nigga understand
What it's like to finally be the motherfuckin' man
Eyes wide that's from the power that the coward feels
Niggas die over bitches, disrespect, and dollar bills
Bloodshed that turned the city to a battlefield
I call it poison, you call it real (pop, pop, pop, pop)
That's how you feel?

[Verse 4: J. Cole]
Pistols be poppin' and niggas drop in a heartbeat
Scattered like roaches, a body laid on the concrete
A body laid on the concrete
Look, somebody laid on the concrete
No time for that, ain't no lookin' back, cause I'm running too
I made it home, I woke up and turned on the morning news
Overcame with a feeling I can't explain
Cause that was my nigga James that was slain, he was 22
(Last night at around...) He was 22
(22 year old black male, suspect, reporting live...)

[Outro: J. Cole]
(I swear to God, bruh)
We're gathered here today...
(I swear to God)
To mourn the life of James McMillan Jr
(I swear to God—nigga, I'ma kill them niggas, man)
A tragedy, another tragedy in the black community
(I promise you, bro...)
We got to do better, people
22 years old, this boy was too young
(I promise you, bro, I'ma kill them niggas, yo...)
Our condolences go to his family, our prayers
(I'ma kill them niggas myself...)
We know he's in a better place
We know he's in a better place
But this has got to end, ladies and gentleman
We've got to come together, this is—this is beyond words
Now I'd like to open this ceremony with a verse from—

[Intro]
Hey, hey
Hey, hey
Hey, hey

[Chorus]
I wanna fold clothes for you
I wanna make you feel good
Baby, I wanna do the right things they
Feel so much better than the wrong things
I said I wanna fold clothes for you
I wanna make you feel good
Baby, I wanna do the right things they
Feel so much better than the wrong things
I wanna fold clothes for you

[Verse 1]
I wanna fold clothes for you
Woke up this morning
Feeling like the best version of me, so happy
I walked in the living room
And saw you all alone on the couch, just napping
I, I see a lot on your plate
Nine months with that weight
I know you tired so I wonder how I can help
I get the basket and grab your clothes out the dryer
Oh, I wanna fold clothes for you

[Chorus]
I wanna fold clothes for you
I wanna make you feel good
Baby, I wanna do the right things they
Feel so much better than the wrong things
I said I wanna fold clothes for you
I wanna make you feel good
Baby, I wanna do the right things they
Feel so much better than the wrong things
I wanna fold clothes for you

[Verse 2]
Listen, this is a meditation for me
A practice in being present
There's nowhere I need to be
Except right here with you
Except right here with you
Folding clothes
Watching Netflix
Catching up on our shows
Eating breakfast
Raisin Bran in my bowl
With bananas and some almond milk
I never thought I'd see the day
I'm drinking almond milk
("You soft!")

[Chorus]
I wanna fold clothes for you
I wanna make you feel good
Baby, I wanna do the right things they
Feel so much better than the wrong things
I said I wanna fold clothes for you
I wanna make you feel good
Baby, I wanna do the right things they
Feel so much better than the wrong things
I wanna fold clothes for you

[Bridge]
If I can make life easier
The way you do mine
Save you some time
Alleviate a bit of stress from your mind
Help you relax
Let you recline babe
Then I should do it
'Cause Heaven only knows
How much you have done that for me
Now I see
It's the simple things
It's the simple things
It's the simple things
That say "I love you"
It's the simple things
It's the simple things
It's the simple things

[Verse 3]
Niggas from the hood is the best actors
We the ones that got to wear our face backwards
Put your frown on before they think you soft
Never smile long or take your defense off
Acting tough so much, we start to feel hard
Live from the city where they pull cards
I got a Glock 40 and a little nine
Ready for the day a nigga pull mine
Niggas from the hood is the best actors
Gotta learn to speak in ways that's unnatural
Just to make it through the job interviews
If my niggas heard me, they'd say
"Damn, what's gotten into you?"
Just trying to make it, dog, somehow
Peeking through the blinds, I see the sun now
I see you're still sleeping and it feels like
Maybe everything is gon' be alright

[Intro]
Catch me, don't you
Catch me, don't you
Catch me, I've fallen in love for the first time

[Bridge]
For you I drop the tough guy shit, on this bus I sit
Thinking 'bout you, thinking 'bout you
Thinking 'bout you, thinking 'bout you
Thinking 'bout you, thinking 'bout you
Thinking 'bout you, thinking 'bout you
Damn it feel good to have you
Damn it feel good to have you
Damn it feel good to have you
Damn it feel good to have you

[Verse 1]
Needin' me, wantin' me, givin' me a chance to feel special
To somebody in a world where they not lovin' me
Handcuffs keep huggin' the, wrists of my niggas
And I wish stuff was different here
But if I had a magic wand to make the evil disappear
That means that there would be no Santa Claus no more
To bring you Christmas cheer
'Cause what he represents is really greed
And the need to purchase shit from corporations
That make a killin' because they feed
On the wallets of the poor who be knockin' on they door
Every Black Friday just to get some shit they can't afford
Even with the discount, write a check, that shit bounce
But as long as we got credit, it don't matter, the amount
We just swipin' shit here, we don't love, we just likin' shit here
What's that smell? Where's your diaper shit here?
Lay on your back, don't pee right now
Or else I'll have to get you back
One day when you gon' want to get your way
Yeah I'll have fun with that
Reminisce when you came out the womb
Tears of joy I think filled up the room
You are now the reason that I fight
I ain't never did nothing this right in my whole life
Got me thinking...

[Bridge]
Am I worthy of this gift?
Am I strong enough to lift? (Am I strong enough to lift?)
Into a place that I can see (Into a place that I can see)
Someone more important than me? (Someone more important than me?)
Am I worthy of this gift? (Am I worthy of this gift?)
Am I strong enough to lift (Am I strong enough to lift)
Into a place that I can see (Into a place that I can see)
Someone more important than me? (Someone more important than me?)

[Verse 2]
Ib gon' ask me how I did this shit
I'm gon' do a humble stunt act like I meant this shit
Thats the ego taking credit for what God made
Fuck this album shit, hey mama look what God made
(She's mine) Catch me, don't you
(She's mine) Catch me, don't you
(She's mine) Catch me
I've fallen in love for the first time
I wanna cry, and I ain't even tryna fight it
Don't wanna die, 'cause now you're here
And I just wanna be right by your side
On any night that you be cryin', baby
I dry your eyes, I dry your eyes

[Outro]
There is a God, it is a God
Yeah, it is a God
I never felt so alive
I never felt so alive
I never felt so alive
(I never felt so alive)
I never felt so alive
(I never felt so alive)
Catch me, don't you—
Catch me, don't you—
Catch me, I've fallen in love for the first time

[Intro]
I never felt so alive
I never felt so alive
I never felt so alive (I never felt so alive)
I never felt so alive (I never felt so alive)

[Interlude]
Catch me, don't you—
Catch me, don't you catch me
I've fallen in love for the first time
I wanna cry
And I ain't even tryna fight it
Don't wanna die (Don't wanna die no more)
'Cause now you're here and I just wanna be
Right by your side
On any night that you be crying, baby
I'll dry your eyes
I'll dry your eyes

[Verse]
Every time you go to sleep you look like you in Heaven
Plus the head game is stronger than a few Excedrin
You shine just like the patent leather on my new 11's
You read me like a book like I'm the Bible, you the Reverend
Yeah, I wanna tell the truth to you
I wanna talk about my days as a youth to you
Exposing you to all my demons and the reasons I'm this way
I would like to paint a picture, but it'll take more than a day
It would take more than some years to get all over all my fears
Preventing me from letting you see all of me perfectly clear
The same wall that's stopping me from letting go and shedding tears
From the lack of having father, and the passing of my peers
While I'm too scared to expose myself
It turns out, you know me better than I know myself
Better than I know myself
Well how 'bout that?

[Outro]
She gets him (you get me)
She hugs him (you kiss me)
You tell me you miss me
And I believe you, I believe you
She gets him (you get me)
She hugs him (you kiss me)
You tell me you miss me
And I believe you, I believe you
Catch me, don't you—
Catch me, don't you catch me
I've fallen in love for the first time

Fuck you doin' nigga

[Verse 1]
I was raised in the pitts
Where if you my age you in a cage or a ditch
But in my case never complained, never simped
Especially nowadays cause now I'm payed in a bitch
Hopping off that plane, somewhere I already been
The menu come in english, but the waiters speaking french
And haters ain't convinced
I ain't mad at em
I also made a 100K today and then laugh at em
I'm smokin on the bag that a nigga then have to stash
I payed cash for it, even my OG niggas be passin on it
My outfit always on some dumb shit, yeah I'm that ignorant
And keep my camera man with me cause I'm that historic
Bank account enormous, out ya category
Not to mention, got a closet full of that Dior shit
Niggas claimin that they new, ain't nothin new they bore me
I'm too into doin me for me to copy your shit
My diamonds shinin, yeah my ice is gorgeous
My flights are private, and my wife is flawless
I'm just livin my life

[Chorus]
We are, we are
Young Millionaires
So everywhere we go
We look strange to ya'll
We are, we are
Young Millionaires
So everywhere we go
We look strange to ya'll

[Bridge]
Get rich to this
Get rich to this
Get rich to this
Get rich to this

[Verse 2]
I had a dream that told me I'ma win
Just set my Rolly today and bout to have to change the time again
And I could prolly deal with the game without these fucked niggas chimin in
They told me i changed cus of money, nigga, money wasn't the problem here
Nor will it ever be nigga
Talk aloud with all my accomplices
Smokin pounds cus we proud of all our accomplishments (everyday)
Started at the bottom, made it out the bottom since
I guess gettin dollars just makes common sense
I guess that mean I'm ballin and you on the bench
I guess all of these commas mean I'm kinda rich
I guess that mean I'm spoiled cus my life's a bitch

[Chorus]
We are, we are
Young Millionaires
So everywhere we go
We look strange to ya'll
We are, we are
Young Millionaires
So everywhere we go
We look strange to ya'll

[Bridge]
Get rich to this
Get rich to this
Get rich to this
Get rich to this

[Outro]
Fuckin Punk

[Intro]
Shake'n bake
Nigga ain't doin' nothing, just sittin' here and swaggin
It's easy though
It's easy to not give a fuck

[Verse 1]
Fresh outta first class, fresh outta purp nap
My outfit straight outta hearse, I'm fresh to death
My car from overseas, the steering wheel on the other side
I'm givin' it all I got and smokin' what's left
So much money on weed, so much smoke in my chest
I take the lessons I learned and put 'em all in my flesh
Tatted, got a strong weed habit
Going hard, could have sworn you niggas had it
Buying champagne, what the tab is
We order more drinks, bring the cabs in
Rip up jeans, call it fashion
A lot of cash and a lot of grass
You niggas broke, you ain't gotta pass
Chanel bags and them Prada tags
Spendin' stash, you ain't gotta stack
Young and rich, don't know how to act
As the wheels keep spinnin' and my joint keep burning
And my team keep winnin'

[Hook]
Roll up, what's the hold up, up
Roll up, what's the hold up, up

[Verse 2]
Thinking of some shit, that rap taught me
Sittin' in a whip, that rap bought me
Look at all the things that I'm affording
My nigga mean I'm ballin' like a sports team
You doin' some shit you think's flossin'
I was doing that back, when I was fourteen
Gettin' it, buying the most, flippin' it
Sixteen, time to pay rent in this bitch
I wasn't even thinking of making millions
I was just thinking, smokin' and chillin'
And trying to pay the bills, try get my mom out this building
And I got my mom out of this building
I never took a hand out
Matter fact I put my hand in
Now everything you see is planned by me
Boss of my own shit, Taylor Gang Ent
Nothing but that cali strong
Gettin' blown by the pound, bitch, TNT
Uh

[Hook]
Roll up, what's the hold up, up
Roll up, what's the hold up, up

[Intro]
Hand me that weed

[Verse]
Uh
Cause I be bakin' when I'm wakin', shinin' cause I'm grindin'
Smokin' while I'm drivin', diamonds in my timing, bitch
Overflow with smoke, it smell like OG when I pull up
Only fuck with OGs, so that's what my clique is full of
Niggas get a 'lil love actin' like they're famous
Found out what your name is, now you think you made it
If you're so fucking hot, my nig', you should be gettin' paid then
But you ain't selling nothing, you're just an internet sensation
Got a package coming, every state I stay in
Ain't no writing checks at the bank no more, I just weigh in
Rolling up the weed, put the KK in the equation
Let you hit the Marley

[Talking]
Let me hear it

[Hook]
It's part of the game, it's all that I know
We sleep on the plane, we live on the road
It's part of the game, it's all that I know
We sleep on the plane, we live on the road
And away we go

[Verse]
ABA, BCd
(Will show you how it feels to be)
To be stuck outside your sanity
(And wrapped around infinity)
I want to leave but I can't conceive that
I'll snap back to reality
(I'll snap back to reality)

[Verse]
Trump's nuts roasting on an open fire
As he keeps nipping at his foes
You'll cry creepy uncle every time he arrives
For he keeps clawing at your clothes
Everybody knows that money and entitlement
Can help to make the season white
Mothers of color with their kids out of sight
Will find it hard to sleep at night

[Chorus]
They know that Trump is on his way
He's got black boys in hoodies locked up on his sleigh
And every working man is going to cry
When they learn that Letch don't care how you live or if you die

[Outro]
So I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from 1 to 92
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you
Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas
Donald Trump, fuck you

[Chorus: Tayla Parx]
Gold in my champagne
Your shit blank, boy your shit lame
Probably just like your dick game
So I don't need to know your name
Don't you see these on my feet?
Bet you can't guess how much I paid
That's a shame
Fuck these simple hoes tryna swerve in my lane

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Who the fuck told you to not have no chill?
Who the fuck told you we splittin' that bill?
Who the fuck told you that I'm in the hood?
When you know fuckin' right I'm in Beverly Hills
Why you keep starin' at me like you know me?
Spur of the moment, I ball like Ginobili
ESPN, photoshootin' with Kobe
You Photoshop bitches be needin' Adobe
Oh, oh, that's some bologna
Oh, this is Missoni
Oh, you are still lookin' for Kony
Would tell you to call me, but I am not phony
Oh, why your car got a cheap gear?
Mothafucka in his car with some cheap gear
I'm draped in McQueen, Balmain on my jean
Ask Givenchy and Marie Claire

[Chorus: Tayla Parx]
Gold in my champagne
Your shit blank, boy your shit lame
Probably just like your dick game
So I don't need to know your name
Don't you see these on my feet?
Bet you can't guess how much I paid
That's a shame
Fuck these simple hoes tryna swerve in my lane

[Chorus: Tayla Parx]

[Chorus: Tayla Parx]

[Bridge: Nicki Minaj]
He said, "Arch your back"
I ain't gon' do it
He said, "Kiss my neck"

Do it, do it, do it, do it
He said, "Arch your back"
I ain't gon' do it
He said, "Kiss my neck"
I ain't gon' do it
Talk dirty in my ear

[Verse 1]
Take your nose off my keyboard
What you bothering me for?
There's a room full of niggas
What you following me for?
This ain't no fucking sing-along
So, girl, what you singin' for?
It's cause we blowing like a C4
You know my whole crew blowing like a C4
20, get the bar rolling
Fake ID's in the trash, weed blowin'
Straight to the top, rooftop glows
With a hand full of girls and they all so foreign
Brain so poisoned, rainbows flowin'
Light-skinned chick, first flight from Poland
A whole lotta friends, first flight from Poland
A whole lotta cash coming straight from Poland

[Chorus]
They loving the crew
They loving the crew
Oh, they loving the crew
Oh, they loving the crew
They loving the crew
They loving the crew
They loving the crew

[Verse 2]
If you broadcast swag, nigga, we the news in your city
Need proof, ask your girl's titties, she on the right side
SSL on the left, saying we the best
She wants to be friends with the crew
Take a lot of pics and travel where we move
Model on stage while I'm singing in her ear
20,000 fans get jealous up in here
They don't even care, girl, give it a rest
Ain't no fucking pussy gonna stick out from the rest
Girls with big breasts ain't shit without legs
'Least in my books so put me through this test, so I could care less
Penelope Cruz, Natalie Portman, please holla at your dude
Used to rap blues for the girls with tattoos
Used to rap blues for the girls with tattoos
Don't you forget it, girls like Gia, girls with no visas
Addicted to the life, french girls named Mia
'Cause my chick might be the next Keira Knightley
So baby, you can talk if you want, talk if you want
Talk if you want, talk if you want

[Chorus]
They loving the crew
Oh, they loving the crew
Oh, they loving the crew
They loving the crew, oh
Oh, they loving the crew
They loving the crew
Oh, they loving the crew
Oh, they loving the crew
They loving the crew
Oh, they loving the crew
The time has come again where I am tied
She’s tying my arteries as if she were tying her shoes
She’s given me a taste, but she won’t give me none
She tasted really sweet, but now she’s gone

She lives on my block so I just ride by
I haven’t had the opportunity to stay hi
She lingers in every dream I feel so insane
I really miss her purple presence and her purple stain

On my pillow sheet
Left by her purple hair
Left me with a purple gaze
A heavy haze that makes her photographic
Placed on a pedestal
In the crack in between my brain
Tagged in Braille writing on my cerebral wall

So just climb a tree
And spend some time with me
Climb a tree
I wanta kiss ya
Climbing creating collages
Like the fluidity of our speech
I hope you’re in my reach
She lives on my block so I just ride by
I haven’t had the opportunity to stay high
She lingers in every dream I feel so insane
I really miss her purple presence and her purple stain

Tagged in Braille writing in my cerebral wall

So just climb a tree
And spend some time with me
Climb a tree
I wanta kiss ya
Climbing creating collages
Like the fluidity of our speech, and
I hope you’re in my reach

[Verse 1]
Friday night at the club, got my gloves on
Swishy-swish, gold locks, ponytail, stun gun
Long nails with the gloss on, dressed up like a champion
Whip it, whip it good
Dude, don't touch me 'cause I'm on one, yeah
Feeling super fly, heavyweight, don't cross the line
Yes, I'm kinda drunk but I just came to have a good time
That guy in the corner keeps on looking at my behind
Ugh, what you looking at? You better run, run for your life

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna start a war, I wanna start a war
I wanna start a war, I wanna start a war
I wanna start a war

[Chorus]
(Hua) Like I do karate
(Hya) Like I do judo
(Fua) Like I do kickboxing (Ding)
Total T.K.O

[Verse 2]
Wait a second, think he wants to step into the ring
Staring at my chest, boy, put your eyes where I can see them
Hands off, don't touch, I'm not your property, I'm leavin'
Pester me again, I'm gonna have to kick your teeth in
Oh, now he's laughing with his friends, they think it's funny
"She's acting like a virgin, bet she never sucks dick"
Hey, let me tell you something
Your mummy taught you nothin'
Don't need 20 rounds to beat you
Baby, I'm not bluffin'

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna start a war, I wanna start a war
I wanna start a war, I wanna start a war
I wanna start a war

[Chorus]
(Hua) Like I do karate
(Hya) Like I do judo
(Fua) Like I do kickboxing (Ding!)
Total T.K.O
(Hua) Like I do karate
(Hya) Like I do judo
(Fua) Like I do kickboxing (Ding!)
Total T.K.O
I think I'm fuckin' gone, rollin' on this floor
Messin' up your carpet, I'll get on it after former
More sections of this yak on your floor
Shouldn't fuckin' roll, but I fuckin' roll
Feelin' like a million bucks before
I walk through this door, when I walk through your door
Can't believe I made it, but I made it, that's for sure
For sure, your lovin', I need more, I need yours

She ain't lookin' for that unconditional
What the fuck these bitches on? They want what I'm sippin' on
They don't want my love, they just want my potential
Fuck it, I'll keep sippin' on this, baby livin' off of this
Got me drownin' in your love, you got me drownin' in abyss
Give me wet attention, I'll start drowning from my wrists, wrist

And baby if you need a little more
The feelings I would give to you
You, you, you, you
The feelings I would give to you
You, you, you, you, you, you, you

[Intro]
That be Maaly Raw!

[Verse 1: Lil Yachty]

I'm Fergenstein, I'm the Ferginator

Diamonds is cut like a gladiator
Terminate, terminate, terminate

[Verse 3: Lil Yachty]
Tryna come to a young nigga crib
It's the last button on the elevator
And my bed so far from my kitchen
I might build me an escalator

You wanna fuck me? Bitch, yes or no?
Wait... you wanna fuck me? Bitch, yes or yes?

[Verse 4: A$AP Ferg]
Wait! Terminate, terminate

Hold on, terminate, terminate

She suck me like Now & Later
She ask me if I want it now or later
Carlton dancin' on my Cartier
Will Smithin', I'm the Fresh Prince
Hold on, I mean the king 'cause I'm destined
Hood Pope ain't got time for peasants
You better bow at my presence

[Verse 5: Lil Yachty]
Terminate, terminate, terminate
Your lil' bitch's face is a sperm bank
Woah, I don't believe in the term, "Can't"
Coast on the block with a gold shank
Earnin' my goat rank
Pull up in No Limit army tank
She see my hair, bet that bitch faint, Lil Boat!
Terminate, terminate, terminate, damn
No combo, I need my green eggs and ham

[Verse 6: A$AP Ferg]

[Verse 7: Lil Yachty]
Came from the 6 with my brothers

Gold chains for my brothers, I ride for my gang
22 diamonds, salsa in the chain
Don't you dare ever talk down on my name
Bitch, lil' bitch

One where I stay with Anita
And one where I fuck on Jaquita

[Verse 8: A$AP Ferg]
Hold on man, you mean Shaquita? I beat her
I beat that pussy up, she sing like Aretha
You're upper echelon? I don't believe yah

[Intro: Meek Mill]
Yeah!
R.I.P. Dex Osama, Lil Snupe
All the fallen soldiers
Scooter, Truce

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
When they killed my nigga Snupe, I seen my young nigga
In the casket he ain't even have no blood in him
Prolly the reason why I keep taking these drugs quicker
Ain't got no patience for these motherfuckin' fuck niggas
I watch everybody change, they thought I lost it
But now they all bustin' U-ies its gon' cost 'em
I seen Chino shut the casket on the coffin (Truce)
Killed his only big brother and we lost him
So I'ma hold it down 'til we all win
We've been at the Clearport ballin'
I just want to see my niggas flossin'
Hundred bands everytime I walk in
If you keep it trill you'll get a blessing for it
Deep down in the trenches with that Wesson on me
My mama, she can't sleep, I come here early mornings (mama)
But mama I got thirty in this dirty .40
Any weapon formed against me shall not prosper
Used to pray them Ramen noodles turned to lobster
Gotta watch my own homies on the roster
Cause this the type of money'll get your lined up

[Bridge: Meek Mill]
And I can't trust nobody
They hit your homie and they knocked the soul out him
They said that they would ride or die but ain't nobody roll 'bout it
Three felonies, ain't graduate, no I am not your role model
I hope the Lord got us

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
When they killed my nigga, I seen the footage on the tape
Man I must've threw up everything I ever ate
Man I know he got some dice at the Heaven gates
Kicking shit with all these bitches like he's Kevin Gates
Relax your mind and kick your feet way up
Selling dog food tryna feed my pups
Young rich nigga and I'm built Ford Tough
And I'm going through stuff
I don't feel no love
I shake your body and you still wake up
Taking Perkys, man I fill my cup
The feds watching and they still might come, I'm gone
I wan' see my brother with the Patek, not the static
Gucci wrap your toe up, got retarded with my daddy
All they seen was red bottoms bleeding by the casket
Perkys got me focused, I done noticed all the damages
I don't see no purpose, in the county eating sandwiches
Lost so many niggas, I went crazy, I couldn't balance it
You can't question God, yeah, yeah, and then there's challenges
Sipping on this Actavis, I swear, I gotta manage it
SRT the challengers
Make that work do acrobatic flip, accurate
And I'm leaning like a project banister
I'm a boss, I ain't never need a manager
Got rich, with thugs scandalous, ayy

[Outro: Young Thug]
Fuck it, we ball, yeah
All the soldiers we lost, yeah
Fuck it, we ball-ooh-all
For all the soldiers we lost
Shawty on percocets in the bag
(All the soldiers we lost)
Got a Rollie and a Pateky in my bag
(All the soldiers we lost)
She just got a nose job and it wasn't that bad
(Fuck it, we ball)
I was juggin' round the city, I came back, ayy
Fuck it, we ball
Yeah, fuck it, we ball
Tear down the mall, yeah
Fuck it, we ball
Tear down the mall, ayy

[Verse 1: Alicia Keys]
Funny thing about the apple
The peach is sweet, but ain't the same
The pear compares, but that's natural
This ain't no cobbler or meringue

[Pre-Chorus: Pharrell Williams (chorus)]
You turn my ovens on (Flame)
You can smell when it's warm (Flame)
Burn the house to the lawn (Flame)
Happens quick as they on (Flame)

[Pre-Chorus: Alicia Keys]
It was Adam and Eve
And the God in the trees
And the snake, oh yeah
Cause everybody is destined
To learn all these lessons alone
Don't be afraid

[Chorus: Alicia Keys (chorus)]
This gon' wake you up (woo-woo)
Smell when it hit the flame (woo-woo)
Hurry 'for it burn up (woo-woo)
Cause it won't be the same (woo-woo)

[Verse 2: Pharrell Willians]
It's funny when the arrow's aiming at you
Inscribed with your name
You pray that it just goes past you
Cupid's only gonna shoot if he knows it's his game

[Pre-Chorus: Pharrell Williams (chorus)]
You turn my ovens on (Flame)
You can smell when it's warm (Flame) (Lucy Liu!)
Burn the house to the lawn (Flame)
Happens quick as they on (Flame)

[Pre-Chorus: Alicia Keys]
It was Adam and Eve
And the God in the trees
And the snake, oh yeah
Cause everybody is destined
To learn all these lessons alone
Don't be afraid

[Chorus: Alicia Keys (chorus)]
This gon' wake you up (woo-woo)
Smell when it hit the flame (woo-woo)
Hurry 'for it burn up (woo-woo)
Cause it won't be the same (woo-woo)

[Bridge: Pharrell Williams]
Hey baby, I'm bananas about you
Oh girl, I lose control
Life would be nuts without you
I got this heart shaped bowl
Cover my soul

Can I have a bite?

[Break: Pharrell Williams]
You know that Harlem isn't here right now
Okay, one two three, stop

[Pre-Chorus: Pharrell Williams (chorus)]
You turn my ovens on (Flame)
You can smell when it's warm (Flame)
Burn the house to the lawn (Flame)
Happen quick as they on (Flame)

[Pre-Chorus: Alicia Keys]
It was Adam and Eve
And the God in the trees
And the snake, oh yeah
Cause everybody is destined
To learn all these lessons alone
Don't be afraid

[Chorus: Alicia Keys (chorus)]
This gon' wake you up (woo-woo)
Smell when it hit the flame (woo-woo)
Hurry 'for it burn up (woo-woo)
Cause it won't be the same (woo-woo)

[Verse 1]
So I heard you found somebody else
And at first, I thought it was a lie
I took all my things that make sounds
The rest I can do without

[Chorus]
I don't want your body
But I hate to think about you with somebody else
Our love has gone cold
You're intertwining your soul with somebody else

I'm looking through you
While you're looking through your phone
And then leaving with somebody else
No, I don't want your body
But I'm picturing your body with somebody else

[Post-Chorus]
I don't want your body, I don't want your body
I don't want your body, I don't (want)

[Verse 2]
C'mon baby (I know)
This ain't the last time that I'll see your face
C'mon baby (I know)
You said you'd find someone to take my place

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I just don't believe that you have got it in you
'Cause we are just gonna keep "doin' it" and every time
I start to believe in anything you're saying
I'm reminded that I should be gettin' over it

[Chorus]
I don't want your body
But I hate to think about you with somebody else
Our love has gone cold
You're intertwining your soul with somebody else

I'm looking through you
While you're looking through your phone
And then leaving with somebody else
No, I don't want your body
But I'm picturing your body with somebody else

[Bridge]
Get someone you love?
Get someone you need?
Fuck that, get money
I can't give you my soul, 'cause we're never alone
Get someone you love?
Get someone you need?
Fuck that, get money
I can't give you my soul, 'cause we're never alone

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
I don't want your body
But I hate to think about you with somebody else
Our love has gone cold
You're intertwining your soul with somebody else

I'm looking through you
While you're looking through your phone
And then leaving with somebody else
No, I don't want your body
But I'm picturing your body with somebody else

[Verse 1]
Stumble up the porch step
You sat down in the car
Only thirteen blocks across this town
To get to where you are
And that don’t offer me much time
To make up my mind
So I best be driving slow
On my way to letting go

[Verse 2]
These headlights they just wanna fade
Off into the night
But if they’re half as stubborn as me
They’ll just keep on shining bright
I ain’t ever been one to settle like
The dust does on the dash
Since the feeling ain’t strong
I’ll just move on
And leave this in my past

[Chorus]
Once you're gone I know your memory'll
Somehow get the best of me
So I question everything I do
Unsure of turning you away
Wonderin' 'bout how I'll feel the day
I see you find somebody new
So I’ve been holding on
Way too long
But not another minute
I'm gonna miss you bad but
Can’t call it love if you ain’t in it

[Verse 3]
Red light turns to green
Then back to red again
I wish there were some other travelers out here
To slow my travelling
Even though the wheel rolled on
Inside I still don’t know
Oh and it troubles me so, oh

[Chorus]
Once you're gone I know your memory'll
Somehow get the best of me
So I question everything I do
Unsure of turning you away
Wonderin' 'bout how I'll feel the day
I see you found somebody new
And I’ve been holding on
Way too long
But not another minute
I might miss you bad but
Can’t call it love if you ain’t in it

[Chorus]
Once you're gone I know your memory'll
Somehow get the best of me
So I question everything I do
Unsure of turning you away
Wonderin' 'bout how I'll feel the day
I see you find somebody new
So I’ve been holding on
Way too long
But not another minute
I'm gonna miss you bad but
Can’t call it love if you ain’t in it

[Outro]
Your car comes to a rest in the drive
You open up the door and I see you smile

[Hook]
I can't even lie, that bitch so bad, lil' mama so thick
The way she throw it back it make you stutter when you hit

[Verse 1]
I'm just tryna fight it off, ain't tryna nut too quick
She make me wanna take her, she's another nigga bitch
A bitch that Gucci Mane can't get, man that bitch don't exist
This dick so good, I take it from her, she might slit her wrist
Bling blaww burr, I put diamonds on her clit
Fucked her in the air, yeah she ride me on the jet
His and her fur, yeah I bought my chick a fit
Like Edward Scissorhands, yeah she cut up on that dick
G-g-g-good God, so why she standing back like a pic?
Spaghetti straps in my Maybach, she showing off her tits
She ran off on the plug, so I'ma smash her at the Ritz
S-skeeted in her mouth so now she talkin' with a lisp

[Hook]
I can't even lie, that bitch so bad lil' mama so thick
The way she throw it back it make you stutter when you hit
I can't even lie, that bitch so bad lil' mama so thick
The way she throw it back it make you stutter when you hit

[Verse 2]
I told her bring a friend with her but she just brought some twins
Three girls and one Gucci Mane goddamn I'm goin' in
All these Franklins on me man I said my name was Ben
Magic City Monday night, I just threw up a ten
Nigga with a attitude I feel like Cube and Ren
These two ice cubes in my ear they cost a quarter M
That pussy hairy scarin' me, goddamn she need to trim
The way that bitch took care of me she might get her a Benz
She suck me 'til it tickle me, slow down the neighbors listenin'
I got on like ten necklaces, you know my diamonds glistenin'
She fucked me then she shot me with her friends, I think she trickin' me
Her nigga know about me but goddamn he can't get rid of me
She st-t-t-stutter step, around the suite in lingerie
I beat it up like MMA she drank it up like Alizé
Eight Latinos in my room I feel like it's the fifth of May
Pull up on the kid, you dig?
But bitch I ain't got time to play

[Hook]
I can't even lie, that bitch so bad lil' mama so thick
The way she throw it back it make you stutter when you hit
I-I can't even lie, that bitch so bad lil' mama so thick
The way she throw it back it make you stutter when you hit
Stutter when you hit
Stutter when you hit
S-s-stutter when you hit
I-I can't even lie, that bitch so bad lil' mama so thick
The way she throw it back it make you stutter when you hit
I-I can't even lie, that bitch so bad lil' mama so thick
The way she throw it back it make you stutter when you hit
I-I
Intro:
Shake’n bake
Nigga ain’t doin’ nothing, just sittin’ here and swaggin
It’s easy though
It’s easy to not give a fuck

Verse 1:
Fresh outta first class
Fresh outta herb nap
My outfit straight outta fur
So fresh to death
My car from overseas
The steering wheel on the other side
I’m givin’ it
All I got is smokin’ what’s left
So much money on weed
So much smoke in my chest
I take the lessons I learned
And put ’em all in my flesh
Tatted, got a strong weed habit
Going hard, could have sworn you niggas had it
Buying champaign with the tabins
We order more drinks, bring the cabs in
Rip up jeans, call it fashion
A lot of cash and a lot of gras
You niggas broke, you ain’t gotta pass
Chanel bags and I’m proud of tags
Spendin’ stash, you ain’t gotta stack
Young and rich, don’t know how to act
As the wheels keep spinnin’ and my joint keep burning
And my team keep winnin’


Chorus:
Roll up, whats the hold up
Roll up, whats the hold up

Verse 2:
Thinking ’bout some shit, that rap taught me
Sittin’ in a whip, that rap bought me
Look at all the things, that I’m affording
My nigga mean I’m ballin’ like a sports team
You doin’ some shit, you think is flossin’
I was doing that back, when I was fourteen
Gettin’ it, buying the most, flippin’ it
Sixteen, time to pay rent in this bitch
I wasn’t even thinking of making millions
I was just thinking smokin’ and chillin’
And trying to pay the bills
Try get my mom out of this building
And I got my mom out of this building
I never took a hand out
Matter fact I put my hand in
Now everything you see is planned by me
Boss of my own shit, TAYLOR GANG E.N.T
Nothing but that cali strong
Gettin’ blown by the pound, bitch TNT
Chorus:
Roll up, whats the hold up
Roll up, whats the hold up

[Chorus 1]
Trying to understand the way I've been behaving
It's a funny thing you really gotta see
Is it just your love that's got me going crazy
Or my eyes playing with me

[Verse 1]
(Heat, heat)
All day your love just come shining down
(Heat, heat)
Just like the sweat just beats (sweat just beating)
(Heat, heat)
I feel you from my root to my crown
(Heat, heat)
Just like

[Chorus 2]
From my caramel that's right beside me
My mind is carousel that's how he rides me
So there's no parallel 

[?]
Y'all know me very well
It's yellow lighting

[Chorus 1]
Trying to understand the way I've been behaving
(I been behaving)
It's a funny thing you really gotta see (gotta see)
Is it just your love that's got me going crazy (crazy)
Or my eyes playing with me (playing with me)

[Verse  2]
(Heat, heat)
All night he's traveling through my body
(Heat, heat)
He do it on his knees (on his knees)
(Heat, heat)
Without his love, I'd be cold and starving
(Heat, heat)
He's my H-O-M-E

[Chorus 2]
From my caramel that's right beside me
My mind is carousel that's how he rides me
So there's no parallel 

[?]
Y'all know me very well
It's yellow lighting

[Chorus 1]
Trying to understand the way I've been behaving
(I been behaving)
It's a funny thing you really gotta see (gotta see)
Is it just your love that's got me going crazy (crazy)
Or my eyes playing with me (playing with me)

[Bridge]
Just like a mirage
I love you like you were 

[gone?]

I love you like you were 

[gone?]
Just like a mirage
I love you like you were 

[gone?]
Just like a mirage

Sorry baby
For the what-ifs and maybes
I take it too far
I know I must be looking crazy

I'm sorry baby
For the what-ifs and maybes
I take it too far
You know I must be looking crazy

[Chorus 1]
Trying to understand the way I've been behaving
(I been behaving)
It's a funny thing you really gotta see (gotta see)
Is it just your love that's got me going crazy (crazy)
Or my eyes playing with me (playing with me)

[Outro]
I spend many nights on my knees praying (my knees praying)
From the side effects of all this heat (this gorgeous heat)
But I'm telling y'all 

[?] (

[?])
Or are my eyes playing with me

[Verse 1]
I don’t know why I keep moving my body
I don’t know if this is wrong or if it’s right
I don’t know if there’s a beat, or something’s taking over me
And I just know I’ll feel so good tonight

[Verse 2]
I don’t know what your name is but I like it
I’ve been thinking ‘bout some things I wanna try
I don’t know what you came to do, but I wanna do it with you
And I just know I’ll feel so good tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, if we keep on dancing
Take our rhythm to new heights
Feel the heat of passion, baby
Light up the night

[Chorus]
We could start a fire
Come on, let it burn baby
We could start a fire
Let the tables turn baby
We could start a fire

[Bridge]
I just know I feel so good
Don’t you know I feel so good
I just know I feel so good
Tonight

[Verse 3]
I don’t care if this turns into a riot
Lets get reckless, tear this place down to the floor
Turn the music way up loud
Can’t nobody stop us now
I just know I feel so good tonight
I just know I feel so good tonight

[Chorus]
We could start a fire
Come on, let it burn baby
We could start a fire
Let the tables turn baby
We could start a fire

[Outro]
I just know I feel so good
Don’t you know I feel so good
Don’t you know, don’t you know?
Tonight

Ask the flowers, ask the snow
It is even deeper than the ocean can go
Can you image

[Refrain: Pharrell Williams, (Chorus)]

My baby daddy a crooked cop
I know it's stupid but I cannot stop
I like the way that you move the stick
And every way when you make it sick, ah-ah

[Verse 2]
He got a bad reputation on the streets, but
In the house you're like a bag full of sweets, what?
He says I'm his snowflake ice queen, oh
I just can't, 'cause he treat me so mean, oh

[Outro]
Ah-ah-ah-ah, I like it
Ah-ah-ah-ah, I like it
Ah-ah-ah-ah, I like it, ooh

[Intro]
Money is the anthem of success
So before we go out, what's your address?

[Verse 1]
I'm the national anthem
God, you're so handsome
Take me to the Hamptons, Bugatti Veyron
He loves to romance 'em
Reckless abandon
Holding me for ransom, upper echelon
He says to be cool, but I don't know how yet
Wind in my hair
Hand on the back of my neck
I said, "Can we party later on", he said "Yes, yes, yes..."
(Of course we can, my darling)

[Chorus]
And I want it all
I want the rings and bling and the sweet skyline
Yeah, I want it all (from you)
I wanna sing, wanna swing on the stage and shine
Yeah, I want it all
I want my dreams, want the things that love can't buy
Yeah, I want it all (from you)
Bye, bye, baby
Bye, bye, bye

[Refrain 1]
Money is the reason we exist
Eveybody knows it, it's a fact kiss, kiss

[Verse 2]
I sing the national anthem
While I'm standing over your body, hold you like a python
And you can't keep your hands off me or your pants on
See what you've done to me, King of Chevron
He says to be cool, but I'm already coolest
I said to get real
Don't you know who you're dealing with?
Um, do you think you'll buy me lots of diamonds?
(Yes, of course I will my darling)

[Chorus]
And I want it all
I want the rings and bling and the sweet skyline
Yeah, I want it all (from you)
I wanna sing, wanna swing on the stage and shine
Yeah, I want it all
I want my dreams, want the things that love can't buy
Yeah, I want it all (from you)
Bye, bye, baby
Bye, bye, bye

[Bridge]
It's a love story for the new age
For the sixth page
We're on a quick, sick rampage
Wining and dining, drinking and driving
Excessive buying, overdose and dying
On our drugs, and our love, and our dreams, and our rage
Blurring the lines between real and the fake
Dark and lonely, I need somebody to hold me
He will do very well
I can tell, I can tell
Keep me safe in his belltower hotel

[Refrain 2]
Money is the anthem of success
So put on mascara and your party dress

[Verse 3]
I'm the national anthem
Boy, put your hands up
Give me a standing ovation
Boy, you have landed
Babe, in the land of sweetness and danger
Queen of Saigon
He says to be cool and I know he means it
He's loving my look
And I'm loving all his strategic ways
I said "do you think you'll kill for me one day?"
(Yes, of course I will, my darling)

[Chorus]
And I want it all
I want the rings and bling and the sweet skyline
Yeah, I want it all (from you)
I wanna sing, wanna swing on his stage and shine
Yeah, I want it all
I want my dreams, want the things that love can't buy
Yeah, I want it all (from you)
Bye, bye, baby
Bye, bye, bye

[Outro]
Money is the anthem
God, you're so handsome
Money is the anthem of success
Money is the anthem
God, you're so handsome
Money is the anthem of success
I'm your national anthem, national anthem
I'm your national anthem, national anthem

Look into the glass
Mirror ball
Everybody has reason to fall
The world is round
And heavy in my mouth

Living in the past
Time is lost
I know I have made mistakes
Hiding in the dark
The world is small
Through my mirrorball

It's over now
Go on, tear me apart
Am I a ghost?
Give me something to hold
Can't fall asleep
You're all I see
Am I a ghost?
Spinning out of control
Looking for some action...
Opposite attraction
The world is small
The world is small
Through my mirrorball

It's over now
Go on, tear me apart
Am I a ghost?
Give me something to hold
Can't fall asleep
You're all I see
Am I a ghost?
Spinning out of control

The wait is over now
I finally figured out
(we are the ghost) 

[x6]
And I told ya, I told ya I know...

Cuz I told ya!
Told ya I know

Bitches dancin' naked in my livin' room
She straight out of college, just turned 22
Girl, get your money up, I ain't even mad at you
Got you all on me, makin' these niggas catchin' attitudes
Tell 'em don't start it, my niggas retarded
Fuck the judge and the sentence, huh, I got a good lawyer

Lil mama booty boomin', that bitch movin' and she standin' still
I know these bitches choosin' me, but I got 80 on me still

If you can't hear what I'm trying to say
If you can't read from the same page
Maybe I'm going deaf
Maybe I'm going blind
Maybe I'm out of my mind

[Bridge: Robin Thicke]
Ok, now he was close
Tried to domesticate you
But she's an animal
Baby, it's in your nature
Just let me liberate you
You don't need no papers
That man is not your maker
And that's why I'm gon' take a

[Hook: Robin Thicke]
Good girl
I know you want it
I know you want it
I know you want it
You're a good girl

I hate these blurred lines
I know you want it
I know you want it
I know you want it
But you're a good girl
The way you grab me
Must wanna get nasty
Go ahead, get at me

[Verse 2: Robin Thicke]
What do they make dreams for
When you got them jeans on
What do we need steam for
Iggy, you the hottest bitch in this place!

[Verse 3: Iggy Azalea]
Pull out, step up, no line, get in
No frequency, you gon' get in
Get out tonight, the night beginning
Tomorrow night, do this again
If it look this good then it can't be bad
No time for the wife life, can't be there
But if you really doubt what I'm 'bout
Then getcho ass in the back and 

[?] backing me out
Then it's vroom vroom whenever we want

You know I only deal with bosses
My swag shawty 

[?] shawty bad and 

[?]
You know I only deal with bosses

[?] Flossin 

[?] by midnight I'm exhausted

[Verse]
Too many best-rappers, not enough best-rhymes, though
Guess I'm delusional, used to doing it all the time, so
Maybe I'm just jaded, out of touch and unrelated
Unable to connect greatness based on the person who makes it
Or maybe I just hate it
And that would make me hater
Maybe it is great but that don't mean it's greater
Having your profile raised doesn't make you a raiser
Being ambiguous with assertions, isn't making you safer
What you mean, though?
Line us up, paddling us on the back
Like we steamboat, you president of the frat
You goin' sling toast, like you Ringo
And you think Doc Holliday's
Just goin' tolerate and too sick to let that thing go
It's just a matter of returns
Ashes to ashes, scattered them from the urns
To start a fire shaky to gather them from the burned
And reassemble these ashes, the blackness is something firm
Then moving blackness backwards in the bread of some other shit
Any deep we spreadin' wheat seeds from a bucket shit
McDonald had a farm and he lovin' it
Rolls Royce of the scented voice against the arms of the government
Artists gettin' robbed for their publishing
By dirty Jewish execs that think his alms from the covenant
I'll retire when I'm tired, that's a Firestone death
Easy to say when nobody's there, like a microphone check
They wanna hear what I'm gon' say before the microphone check
Make me sign an NDA before the microphone test
'Less you face that type of faith, institutional opposition
Then with all due respect, you are not my competition
Nah

I had forgiven you
For tricking me again
But I have been tricked again
Into forgiving you

What is this?
Are you some kind of hypnotist?
Waving your powers around
The sun eclipse behind the cloud

Amongst all of those strangers

She keeps watching for the jaguar

She forgets about the fear

[Chorus]
When she's high
When she's high

They remind her how the animals and trees and insects call
Is it wrong not to believe
Nature makes us all complete
Daggers

Wanna get high, trippy, fucked up nigga
Oh you tryna get high, might as well pull with ya

I'm the money man with the money team
Your money talk, well my money sing
I'm a rock star, bitch I'm a Memphis king
Out in Hollywood, livin' every nigga dream
With a bunch of white girls in a limousine
'Bout to pass the fuck out on this cup of lean
Hey white girl, have a couple of beans

These issues included bullying, supporting teachers, modernizing curriculums, and violence in Chicago.

Gave the waitress three hundred just to pour the shots
Picture perfect how I hold the pot (skrt)

Drop a kilo on your head make your neck break (dang)

Well have you ever stopped to wonder how they do Christmas there down under?
How do they make Christmas nice, when they ain't got no snow  and ice?
And what about poor Santa's sleigh?
He has to come from fucking miles away
And what about Mick Dundee?
Well he ain't got no Christmas tree

[Chorus]
Well they say, Christmas here is so much fun
We got surfing, we got sun
Christmas here's sweet as a peach
Opening presents on the beach
We got barbies, we got beer
Santa wishes he lived here
Loads of laughter, loads of booze
Christmas with the kangaroos

[Verse 2]
Well have you ever stopped to wonder how they do Christmas there down under?
Have you ever stopped to think "Do they have much pumpkin drink?"
Oh don't you just find it shocking?
Have you got Tim Tams in your stocking?
Do you wonder where Jesus was born?
No, they got Kylie, they got Shane Warne

[Chorus]
They all say Christmas here is so much fun
We got surfing, we got sun
Christmas here's sweet as a peach
Opening presents on the beach
Yeah 'cause got barbies, we got beer
Santa wishes he lived here
Loads of laughter, loads of booze
Christmas with the kangaroos

Loads of laughter, loads of booze
That's Christmas with the kangaroos
Well I can't stop working
'Cause I like to work
When nothing else is going on

It's bad for the body
But it's good for the soul
Might even keep you breathing
When you lose control

Can't stop working
Can't stop working

Where've I been
For all these years
I thought I knew you better
Come on down to the edge of the sea today
And write a letter there in the sand

Forgiveness
Forgiveness
I can't stop working

Well I can't stop working
'Cause I like to work
When nothing else is going on

It's bad for the body
But it's good for the soul
Might even keep me breathing
When I lose  control

Can't stop working
Can't stop working

I might take some time off
I can't stop working
Might take time off for forgiveness
Forgiveness

I can't stop working
Terrorist suicide hang gliders
In the sky above you can't see
Hidden there in the darkness
Behind the reasons that you're free

I got news along the way
That I bring to you with sorrow
I never knew 'till yesterday
My life would end tomorrow

I think I know who to blame
It's all those people with funny names
Moving in to our neighborhood
How can I tell if they're bad or good?

Terrorist suicide hang gliders
In the sky above you can't see
Hidden there in the darkness
Behind the reasons that you're free
John Oaks is in the neighborhood
Protecting all the trees
He's the master of irrigation
And he knows what he sees
Great farmers watering everywhere
Pipes running where they please

John sees his laws are broken
Trees drowning where they breathe
Now John used to be a mellow man
Drinking chai and smoking weed
Ain't no one in the county
Ever seen what he seen

John Oaks
John Oaks
John Oaks
John Oaks

Old John rides in his pickup
With rakes and friends in the back
Workers he takes with him
Then he drives them all back
To protect them from the politicians
Using them to get ahead
Preying on the people
Trying to get inside their heads
John Oaks is really stand up
He won't take shit lying down
He calls it like he sees it
And he puts his money down
John Oaks
John Oaks

One day at the demonstration
John Oaks was standing up
He arrive there at the location
In his old pickup truck
Took a rake in his hand
And his workers by his side
Stood there waiting for his turn
To speak and turn the tide
When he found himself surrounded
By police everywhere
They tried to take his workers to jail
When he grabbed one by his hair

John Oaks
John Oaks
John Oaks
John Oaks

Shots rang out and people yelled
As the police took control
Shot a black man right where he fell
With a sniper on the knoll
John Oaks saw law and order
Was leading him astray
Tried to get back in his pickup
With his workers to get away
That's when the police moved in
And stood there in his way
John started up his pickup
And that was his last day
John Oaks
John Oaks
John Oaks
John Oaks

They said he had a pistol
When the old pickup backfired
And they shot him there behind the wheel
And then John Oaks expired
The workers grabbed the rakes
And that's all that I can say
They went to the cemetery
And they stay there to this day

John Oaks

Woke up this morning
To a glass accident
Glass fell in love with the floor
Too many pieces there for me to clean up
So I left a warning message by the door

"Danger" on a scary skulls and crossbones
A piece of paper on the floor
Covered broken pieces of a love dream lingering there
That could do some damage for ever more

Just imagine what could go wrong
And how some lives could change forever
If you're not careful how you handle delicate things
But now is better than never

There was a lingering hope
That made it through the dark night
And threatened everything thereafter
A hope that was confusing
Looking like a bright light
Blinding you forever with its power
Woke up this morning to a glass accident
Glass fell in love with the floor
Too many pieces there for me to clean up
So I left a warning message by the door
It's a lonely cup of coffee
'Cause my baby's gone
Someone has to work
I know that's true
Carpenters bring ladders
I bring love to you
Their working day beginning under skies of blue
Is just now getting started
And I'm sitting under a tree
Singing a song and thinking of you
My life has been so lucky
The package has arrived
I got my new robot from Amazon.com
Unpacking it now
I have a sense of pride
I'm going online to program it for you

[Intro]
Yah you know
Niggas don't really want drama
I'm just trying to live
Go out, hang out, have a little fun
Shit always gets wild, always

[Verse 1]
Its Saturday night
I'm rolling with my bitch and my niggas
Well known ghetto-grown Glock rocking street figures
Their cars trailing
I'm rolling in the front with my bitch for life
You can call her my wife
The four in the back in the blacked out 'lac
They high off the yak and they dusted too
Streets call 'em killers but I call them my crew
Some niggas wear red, my niggas wear blue
Step through the door, niggas can't help but feel us
Faggots tuck their jewels, bitches trying to see us
Led us to the back, put us up in a booth
Got vodka and cran, Jagermeifer to shoot
Coco started dancing, everything was fine
'Til some nigga said that table was supposed to be mine
I was feeling good, ain't paying him no mind
'Til the nigga got wild, threw a bottle of wine

[Bridge]
3, 2, mother
3, 2, father
3, 2, sister
3, 2, brother
No time to pray

[Verse 2]
The shit just missed me and my niggas kicked in
Blade swing the razor and he opened his skin
These niggas wasn't having it, gangstas too
Mother fuckers started shooting, lighting up the room
(?) wore a vest and it went right through
They bodied Big Wrench, what the fuck Imma do?
Flip the table up, me and Coco hit the back door
These niggas wasn't done, these niggas want more
Fell off in the cut like a video game
Pulled my strap took my aim, make the door my frame
Everybody that stepped out, that body got flamed
I knew I was bleeding, I could feel the pain
Broke out, had to get behind the wheel
Running through the parking lot, Coc broke her heel
I started getting dizzy as I clenched my gat
I made it to my whip, I was shot in the back

[Bridge]
3, 2, mother
3, 2, father
3, 2, sister
3, 2, brother
No time to pray
Jumped in the car, laid across the backseat
Coc grabbed the wheel, I was really starting to leak
Halfway out the lock got blocked, its back on
Some niggas in a blue Seville with a grill
Hopped in the stash by going for dolo
Its  extra big but it packs a fully auto
Blast through my own glass, should have heard the sound
It was on bitch, no time to roll shit down
Hit the corner, see my niggas Smitty and Mick
The was rolling toward the club when they heard 'bout the shit
Didn't have to tell 'em they just a block up the street
Cops on the way, still ain't throwing my heat
Don't even know why the fuck I'm out here dealing with beef
Just went out for some drinks in the club with my peeps
My two boys are dead, I seen 'em fall at my feet
And I'm shot the fuck up bleeding all on my seat
Ice-T VI: Return of the Real
Real is a word people don't really want to deal with
Real is the difference from the way things should be and the way things are
Things should be beautiful and everybody should get along
But things are really fucked up
Opportunity isn't available to everybody
Motherfuckers do go to jail
Men and women do not always get along
A woman doesn't think twice about referring to a man as a dog
But then breaks down when she's called a bitch
That's really fucked up
Real
The first four letters of reality
You ready to get there?
That's what it's all about
A lot of my homies are really incarcerated or locked up
In federal penitentiaries or state institutions and will never come home
This album is dedicated to them
And my homies that have died and passed on in the past few years
Really never get a chance to hear this record
My music is designed for the individuals out there who are ready to deal with the truth
The truth is that anything that is alive
Will do whatever it has to do to remain alive
It's called survival
And no matter how cold and fucked up it may seem
That's real

[Intro]
No, no, no, no, no, no, yeah, yeah
No, no, no, no, no, no, yeah, yeah
No, no, no, no, no, no, yeah, yeah
No, no, no, no, no, no, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Couldn't tell a lie, I been did mine
So I figured I'd be off to take off to somewhere new (Ahh), hey
And make some memories (Ahh), yeah
In the middle of the night
I'm standin' in the moon's beam
Blowin' off some steam
Wonderin' how I got so done with the high
Not so pleased (Ahh)
No I wouldn't let it show (Ahh)
I always try and outrun my pride
And it keeps close
You very well know you can't run from who you are (Ahh)
Oh you soon see (Ahh)
I tune my mind, body, soul so close
To find out how I'm supposed to walk through the faces of flames (Ahh), hey
Oh, you're in control (Ahh)

[Chorus]
So in control
No, no, no, no, no, no, yeah, yeah
No, no, no, no, no, no, yeah, yeah
So in control
No, no, no, no, no, no, yeah, yeah
Ohh
No, no, no, no, no, no, yeah, yeah

[Post-Chorus]
You are
(Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo)
The commander
(Nah-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah)
You are
(Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo)
The commander

[Verse 2]
Tryna catch a vibe, starin' at the light
And I gotta make it count
To leap bounds
Soarin' over trees (Ahh)
Oh look at me go (Ahh)
In the middle of the day
I hear it in the prophecy, can't come down
It grows in my heart, not knowin' where it goes
Search through pain (Ahh)
And the wishes with the rain (Ahh)
I seem to deny all that blinding light
That only glows to those that really can't run
On just who they are (Ahh)
It's clear as can be (Ahh)
No need to lie into your emerald soul
You surely know gold is always in your glow
Why not let it shine? (Ahh), hey
You're in control of the dream (Ahh)

[Chorus]
You're so in control
No, no, no, no, no, no, yeah, yeah
So in control
No, no, no, no, no, no, yeah, yeah
So in control
No, no, no, no, no, no, yeah, yeah
No, no, no, no, no, no, yeah, yeah

[Post-Chorus]
You are
(Mmh, mmh)
The commander
(La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la)
You are
(Nah-nah, nah-nah)
The commander
(You're in control)
You are

[Intro]
(What goes around, yeah
Comes around, yeah)

[Verse 1]
I've had my eyes on you
For three long years
When no one else wanted you
I took you in and held you near
But then you drifted away (Drifted away)
After you said you'd always stay (Always stay)
How could you be so mean and untrue?
He didn't want you until he'd seen
What my love did for you, yeah (Did for you)

[Chorus]
Ooh baby, what goes around, comes around
I knew he'd soon be gone
Yeah baby, he put you down, now you're the clown
And you want me to come back home
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2]
I've had no love affairs
For three long years (Three long years)
Remember how I used to care
When you were down, I dried your tears (Dried your tears)
Who did you think was the fool?
I let you treat me so cruel
This is the moment of truth for you
Do you think your playing is through?
I don't think I can trust you

[Chorus]
Ooh baby, what goes around, comes around
I knew he'd soon be gone
Yeah baby, he put you down, now you're the clown
And you want me to come back home?
Yeah, yeah, yeah

What goes around, comes around
He put you down, now you're the clown
(Goes around, yeah
Comes around, yeah)

[Bridge]
(I've had my eyes on you
For three long years
When no one else wanted you
I took you in and held you near, yeah)

[Chorus]
Ooh baby, what goes around, comes around
I knew he'd soon be gone
Now, now, baby, he put you down, now you're the clown
And you want me to come back home?
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Outro]
Ooh baby, what goes around, comes around
He put you down, now you're the clown (Clown, ooh)
(Don't you know, don't you know, don't you know, don't you know)

Yeah, yeah, baby, what goes around, comes around
He put you down, now you're the clown, yeah (Clown, ooh)
(Don't you know, don't you know, don't you know, don't you know)

Na na na na na na, baby, what goes around

[Verse 1]
It won't be easy, you'll think it's strange
When I try to explain how I feel
That I still need your love after all that I've done
You won't believe me
All you will see is a girl you once knew
Although she's dressed up to the nines
At sixes and sevens with you

[Verse 2]
I had to let it happen, I had to change
Couldn't stay all my life down at heel
Looking out of the window, staying out of the sun
So I chose freedom
Running around, trying everything new
But nothing impressed me at all
I never expected it to

[Chorus]
Don't cry for me Argentina
The truth is I never left you
All through my wild days
My mad existence
I kept my promise
Don't keep your distance

[Verse 3]
And as for fortune, and as for fame
I never invited them in
Though it seemed to the world they were all I desired
They are illusions
They're not the solutions they promised to be
The answer was here all the time
I love you and hope you love me

[Chorus]
Don't cry for me Argentina
Don't cry for me Argentina
The truth is I never left you
All through my wild days
My mad existence
I kept my promise
Don't keep your distance

[Outro]
Have I said too much?
There's nothing more I can think of to say to you
But all you have to do is look at me to know
That every word is true
First of all I wanna uhm, I wanna say thank you to Labyrinth, that was an amazing, amazing performance. Can I put this down? Sorry, seriously. It's better this way. Ahh, I always feel better with something hard between my legs.

I stand before you as a doormat. Oh, I mean, as a female entertainer. Thank you for acknowledging my ability to continue my career for 34 years in the face of blatant misogyny, sexism, constant bullying and relentless abuse. When I started there was no internet, so people had to say it to my face. There were very few people I had to clap back at because life was simpler then.

When I first moved to New York, I was a teenager. It was 1979 and New York was a very scary place. In the first year I was held at gunpoint, raped on a rooftop with a knife digging into my throat and I had my apartment broken into and robbed so many times I just stopped locking the door. In the years to follow, I lost almost every friend I had to AIDS or drugs or gunshot. People were dying of AIDS everywhere. It wasn’t safe to be gay, it wasn’t cool to be associated with the gay community.

As you can imagine, all these unexpected events not only helped me become the daring woman that stands before you, but it also reminded me that I'm vulnerable. And in life there is no real safety except self-belief. And an understanding that I'm not the owner of my talents. I'm not the owner of anything. Everything I have is a gift from God. And even the shitty fucked up things that happened to me, that still happen to me, are also gifts to teach me lessons and make me stronger.

I'm receiving an award for being woman of the year, so I ask myself "what can I say about being a woman in the music business? What can I say about being a woman?".

When I first started writing songs, I didn't think in a gender-specific way. I didn't think about feminism. I just wanted to be an artist. I was of course inspired by Debbie Harry and Chrissie Hynde and Aretha Franklin, but my real muse was David Bowie. He embodied male and female spirit and that suited me just fine. He made me think there were no rules. But I was wrong. There are no rules - if you're a boy.

If you're a girl, you have to play the game. What is that game? You're allowed to be pretty and cute and sexy. But don’t act too smart. Don’t have an opinion. Don't have an opinion that is out of line with the status quo at least. You are allowed to be objectified by men and dress like a slut, but don’t own your sluttiness. And do not, I repeat do not, share your own sexual fantasies with the world. Be what men want you to be, but more importantly, be what women feel comfortable with you being around other men. And finally, do not age. Because to age is a sin. You will be criticized. You will be vilified. And you will definitely not be played on the radio.

When I first became famous, there were nude photos of me in Playboy and Penthouse magazine. Photos that were taken from art schools where I posed for back in the day to make money.  They weren't very sexy. In fact I looked quite bored. I was. But I was expected to feel ashamed when these photos came out, but I was not. And this puzzled people.

Eventually I was left alone because I married Sean Penn, and not only would he would bust a cap in your ass, but I was off the market. So for a while I was not considered a threat. Years later, divorced and single - sorry, Sean - I made my Erotica album and my Sex book was released. I remember being the headline of every newspaper and magazine. And everything I read about myself was damning. I was called a whore and a witch. One headline compared me to Satan. I said, "Wait a minute, isn't Prince running around with fishnets and high heels and lipstick with his butt hanging out?' Yes, he was. But he was a man. This was the first time I truly understood that women really did not have the same freedom as men.

I remember feeling paralyzed. It took me a while to pull myself together and get on with my creative life. Get on with my life. I took comfort in the poetry of Maya Angelou, and the writings of James Baldwin, and in the music of Nina Simone.

I remember wishing that I had a female peer I could look to for support. Camille Paglia, the famous feminist writer, said that I set women back by objectifying myself sexually. "Oh", I thought, "so if you're a feminist, you don't have sexuality, you deny it." So I said "fuck it. I'm a different kind of feminist. I'm a bad feminist."
People say that I'm so controversial. But I think the most controversial thing I have ever done is to stick around. Michael is gone. Tupac is gone. Prince is gone. Whitney is gone. Amy Winehouse is gone. David Bowie is gone. But I'm still standing. I'm one of the lucky ones and every day I count my blessings.

What I would like to say to all women here today is this: Women have been so oppressed for so long, they believe what men have to say about them. And they believe they have to back a man to get the job done. And there are some very good men worth backing, but not because they're men - because they're worthy. As women, we have to start appreciating our own worth and each other's worth. Seek out strong women to befriend, to align yourself with, to learn from, to be inspired by, to collaborate with, to support, to be enlightened by.

As I said before, it's not so much about receiving this award as it is having this opportunity to stand before you and really say thank you, as a woman, as an artist, as a human. Not only to the people who have loved and supported me along the way, you have no idea... you have no idea how much your support means.

But to the doubters and naysayers and everyone who gave me hell and said I could not, that I would not, that I must not - your resistance made me stronger, made me push harder, made me the fighter that I am today. Made me the woman that I am today. So thank you.

If Young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon' shoot you

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
I got so many felonies, I might can't never go to Canada
But Drake said he gon' pull some strings, so let me check my calendar
I just popped me one of them one what-you-call-its and it boosted my stamina
Now I'm fucking her on the banister, guess I just East Atlanta'd her
I'm in an all-red drop tarantula, fuck a Challenger
Damn these hoes ain't got no manners, bruh, where's the manager?
I keep throwing rubber bandies up, ho, pull your panties up
'Cause you fuck like a granny fuck, you're just an amateur
This Patek Philippe gon' make this crooked judge try throw the book at me
I look like half a million worth of heroin when she look at me
But you ain't gotta fuck with me, my nig, but you're stuck with me
But how you called the cops on me, my nig? You grew up with me

[Chorus: Drake]
I don't usually do this 'less I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now, got me talking about my life
I don't usually do this 'less I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now
I don't usually do this 'less I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now and I need ya in my life
I don't usually do this 'less I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now

[Verse 2: Drake]
Yeah, I'm both
Yeah, I had a drink, yeah, I smoked
Yeah, you think I need you but I don't
Just left out Dubai with all my folk
Open water, my location is remote
Shout-out Yachty but this ain't a lil' boat
This some shit I wrote about when I was broke
See, the power of the mind is not a joke
Man, I said that I would do it and I did
Used to get left-overs out the fridge
Nobody was famous where I lived
'Til I got it jumping at the crib
Took a lot to be able to give, I mean

[Chorus: Drake]
I don't usually do this 'less I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now, got me talking about my life
I don't usually do this 'less I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now
I don't usually do this 'less I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now and I need ya in my life
I don't usually do this 'less I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now

[Verse 1]
Now my watch so fuckin' bright
It look like sunlight in the night
I shit on rappers, I shit on athletes
Me and Floyd should book a fight
I'm a sight to see for sore eyes your hoe should book a flight
Versace frames so call me Forbes
I done fucked every hoe I like
I'm so charming all these tinted chains
I didn't even wear a charm
She like Bentley bracelets what's that on your arm
You didn't have to speak offensive cause my watch is so expensive women get so damn defensive
They love me like kids love Christmas
I'm young active and attractive
Nonchalant but I'm persistent
I can get any bitch I want
But I'm so motherfuckin' picky
I'm a very picky person been like that since I was hurtin'
You can't tell me anything, bitch, you gotta be for certain

[Verse 2]
I'm a fed target, on the red carpet
In a whip so new valet scared to park it
Not a average artist, an elaborate artist
My collabs turn locals to established artists
In the strip club chillin' so nonchalant
Cause all these hoes bleed once a month (huh)
I give a chick a couple hundred just to leave me alone
A little hush money so she don't ask me none
I still get love from the EA (six)
But I got no love from the DA
I see the DJ run it back like a punt return
I guess I still get love from the DJs
But I got no love for you fuckboys
You still  caught up in the he-say she-say
I send love to my niggas on lock down
A lot of them ain't got no release date
The J's love it how I whip it till my wrist ache
Bitch say that she in love with my mixtapes
Baby if you love me like you say that you do
Then you'll take these ten bricks to your ribcage
All the young niggas call me an OG
But I don't ever reminisce about the old days
I don't want nothin' old but a bankroll
I outgrew oldschools at a young age (it's Wop)

[Hook]
In the strip club chillin' so nonchalant

In the strip club chillin', In the strip club chillin'

You ain't caught no body, nigga, you ain't shot nobody, nigga

I don't need no niggas to like me, bitch I'm a grown man
Let me give you a lesson, Guwop I'm Bouldercrestin'
You and all them non smokers go to the non smokin' section
We see them choppers blammin', fuck all that Instagramin'
You think you was killin' Cam Newton the way that nigga scramblin'
Partner that's your life you gambling, 'bout to cause a stampede
Pussy 'bout to leave his ho in the club, tryna run away from me
Better have a plan B, you understand me

Let me just say this out the gate:

They want me to apologize, but I can't
You can talk about homicides, but I can't
You pillow-talking to these bitches, but I can't
You niggas snitchin' on your partners, but I can't
You let a nigga disrespect you, but I can't
You might can turn the other cheek, but I can't
You suckers rockin' fake jewelry, but I can't
I know they wait for me to fall, but I can't

[Verse 2]
Oh that's your girl? That's your world, I'm with her tonight
A rich nigga smilin' at you, It's so pearly white
It's the burr (burr burr burr) rockin' fur tonight
I'm Michael Kors to the floor, call me sir tonight
Think what you wanna think, but you can't break a bank, fool
Can't let a nigga go, she know I keep her bank roll
She wanna start a home with me, but I can't
She think that I'm her cup of tea, but I ain't
See, I'm the type to think his shit doesn't stink
The new ice scream “Master P,” without the tank
Fresh out the boat, but she's a freaky, not a saint
A stowaway, so I'ma make her walk the plank

[Hook]
They want me to apologize, but I can't
You can talk about homicides, but I can't
You pillow-talking to these bitches, but I can't
You niggas snitchin' on your partners, but I can't
You let a nigga disrespect you, but I can't
You might can turn the other cheek, but I can't
You suckers rockin' fake jewelry, but I can't
I know they wait for me to fall, but I can't

[Verse 3]
I'm on that rich nigga shit, I drop some bread on that bitch
All these stones, man you'd think we're more than Fred in this bitch
I done shown this bitch so much, that I got scared of this bitch
She done seen so many mils I might go fed if she snitch
I need a mistress, the type to give me head 'til she sick
I told her, "please stop sucking on me," I was begging the bitch
I was worth like half a million when I came in this shit
I'm a eight figure nigga now, I'm trained for this shit
Back to all these rocks on me, I look like Hov and Dame in this bitch
My life's a documentary, I feel like Game in this shit
So many of my partners turned state I'm so ashamed of my clique
But I can't never be a snitch, I'm too well-trained for this shit

[Hook]
They want me to apologize, but I can't
You can talk about homicides, but I can't
You pillow-talking to these bitches, but I can't
You niggas snitchin' on your partners, but I can't
You let a nigga disrespect you, but I can't
You might can turn the other cheek, but I can't
You suckers rockin' fake jewelry, but I can't
I know they wait for me to fall, but I can't

[Intro: Gucci Mane]
Ricky Racks
It's the return, East Atlanta, Santa!

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Off the wall, off the chain
Off the top, I'm off the leash
So many freaks coming by the spot
Had to move, I broke the lease
I'm a dog, street gorilla
Going ape shit, I'm a beast
You feeling froggish, nigga jump
Got that pump on me, capiche?
I'm complete, can't compete
Pussy nigga check my physique
I'm a freak, made 3 albums in 6 months
I'm so unique, I'm elite
I'm prestigious, got two hoes in the Saint Regis
And all day all I dream about is sex
That's why I got on Yeezys
The Trap god but I love Jesus
Jesus, Jesus, Goodness gracious
All these sauce it's getting contagious
Done in Vegas stays in Vegas
Punchanella Punchanella
Put a brick down put it back together
Cash and dope go hand in hand
Hand you the yay, hand me the bags
It's Gucci!

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
I'm the Trap God and I walk on water
I'm the Trap God and I walk on water
I'm the Trap God and I walk on water
I'm the Trap God and I walk on water
Neck like water
Wrists like water
Earrings, fingers and they look like water
Just bought a house and it's right by water
I'm the Trap God and I walk on water
I'm the Trap God and I walk on water
I'm the Trap God and I walk on water
I'm the Trap God and I walk on water
I'm the Trap God and I walk on water

Wrists like water
Earrings, fingers and they look like water
Just bought a house and it's right by water
I'm the Trap God and I walk on water

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
G-Gucci Mane I'm the water man
Make it rain, do the water dance
Water dripping like the faucet drip
Hit ten hoes on my Florida trip
Like 21 Savage I slaughtered it
Thirty thousand dollars I ordered it
Like Dae Dae, I spend this shit
Like Lil Uzi Vert, I'm dripping it
You can walk on water too if have faith in me
I got high paid killers, you safe with me
Set me up on first date, don't wait on me
I'm a human highlight, First Take with me
If you got a Don, who needs a Wraith?
If you got a bank, who needs a safe?
Buy the restaurant, who needs a chef?
My game's too official, who needs a ref?
When the Wopter call, don't hold your breathe
I came to ball, until nothing left
Balenciaga sneakers, baby watch your step
All you rappers broke, but I came to help
I'm Ric Flair, I came to take your belt
East Atlanta Santa, you just an elf
When I do it, I do it, I do it to death
All these haters can go to Hell

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
I'm the Trap God and I walk on water
I'm the Trap God and I walk on water
I'm the Trap God and I walk on water
I'm the Trap God and I walk on water
Neck like water
Wrists like water
Earrings, fingers and they look like water
Just bought a house and it's right by water
I'm the Trap God and I walk on water
I'm the Trap God and I walk on water
I'm the Trap God and I walk on water
I'm the Trap God and I walk on water
I'm the Trap God and I walk on water
Neck like water
Wrists like water
Earrings, fingers and they look like water
Just bought a house and it's right by water
I'm the Trap God and I walk on water

Get the fuck out my face
And if you niggas ain't talkin 'bout profit

Fiendin' cous'

How the fuck you even get in the club?
I got insane young niggas and they trained to go
I point my fingers like a cross, and God send 'em to ya door
Man y'all niggas ain't no killas, man y'all niggas some hoes
Man y'all niggas ain't no dealers, man y'all niggas some J's
I don't blame you, I blame yo daddy— It was how you was raised
Should take this Tom Ford belt and beat you with it
Like back in the day
They say that Gucci Mane is crazy and I say "I agree"
But they stole so much sauce that I heard their record
And thought it was me
It's Gucci

[Verse 1]
My bitch ring cost 2 M&M's and I ain't been out a year yet
My wrist is sick, its terminally ill, it still ain't found a cure yet
You burning all your bridges nigga I'ma call you Bridgette
You acting like a bitch, you mad cause you ain't made a hit yet
Someone come and stop Guwop, ain't found a volunteer yet
This trap rap that influencing the world man Gucci pioneered it
I just vacuum sealed a couple mill, I know real niggas feel that
Gucci can't retire cause he ain't made a hundred mill yet
Keep on talkin' slick, I send my shooters where you live at
Pow, pow, pow, put that pistol where your grill at
Lil mama sucking it like she love me, I ain't even pay the bills yet
I was worth two hundred fifty thou', didn't even have a deal yet

[Chorus]
She braggin on the dickin' down, we ain't even done it yet
He bought it 'fore I whipped the shit man I ain't even spun it yet
Water in it, water whippin', it ain't even dry yet
Quarter flippin, in the kitchen, workin' with the pyrex
She braggin on the dickin' down, we ain't even done it yet
He bought it 'fore I whipped the shit, man I ain't even spun it yet
Water in it, water whippin', it ain't even dry yet
Quarter flippin, in the kitchen, workin' with the pyrex

[Verse 2]
They bring the money to me man, the work ain't even came yet
It's like they got umbrellas out it ain't even rain yet
Grr, that dog food and she can't find no vein at
Grr, mob rules might tie you to a train track
You leasing that don't even got the title, Jack
She peepin' that, that's why she didn't invite you back
You got midget arms, you swing, I don't even fight you back
I'm a tiger you's a lame, I get no stripes for that
Drop me in the jungle where the lions at (grr)
I come back with a lion jacket with the matching hat (grr)
I call you Raphael cause you hang with a sewer rat
I can't hang with no informer, I'm too hood for that

[Chorus]
She braggin on the dickin' down, we ain't even done it yet
He bought it 'fore I whipped the shit man I ain't even spun it yet
Water in it, water whippin', it ain't even dry yet
Quarter flippin, in the kitchen, workin' with the pyrex
She braggin on the dickin' down, we ain't even done it yet
He bought it 'fore I whipped the shit, man I ain't even spun it yet
Water in it, water whippin', it ain't even dry yet
Quarter flippin, in the kitchen, workin' with the pyrex

Fuck, it's 12 at the door
So many plants in this bitch it look like I live on a farm
So many lamps in this bitch it look like I'm trying to build a bomb
Me and my shooter, back of the Uber
Pull up with Buddha, that's how we maneuver
If we don't know ya, then we can't serve ya
If you don't pay me, then we gonna shoot ya
Gucci got 500 bags of OG's and shit
Y'all niggas selling QP's and shit

Call me anything, but don't call the cops on me
I fly private because I got the blocks on me
Check the trailer trunk, got a crop on me
I got a cartel kingpin watch on me
Sellin' more weed than dispensaries
Broke niggas don't make sense to me
So many mexicans bringing in the tree for me
I think Trump trying to build a fuckin' fence for me
Pink diamonds on my ring, stick my finger in her pussy
Big Guwop, I'm the bully of the bully
Got bales of the cookie, well connected with the

Not the

I get you fuckers knocked out for a quarter key
I told you motherfuckers not to fuck with me
Mike WiLL Made It

[Verse 1]
Gucci Mane, and I'm a one man band
Big papa, I got a brand new bag
Fresh out the feds, I got a brand new swag
I don't mean to brag, but let my mink coat drag
In Vegas they treat me like I'm Elvis Presley
She using her eyes to undress the sexy
Who wanna come down and be the next contestant?
The list get the chance to hang in Gucci's section
I walk in the spot like I own the venue
You might find your girlfriend on my private menu
But please don't leave 'cause I ain't tryin' to offend you
But don't blame me, she got her own agenda
Tie dye shirt on like we at Coachella
Let's make love and make these other hoes jealous
I might just jump in the crowd like I'm performing heavy metal
I'm one of a kind like this extraordinary bezel

[Chorus]
Shout out every word in my verse
I need you to scream with me 'til it hurt
'Cause this is the greatest show on earth
You witnessed the greatest show on earth (Gucci!)
I need you to sing with me 'til it hurt
And shout out every word in my verse
'Cause this is the greatest show on earth
You witnessed the greatest show on earth, ha

[Verse 2]
Verse number 2, so I'm jumping back in
Make her chew me up, like the Doublemint twins
Remember I was trappin' at the Bouldercrest Inn
Now I'm slidin' down the Crest in a drop top Benz
'Scuse me, I meant in a drop top R
Neighborhood celebrity, but worldwide star
In some lowtop Giuseppes, and I'm steppin' on the bar
Eight figure Gucci Mane, now that's a god damn bar
Choreographer, I don't need it
Who needs stylist when you this freezy?
Fuck a interview, I talk greasy

[?] a hired man, for what reason?
I'm a one man band, but give the drummer some
Mike WiLL, yeah, the Ear Drummers some
I'm a Black Beatle like Rae Srem' and them
And every weekend I have an M&M

[Chorus]
Shout out every word in my verse
I need you to scream with me 'til it hurt
'Cause this is the greatest show on earth
You witnessed the greatest show on earth (Gucci!)
I need you to sing with me 'til it hurt
And shout out every word in my verse
'Cause this is the greatest show on earth
You witnessed the greatest show on earth, ha

[Ice-T & (Reporter)]
(Ice-T, I'd like to ask you a few questions)
Yeah, yeah what is it, come on
(Is it true that you and your organization still have underworld connections?)
Absolutely not, where'd you get that information from
(Isn't it a fact that most of your lyrics are true?)
Naw, naw, it's all fantasy
It's just, you know you just make this stuff up
Rap is fake
(Hm well government officials still say that you connected with major crime figures)
I don't know what they're talking about it's a joke
I make movies, I make records
(So you swear to the public and deny any and all criminal ties, given though your music states otherwise?)
Absolutely, I mean I'm totally legit
Never done anything wrong, you know what I'm saying
It's all a fantasy, they're just making this stuff up
You know it's 'cause I'm a black man, they're trying to keep me down
But hey
I'm totally innocent
You know what I'm saying
Give me a break lady
Get a life
Yo nigga this club whack as shit
(Word man)
(I'm telling you man)
Ain't nothing up in here but some busta ass niggas
(Fuck these niggas)
Fucking assholes, ain't givin' a nigga no rhythm
Fucking ass bitch
Fuck this bitch here
I ain't supposed to know that's a fucking wig
Bitch got tired ass shit anyway
(Trife ass ho ass bitch)
All these niggas up in here ain't nothing but some motherfucking marks
Fuck 'em
(Right)
Yo ain't that that yellow nigga Ice-T?
(Fuck him)
(Punk ass shit)
Nigga (?)
(Motherfuck him)

Let that nigga know what time it is)

[Intro: Ice-T]
Yeah
DJ Ace
Iceberg nigga
Gangsta shit
Niggas out there running their mother fucking mouth
Acting like bangers
Acting without sad cards
Like somebody supposed to be afraid

[Hook: Ice-T]
You faggots don't scare me, I'm twice as cold
Niggas can't tell me shit, I'm twice as old
Fuck how much you sold, I got twice the cash
Fuck how raw you are, I blast twice as fast
No matter how fly you get, I get  twice as smooth
No matter how slick you are, I got twice the moves
Fuck how big you get, I got twice the fame
One word Iceberg, that means twice the game

[Verse 1: Ice-T]
Twice the heart nigga look in my eyes
L.A. gang-banging, to the streets I'm wise
Notice a novice when it comes to the guns
I never flash, just reach and blast
Chrome hydraulics and the black ski mask
Your next decision might be your last
Real niggas fed the fuck up with the fakes
Think about the next move you make nigga

[Hook: Ice-T]
You faggots don't scare me, I'm twice as cold
Niggas can't tell me shit, I'm twice as old
Fuck how much you sold, I got twice the cash
Fuck how raw you are, I blast twice as fast
No matter how fly you get, I get  twice as smooth
No matter how slick you are, I got twice the moves
Fuck how big you get, I got twice the fame
One word Iceberg, that means twice the game

[Verse 2: Ice-T]
Fame
Motherfuckers want it so bad
Give away every fucking piece of soul they had
Lie to themselves and they lie on the pad
Its a motherfucking hip-hop fad
Get gangster, get gully, get raw
Talk about shit that you never fucking saw
Well the streets talk
They say they need to holler at you
You go to jail, you got problems there too
That's the drama that comes with fakeness
Body guard niggas straight making me laugh
Forty niggas in your entourage, all of them fags
The real nigga in your crew straight extorting your cash
Who am I talking to?
Half you rap whores
Rolling with the cops talking all about your hardocore
No names needed, everybody knows
The real niggas in the game, and the straight hoes

[Hook: Ice-T]
You faggots don't scare me, I'm twice as cold
Niggas can't tell me shit, I'm twice as old
Fuck how much you sold, I got twice the cash
Fuck how raw you are, I blast twice as fast
No matter how fly you get, I get  twice as smooth
No matter how slick you are, I got twice the moves
Fuck how big you get, I got twice the fame
One word Iceberg, that means twice the game

[Verse 3: Ice-T]
These streets got a problem with you
They say the shit you say on your records ain't true
They say that you're talking about people that you never knew
It's a gimmick niggas see right through
They want a little cash back for the lives you stole
They say they'll take it back in your blood and your gold
More body guards, more steel plates
In the doors of your cars and your SUVs
You know you got real problems 'cause you're fucking with Gs
You got the fake gangster rapper disease
Keep lying nigga, digging your grave
Claiming how you bust guns when you know you're bitch made
Your whole posse knows nigga, when will you learn
They're looking at your bankroll, laying the turn
You wanna be a gangster but forgot one thing
Gangsters get murdered or they die in the bing

[Hook: Ice-T]
You faggots don't scare me, I'm twice as cold
Niggas can't tell me shit, I'm twice as old
Fuck how much you sold, I got twice the cash
Fuck how raw you are, I blast twice as fast
No matter how fly you get, I get  twice as smooth
No matter how slick you are, I got twice the moves
Fuck how big you get, I got twice the fame
One word Iceberg, that means twice the game

[Verse 1: Nate Dogg]
When I met you last night, baby
Before you opened up your gap
I had respect for you, lady
But now, I take it all back
'Cause you gave me all your pussy
And you even licked my balls
Leave your number on the cabinet
And I promise, baby, I'll give you a call
Next time I'm feeling kinda horny
You can come on over
And I'll break you off
And if you can't fuck that day, baby
Just lay back and open your mouth
'Cause I have never met a girl
That I love in the whole wide world

[Verse 2: Kurupt]
Well if Kurupt gave a fuck about a bitch, I'd always be broke
I'd never have no motherfuckin' Indo to smoke
I gets loc'ed and loony, bitch, you can't do me
Do we look like BBD? You hoochie groupie
I have no love for hoes
That's something that I learned in Tha Pound
So how the fuck am I supposed
To pay this hoe just to lay this hoe?
I know the pussy's mine
So I'mma fuck a couple more times
And then I'm through with it
There's nothing else to do with it
Pass it to the homie, now you hit it
Cause she ain't nothin' but a bitch to me
And y'all know, that bitches ain't shit to me
I gives a fuck, why don't y'all pay attention?
Approach her with a different proposition
I'm Kurupt, ho, you'll never be my only one

[Hook: Nate Dogg]
It ain't no fun if the homies can't have none
It ain't no fun if the homies can't have none
It ain't no fun if the homies can't have none
It ain't no fun if the homies can't have none

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
Guess who's back in the motherfuckin' house?
With a fat dick for your motherfuckin' mouth
Hoes recognize, niggas do too
'Cause when bitches get scandalous and pull a voodoo
What you gon' do? You really don't know
So I'd advise you not to trust that ho
Silly of me to fall in love with a bitch
Knowing damn well I'm too caught up with my grip
Now, as the sun rotates and my game grows bigger
How many bitches wanna fuck this nigga named Snoop?
Doggy, I'm all the above
I'm too swift on my toes to get caught up with you hoes
But see, it ain't no fun
If my homies can't get a taste of it
'Cause you know I don't love em

[Verse 4: Warren G]
See Kurupt don't give a fuck, Snoop don't give a fuck
So guess I'll just say that I don't give a fuck
Because bitches ain't shit but they seem kind of funny
When you getting to the rap game and you makin' money
But back up, bitch, because I'm strugglin'
Just get on your knees and then start jugglin'
These motherfuckin' nuts in your mouth
It's me, Warren G, the nigga with the clout, whoo!

[Intro: Big Sean]
Uh-huh, oh, yeah, look

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Okay I know what it feel like to be young and single
You know the life when your pockets got a bunch of singles
You know taking double shots, saying fuck a single
You know, hardly getting sleep but it's the fuckin' dream though
Look, I know what it feel like to think you found the one
Told mom that so many times that I'm sounding dumb
Cause she started to mix Ashley up with Tanesha
And saying "Hi Britney" when I'm on the phone with Lisa
Fuck it, I got some new hoes, I mean some XXX girls
Pussy get wet as an S-Curl
Then I started thinkin' 'bout my ex-ex-ex girl
And how it was the worst times but she was the best girl
You know, good girl, bad time, right place, wrong mind
Got my mind right, hit her back, brrr, the wrong line
(The number you dialed has been disconnected)
Man, but before I started feeling bad
My nigga text me like "I got some hoes, hit me back"
Fuck it

[Chorus: Jeremih]
Oh I could let you down
When you trip, I'll take you anywhere, I take ya
We get ahead, yup, she give me head, damn right
You know it ain't right if she ain't by my side
With this crazy, crazy world
Thank God I'm with my girl
We get ahead, yup, she give me head, damn right
You know it ain't right if she ain't by my side
With this crazy, crazy world
Thank God I'm with my girl

[Verse 2: Chance The Rapper]
You be the momma, you be the daddy
Baby, we could play house, I'll change your addy
Or even change my palate and fuck with salad
Put me in the picture, let's change your avi, oh, oh, oh
Can't even stunt I was sprung from the jump
Never got head while flaming up the blunt
You were my first, I'm just saying
More folks should try it, it's crazy
Focus, selfish moments, on road, I done have my share
Flying out of town like baby don't mind my player
Sleepy arguments via texts while I buy my beer
And the air so tired I forget to recline my chair
Picture you in my head, a souvenir by my legs
Some scuba gear for the bed, we do it 'cause Simon says
Ain't a single living thing that likes living single
We good over here, that's all that we know

[Chorus: Jeremih]
Oh I could let you down
When you trip, I'll take you anywhere, I take ya
We get ahead, yup, she give me head, damn right
You know it ain't right if she ain't by my side
With this crazy, crazy world
Thank God I'm with my girl
We get ahead, yup, she give me head, damn right
You know it right if she ain't by my side
With this crazy, crazy world
Thank God I'm with my girl

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
To the one girl guys who claim they don't need more
Like my nigga Henry, he married at 24
I'm like why nigga, why?
You supposed to be with her longer than your ass been alive?
He like, "ahhh"
Fuck it, we about to do therapy
Aye, at least when I hit the doctor I'm carefree with no plan b's
You probably never got tested and have that type of clarity
I'd rather live my life with that lifetime guarantee
But I'm down to hear the stories about what your hoes do
It’s probably more entertaining than me talking about my wife down in Whole Foods
Or how when I'm with her I feel whole too
Go on, keep living that life you niggas know you too old too
Fuck it, I started laughing and pretend like I ain't listen
Even though he on target with everything I've been missing
The closest thing I had to that came in at 4 AM and out at 8 for work
And I'm the reason we ain't make it work
That's what makes it worse
Damn

[Chorus: Jeremih]
Oh I could let you down
When you trip, I'll take you anywhere, I take ya
We get ahead, yup, she give me head, damn right
You know it ain't right if she ain't by my side
With this crazy, crazy world
Thank God I'm with my girl
We get ahead, yup, she give me head, damn right
You know it ain't right if she ain't by my side
With this crazy, crazy world
Thank God I'm with my girl

[Intro: ?? ]
So Disappointed
We all disappointed
All disappointed

[Verse 1 : T.I.]
Aiight
Now I believe in a lot of things
Believe karma real, Believe Allah King
Believe the bible is re-written, preacher be bullshiting
So when they speak believe not a thing

Believe M-L-King had a dream for real
He in Heaven, and we be dealing with demons still
Like an episode of Pinky and the brain for real
Wanna run the world & rule errthing for real

Well god damn (Hol' Up Hol' Up)

Whatchu think will happen when you die ma man,(Die ma man)
Even better whatchu gon do when they push you in the fire ma man
Well I'm a sinner (true) but not like you
I ain't been malicious in the shit I do
Well, I might smoke a  blunt or two (ugh)
Ménage every month or two
Sell I dope to get some money, shit I wanna do law
But I can't go to school, I ain't go the money to
Rather give me fifty years than a scholarship
Anything to keep me outta politics
I believe politicians pull a lot of tricks
The war on drugs crack epidemic, all a 'dat
The death of Bob Marley & Malcom X
Pac and Biggie too , but I ain't really sure about dat

Believe Jesus, die for my sins, don't need no fake image for me to hide behind man
The KKK and the USA got a thang like Superman got for Lois Lane

Uncle Sam liftin' Lady Justice dress up
Grabbing on the pussy yelling "show that thang"

Now be clear, I ain't tryna this ain't no black thang or white thang
It's a dead wrong and right thang

Believe white supremacy , think i'ont see it
Everything they tryna bring down on me
Like the stop and frisk, mass incarceration that perpetuation of recidivism
That mean they create a system hard to break
That's why millions still behind bars today
Columbus day you believe a holiday
What about Capone and Doc Holiday
Lucky Luciano, John Gotti day
Bumpy Johnson and Larry Hoover day
Happy Meech day, Happy Tookie day
Happy Hitler day, sounds stupid aye?
That’s cause hypocrisy more American than democracy
Far as I can see the Constitution wasn't for folk that look like me and that’s what I believe!

[Chorus ?? (T.I.) ]
Wanna be better but you down at the moment
Give dat shit to God it'll  be better in the morning
Still think your skin make you  way more important
Naaaaahh (Hol' up)
All this money but you still can't afford me
Gotta sell your soul just to end up on the Forbes list
Leader of the generation, I'ma get us all in
Aaaaahhh

[Verse 2: T.I.]
All your plans ain't worth for damn
Cause in front of God, you are just a man
Wanna take advantage of a lesser man
Build a wall, keeping out the Mexicans
Go to Standing Rock and wanna poison water, just like Michigan
Now ain't this a bitch
If I learned anything, I've seen any bitch can be president (Hold up)
I say that and they get hostile; get to yellin, flarin' they nostrils (Hold up)
God never said weapons wouldn't form, he just said they wouldn't prosper

[Outro: ?? (T.I)]
Stand for your people , ya
Stand with your brother, its time with your sister, ya
Stand for your people, ya
We can't give another fuck
Message to Americaaaaa
So Disappointing, we all disappointed
Bout to do some more play, Oh u want that OA?
How you doing numbers very similar to my case
Neighborhood like a battlefield , we are not safe
(I believe we are not safe, I believe we are not safe)
(I belive dat what I believe dat what I believe we are not safe)
(I believe we are not safe)
(I believe dat what I believe we are not safe, dat what i believe, dat what i believe, eyy)

That the world fucked up you niggas dough ain't as long as my shoe-strings
I know most niggas ain't gon care regardless
But I can't look my children in they eye if ain't trying the hardest
Bought a rich a milli set the time on it got no diamonds like i want it
Then i prayed the God may bless my street these young niggas dying on it
Take a pic with a Tec-9 on it then put a hashtag sign on it
Then go commit crime on it

Back & fourth with it doin numbers got it goin up

My Ambitionz as a writer
I just wanna answer what y'all are asking
Pretty boys hang with the ball cappin'
Keep it up I should be hanging with the Kardashians
My Ambitionz as a writer
Just like Bird has Weezy, Jay had Yeezy
Pac had Afeni, Club had Meezy
Sremm' had Meechie, Coach had Jeezy
Dre had Eazy, y'all got Leezy
My Ambitionz as a writer
Yeah, writing my life in these songs
I feel like I'm righting these wrongs
So we need a Pac but he's gone
So I'm at the door like ding dong
It's not only me but the team strong
Been knocking and pounding like King Kong
I guess we'll come back when you leave home
My Ambitionz as a writer
Shit I was smoking the keystone
I write 'cause I want a beach home
I write 'cause I'm selling the G-code
I write in a fuck-nigga-free zone, one hunnid percent
Everybody won't get it
Writing is a heavy job, infiltrating youth and help them get a job
Help them start a business, help 'em stay alive, help them help themself and help them own a ride (its all bout the business)
My Ambitionz as a writer
My Ambitionz as a writer

[Verse 2: B.o.B.]
Looking like you the neighborhood watch
Why you wifing up the neighborhood thot?
Where I'm from, they don't make it to the top
We don't fuck with 12, thanks for crooked cops
All out of favors, I'm all out of papers
I can't be a doctor, I'm all out of patients
Niggas be steady false claiming
I swear I don’t rap I just walk in and say shit
I say the shit they afraid to say
They say the shit they get paid to say
I do this shit on the day to day
Fuck on your hoe with my labelmates
Out of Dubai, when I lay awake
Come back for that pussy, that's layaway
She blew me so long, I ain't see her face
King of the jungle, a win away
LeBron James, I'm a ring away
She blew my phone and it ring away
My car hard and my seats soft
Either way you flip it, it's a brick a' yay
Rich enough to eat my cake
Ike Turner and Annie Mae
Same shit, different day, elevate, jumpin' good in all 50 states
Bandz

[Verse 3: T.I]
Narrated, culture curator
Middle finger for a pure hater
Back when OutKast dropped "Elevators"
I was a young dope boy delegator
See I've learnt it ain't what you do man, I'm more concerned with your motivation
Eazy-E, Pac,  B.I.G., and Pimp C, I celebrate em
Man I'm in the dope game when I was on the field
You niggas commentating, or either tailgatin', betta tell 'em sum'n
Better mind your business ‘fo somebody get ya melon popped
Better tell 'em sum'n
Hit your trap queen too, you ain't Fetty Wap
See that's why I be writing, 'cause it's therapeutic
Go the fed time, so my mind bad
See so many murders in the '90s, when I go to sleep I can't help but rewind back
I keep dreaming about having dime bags, some crack and a .9 as I'm ridin' past cops
On probation to get behind me, turn they lights on, shawty I ain't even stop
And the endin' the same, I ride 'til I run outta gas, that's when I wake up

Whats on the mind......of a Black Man right now?
I wonder....

[Verse 1: T.I.]
Ain't it hard enough..to raise your sons and your daughters up?
Without dealing with the racist stuff
Man, I just got out of prison trying hard as fuck
And it seem like its a green light on anyone with my skin type
Get pulled over for a tail-light and get shot
Know what dat feel like? Man, it real life
We ain't have to be brought here man, real life
But the fact is that we all here
If you don't like, you should've left us where we were
Bruh, its all your fault, see L.O.L. J.K. J.K. yeah
Everybody sing "Kum-ba-ya"
Reparation that'll never happen, but we ain't just gon be Abused by it y'all, wait a minute
I'm confused, I thought every man was treated equal, read it in the Constitution, yeah only when they feel like sticking to it
But U.S.A. the greatest nation in the world, dat my story and I'm sticking to it
Keep sticking to it

[Hook: London Jae (T.I.){Translee}]
Letter to the System, (yeah)
For my brothers in them prisons (yeah)

{Yeah, you on my shit list, yeah}

[Verse 2: Translee]
Man, these fools vote on Instagram, they don't give a damn
Grandma on the phone screaming "Oh Boy Oh Boy"
Damn and she ain't never heard of Killa Cam
Clocks feeling like a ceiling fan
She remember back when Martin Luther, he would march and Marchin' at the Million Man and that shit begin again
Man, they got the problem solver for y'all, .38s and revolvers
They should've never involved us
Probably knew that white women would stalk us
Neiman to Marcus, ?, Neiman to Narcos? , Narcotic Targets, walkin' and jogging walk out of Target
Stop and risk police going in my pocket
Drug search over illegal parking?
Drug dog, when they me they barking
Black skin at the target, black for sale at the black market
And its all for free, we don't ask for nothing
I got me, I ain't backwards hustling
We got us, we ain't taxing us
Get yo ass back back back back back back to the back of the bus

The human nature of this society
Will flat-line your reality
If you fail to realize
Pain is a part of the game
For those who don’t know me
Don’t ever dodge pain and adversity because
Pain is just weakness leaving the body man

[Hook: T.I.]
Pain just the weakness when it leaving the body
Pain just the weakness when it leaving the body
Ill on my name be aware when you speak
Ill on my name and you say it better mean it
Pain just the weakness when it leaving the body
Pain just the weakness when it leaving the body
Ill on my name be aware when you speak
Ill on my name be aware when you speak

[Verse 1: T.I.]
The truth hurts as well as bullets I got ‘em both
You do dirty like Yeezy shows you gotta go
No more excusing the flaw if you could be bought then
I’d rather see you die than the movement
A savage only if environments induce it
Never too old for a pruning
Staying silent try my best to mind my business
But you ain’t down with the advancement then deuces
I live my life just like I kick it in my music
Watch your mouth you held accountable for saying
Something stupid
Of all things
And I don’t give a damn if you ballin’
Step aside when the revolution coming

[Hook: T.I.]
Pain just the weakness when it leaving the body
Pain just the weakness when it leaving the body
Ill on my name be aware when you speak
Ill on my name and you say it better mean it
Pain just the weakness when it leaving the body
Pain just the weakness when it leaving the body
Ill on my name be aware when you speak
Ill on my name be aware when you speak

[Verse 2: London Jae]
Now who want smoke?
I got a clip for every nigga you know
I’m bringing pain bought every fucking bullet up in the store
Malcolm and Martin probably turning over in they grave
The movement gon’ move regardless
With or without you modern slave
Token niggas, soft spoken house niggas, and hopeless niggas
Pussy ass Uncle Tom poster boy, focus nigga
Read some shit today they tried to feed that man some shit
Ain’t that some shit?
They shoulda killed that bitch, fuck capital punishment
Mr. Officer how the fuck you the law when you offin' us
Now we ask for their respect instead you make us a offer to kiss your ass
Ignore the racial divide
Only way weakness ain’t painful is if you keep it inside

[Hook: T.I.]
Pain just the weakness when it leaving the body
Pain just the weakness when it leaving the body
Ill on my name be aware when you speak
Ill on my name and you say it better mean it
Pain just the weakness when it leaving the body
Pain just the weakness when it leaving the body
Ill on my name be aware when you speak
Ill on my name be aware when you speak

[Verse 3: T.I.]
Fuck the other side, ain’t no love at all
If ain’t no love for us, we tryna fuck ’em all
I know you feel like you a gangsta acting tough and all
But left and right they locking niggas up for nothing dawg
Take it how it comes give no fuck at all
Say, "bitches, US or else," till there’s nothing else
Nothing to fear but fear itself
I fear no one but God
Put that on Franklin Roosevelt
Pool-side at the Roosevelt
I give a damn how much dough I dealt
Never compromising my principles no going out
Seattle Mariner, fitted cap and a Derringer
'Cause life is mandatory end of story, yeah

[Hook: T.I.]
Pain just the weakness when it leaving the body
Pain just the weakness when it leaving the body
Ill on my name be aware when you speak

Pour some liquor for my niggas
Just to let you know how much I miss you
I'ma hold it down for the block, triple white Maybach on my 2Pac
Picture me mobbing (x4)

[Verse 1: T.I.]
We riding late night, triple white Maybach on a mission walking off at Magic City
It's gon' be an ass and titty night, city light
Now you front and glare, but I don't care
If you crackin' and 

[?], we gon' be all above it there
Make sucker raise up and make that bitch raise
Eyebrows I ain't even gonna 

[mention names?]
Man, I ain't never been is bitch made
You small time nigga, welcome to the big league , homie you passed
Playing tough, no we tenderony(?)
Off a nigga quick and quick to offer testimony
So I stay up about my lonely
They phony, I'm 

[blodger?] dodging
Sophisticated thug life, see a nigga mobbing

[Hook: The-Dream]
Picture me mobbing
Picture me mobbing
Picture me mobbing
Picture me mobbing

[Verse 2: T.I.]
Pop a bottle pour it out for niggas who ain't with me
Get a bankroll throw it out so ignant niggas listening
Fuck what haters talking bout
Trap nigga fucking with me till the death
I’m the last real nigga left
Young hugh hef, retired nino brown
Graduated into royalty, oh you don’t see no crown?
It don’t matter still they know it’s me
Gangsta gutter poetry
Don’t care what you think, my heart pure I know the Lord see
Out this world officially in orbit
Full of game lame niggas should absorb it
Adversity endured it, he ain't all gorgeous
Just hope they recognize a G when I’m at God's doorstep
Made some bad choices of course but that’s only natural
Now how will you react when the reaper is looking at you
Stacked the dough in my satchel, I’m ballin’ my money long
Shine on ‘em while I’m alive but when I’m gone you can

[Hook: The-Dream]
Picture me mobbing (x4)
Pour some liquor for my niggas
Just to let you know how much I miss you
I'ma hold it down for the block, triple white Maybach on my 2Pac
Picture me....

[Verse 3: T.I.]
I still do it for my thug niggas and my drug dealers
Middle finger to sadiddy bitches who don’t fuck with us
Triple felo ex-con nigga got told on
Just came back on tryna get back on
Ay It wasn’t always bout the rap holme
I still pull up on the street I used to trap on
It’s well known I went from flipping ____ serving
Onto mobbing top down in Rolls down Melrose

[2Pac lyric] – can you see me? is it clear to ya nigga? hahaha

[Intro: Charlie Wilson]
Ehhh yeaaah
Oh la, sha ba da ba twee twee
Ohh heyy, yeaaah

[Verse 1: T.I.]
Hm, put it on everything I ever loved
I was born in the bottom, no way outta there but selling drugs
I promised everything I ever did
Was done to get my momma out the ghetto since a little kid
Used to resent the shit my daddy did
Had it against him till I had a kid
And a baby momma with an attitude
And the baby don't know how to set me and your momma ain't compatible
Bitch, now every day be shaped
And nigga nowaday reach other levels of hate, believe me
And you can tell when you see me
The same niggas from the songs and on TV
The lame niggas hating hard, never be me
The fame might've hit me hard, but I'm still me
Hm, and who would've ever thought
That y'all niggas trappin raw, wouldn't leave till he did it all

[Bridge: T.I.]
I'm a real nigga man, I do this shit for y'all (what)
May you reach the top, pray you never fall (no)
Do it when the summer falls, spring on these niggas
Did my thing on these niggas
Talking 13 things on these niggas
Who will put the King on these niggas ride
Drop top through the project
Bumpin 2Pac with a Glock in my RS (damn)
I'm sayin'

[Verse 2: Charlie Wilson]
I know I swore to myself this life was all behind me, yeah
Man, I know what I said, don't need you to remind me, no
But what I need you to do is find another way for me, yeah
And if you can't then man, just pray for me
Cause here we go again

[Chorus: T.I. & Charlie Wilson]
Up & down i-10  you tryin' to fit the bricks and the sticks in the stash
Oh lord
On a steady pace, know it ain't a race
Through the speed limit on the dash
Oh lord
I'm on another trip right now
You can't tell me shit right now
Cause I gotta get it some way somehow
Cause here we go again
Somebody tryna set a trap for yah ass don't fall for that
Set a trap for yah ass don't fall for that
Ay man they tryna set a trap for yah ass don't fall for that
They wanna trick you off tha streets real bad don't fall for that
Somebody tryna set a trap for yah ass don't fall for that
Don't fall for that
Wanna trick you off tha streets real bad
Somebody tryna set a trap for yah ass don't fall for that

Goddamn boy yah better than this
How long you think gon make it selling these shit
You wanna trade you're future for this
Ay man yo homeboys around yah
Don't be telling you shit
Your present environment ain't forever unless
You refuse want better well you better invest
To get some shit you never had
Hmph
You got to do some shit you never did
Ok
Then ya go & buy shit tha same way shawty
Only gon bring you tha same thing for it
Thought anything else about that
That'll make you insane do you got that
Get an attitude tell him shit steady fucking up
This right here he'll never get it cause he don't know enough
Miss tha message & tha lesson to busy pouring up
How you on point when you always fucked up
You say you wanna make it what you doing forreal
Look bruh you fail tha plan or you plan tha fail
Man He Gon Fuck around & let them throw his ass in jail
Give him a felony & let him be know where he live
Gotta have a pistol if you livin in their
Catch his ass wit that & we can get him forreal
& if he ain't got one

So his ass either locked up or 6 feet deep
Come on
They tryna set a trap for yah ass don't fall for that
They wanna trick yah off tha streets real bad don't fall for that
Somebody tryna set a trap for yah ass don't fall for that
Don't fall for that
They wanna trick you off tha streets real bad don't fall for that
Ay man
They tryna set a trap for yah ass don't fall for that

[Chorus]
I think I'm out my mind, people say I'm trippin'
Cause I raise hell everywhere I go
I'm on 285 in my old school, same old tude'
It be like, "Tip saying some shit,"
I know
But I believe in God, and I know he be with me
Even when my mission ain't as righteous as his will
How many V12 fast enough to pop a wheelie?
Driving reckless everywhere, but I got Jesus at the wheel

[Hook]
Help me Jesus, take the wheel
Hey, help me Jesus take the wheel
God help me, man
Lord knows I don't want to go to jail again

[Verse 1]
People just be sayin what they want up out they mouth
And meanwhile I be tryna keep about as real as I can keep it
You try me and I'm gonna bring that drama to your house
And I pray to god that we can keep this lil' me and you a secret
But if not, gotta hot meal ticket
Said I'll barely see the side of a cell, smiling, as I post bail
Emerging, for certain, you see it, I'm God's child
Even though Jesus knows I been wild since a fetus

[Hook]
Help me Jesus, take the wheel
Hey, help me Jesus take the wheel
God help me, man
Lord knows I don't want to go to jail again

[Verse 2]
I got a real big heart and a real bad temper
Gay motherfuckers just don't know how to take it
Maybe because I pull a niggas card
And check em when they be faking
They don't like it, we can make it what they make it
Over time, I had cases accumulated from fire conversations
A violent demonstration, come after your violation'
(What's the cause?) You know me dawg
Man you know I ain't fake no moves, play no games at all
I ain't one of these other niggas out here who finna cater to y'all
My window open, I get back in there, I'm taking it all
Once and for all, these niggas tell tall tales
But when all that fails, I be praying for em

[Hook]
Help me Jesus, take the wheel
Hey, help me Jesus take the wheel
God help me, man
Lord knows I don't want to go to jail again

[Verse 3]
I know what you're thinking, you see me drinking while I'm drivin
Speed by, with the top down, been smoking, I ain't even high
Got a six figure watch on, hangin out the window, stones singin
20 carot solitaire on my pinkie, yeah I got that nigga slipping
Somebody say "you trippin"
Hey TIP need to keep a chopper with him
Banana clipping, I better listen
Sometimes life lessons aren't learned from self
Tryna get burned to death
You should only be wide-eyed off profits you can earn for self
Telling you you'll fall asleep tryna take mine
No nap time, just flat-line
You could reach for mine, and my gat find
You better check that shit
Nigga stand down, you might not know my background

[Chorus]
I think I'm out my mind, people say I'm trippin'
Cause I raise hell everywhere I go
I'm on 285 in my old school, same old tude'
It be like, "Tip saying some shit,"
I know
But I believe in God, and I know he be with me
Even when my mission ain't as righteous as his will
How many V12 fast enough to pop a wheelie?
Driving reckless everywhere, but I got Jesus at the wheel

[Hook]
Help me Jesus, take the wheel
Hey, help me Jesus take the wheel
God help me, man
Lord knows I don't want to go to jail again
Snippet
Dry every river
With you in mind
Now you no longer have a use
'Cause I feel no love, no love

[Verse 1]
When we were young
We wanted to die
But the sound of a drum
And the words of a child
Brought a different light
Now no one can tell
The winter was nice
But the summer is hell
The summer is hell

[Verse 2]
The ground was so hard
The nights were so long
But we suffered the dark
And we wrote all those songs
Still, I was a fool
I covered my ears
No, I would not face the last snowstorm of the year

[Refrain]
No, I would not face the last snowstorm of
The year

[Instrumental]

[Outro]
(No I would not face the last snowstorm)

[Intro]
Down low, down low... down low, down low
Down low, down low... down low, down low

[Verse 1]
You say you want me, but he needs you, baby
Tell me, what am I gonna do
About this fuckin' threesome love affair?
If Mr. Biggs comes in and catch us, oh my goodness
He'll be freaked when lookin' at your pretty titties in the air
Something about the way you switch that ass
When you're with him, looking at me
I can't believe he trusts us like he do
Bloomingdales and all that shopping, taking trips
While I was knocking, ain't no secret
Why I'd end up loving you

[Chorus]
Down low, down low (Keep it...)
Down low, down low (Gotta keep it on the...)
Down low, down low (Creepin' on the...)
Down low, down low (Nobody has to know)

[Verse 2]
Secret lovers, undercover on the DL
Getting busy in the back of his Mercedes every night
Answers the phone when he goes home
And let him know that everything is A-OK
Oh baby, damn this shit is tight
Passing blunts to one another on 3-5th Street
As you reminisce and tell me what he used to do for you
You making plans to be with me while he's at home
Meet you at college, if you want me, baby, this is what we do

[Chorus]
Down low, down low (Gotta keep it on the...)
Down low, down low (Creepin' on the...)
Down low, down low (Gotta keep it on...)
Down low, down low

[Verse 3]
Dom Perignon is what we're sippin'
While we're trippin' on the fact that he's not here
It turns us on in every way
You say you stashed away some money for us
When you leavin', oh Lord, tell me
Will I live to see another day? (See another day...)
I tried my best to walk away but every time I think about
That sweetest love you're givin' me, I hesitate
He's out the front, I'm in the back
I locks the front, he's in the back
And I'll be damned, that silly bitch is screaming "rape"

[Chorus]
Down low, down low
(Yeah, that's what ya get for that down low shit)
Down low, down low
(That's what I kept telling myself)
Down low, down low
(Out of every woman in the world...)
Down low, down low
(...you had to go and mess with Mr. Biggs' girl)
Down low, down low
(That's what ya get for that down low shit)
Down low, down low (Ho, yeah)
Down low, down low
(Niggas, don't be thinkin' you can keep creepin')
Down low, down low

Because what goes around comes right back on around again
Yes, it does, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (Kelly, keep it on...)
And sometimes you get lonely, yeah
You get lonely, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
And sometimes you wanna call somebody up and tell them to come comfort you, yeah
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh...
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh... (Keep it on...)
Yeah
And it feels good when...(Kelly, keep it on...)
(Down low, down low) It feels good when a woman...
(Keep it on...) ...comes in and... (Down low, down low)
...takes over things... (Kelly, keep it on...)
...and says to you... (Down low, down low)
...'Are you hungry, baby?'...

[Intro]
We got the remix
It's another hot exclusive from the dominators

[Hook: Connie Mitchell + Dwele]
Flashing lights, lights
Flashing lights, lights
Flashing lights, lights
What do I know?
Flashing lights, lights
Know

[Verse 1: Pusha T]
Pharmaceuticals bought me charm like the jeweler jewels
Squares of ice shed light like the Rubix cube
I get it mixed up, red with the blues
And she all mixed up, admirin' the hues
Four years later, niggas admirin' your shoes
Bape year late, we call you Tokyo buffoons
'Cause stylists admire us, look at how you groom
Keep runnin' to SoHo, them exclusives in my room
Niggas is biters, we let you slide with your writings
We knew that cocaine talk was not like you
But who goes as far as tryin' to dress like him?
One sequin glove can never make you Michael
I moonwalk over tracks and make niggas spiteful
But never hear a word 'cause them niggas know
That my flow so viper and if Pusha go psycho
He'll seance that pen and pull your spirit up out yah, P

[Verse 2: No Malice]
I'm so literary with it, you can tell how I write
The boy such an author, I should smoke a pipe
Rockin' an ascot, the coupe with a glass top
17 inch rims makin' the ass drop
I was in the spot from the first to the fifth
With a mean comeback like The Return of the Sith
Like ridin' a bike, never you forget
Still I got it for cheap, whether you smoke or you sniff
The gift is the curse and vice versa
To remove me off that horse takes more than a merger
Durin' that hiatus I was with the natives
Then back to the States, pass along the savings
Put it in the street, caterin' the cravings
Like the second-comin', got the fans awaitin'
Victory is sweet, even amongst the hatin'
Find me on that beach, island in the Caymans, gone

[Hook: Dwele + Connie Mitchell]
As you recall, you know I love to show off
But you never thought that I would take it this far
What do you know?
Flashing lights, lights
What do you know?
Flashing lights, lights
Know...
Flashing lights, lights
Flashing lights, lights

[Outro: DJ Drama]
What up, you know who it is, it's the one and only Mr. Thanksgiving a.k.a. Mr. Gangsta Grillz himself, DJ Drama. And right now you're locked into Benzy's Get Right Radio. Pay attention!

[Intro]
Yo, Gee, they can't stop me from rapping, can they?
Can they, Hop?

[Hook]
Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall
(I spit it through the wire, man)
For a chance to be with you
I'd gladly risk it all
(There's too much stuff on my heart right now, man)
Through the fire (I'd gladly risk it all right now)
Through whatever, come what may (It's a life-or-death situation, man)
For a chance at loving you (Y'all, y'all don't really understand how I feel right now, man)
I'd take it all the way
(It's your boy Kanye to the... Chi-town, what's goin' on?)
Right down to the wire
Even through the fire

[Verse 1]
I drink a Boost for breakfast, an Ensure for dessert
Somebody ordered pancakes, I just sip the sizzurp
That right there could drive a sane man berserk
Not to worry, Mr. H-to-the-Izzo's back to wi-zerk
How do you console my mom or give her light support
Telling her her son's on life support?
And just imagine how my girl feel
On the plane, scared as hell that her guy look like Emmett Till
She was with me before the deal, she'd been trying to be mine
She a Delta, so she'd been throwing that Dynasty sign
No use in me tryin' to be lyin', I been tryin' to be signed
Tryin' to be a millionaire, how I used two lifelines
In the same hospital where B.I.G. and 2Pac died
The doctor said I had blood clots, but I ain't Jamaican, man
Story on MTV and I ain't trying to make a band
I swear this right here, history in the making, man

[Hook]
Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall (I really apologize for everything right now if it's unclear at all, man)
For a chance to be with you (They got my mouth wired shut for like I dunno)
I'd gladly risk it all (The doctor said like six weeks, y'know he had, I had reconstructive surgery on my jaw)
Through the fire
Through whatever, come what may
(I looked in the mirror)
For a chance at loving you
(And half my jaw was in the back of my mouth, man, I couldn't believe it)
I'd take it all the way (But I'm still here for y'all right now, man)
Right down to the wire (This what I got to say right here, dawg)
Even through the fire (Yeah, turn me up, yeah)

[Verse 2]
What if somebody from the Chi' that was ill got a deal
On the hottest rap label around?
But he wasn't talking about coke and birds
It was more like spoken word
Except he's really putting it down?
And he explained the story about how blacks came from glory
And what we need to do in the game
Good dude, bad night, right place, wrong time
In the blink of a eye, his whole life changed
If you could feel how my face felt
You would know how Mase felt
Thank God I ain't too cool for the safe belt
I swear to God, Driver 2 wants to sue
I got a lawyer for the case to keep what's in my safe safe
My dawgs couldn't tell if I...
I looked like Tom Cruise in Vanilla Sky
All they heard was I was in an accident like GEICO
They thought I was burnt up like Pepsi did Michael
I must got a angel, ‘cause look how death missed his ass
Unbreakable, what, you thought they'd call me Mr. Glass?
Look back on my life like the Ghost of Christmas Past
Toys "R" Us where I used to spend that Christmas cash
And I still won't grow up, I'm a grown-ass kid
Swear I should be locked up for stupid shit that I did
But I'm a champion, so I turned tragedy to triumph
Make music that's fire, spit my soul through the wire

[Hook]
Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall (Y'know what I'm saying?)
For a chance to be with you (When the doctor told me I had, um, that I was gonna have to have a plate in my chin, I said)
I'd gladly risk it all ("Dawg, don't you realize I'll never make it on a plane now?")
Through the fire ("It's bad enough I got all this jewelry on!")
Through whatever, come what may
For a chance at loving you (She can't be serious, man)
I'd take it all the way
Right down to the wire
Even through the fire

[Outro: Elton John]
I'm still standing better than I ever did
Looking like a true survivor, feeling like a little kid
I'm still standing after all this time
Picking up the pieces of my life without you on my mind
I'm still standing, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm still standing, yeah, yeah, yeah
"My Pledge"

If it please the court I've had a lot to say
And it's not always been true
Standing here before you, judge
I make my pledge of truth to you

The waves came over the bow
The decks awash with running green and foam
Back there at the wheel I was terrified
Next day we first saw home

My relatives came over on the Mayflower
Landed on the shore almost alone
Now that damn traffic today is terrible
And everywhere I look I see people alone

Alone with their heads looking in their hands
Lost in the conversation stare
Walking with their eyes looking at the screen
Talking like they were really there
I'm lost in this new generation
Left me behind it seems
Listening to the shadow of Jimi Hendrix
"Purple Haze", sounding like TV

I stepped on someone's hand laying on the street
Both asleep and dead it may seem
He didn't even move there on the sidewalk
I stood there staring in a dream

She came along in her uniform
Stood moving me away with a gentle hand
Dressed in white like a nightingale
Her name was Florence, Florence of the Land
(I knew I'd seen her somewhere)

I knew I'd seen her somewhere
But she was busy with him gone
She came with three different brothers
Abraham, Martin and John

I heard a song about that once
And I never knew what it meant
Three stars died in a plane one night
Rock and Roll, the message was sent
I couldn't wrap my head around it
Didn't know what it meant
Standing there on that sandy beach
Watching it turn to cement

Now I don't see all the colors
And I might miss some of their beauty
But I do see what I see
And I want to do my duty

Enlisted in the Navy at the corner store
They had a recruiting booth
I covered my heart and raised my hand
And swore it was the truth

That's my pledge
That's my pledge
That's my pledge, judge
That's my pledge

[Intro]
It's Guwop
Freethrow

[Verse 1]
Nigga better bring his best, nigga better bring his best
Nigga run up, I guessed it
By some long, that nigga was flexin'
All my dope I stretch it
Used to get the bricks from Texas
Nigga just got off the exit
Am I gon' pay or just finesse it?
Gucci Mane, I'm from Bouldercrest but I still used to hang on 

[?]
Keep a revolver like a nigga in a western
Been locked up so many damn times but I still ain't learn my lesson
If the jug by 12 didn't care about 7, still walk around with my mac-11
I'm a dope cook and professor
Skrt skrt, this ain't no hamburger helper
My uncle is my tester, free Jerry Chester
Got a show in San Diego, but the bricks still comin' on schedule
Got tha' handcuffs on yo' baby momma but Gucci Mane can't arrest her

[Hook]
New car; no roof
Fuck you and yo' hoe too
Jesus piece on my chest but I get the bricks from Heysus
Hector Camacho, ass niggas, y'all niggas ain't bulletproof
The nigga standin' next to you with it too?
Fuck you and that nigga too
New car; no roof
Fuck you and yo' hoe too
Jesus piece on my chest but I get the bricks from Heysus
Hector Camacho, ass niggas, y'all niggas ain't bulletproof
The nigga standin' next to you with it too?
Fuck you and that nigga too

[Verse 2]
A nigga run up on gwop
Nigga gon' get popped
Nigga gon' get mollywhopped
Hit with a champagne bottle
My young niggas so crazy
Half of the time, don't listen
Half of the time, they trippin'
50 percent, prison
90 percent, yo' bitch with me
100 percent, that scrap with me
Young nigga bought 8 chickens
4 clean, 4 missin'
Yo' girlfriend so ugly, I don't even know why the hoe strippin'
You might as well just start pimpin'
Put that bitch on Ol' Dixie
Got two pints, so I'm big sippin'
Got a show in Mississippi
On this David Banner, hometown
If I'm now, it's my city
And tell him that I got fire with me
All my nigga's gon' die with me
You can walk over like you big bad
But when I shoot yo' ass, you gon start limpin'

[Hook]
New car; no roof
Fuck you and yo' hoe too
Jesus piece on my chest but I get the bricks from Heysus
Hector Camacho, ass niggas, y'all niggas ain't bulletproof
The nigga standin' next to you with it too?
Fuck you and that nigga too
New car; no roof
Fuck you and yo' hoe too
Jesus piece on my chest but I get the bricks from Heysus
Hector Camacho, ass niggas, y'all niggas ain't bulletproof
The nigga standin' next to you with it too?
Fuck you and that nigga too

[Outro]
Fuck you and that nigga too

Cook my dope fast forward, sell lean in slow motion

Caught a charge and beat it
Gucci Mane, I’m undefeated
Red bottom’s on all my hoes, all my bitches are so conceited
Front flip, I’m flippin’ bricks
Backflip, you hustle backwards
Your girlfriend is unattractive
Could’ve but I didn’t smash her
Call me 4 eyes with these Gucci glasses
Trap school; better take some classes

My rims so fat but I got these lil’ skinny tires
They locked me up and put me on probation, nigga. (true)
The way I chase that white girl, they think I’m Jason, nigga
I’m all in your dreams like I’m Freddy Krueger
But I’m not Freddy baby, call me Freddy Mueller
I need to go to rehab, I’m a drug abuser
I drink so much cough syrup, they think I got the flu
Smoked so much kush, I might need an organ donor
Another set of lungs ‘cause I’m a heavy smoker
Popped so many bottles, need another liver
And I don’t plan on stopping ‘cause I’m not a quitter (it's Gucci!)

[Hook]

[Intro]
Lightin' up a Cuban cigar down Collins Ave
This that type of shit
Saucy, yeah, you know this that
It's that light that Cuban cigar in the Wraith music
No excuses
I feel marvelous by the way

[Verse 1]
Look uh, first off, I'm poppin' nigga, fuck all y'all
Y'all lucky I don't let this thing touch all y'all
Swavey, uh
It's been a while man, uh
Say the name for a nigga greatest ever
New Toronto very own, bitch, I made another
Made songs 'bout Teyana and Karrueche
I should have pulled some fly shit and had them date each other

[Interlude]
Lemme talk my shit
I told y'all was gon be a lovely evenin', I told you
This that shit you just
You just smoke an L to and sit the fuck back
And look at your life like, "Look what I did"

[Verse 2]
Uh, I run the city in my joggers
Niggas talkin' like bloggers
Villas and apartments
Movin' like Vinny Vargas
Case closed, deal open talkin' large shit
Got me out on South Beach with the sergeant
Collins Ave., Ocean Ave doin' Prime nigga
The Henny fall for all my dawgs doin' time nigga
Lately I've been fuckin' bitches two in time
Sellin' flows, sellin' shows, plus keepin' you in line
Oh it's hard
Still I do it and money it comin' fluent
Spittin' like I need to check my fluids
But I get a check from all these niggas like I'm Jewish
Stupid money comin', got a nigga feelin' foolish
I stunt harder, single number 1 charter
Two platinum plaque singles off of one starter
I been harder, been smarter
Boy, they got me movin' like the hall of fame
Arm through the rim, Vince Carter
Your flow easy and your beats bore me
I done bossed up the city, whole street saw me
In a pair of a red bottoms and fatigues on me
Plugged up 'til the day they call police on me
Say my shit the hardest 'cause my shit the hardest
In ten years, we'll check back 'bout who's the bigger artist
Whole clique of artists and they 'bout to get shit started
Even though the kid alone, could have your shit deported
I see --- talkin' slick now
I got a million for every word out your slick mouth
Lucky I can't even argue with them little guys
I'm more focused on gettin' niggas legitimised
I own the land, I own property, the enterprise
I'm still stuntin', fuckin' all your bitches inner thighs
My watch ten glass can get a nigga killed
P.E., gym class the way I'm in the field
Drove the Rolls round Toronto, show the kid's its real
340 cash, fuck how niggas feel
I was broker than the joker
Now I need a bag
Spanish bitch la vida loca
Bitch name Coca and I stroke her in the hot tub
Niggas say it's love, though it's not love
So I'm in the VIP strip club section, I'm gettin' hot rubs
Big dutty .45 on me, in case they pop up
'Cause when the shot sober
Niggas leave you slouched over in the couch sofa
Dawg, especially when the block know ya
And your hater steady talkin, what they got for you
But your shooters in the drops over
Down to shoot a movie clip until the plots over

[Outro]
I'm not gon' play nice with you niggas man
Fuck you want me to do? I'm sorry
Over here in one umbrella, you know
We got a no fuck nigga policy, know what I'm sayin'? One of those
I'm not one of them niggas that you just
You know you just see me out on a random blue
And you see me in my Wraith and you just pull up
And shoot your gun at me
You gotta make certain calls for that, baby
You gotta talk to certain people
Before you make those moves
Oh I know you

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
Baby, where you going? Party that way

Let me see you wobble, wobble, drop it, drop it, all on me

You let me in, I'm finna stay for a long while

Shake that ass, smack that ass, I got the party packed
Cocaine and molly, that's a heart attack
Girl, when I last, you have some sex, I mean no disrespect
Girl, I'm tryna get that pussy wet (ha)
Girl, you might see me with the Bloods and the Crips

[Chorus]
You caught me
She getting naughty
No doubt about it
I’ll be on time out
You ask me, "Girl, who yo daddy?"
I say you’re mine now
You caught me
She getting naughty
No doubt about it
I’ll be on time out
You ask me, "Girl, who yo daddy?"
I say you’re mine now

[Post-Chorus]
Put me in the corner
Rock me in the bedroom
Give a girl some warning
Say it ain't no good
Put me in the corner
Rock me in the bedroom
Give a girl some warning
Say it ain't no good

[Verse]
Did I do that?
Oh did I do that?
Shit I put that back on a nigga like watch yo ass
Like a siamese cat when I leave that scratch
Got a nigga like this my belt
I could take this off, I could give you hell
Have you screaming like oh my Lord
But she don't need help
No no she don't
Until she wanna talk back, talk back, talk back
Curse words, big hand, loud slap
When I come home, was good oh snap
50 shades man that's your type
Yo, got me blushing man right from the back
Ain't no cursing, I swear you an ass
Freak ass nigga I swear you a track
Yall need that nigga I swear you a dad
Yo when I got him aching, he ain't taking
He gone give this ass a spanking
Don't care how high my ranking
With these rings on and I thank him
See I'm panting and those handprints
How the fuck I'm out here standing
See how the fuck I'm out here dancing
He a rough one I can't stand it ugh

[Chorus]
You caught me
She getting naughty
No doubt about it
I’ll be on time out
You ask me, "Girl, who yo daddy?"

[Post-Chorus]
Put me in the corner
Rock me in the bedroom
Give a girl some warning
Say it ain't no good
Put me in the corner
Rock me in the bedroom
Give a girl some warning
Say it ain't no good

[Verse]
When it rains, it pours
Open windows and closed doors
All the pretty lights and sounds to open up the night
Friends, they come and go
That's okay, I'm kind of bored
Let's go hard, get drunk, and travel down a rabbit hole

[Chorus]
Would you ride for me?
Lie for me?
Die for me?
Vibe with me?
I don't want this to end
But i'm not your man
So when this hits the fan would you?

[Verse 1]
I've got a girl on my way and she looks like Rihanna
Babygirl, I'm legit, I'd probably wife up your momma
Catch me rolling to the spot in my blacked out Honda
My main girl is foreign and she tastes like designer
Netflix and chillling so get out of your feelings
If you never do business, leave the building
I want a bad girl with a little bit of class
Drop the attitude, just leave the frustration in the past
1, 2, 3 to the 4
Counting down the time until our bodies hit the floor
Just a young dude, don't know why i'm feeling you
But i don't want a relation so

[Verse 2]
I got a girl on my way and she look like Rihanna
Babygirl, I'm legit, I'd probably wife up your momma
Catch me rolling to the spot in my blacked out Honda
My main girl is foreign and she tastes like designer
Netflix and chillling so get out of your feelings
If you never do business, leave the building
I want a bad girl with a little bit of class
Drop the attitude, just leave the frustration in the past
Netflix and chillling so get out of your feelings
If you never do business, leave the building
I want a bad girl with a little bit of class
Drop the attitude, just leave the frustration in the past

[Chorus]
Would you ride for me?
Lie for me?
Die for me?
Vibe with me?
I don't want this to end
But i'm not your man
So when this hits the fan would you ride for me?

[Bridge]
Netflix and chillling so get out of your feelings
If you never do business, leave the building
I want a bad girl with a little bit of class
Drop the attitude, just leave the frustration in the past
Netflix and chillling so get out of your feelings
If you never do business, leave the building
I want a bad girl with a little bit of class
Drop the attitude, just leave the frustration in the past

[Chorus]
Would you ride for me?
Lie for me?
Die for me?
Vibe with me?
I don't want this to end
But i'm not your man
So when this hits the fan would you ride for me?

[Chorus]
I'm not scared of your stolen power
See right through you any hour
I won’t ease your strain
You'll be taking it slow, feeding my flame
Shuffling the cards of your game
And just in time
In the right place
Suddenly I will play my ace

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Ha ha
Treat women like property, possessive like a noun with an apostrophe S's, I'd probably stalk broccoli, yes it's
Socrates with a block of cheese and a dollar stuck in this soda pop machine
Got emcees dropping to knees, copping a plea bargain they keep sobbing, like, "please stop it"
Aftermath, bitch, still Detoxing
Looking for us? We over here like we're eavesdropping
Apparently still mad over what I said last year
On that Vegas track, I just look stupid and stand there
And try to act like I can't hear
What? Sorry dear, but I think Pam Grier just stuck a tampon in my damn ear
Just then Foxy Brown, walks up and knocks me down
Kicks me and socks me, ow

[Chorus]
I'm not scared of your stolen power
See right through you any hour
I won’t ease your strain

[Verse 2: Karacter]
I'm not scared, I'm just a white kid in a black neighborhood
Side terror
Wipe off this fear, to not thinking clear
I need to get my head straight
I do feel like a Nazi in a Jewish camp
Concentration
A foolish act to puzzle you fools with the coolest raps like Rubik's cube that I stole just to solve then give it back
Stupid face your making bitch
Loose the mask
Oh wait
I'm sorry that's my bad
Looks like shit
Might be obvious and a waste of my time to say you look like the crap from a sewage plant
But as you were saying
Back to your rant
Lex Luther just got circles ran round his puny ass so fast his neck snapped and it dropped his pants
You've just been schooled by Clark Kent
Shopping at the market
In the parking lot next to your apartment and part from it
You tried to look hard as shit but you pooed your pants
And I didn't even get to use superman yet
And he's my strong suit
Fall soon back on, to attack these villains, and kill em just passing em back and forth, feeling em then put an axe in their nads
That's what I call a hacky sack bitch
Cut cut and pass
You think your lucky
It's Chucky the mother fucking assassin
Castrating stuck in the cabinet sucking a bottle of Aspirin
Preparing a statement while he sharpens his blade
Carves it across his face as he coughs
Testing his voice is it raspy
Nope, just naturally nasty
Get ready for the ass whooping he's bout to serve up like a double cheese burger from Arby's

[Chorus]
I'm not scared of your stolen power
See right through you any hour
I won’t ease your strain

[Verse 3: Karacter]
Dearest resident
Don't flip past this channel and skip it
A paramedic is in your living room slitting scissors through your flannel get up
So get up, feel better, and add up what I said on that chalk board of yours boarded up inside your head
You're almost dead
I'm your guardian
Here we are
Reminiscing this shit as we walk down the hall of wits
Shelve these thoughts
Highlight reel of selfish tall feminist broads
Everyone that's screwed you over when they said they'd call
Seminar, phantom here I am sent to ward these demons off

[Eminem]
Off misogyny
Sodomy, how many chocolaty jell-o pops can he possibly lace, walking atrocity
No wonder you scoff at me, it’s still obvious I invented prick

[Karacter]
Rest in heaven, I'm evidently milking this game like
Her breasts are dripping
Guess I'm busy, but unless you bitches are seven teen and eleven months I don't want to hear the pessimism
Tell the rest I'm on readers digest while I'm on the toilet
Pizza sky rocket
Gossip isn't
Close to the shit
I must be fast, lickity split
There's no exaggeration, I mean it Brittany
A fan of Trina
Get's me like I wanna jam my weener in Christina

[Eminem]
And Serena and Selena
Scarlett Johansson, Tiffani Amber Thiessen
Give me a damn good reason to not wanna slip an Ambien in a Cappuccino
And try to have a threesome with Janet Reno

[Karacter]
Stuff her with cream like a spicy popper of jalapeno
Appetizer, my main meal's Destiny
Now, If I die I'll come back to haunt your back side grizzly
Capitalize the "Ass" in fucking Caspar and Wendy
As Detroit looking like a power outage, just a black out city
Crack house just down the street of McDonalds, where you lost your virginity
Oh dity, I'm out
Explosive, you're left with the call
You might want to

[Eminem]
Head for the fire exits, I'm coming through like a wrecking-ball

[Karacter]
Test us, we're scared of nothing at all

[Chorus]
I'm not scared of your stolen power
See right through you any hour
I won’t ease your strain
You'll be taking it slow, feeding my flame
Shuffling the cards of your game
And just in time
In the right place
Suddenly I will play my ace

[Chorus]
Get up, stand up
Throw your hands up high
Get up, stand up
We'll set it off tonight
Get up, stand up
Throw your hands up high
Get up, stand up
We'll set it off tonight

[Verse 1]
Wake up everybody, get up out of your seat
No more holdin' back now, are you feelin' this heat?
So tell the DJ turn it up until you're satisfied
And if they try to shut us down it's gonna be a fight

[Chorus]
Get up, stand up
Throw your hands up high
Get up, stand up
We'll set it off tonight
Get up, stand up
Throw your hands up high
Get up, stand up
We'll set it off tonight

[Verse 2]
Wake up all you playas, spend your money tonight
Ladies are you with me? Are you feelin' this vibe?
The party can't get started 'til you get on the floor
So check your wiggles at the door, tell me what you waitin' for?

[Hook]
New on the streets
My name's Rihanna

[Verse 1]
I'm a soldier true and through
I know I'll make it through the storm
I really want you to realize
I really want you to put me on
I've been searchin' for somebody
To let me be all I can be
Music is my inspiration
It's the only thing I need

[Hook]
New on the streets
My name's Rihanna

[Verse 2]
So I try my best and pray to God
My dreams will all turn real
'Cause there's a fire burnin' in my heart
I hope you all can feel
To my music I'll be faithful
You know I'll give my all and all
Through the good times and the bad times
Summer, winter, spring and fall

[Hook]
New on the streets
My name's Rihanna

My name is Rihanna

[Verse 1]
Why do you call when I'm not feelin' you? (baby)
Why can't you leave? Boy, just walk away
When are you going to understand ohhha..
What sort of things they be tellin' you
I've got to stop them from compelling you boy
They better stop, they're not helping you ohhha...

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't even try, 'cause I know
That, you're not the one
Don't waste your time
Goodbye, don'tcha cry
The game is done

[Chorus]
I'm gonna tell you right here
Let this be the last time
I'm gonna make it so clear
Boy, you must be outcha mind
I'm gonna tell you right here
Let this be the last time
I'm gonna make it so clear
You must be outcha mind

[Verse 2]
Don't you lie, don't you try
Say goodbye, it just won't work
Your head's in the sky, must be trippin'
Must be high, but there's so much I'm worth
I'm not stupid, I'm not a fool
I know what I'm doin', I went to school
You better listen, do what you're told
My love's more valuable than a pot of gold

[Chorus]
I'm gonna tell you right here
Let this be the last time
I'm gonna make it so clear
Boy, you must be outcha mind
I'm gonna tell you right here
Let this be the last time
I'm gonna make it so clear
Must be outcha your mind

[Outro]
Don't even try, 'cause I, know that you're not the one
Don't waste your time
Goodbye, don't you cry
The game is done
Don't even try, 'cause I, know that you're not the one
Don't waste your time
Goodbye, don't you cry
The game is done

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the tree tops glisten
And children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow

I'm dreaming of a white christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white

I'm dreaming of a white christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the tree tops glisten
And children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white

[Verse 1]
Mother, mother
There's too many of you crying
Brother, brother, brother
There's far too many of you dying
You know we've got to find a way
To bring some lovin' here today, yeah
Father, father
We don't need to escalate
You see, war is not the answer
For only love can conquer hate
You know we've got to find a way
To bring some lovin' here today

[Chorus]
Picket lines and picket signs
Don't punish me with brutality
Talk to me, so you can see
Oh, what's going on
What's going on
Yeah, what's going on
Ah, what's going on

[Verse 2]
Mother, mother, everybody thinks we're wrong
Oh, but who are they to judge us
Simply because our hair is long?
Oh, you know we've got to find a way
To bring some understanding here today, oh

[Chorus]
Picket lines and picket signs
Don't punish me with brutality
Come on, talk to me
So you can see
What's going on
What's going on
What's going on
I'll tell you what's going on

Got some light-skinned bitches sitting by the torch

Lil Haiti, Haitians thank you for our boat ride

I see things in my sleep
This past week 

[?]
I'm on a cloud

[?]

[Verse 1]
I think they runnin' out of rappers to compare me with
Ain't a bitch out bad enough to pair me with
Usually only fuck with niggas that you hear me with
My jewelry dance like rubies skipping on canary bricks
On some donkey shit, nigga I bought me this
Shooters love me from Canal up to 40th

[Verse]
We don't talk no more and it's hard to not call you my baby
We don't fuck no more and it's hard to not call you my baby
But you wanna say this shit is over
Shawty I thought we were gettin' closer
Not gonna left me, nah
I don't wanna do this shit sober

[Pre-Chorus]
So I'm puttin' purple in the soda
And I'm gettin' throwed 'til it's over
I'm about to call the bitches over
I'm about to have me a party
And I'm about to have me a party
I'm fuckin' with a bad lil' shawty
I'm about to call the bitches over
'Cause I don't wanna do this solo

[Chorus]
I'ma come fuck you in the morning
I'ma come fuck you in the morning
Weed and the pussy and the money
I'ma lean in the pussy in the morning

Lookin' for somebody that'll show up (Yeah)

The skeleton goes twirling in the sea
For having been disobeyed to people
The father had drowned his daughter's body
No one could remember why exactly
A lost fisherman thought he'd caught big fish
The hanging bones were instead nightmarish

He rushed back home with her caught in his line
Lit a fire which appeased his panic
Kind ladies untangled her from her klink
To keep her warm, cloaked her with furs and hides
Starting to soften in the warm silence
Fell asleep, untempted by her presence

He was dreaming, a tear formed in his eyes
She saw it shine, suddenly felt thirsty
Unfurled her bones, brought her mouth to the tear
She drank and drank, it flowed like a river
Plunged her hand in and gently pulled his heart
Her four-fold drum that would follow her prayer
They woke up all entwined, breath against breath
Got up to live by the sea where they were fed
By the ocean

No, they are not afraid, death has its place
In order to create, in order to live

She'd beat the drum and would sing for new flesh
Sing for hair, eyes, chubby hands, legs, and breasts
All that a woman needs would then surface
She sang some more to bear the sleeping child
Slipped in back with him, new skin against skin
Returned the heart, the magnificent drum

And some collard greens, that shit was brackin'
Just cracked me a new bitch
Bust a new nut on her nigga's jersey
My bitch get off at 9 o'clock
So I had to shake her 'round 7:30

With these big guns, I'm hella dirty
Get caught with this shit
I ain't comin' home 'til like 2030

[Intro: Verse 1]
Remember when they used to say
That there would be something blay
And said that my beat delay wouldn't work
Well
You walk right out the door
And see me practice more and more
Now it seems that i'm absurdably obsessed
That's why, they're coming to take me away
Ha-haaa!

[Hook]
They're coming to take me away
Ho-hoo!
He-hee!
Ha-haaa!
To the funny farm, where beats are stolen all the time
And whack em caesars stay around

And show the men in the coats i'll be happy to go
They're comin' to take me away
Ho-hoo! He-hee! Ha-hahahaha!
Ho-hoo! Ha-hahaha!
Ha-hahaha!
Break

[Verse 2]
Now
You think it's a joke, the things I say

It seems that times have taught me
That if you troll, chan
You'll know you laugh
I heard you laugh
Ha-hahahaha-haha
You have the dirt to tell me
I'm totally mad?
I don't know why

[Hook]
They're coming to take me away

[Verse 3]
Why do you gotta take me away, man?
But every time they put me in
The room that makes you

Now
All of those times you called me whack

They're all one track
The Bass, the stairs
The hots for all your needs
You just wait

They rhymes play beats
Well, I play cuts
That's why, they're

[Verse 4]
But when they come and take me away
They would put me in this room
That I just go crazy, and
Break
Now
Looney Toons, go down the hall
My beats don't ever patter off the wall
They try to put a jacket around my lips
Well
If you put me away, you're totally wrong
I'm not gonna do it, my bass is so strong
My highs will probably wind up breakin' glass
That's why, they're

They're coming to take me away

[Verse 1: Tom Misch]
Came in boxes of two
So I gave one to you
And with every moment that went by
I wanted to spend a bit more time
Moving with you
Is all I needed to do
And in every cloud that shapes the sky
We'd watch til' the moon 

[moves?] through the night

[Chorus: Tom Misch & Carmody]
We got that easy love (x4)

[Verse 2: Carmody]
There's nothin' to say
But I like it that way
'Cause we don't need to speak in words
We make a sound they've never heard
I feel it like that
Like sun rays on my back
Like swimming through dark water at night
But knowin' that you will be alright

[Chorus: Tom Misch & Carmody]
We got that easy love (x4)

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3: Carmody]
Send me to a dreamy place and I'm hopin' we'll stay
But after they lie to my eyes then I hope it don't lose its way
'Cause it feels electric here

[Chorus: Tom Misch & Carmody]
We got that easy love (x4)

Merry Christmas, everybody
Quit hating

Chestnuts roasting on an open fire (oh, the session open fire)
Jack Frost nipping at your nose (get off my nose, Jack Frost)
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir (sing them, girls)
And folks dressed up like Eskimos (I love it)

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe (and some mac and cheese and greens and yams)
Help to make this season bright (Good Lord)
Tiny tots (with what?)
With their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight (never good)

They know that Santa's on his way (yes, he is)
He's loaded lots of toys up on that sleigh (woo!)
And every mother's child is 'bout to spy (on what?)
To see if them reindeer really know how to fly (hope you know they do)

And so I'm offering this simple phrase (and what's that?)
To kids from one to ninety-two (that's a lot of kids, a lot of kids)
Although it's been said many times many ways
Merry Christmas to you
Yeah, play them keys
Oh, man
I love them keys
Woo!
Y'all feel the spirit in your chest?
Can you feel the Christmas spirit in your chest?
'Cause I can feel it in mines

And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
I know it's been said many times and many ways
Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas to you

Wow, killed it
Jesus Christ
Let me do adlibs

[Intro]
Nuclear fusion

[Verse 1]
Look into the sky and see the pattern
Reflecting in your eye from a distance
Mirroring the stars are the atoms
Mixing up like a cocktail

[Pre-Chorus]
The devil's inside all the detail
The tittle runs wild under veil
Coming together in the pattern
Fit tightly like a dovetail

[Chorus]
Nuclear fusion
All the bonds that be couldn't break us
Exponentially in fine feather
We're essentially one being
All the bonds that be couldn't tear us
From eventually fusing tightly
We're essentially one being
Nuclear fusion

[Verse 2]
Ocean like a moat fortification
Separating me from restoration
My spirit leaves my body in frustration
Flying through the world in radiation

[Pre-Chorus]
The devil's inside all the detail
The tittle runs wild under veil
Coming together in the pattern
Fit tightly like a dovetail

[Chorus]
Nuclear fusion
All the bonds that be couldn't break us
Exponentially in fine feather
We're essentially one being
All the bonds that be couldn't tear us
From eventually fusing tightly
We're essentially one being
Nuclear fusion

[Outro]
All that I ever see is nuclear fusion
All that I ever hear is nuclear fusion
Nuclear fusion

Yeah
Sex game had her ass blowing me up (brrr)
Sex game had her ass texting me up

Whoa

[Chorus]

[Verse]
Look, give me the ball and I won't have to pass it
I ain't passing out until I'm asthma attacking
I take a plan and then I back-to-back it
Hit after hit, check the batting average
I take the work, flip it, acrobatic
Got a little time and a lot of talent
Do a little talking and a lot of action
Seen the competition, hm, not a challenge
I lean, I move, I walk through in this bitch
Packed out, but I can count on my hands who I'ma talk to in this bitch
Girls from law school in this bitch
Yeah, they paralegals
Barely 21, that's very legal
But they doing shit that's probably barely legal, aw, man
It's that nigga that you probably least expected
I just had a couple dots that need connecting
Now your top five getting redirected
From here on out, it'll be consecutive
We making moves like Tarantino, like J.J. Abrams
Moving like Channing Tatum
Moving like Jason Statham
Motherfuck the whole industry
Half of these niggas my mini-me's
I got this bitch going off more than breaking and entering
You hot for a minute, me
I make the shit that last for infinity
Hop in the booth, man, that shit like a gym to me, don't test the agility
Silly, silly, thinking that the negativity you talking could ever fuck up the tranquility, look
Okay, okay, okay, I'm on Rodeo for the day
If you owe me then you better pay your layaway, away
Stay away, or your ass might get K.O., kay today
Man, that "pew! pew!" hit your ass from like way, a-ways, away

[Chorus]
I got the moves
I got the moves (whoa)
I'm making moves
You gotta move (you gotta move)
She make that back move (damn)

Look, I'm a Don, I'm a Don, I'm a Don (Don)
I gave my whole family jobs and I take care of my Mom
Me and my girl been through so much, that's my partner in crime  (808 Mafia!)
Touch any of the above, now you harder to find
Gone
I'm just gonna stay till you tell me to go
I only wanna hear what I already know
But I just wanna hear it said out loud
"Leave me alone
God damn you, get out"

I'm just gonna stay till you tell me to leave
I'll climb onto your bed and I'll get under the sheets
Just until you look me straight in the eye
Point to the door
Say "good luck and goodbye"

And I'm just gonna stay till you give me a reason
I'm not gonna let you let me down easy
Not until I hear it straight from your mouth
"He's coming over
I don't want you around"

So I'm just gonna sit here and stare at your lips
I won't read it in your face
I won't take any hints
You only used me till someone real came along
Tell me the truth
Or tell me I'm wrong

[Outro: Sample]
"What good are words? What good are words?"
"Your heart is breaking."
"What good are words? What good are words?"
"I tried to tell you. You said you already knew."
"What good are words? What good are words?"
"Your time is up. Your time is up."
"What good are words? What good are words?"
"I was as honest as I knew how to be."

"What good are words? What good are words?"
"Your heart is breaking."
"What good are words? What good are words?"
"I could've betrayed you."
"What good are words? What good are words?"
"Your time is up. Your time is up."
"What good are words? What good are words?"
"You tricked me into loving you."

"I'm telling you that very frankly and honestly. If I did fall in love with you, it would still have to end in the same way."

[Sample from "Roxanne's Revenge" by Roxanne Shanté]
I asked you a question
I wanna know why
I wanna know why
Why'd you have to make a record 'bout me?
Why'd you have to make a record 'bout me?

[Verse 1]
I heard that you heard
That I was writing songs about you
That I was bad mouthing your name
In some shitty bar somewhere
You know how I love
These biased, one-sided conversations
So let's discuss the whos, the whys, the whens, the hows, the wheres
But who really cares

If it was all in my mind
If it was all in my mind
To begin with
If it was all in my mind
If it was all in my mind
To begin with

[Verse 2]
And I remember her bent over
And knowing that it was the last time
You know the end is near
If she only lets you fuck at night
And when she finally came even though she faked it
It was much appreciated
At least she had the decency
To try to make a sound she thought I'd like
But it's alright

Cause it was all in my mind
Cause it was all in my mind
To begin with
Cause it was all in my mind
Cause it was all in my mind
To begin with

[Maddie Acid]
Yeah I heard your song
But I wasn't impressed
So you got your feelings hurt
Now you're feeling depressed
Just because we had sex and it didn't last
Now you want revenge
You want to put me on blast
Don't make me laugh
Remember all the girls you played
And all the lies you told back in the day to get laid
An excuse for Suze
You got a story for Lori
And all those other girls you only called when you were horny
So yeah, it's nothing that you didn't do first
The only difference is that you probably did it worse
So look at the big bad soldier
Declaring holy war on every girl who didn't mean to fuck him over
But karma's a bitch
For hypocrites who kiss and tell
And talk shit about girls who only wished him well
So if you wanna chat
Just stick to the facts
And get at me
From Russia with love, Maddie

[Intro: Frankie Cosmos]
Cigarettes out the window
Cigarettes out the window

[Verse 1: TV Girl]
My girl Liddy used to always smoke
Cigarettes when she couldn't sleep
She'd disappear for an hour and a half
And when she'd come back, she'd brush her teeth
But I could still smell it on her raggedy tee
And I could taste it on her lips when we kissed
Poor little Liddy used to always quit
But she never really quit
She'd just say she did

[Chorus: Frankie Cosmos]
Cigarettes out the window (Ooh-ooh)
Cigarettes out the window (Ooh-ooh)
Cigarettes out the window (Ooh-ooh)
Cigarettes out the window (Ooh-ooh)

[Verse 2: TV Girl]
My girl Liddy used to always smoke
Cigarettes when she couldn't sleep
I wonder what she did when she got done
I guess she'd just flick them out in the street
Poor little Liddy, she wishes it was dark
But it's never really dark in LA
The light from the billboard always shines
But it changed twelve times since you went away

[Chorus: Frankie Cosmos]
Cigarettes out the window (Ooh-ooh)
Cigarettes out the window (Ooh-ooh)
Cigarettes out the window (Ooh-ooh)
Cigarettes out the window (Ooh-ooh)

[Outro: Victor Jory]
You'll find moonlit nights strangely empty because when you call my name through them there'll be no answer
Rather melodramatic, aren't you?
You'll find moonlit nights strangely empty because when you call my name through them there'll be no answer
You mind if I smoke?
You'll find moonlit nights strangely empty because when you call my name through them there'll be no answer (Ooh-ooh)
I always smoke with the theatre
You'll find moonlit nights strangely empty because when you call my name through them there'll be no answer (Ooh-ooh)
Somehow it enhances the performance

[Intro: Yeastie Girlz]
Now you suck
We wanna talk about sex but we're not allowed
Well, you may not like it but you better learn how 'cause it's your turn now
You're wasting your tongue with lame excuses and lies
Now, what's on your nasty old mind?

[Verse 1: TV Girl]
So how should I begin this?
I guess it started when you were with him
And how he never even took you out to dance
But did he fuck with any rhythm?
But now he's playing with your head
But did he ever make you cum?
Did he ever make you cry?
Do the wires in your mind get sewn together?
Rubbed and severed by the heat
You don't know how long I could stare into your picture
And wish that it was me
I guess it's different 'cause you love him
But I've got an interactive
Sick and twisted imagination
And that's gotta count for something

[Chorus: Yeastie Girlz]
We wanna talk about sex but we're not allowed
Well, you may not like it but you'd better learn how 'cause it's your turn now
You're wasting your tongue with lame excuses and lies
Get your face between my thighs

[Verse 2: TV Girl]
I dreamt of standing in your doorstep
Licking sweat off of your forehead
With your finger in my mouth
And the sound when leather jackets hit the ground
You should hear when you're not around
When it's just us horny poets
Who can't wait to write it down
And swear we were only being honest
Do you like these little sonnets?
'Cause I wrote them just for you
But how quickly they turn sour
So be careful who you screw
And never call
And I'm starting to suspect
You don't intend to do anything you say at all

[Chorus: Yeastie Girlz]
We wanna talk about sex but we're not allowed
Well, you may not like it but you'd better learn how 'cause it's your turn now
You're wasting your tongue with lame excuses and lies
Now, what's on your nasty old mind?

[Outro: Yeastie Girlz]
All by yourself, sittin' alone
I hope we're still friends, yeah, I hope you don't mind
All by yourself, sittin' alone
I hope we're still friends, yeah, I hope you don't mind
All by yourself, sittin' alone
I hope we're still friends, yeah, I hope you don't mind
All by yourself, sittin' alone
I hope we're still friends, yeah, I hope you don't mind
All by yourself, sittin' alone
I hope we're still friends, yeah, I hope you don't mind
All by yourself, sittin' alone
I hope we're still friends, yeah, I hope you don't mind
All by yourself, sittin' alone
I hope we're still friends, yeah, I hope you don't mind
All by yourself, sittin' alone
I hope we're still friends, yeah, I hope you don't mind
Here she comes walking down the street
Maddie Klein and her fabulous loving machine
In the place where I used to be
He almost looks like a human being

And here she comes walking down the street
Maddie Klein sure loves her little loving machine
Sometimes he holds her hand too tight
Ooh, but that's alright

Cause he'll never leave
No, he'll never leave
Will he ever pull her hair like she likes?
No, but that's alright
Maddie Klein and her fabulous loving machine

There they go, walking up the street
She'll take him home, shut him down, and she'll go to sleep
And that's just the way that it's got to be
She can't get him wet, or he'll overheat
And who really cares about a little rust
If Maddie Klein's got herself a little boy she can trust?
Sometimes she misses the flesh and bone
But they only wanna screw her, and leave her alone
But he'll never leave
No, he'll never leave
Will he ever smack her ass like she likes?
Will he ever make her laugh late at night?
No, but he'll never leave
When he gets obsolete
She can always just throw him away
And get a new one
But that's okay
She'll love him the same
As her fabulous loving machine
Gather around everybody
Have you heard the latest craze?
Put your hands in your pockets
And look the other way
Remember those times when you were laughing
Naked on my couch
Pretend it never happened
Politely smile as we turn around

Do the act like you never met me
Do the act like you never met me
Do the act like you never met me
And slowly walk away

The hidden kisses
The clumsy conspiratory glance
But I don't really mind it though
I always like the way you danced
It's so easy to do
So much simpler than the one we did before
Just point out your toe
At someone you know
And pretend that they're not
And do the act like you never met me
Do the act like you never met me
And do the act like you never met me
And slowly walk away

Slide to the left
Now slide to the right
Now tell me once again
How I was a really great guy
Dip to right
Shimmy to the left
It's 3 o'clock in the morning
Don't answer my texts
Take a step back and
Take a couple more
Now one more sorry look
Before you walk out that door
Arch your back
When you spend the night with him
Bounce around a while
Never talk to me again

That's how you do the
Act like you never met me
So do the act like you never met me
Do the act like you never met me
And slowly walk away
You should know, you should know, you should know
You should know by now
What they say, what they say, what they say
When you're not around
And a little girl should be careful
But who's gonna make her?
When those boys start playing too rough
Well who's gonna save her?

Remember your safeword
Remember your safeword
Remember your safeword
Remember your safeword

And it's a dull, dull world
Where you need to manufacture some action
She'll take you home, tie you up, and slap ya
Without even askin'
And all the clamps and whips in Los Angeles
Couldn't faze her
So if you really wanna see her in pain
Just wait until later
Remember your safeword
Remember your safeword
Remember your safeword
Remember your safeword

And if everything could come to a stop
Just from something she said
I thought the whole point was you were living on the edge
So when those sounds start to drift down the halls
And start to freak out the neighbors
Remember that it's good, clean, fun
Just wholesome delinquent behavior

Remember your safeword
Remember your safeword
Remember your safeword
Remember your safeword
Remember your safeword
Remember your safeword

[Verse 1: R. Kelly]
There was a family filled with cheer and lots of glee
And that special night they couldn't wait to light the Christmas tree
And throughout the town, they'd gather 'round to hear the choir sing
Once upon a time
I reminisce all the things we'd wish Santa would bring
Stockings on the fireplace and bells ringing
Outside we'd go play in the snow make angel wings
Once upon a time
Fireplaces, noels, cozy nights, and fairy tales
Peace amongst family
Yes, we'd laugh a lot, have photo ops, candy canes, and lemon drops
Seasons greetings
We'd throw snowballs, we'd laugh, we'd fall, we'd build snowmen
Once upon a time
They who didn't have much we'd share some love throughout the year
Once upon a time
Once upon a time
Once upon a time
So remember this, grown-up or kids, never forget
Your once upon a time

[Verse 1]
I think of you every single evening
As I lay awake at night
I try to think; try to walk away with you...me in
And I say

[Chorus]
Honey baby don't do nothing crazy
When I say that everything will be fine!
Oh, honey baby, oh
How can you blame me
When I say I wanna make you mine?
Cause everybody else in the world is driving me crazy
Except you, honey baby!
Oh!

[Verse 2]
Flying high, I can see his smiling
As we walk down by the drives
Take my hand, take my breath away
Cause you make me feel like flying!

[Chorus]
Honey baby don't do nothing crazy
When I say that everything will be fine!
Oh, honey baby, oh
How can you blame me
When I say I wanna make you mine?
Cause everybody else in the world is driving me crazy
Except you, honey baby!

[Bridge]
Oh, you are everything I'll never need
Oh, you are everything I wanna be!
Drive me crazy, have me baby
All I really wanna say is

[Chorus]
Honey baby don't do nothing crazy
When I say that everything will be fine!
Oh, honey baby, oh
How can you blame me
When I say I wanna make you mine?
Cause everybody else in the world is driving me crazy
Except you, honey baby!

[Verse 1]
One daybreak, one heartache
Every once-upon-a-time
That black dress, happiness
Bubble baths and quarter lines

[Pre-Chorus]
They mean so much to everyone
But you count them up one by one

[Chorus]
Clear midnights and this spotlight
Once thinking that your dad was ten feet tall
A blue bonnet, a braid on it
Quiet winters and leaves that always fall
Your black boots, my red flower ring
Live for the little things

[Verse 2]
Oil paintings and making
Every detail turn out bad
One last stands, new romance
Living for that love and person

[Pre-Chorus]
They mean so much to everyone
But you count them up one by one

[Chorus]
Clear midnights and this spotlight
Once thinking that your dad was ten feet tall
A blue bonnet, a braid on it
Quiet winters and leaves that always fall
Your black boots, my red flower ring
Live for the little things

Ohh, yeah
Ohh

[Bridge]
No fighting, black riding
Wish upon a star and give the moon a smile
Pretending, defending
Take a risk and go along for the ride
Strawberries and fairies with wings
Live for the little things

[Outro]
Na na na...
Oh, yeah
Na na na...
Ohh, yeah
Na na na...

I need you more than I know how to mention
And I'd give forever to get your attention
Be you're summer midnight with starry blue eyes
That only see you and are yours every night

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh, love's like this
It's something I missed
Ooh, ooh, love's like this

[Chorus]
And that small town daydream
Lasted all night
'Cause tonight all those bright city lights
Just look at you look at me
Heaven looked down to see
We're falling now
And there's nothing we ain't too sure of
Just two kids making up for lost love

[Verse 2]
All of the days that I couldn't get it right
It all disappeared lying here by your side
With your dirty blue jeans and my crooked smile
You make it look easy changing my life

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh, love's like this
It's something I missed
Ooh, ooh, love's like this

[Chorus]
And that small town daydream
Lasted all night
'Cause tonight all those bright city lights
Just look at you look at me
Heaven looked down to see
We're falling now
And there's nothing we ain't too sure of
Just two kids making up for lost love

[Bridge]
Heaven had quite the time
To figure this life out
But baby I've got mine
To give you everything you dream about

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh, love's like this
It's something I missed
Ooh, ooh, love's like this

[Chorus]
And that small town daydream
Lasted all night
'Cause tonight all those bright city lights
Just look at you look at me
Heaven looked down to see
We're falling now
And there's nothing we ain't too sure of
Just two kids making up for lost love

And that small town daydream
Lasted all night
'Cause tonight all those bright city lights
Just look at you look at me
Heaven looked down to see
We're falling now
And there's nothing we ain't too sure of
Just two kids making up for lost love

Chef for the year, better yet, the fucking century
Dread head killers with me before dem up insolate
I'm in the kitchen scrapping up the pottery
Working with my hands like the maestro at the symphony
Sniff, I'm cocaina, shawty, take a wiff off me
Snuffleupagus nigga come and cop a eight from me
Talk slick to me, E40 style, you hearing me?
Got a green skirt and I bought it off a recipe

I got exactly what you need to do your thing when you pitching
Guarantee to add a few layers of bling on your stitching
Bein' teeded in your chest get you stinging and itching
Got to have the right ingredients before you can start
Like one part gangsterism with one part heart
Two parts of keeping it G and add you one hundred
Milligrams of a killer, man and you'd had done it
Put it all inside a Cadillac with them 3's and them 4's
Swang wide and mix scurrily while skating on vogues
Don't forget to shake them haters off homie that's a necessity
Now you done made you a trill, nigga, now that's the recipe

He only loves you when he's high
He only wants you half the time
He only calls you when he's dry
He only loves you when he's high

He only kisses you at night
He's always turning off the lights
He doesn't keep you in his mind
He barely looks you in the eyes

Heart break and stomach pains is all he leaves
You don't know where else to go so you won't leave

He never loves you when he's clean
He doesn't treat you like a queen
I don't think love should be so mean
I don't think love should be so mean

[Verse 1]
Here in my mind the sky looks the same
On every day you loved me
When we started home it started to rain
You put your coat around me
We stood there in the road
You held me so close
But did you ever let go

[Chorus]
Down came the rain
Lightning and thunder
We tried in vain
To hold on to each other
Winds of change blew you away from me
Right here right now, I feel it on my skin
The bitter sting of what we could’ve been
Just when our love was like a burning flame
Down came the rain

[Verse 2]
In through the window I see her with you
I’m soaked to the skin, you’re warm and dry
I guess the storm is over for you
But look at the tears here in my eyes
I just stood there like a ghost
As you held her so close
And as I let you go

[Chorus]
Down came the rain
Lightning and thunder
We tried in vain
To hold on to each other
Winds of change blew you away from me
Love like this changes who you are
Every kiss you gave me is a scar
Just when our love was like a burning flame
Down came the rain

[Bridge]
All I need is to move on fast
But all I want is to have you back
And it just keeps falling…

[Chorus]
Down came the rain
Lightning and thunder
We tried in vain
To hold on to each other
Winds of change blew you away from me
Right here right now, I feel it on my skin
The bitter sting of what we could’ve been
Just when our love was like a burning flame
Down came the rain
Down came the rain

[Pre-Chorus]
You say you want a better life, I know
You're tired of all these party nights with nothing left to show
When everybody is living life with someone they can't hold
It must be hard to sleep at night, believe me girl, I know

[Chorus]
I wanna be your lover that you need
I wanna be the shore to your sea
You'll always have a home here with me
I wanna be
I wanna be
I wanna be (be-be-be)
I wanna be (be-be-be), oh
I wanna be (be-be-be)
I wanna be (be-be-be)

[Pre-Chorus]
You say you want a better life, I know
You're tired of all these party nights with nothing left to show
When everybody is living life with someone they can't hold
It must be hard to sleep at night, believe me girl, I know

[Chorus]
I wanna be the lover that you need
I wanna be the shore to your sea
You'll always have a home here with me
I wanna be
I wanna be
I wanna be (be-be-be)
I wanna be (be-be-be), oh
I wanna be (be-be-be)
I wanna be (be-be-be)

[Verse 1]
Guess mine is not the first heart broken
My eyes are not the first to cry
I'm not the first to know
There's just no getting over you
You know I'm just a fool who's willing
To sit around and wait for you
But, baby, can't you see
There's nothing else for me to do?
I'm hopelessly devoted to you

[Chorus]
But now there's nowhere to hide
Since you pushed my love aside
I'm out of my head
Hopelessly devoted to you
Hopelessly devoted to you
Hopelessly devoted to you

[Verse 2]
My head is saying, "Fool, forget him"
My heart is saying, "Don't let go
Hold on till the end"
And that's what I intend to do
I'm hopelessly devoted to you

[Chorus]
But now there's nowhere to hide
Since you pushed my love aside
I'm out of my head
Hopelessly devoted to you
Hopelessly devoted to you
Hopelessly devoted to you

[Verse 1]
I got a lying smile I never put out for you
Cause I guess I never felt like I really needed to
And they say little girls have big dreams
And nothing in the world was gonna come between me and you

[Chorus]
And it was a long time coming
I waited half my life just to find someone like you
I spent a long time finding out love hangs around after you walk out
Not knowing it'd be a long time going

[Verse 2]
They say it's better to have lost than never to have loved at all
And I say, whoever said that didn't have too far to fall
And they say little girls are so naive
That wasn't how it was supposed to be with me and you

[Chorus]
And it was a long time coming
I waited half my life just to find someone like you
I spend a long time finding out love hangs around after you walk out
Not knowing it will be a long time going

[Bridge]
I've burned my bridges, had sleepless nights
Washed my sins on the neon lights
And I'm still not over you

[Chorus]
And it was a long time coming
I waited half my life just to find someone like you
I spend a long time finding out love hangs around after you walk out
Not knowing it will be a long time going

A long time going

And it will be a long time, long time going
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh

It will be a long time, long time going, going
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh

[Verse 1]
Come on, gather 'round, I'm gonna tell you how the fire went out
Sorry for the inconvenience, I didn't mean to let you down
We were supposed to be forever but it's too bad you didn't see that to me
You were the perfect view of misery

[Chorus]
I never talked about the tears I cried
All the sleepless nights or the endless fights
I never talked about the days he called
There was something wrong, it was all my fault
I had it all, what a shame, what a fall now
But in case you haven't heard the news
There wasn't much love to lose

[Verse 2]
Let's talk about that golden boy that I met on a winter night
How was I supposed to know that he was just as cold inside?
He smiled and I smiled, well the camera's in your mind
And I lied, I swore that everything was fine

[Chorus]
I never talked about the tears I cried
All the sleepless nights or the endless fights
I never talked about the nights he called
There was something wrong, it was all my fault
I had it all, what a shame, what a fall now
But in case you haven't heard the news
There wasn't much love to lose

[Bridge]
I know you wanna talk about me
How I gave up on love so foolishly
But keep in mind

[Chorus]
I never talked about the tears I cried
All the sleepless nights or the endless fights
I never talked about the nights he called
There was something wrong, it was all my fault
I had it all, what a shame, what a fall now
But in case you haven't heard the news
There wasn't much love to lose

[Outro]
Come on, gather 'round, I'm gonna tell you how the fire went out

[Verse 1]
Something about me didn't fit into your perfect world
I bet the bluegrass stained your smile
You should use a darker color when you write on the wall
I haven't read it a thousand times

[Pre-Chorus]
Maybe if you saw me for a second you would realize
Honey I was trying so hard

[Chorus]
To talk, walk, think, stop
Anytime you want me to
Bend all my rules
I used to let you choose
Who you wanted me to be
This time I'm flying free
It's my turn to be me

[Verse 2]
You liked the face but you had to replace me
Inside I saw the walls of me go down
You can take the girl away from
Cowboy hats and steel guitars
She'll still sing the same old songs

[Pre-Chorus]
Maybe if you saw me for a second you would realize
Honey I was trying so hard

[Chorus]
To talk, walk, think, stop
Anytime you want me to
Bend all my rules
I used to let you choose
Who you wanted me to be
This time I'm flying free
It's my turn to be me

[Bridge]
Turned on that radio
Hey that's when I realized
It wasn't our song, it was yours
And in conversation baby I was decoration
Now I deserve a little bit more than

[Chorus]
To talk, walk, think, stop
Anytime you want me to
Bend all my rules
I used to let you choose
Who you wanted me to be
This time I'm flying free
It's my turn to be me
I shined your shoes
I poured the wine
I gave you all of my time

I patched your dents
Smiled at your friends
Which apparently is a crime

I gave you space
You took my place
And gave it to her

But life's too long
To waste it all loving a liar

And when love hands me matches now
I'm gonna burn it down

I keyed her car
Got my guitar
And wrote this damn song
Look what you've found
She's been around
I hear the lines long

And don't you tell me
To be nice
I'm not a nice girl

She died from complications
Of the things you told her

So when love hands me matches now
I'm gonna burn it down

Ain't it funny
You said honey
You meant sitting duck
Well I say, cheater, liar, truck on fire, loser, leaver, deceiver
Just a few I've thought of

And when love hands me matches now
'Gonna burn it down
I'm gonna burn it down
Oh yeah
Gonna burn it, burn it, burn it down
Matches, now

[Verse 1]
He's got a nice little life
He's gonna live it, but on
Friday nights he plays that mandolin
Painted red, and he said
It's not the best I know
But it's mine, I'm gonna make it mine
People there can't help but care
About the friendly music of a guy
Who's getting by from their applause
He's got a song that moves along
He's got his local crowd tonight
At Angelina's family bar and grill

[Chorus]
He's got his heart on his sleeve
The songs he plays just living free
But who knows what goes through his mind
When he plays a song it brings along
Everybody saying
Who's that guy who plays the mandolin... mandolin
Oh yeah, mandolin

[Verse 2]
Got a car, got a scar
Like everyone he's got a few but
Everybody loves that mandolin
Got his problems, bills to pay
Somehow that boy finds a way
Through paychecks in tip jars, yeah

[Chorus]
He's got his heart on his sleeve
The songs he plays just living free
But who knows what goes through his mind
When he plays a song it brings along
Everybody saying
Who's that guy who plays the mandolin... mandolin
Oh yeah, mandolin

[Bridge]
Oh he's the kind of guy
Who never really wanted fame
His feet are planted firmly on the ground
He never wanted people to remember his name
He never wanted word to get around
That he found heaven on earth

[Chorus]
He's got his heart on his sleeve
The songs he plays just living free
But who knows what goes through his mind
When he plays a song it brings along
Everybody saying
Who's that guy who plays the mandolin
Oh, I'm the guy who plays the mandolin
Mandolin
Oh, mandolin

[Intro: Pharrell, DJ Drama, & DJ drops]
Gangsta Gri-Zillz!
Shout to VA!
Yeah, uh-huh
Shout my nigga Chad Hugo!
Ha
Rob Walker, what up?
Aphilliates, nigga! Pay attention!
Ayo, yo

[Verse (false starts): Pharrell, DJ Drama, & DJ drops]
Water's boiling, the rocks is coiling
That desire inside of you is far from dormant (Gangsta!)
Water's boiling, the rocks is coiling
That desire inside of you is far from— (It's Gangsta Grillz, you bastards! Ill!)

[Verse: Pharrell, DJ Drama, & DJ drops]
Water's boiling, the rocks is coiling
That desire inside of you is far from dormant
You only hear the smoke when you cross these lines
Up early in the mornin' like it's coffee time (Gangsta Gri-Zillz!)
We got the sharpest mind like we porcupines
Cross me in the desert and you'll see his eagle
Ain't no referee, and there ain't no free throws
It's all illegal, diet períco
My fans smoke it up 'til they the size of Smeagol
Look at my hands, I'm the Lord of the Rings
Musical cocaine brought me all these things
Some nod, some bob, some throw up, some sing
The ill visual, I keep the watch visible
But it's set invisible so you'll think that I'm kidding you
It's there, but it's not there—you think that I'm shitting you
You see it, but you can't believe it, so it's killing you
The 9-11 got the right chrome selected
Now it's looking just like a bullfrog, pregnant
It don't hop; yeah, it drop
Call me "David Blaine" and ask me where is the top
Or ask this young nigga what it's like to ride in jets
Daytime, it leave smoke like a backwards cigarette
At nightime, it look like it's just been lit, I bet
My set is when my thumb is rubbing my index
Your girl told me to tell you something right before she lick
You wanna know what she said?

[Intro:]
Yup, yup, yessir
Yup, yup, yessir

[Verse 1]
Ayo, let me enlighten y'all, let me spark this shit
We amongst the yellow juice sippers and the kush crumblers
The diesel distributors and coca tumblers
We shut down the club in amazement for those that are under us
The go-pro bitches, they wanna run with us
Wanna blow me slowly, speed it up, fuck it, just run with us
Wanna have fun with us, not be distraught and sick
Cause when the Enzo pull up, nigga park yo' whip
Spectators be yapping on some Bob Costa shit
I ain't just talking shit, I'm Marcus Vick
Without the Heisman Trophy but with the Hawaiian Sophies
Frequent flyer miles, I be flying, them hoes be
The chain tucked your sight 'cause you eyeing it grossly
Reach is a toothbrush, the iron is close, we
Keep me surrounded, so please don't try it
Them po' don't think, no time to decide it
Unless you wanna be in the papers, and you headlining
Your whole fucking name followed by 'he dying'
If that was your food for thought you should go on a diet, haha
I just fried it

[Hook]
Yup, yup, yessir
Yup, yup, yessir
Yup, yup, yessir
Yup, yup, yessir

[Verse 2]
I just arrived in a five-star hotel out in Hotlanta
Speeding away from a van filled with bitches with cameras
The flash hits my ear, blinds 'em all with the gamma
Me and a stripper, she got a bubble and that cute Southern grammar
You know the type, probably stripped from Texas to Tampa
Waiting to lie, telling you it was for college or Pampers
But I go through drastic measures not to ask as pleasure
I trade the gas and breakfast for the ass and the headers
Then "Top of the morning to ya," now she gotta zoom home
She gotta dance all night until the moon's gone
We head to Magic City, gotta hit a new zone
All you see is pearls, silent colors, two tones
On your life, nigga, nothing but tombstones
Some many Phantoms, the parking lot look like a graveyard
It's the domain where err'body play God
The underlings is king, ordering more by the card
Throw 20 grand up whenever Jeezy says "Yeah"
Give a new meaning to the phrase, "There's money in the air"
I was there

[Hook]
Yup, yup, yessir
Yup, yup, yessir
Yup, yup, yessir
Yup, yup, yessir

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
Yeah this Pimps Christmas
Yeah this Pimps Christmas
Yeah this Pimps Christmas
Yeah this Pimps Christmas
December 25th a pimp Christmas
Let me check my gift list, I'm on some pimp shit
Yes indeed, I proceed to roll up the trees
Snoopy DO-Double G aw nigga please
Let me show you how it is what we lookin' for
We tryna get the dough I'm at the liqour store
I'm tryna crack a hoe, you know I'm gettin' dough
I'm in a Bentley you know that motherfucker snow
It's all white delight, you know its extra tight
I'm tryna crack a bitch til I get my money right
You know I'm extra tight, I'm takin' hella flight
Catch a bad bitch I'm just like Dolomite
It's a pimp Christmas, that's what it is nigga
I treated you bad my dear
I'll blame it on fear
To help my own ears

And I put myself first my love
I pushed and I pushed
And I shoved and I shoved

Sometimes I can't breathe
And I push you out to sea
And leave you drowning
Drowning

And you, you smy soul my friend
You know that I know
That this ain't the end
And you opened my heart again
But things they have changed now
And we can't pretend

But we've got mountains to climb
And sure I'm happy when you're mine
But we're drowning
Drowning

[Verse 1]
"I need you now"
Read letters that I wrote on the wall
And the message that I left when I called
"I need you now"
Words I said drowned out by the rain
Waiting there for you but you never came

[Pre-Chorus]
My world’s a little colder now
But I’m keeping warm somehow

[Chorus]
So here you are at my window
Guess nobody told you
I don’t need you, don’t need you
And I waited so frustrated
Who’s gonna hold you?
I don’t need you, don’t need you now

[Verse 2]
"I need you now"
Words I heard you whisper to me
We were walking down a one-way street
You need me now
That’s what you’ve been telling my friends
But I’ve come too far to go back there again

[Pre-Chorus]
My heart, my mind, and numbers have changed
You might as well forget my name

[Chorus]
So here you are at my window
Guess nobody told you
I don’t need you, don’t need you
And I waited so frustrated
Who’s gonna hold you?
I don’t need you, don’t need you now

[Bridge]
"I need you now"
Read letters that I wrote on the wall
And the message that I left when I called

[Chorus]
So here you are at my window
Guess nobody told you
I don’t need you, don’t need you
And I waited so frustrated
Who’s gonna hold you?
I don’t need you, don’t need you now

[Outro]
And I don’t look for your car
I don’t wonder where you are
I don’t dream about you 'cause I don’t need you now
I don’t dream about the way
That I never heard you say:
“I need you, I need you”
I don’t need you now
Don’t need you
Don’t need you now

[Verse 1]
I think you fell off of your cloud today
You didn't see it coming or did you
You tried to please everybody
But the sweet breeze swept you away

[Pre-Chorus]
The sun goes down on a good day
Tomorrow is still an unknown
You think you're all alone in this place
I think you're crazy 'cause I still love you baby

[Chorus]
Oh don't fade away baby
Blowing in the wind is getting harder to do
Don't count the days as they leave you
Count them as you find a day new
Don't fade away
Never fade

[Verse 2]
Hard to breathe, nobody knows it's you
Somebody blows your candle out
You wore a mask, now that's broken too
Everybody else was everything to you

[Pre-Chorus]
The sun goes down on a good day
Tomorrow is still an unknown
You think everybody wants a fight
I think you're crazy 'cause I still love you baby

[Chorus]
Oh don't fade away baby
Blowing in the wind is getting harder to do
Don't count the days as they leave you
Count them as you find a day new
Don't fade away
Never fade

[Verse 3]
I think you fell out of the sky today
I think you know it's true
You've seen the world, now all you see is me
Tell me now baby what are you gonna do

[Chorus]
Oh don't fade away baby
Blowing in the wind is getting harder to do
Don't count the days as they leave you
Count them as you find a day new
Don't fade away
Don't fade away
Don't fade away
Never fade

[Verse 1]
Standing on the border
Looking out into the great unknown
I can feel my heart beating faster as I step out on my own
There's a new horizon and the promise of favorable wind
I'm heading out tonight, traveling light
I'm gonna start all over again

[Chorus]
And buy a one-way ticket on a west bound train
See how far I can go
'Cause I'm gonna go out dancing in the pouring rain
And talk to someone I don't know
I will face the world around me
Knowing that I'm strong enough to let you go
And I will fall in love again
Because I can

[Verse 2]
Gonna climb the mountain
And look the eagle in the eye
I won't let fear clip my wings and tell me how high I can fly
How could I have ever believed
That love had to be so blind
When freedom was waiting, down at the station
All I had to do was make up my mind

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Well, I have walked through the fire
And crawled on my knees through the valley of the shadow of doubt
Then the truth came shining like a light on me and now I can see my way out

[Chorus]
Buy a one-way ticket on a west bound train
See how far I can go
'Cause I'm gonna go out dancing in the pouring rain
And talk to someone I don't know

Buy a one-way ticket on a west bound train
I'm gonna have my breakfast with some pink champagne
Gonna sail the ocean, gonna spread my wings
Gonna climb that mountain, gonna do everything
I was scared of dentists and the dark
I was scared of pretty girls and starting conversations
Oh, all my friends are turning green
You're the magician's assistant in their dreams

Oh, and they come unstuck

Lady, running down to the riptide
Taken away to the dark side
I wanna be your left hand man
I love you when you're singing that song and
I got a lump in my throat because
You're gonna sing the words wrong

There's this movie that I think you'll like
This guy decides to quit his job and heads to New York City
This cowboy's running from himself
And she's been living on the highest shelf

Oh, and they come unstuck
Lady, running down to the riptide
Taken away to the dark side
I wanna be your left hand man
I love you when you're singing that song and
I got a lump in my throat because
You're gonna sing the words wrong

I just wanna, I just wanna know
If you're gonna, if you're gonna stay
I just gotta, I just gotta know
I can't have it, I can't have it any other way
I swear she's destined for the screen
Closest thing to Michelle Pfeiffer that you've ever seen, oh

Lady, running down to the riptide
Taken away to the dark side
I wanna be your left hand man
I love you when you're singing that song and
I got a lump in my throat because
You're gonna sing the words wrong

Oh lady, running down to the riptide
Taken away to the dark side
I wanna be your left hand man
I love you when you're singing that song and
I got a lump in my throat because
You're gonna sing the words wrong
Oh lady, running down to the riptide
Taken away to the dark side
I wanna be your left hand man
I love you when you're singing that song and
I got a lump in my throat because
You're gonna sing the words wrong
I got a lump in my throat because you're gonna sing the words wrong
There's a plane or a bus leaving Dallas
I hope you're on it
If there's a train moving fast down the tracks
I hope you caught it
'Cause I swear out there ain't where
You outta be
So catch a ride or catch a cab
Don't you know that I miss you bad
But don't you walk to me

Baby run cut a path across the blue sky
Straight in a straight line
You can't get here fast enough
Find a truck and fire it up
Lean on the gas and off the clutch
Leave Dallas in the dust
I need you in a rush
So baby run
So baby run

Oh if you ain't got a suitcase
Get a box
Or an old brown paper sack
Pack it light or pack it heavy
Take a truck, take a Chevy
Baby just come back
There's a shortcut to the highway out of town
Why don't you take it
Don't let that speed limit slow you down
Go on and break it
Baby break it
Baby run
Cut a path across the blue sky
Straight in a straight line
You can't get here fast enough
Find a truck and fire it up
Lean on the gas and off the clutch
Leave Dallas in the dust
I need you in a rush
So baby run

Run to me
Baby run
Run to me
So baby run
Run
Oh baby run
I'm still wearing my blue jeans
No I don't know what you mean
I'm still the same girl
Picking daisies in the field
I believe in what I feel
I've always been the same girl

Some moments change your life
This could be one of them
I'm just living life and thinking
Hey this could be fun

I've always been the same girl
Living in the same world
Singing little songs at the break of dawn girl
Sitting on the front porch
Do do do do do
Watching what you say girl
Never blow away girl
Living in the crazy world
I've always been the same girl
I still live in one small town
But always love to move around
I've always been the same girl
Still keep diaries that say
Where I was and did that day
I've always been the same girl

Some moments change your life
This could be one of them
I'm just living life and thinking
Hey this could be fun

I've always been the same girl
Living in the same world
Singing little songs at the break of dawn girl
Sitting on the front porch
Do do do do do
Watching what you say girl
Never blow away girl
Living in the crazy world
I've always been the same girl

Some days will change your life
Yeah this could be one of them
I'm just living life and thinking...
I've always been the same girl
Living in the same world
Singing little songs at the break of dawn girl
Sitting on the front porch
Do do do do do
Watching what you say girl
Never blow away girl
Living in the crazy world
I've always been the same girl

Living in the crazy world
I've always been the same girl

[Verse 1]
If I could be sweet
I would but first of all, let me say
I must apologize for acting stank and treating you this way
Cause I've been acting like sour milk all on the floor
Its your fault you didn't shut the refrigerator
Maybe that's the reason I've been acting so cold

[Chorus]
If I could escape
And recreate a place that's my own world
And I could be your favorite girl
Forever, perfectly together
Now tell me boy now wouldn't that be sweet
If I could be sweet
Sorry, but I know I've been a real bad girl
I didn't mean for you to get hurt
Whatsoever
We can make it better
Now tell me boy now wouldn't that be sweet
Sweet escape, sweet escape

[Verse 2]
You let me drown
I'm at my lowest boiling point
Come help me out
I need to get me out of this joint
Come on, let's bounce
Counting on you to turn me around
Instead of clowning around
Let's look for some common ground
Oh baby
Times been getting a little crazy
I've been getting a little lazy
Waiting for you to come save me
I can see that you're angry
By the way that you treat me
Hopefully, you don't leave me
Wanna take you with me

[Chorus]
If I could escape
And recreate a place that's my own world
And I could be your favorite girl
Forever, perfectly together
Now tell me boy now wouldn't that be sweet
If I could be sweet
Sorry, but I know I've been a real bad girl
I didn't mean for you to get hurt
Whatsoever
We can make it better
Now tell me boy now wouldn't that be sweet
Sweet escape, sweet escape

Feel just like a...
Now that the light is fading
Silver and purple at twilight
Scenes of the day remain with us
Bright as the fire is burning bright

Blue as the sky above the lake
And blue the water flowing
White birch drooping on the shore
Her leaves of emerald glowing

The night is robed in spangled black
And soon we shall be sleeping
Beyond the moon that rides on high
The radiant dawn is creeping, creeping

Down through the leaves, the sunlight
Came in shafts of gold
Now by the dying embers
We watch the day grow old

Your heater is busted
If your bank keeps calling
And your parents are 

[?]
Follow me
We gon' build up this movement
Your boots on your feet
Put your hands in your gloves
Put 'em up, let 'em see
We gon' build, we gon' build my brother
We gon' build, we gon' build my sister
We gon' build, we gon' build my brother
We gon' build
Put your hands in your gloves, let 'em see

[Verse 1: Kev Nish]
We be stalking on the bottom of the dryest well
Form a movement to the top, 'till we high as hell
To the future, fuck the past, 'cause I built on that
Beat down the rules and regulations that was built on crap
Bring down the family after Reagan
Put jack before my paycheck
Empty hotel rooms, and my man can't get a blanket
Nah, I ain't anti, just raising up the ante
This nation's under fire and you sipping the chianti
There's racists out for hire, 

[?]
Three dollar bottel water, mother nature's trying to jack me
The opposite of build is what's really going on
You know there's really something wrong
When you can't see you're getting robbed
You got your fingers in my pockets like you reaching for my holes
Write me up another ticket, while you're writing up the laws
You victims pay attention 'cause there's writings on the wall
It says "In God we trust", don't trust the government at all

[Verse 2: Prohgress]
They trying to tear us down
I don't care you whores tell us
I got a sledge camera that'll make Thor jalous
When I put the smash down I'm pissed like wrong tennets
Crashing through your vine, like a drop at the wrong palace
Get the fuck up out the way, the night train is coming through
Or get your ass aboard, 'cause time waits for none of you
Bow down to MCs, 9 steps in front of you
Our boots leave cracks that like weights that're falling through
You don't want FM in the hands of your core fans
You'll lose your own shine, you'll raps out boreland
Buy us on the track, he blow spots like Tim Taylor
You'll get no facetime just a hat and "howdy neighbor"
Imma build an army of B-boys and DJs
MC and graphiters who spray what we say
It's the truth like P-square shooting over his man
When we rule we letting loose like some Red Sox fans

[Interlude]
Oh build, oh build
Oh, oh, oh build
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh build, oh build
Oh, oh, oh build
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 3: Bias]
You are now tunes into the sounds of FM and Bias
You're about to build right now
We got the lights out
We is on right now
We got a hot tech beat and it drives you crazy
'Cause now you're playing catchup like Kerry's lady
I'm synonymous with victories like Redsky's name
After this I'm 'bout to go an watch the SC game
At the bar with FM, "We need 4 more beers!"
Y'all can bang this cup for 4 more years
Go ahead, enjoy that high, smoke that kush
'Cause like hippy boy, we gonna see a lot more bush
You're always calling my crib where I used to stay
Girls never knew I'm a player, they used to say
"If he was rich then maybe I might feel him"
Now they throwing it at me like my 

[?]
And they out there listening, still all smiling
'Cause they know they really a freak like Bill O'Reilly
For the 9 to 5 workers, Imma free these cowards
'Cause we's about to build like the freedom tower

[Verse 4: J-Splif]
It's a cycle everyday, wake up early as the sun
Blue collar mind state, 'cause the job is never done
Lack of the funds make me envy the wealthy
Always plotting up schemes, my imagination healthy
Starting with labels and wooden building blocks
Out to grow my ideas on buildings on the block
Construction's gradual, not an overnight step
We constructing the manual for generation X
Foundation is strong, and the future looks bright
So look ahead, move along, and we blow when it's time
'Till the moment is right, we gon' keep on working
Students of the game, we gon' keep on learning
No mountain high enough, the desire to keep burning
Ain't no valley too low for some deep soul searching
We built an empire with no ending in mind
Strange solid as a rock, watch us climbing to our prime

[Hook: Prohgress]

With waves of this feeling
As light as the ocean
And then I see you
When I feel like I'm drowning
And then I see you
It's okay, it's okay, I'm okay, I'm alright again
It's okay, I'm okay, it's okay

[Chorus]
Take me to that place where you always go
When you're sleeping or your day takes you low, so low
When I'm on and off again, on and off again, on and off again, oh

Where you always go
Where you always go (Take me, take me )
Where you always go (Take me)
Where you always (Take)
I've seen the dreadlocked man sit by the magic tree
Singing songs of the wise the wise and the free
And the bike slipped from beneath my drunken weight

And my body it became the tar's evening bait
But none of this is fate

And I've crawled through the bushes and the spiders and thorns
To delve beyond the barrier of the celebration core
I'm just an innocent outlaw
And I know that it's good that I'm doing this for

It's all lies

And my limbs have danced for the Amsterdam sunrise
With not one restriction and not one disguise
Monotony is what I despise
Integration to society would be my demise
It's all lies

[Chorus]
I got that work
That shoop that'll make your back bounce (you gotta believe me, baby)
Don't get yourself hurt and worn out, little girl

She walks past here every day now
You bet I stare
You bet I stare
She looks at me then she looks away
She doesn't care
She doesn't care

But now I, will let her go
Because she, will never let me know
But now I, will let her go
Because she, will never let me know

She walks past here every day now
You bet I stare
You bet I stare
She looks at me then she looks away
She doesn't care
She doesn't care
Stay away from my baby
Even though her love may stray
I never thought she'd mean this much
There's a difference between this lover and lust

Stay away from my lady
When she’s gone days are so hazy
If she left I'd be oh-so lost
I'll keep her here whatever the cost

It's not like I’m a greedy boy at all
It's the flowers in your hair, the way she gives her stare, so

Stay away from my baby, even though her love may change
I'll keep you here my dear, sweetheart
Never leave, please don't depart

Stay away from my lady
I could never leave such a lady
Keep you here, my dear sweetheart
Never leave, never depart

[Verse 1]
I won't just survive
Oh, you will see me thrive
Can write my story
I'm beyond the archetype
I won't just conform
No matter how you shake my core
Cause my roots, they run deep, oh

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Oh, ye of so little faith
Don't doubt it, don't doubt it
Victory is in my veins
I know it, I know it
And I will not negotiate
I'll fight it, I'll fight it
I will transform
I will still rise
Rise, rise, rise, rise, rise, rise

[Verse 2]
I must stay conscious
Through the madness and chaos
So I call on my angels
They say...

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Oh, ye of so little faith
Don't doubt it, don't doubt it
Victory is in your veins
You know it, you know it
And you will not negotiate
Just fight it, just fight it
And be transformed
I will still rise
Rise, rise, rise, rise, rise, rise, rise

[Chorus]
’Cause when, when the fire's at my feet again
And the vultures all start circling
They're whispering, "you're out of time."
But still, I rise
This is no mistake, no accident
When you think the final nail is in; think again
Don't be surprised, I will still rise
I will still rise
Rise, rise, rise, rise, rise, rise, rise

[Verse 1]
I won't just survive
Oh, you will see me thrive
Can write my story
I'm beyond the archetype
I won't just conform
No matter how you shake my core
Cause my roots, they run deep, oh

[Verse 2]
I must stay conscious
Through the madness and chaos
So I will on my angels
They say...

[Chorus]
Don't doubt it, don't doubt it
I know it, I know it
And be transformed
’Cause when, when the fire's at my feet again
And the vultures all start circling
They're whispering, "you're out of time."
But still, I rise

[Outro]
Don't doubt it

[Verse 1]
I won't just conform
No matter how you shake my core
Cause my roots, they run deep, oh

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Oh, ye of so little faith
Don't doubt it, don't doubt it
Victory is in my veins
I know it, I know it
And I will not negotiate
I'll fight it, I'll fight it
I will transform

[Chorus]
But still, I rise
Don't be surprised, I will still rise

[Verse 2]
I must stay conscious
Through the madness and chaos
So I call on my angels
They say...

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Oh, ye of so little faith
Don't doubt it, don't doubt it
Victory is in your veins
You know it, you know it
And you will not negotiate
Just fight it, just fight it
And be transformed

[Chorus]
But still, I rise
Don't be surprised, I will still rise
But still, I rise
Don't be surprised, I will still rise

Catchin' feelings like a female

[Hook]
At times I get too drunk to fuck, too high to deal with shit
I might just spend a hundred at the dealership
Even my haters gotta feel this shit
Enjoy the show, bitch you could suck my dick
You, you could suck my dick

[Verse]
As smoke lingers, the Earth spins like the ball on Earl "The Pearl" Monroe fingers
I've been a boat swinger, in my "Stone Cold" Steve Austin shirt with the clicker
You know we're still here, don't get mad at me
I've just been hooked on Grey's Anatomy
A good thing about that, is I could probably be a surgeon
'cause I could cut flesh with no burden
Drop a tab of acid
Let's just be for certain
The reaper lurkin'
In 1997 dog, my beeper was chirpin'
The 850's started speaking German
To find the true meaning you must be determined
I just want to be on T.V. forever like Chris Berman
Have diamonds blind my eyes while my wrist turnin'
Have my lady suck my dick while the spliff burnin'
It's picture perfect, man

[Pre-Hook]
Feel me, right? I know you feel me, right?
I know you feel me right, uh

[Hook]
At times I get too drunk to fuck, too high to deal with shit
I might just spend a hundred at the dealership
Even my haters gotta feel this shit

You and you, you could suck my dick

Victims to sick, I'm fixin' to pick some and start shit
I'm out of pictures to rip and shit to throw darts at
Ain't got no more targets, shit, Irv and Jeff
We done beat 'em to death, Benzino in debt
There seems to just be no one left to bully, bush is pussy
Why the fuck you think his name's Bush? Puss is bushy!
Ain't shit goin' on, shit, I've been gettin' so bored lately
I'm thinkin' of doin' some shit to get you to go and hate me again
To tell the truth, I liked the shit better then
Shit, I could spit better, I'm 'bout to kick this sick shit again, look:
The game just isn't the same, it's changin'
Dre is quittin', Jay is quittin', now it's just gangtas
Just sayin' the same shit, it's ancient, it's fake and it's
Makin' me so bored, I'ma just make a new language
Fubba-u-cubba-cubba yubba-obubba-ubba
You-ba can subbabick my dadibbadick through a tuba
Summaladummalamma, I'm not a human, I'm a
Supersonic, new robotic, suicidal unabomber
You think I'm the new Osama, press thinks I'm the new Madonna
Jeffrey Dahmer left me with this legacy to carry on
A lot of talk and rumors on us, who's the hottest? To be honest
Hip-hop ain't been the same since 2Pac moved to Cuba on us

Pussy game still cold, we don't get minks for that
When I'm poppin' them bananas, we don't link chimps for that
I gave these bitches two years, now your time's up

[Intro]
Uh, alright

[Verse 1]
My girl ain't a supermodel
But care I don't
Only one that makes me feel good
When I don't
She looks like a Sunday morning
That face don't never get boring
When I'm gone, on the road out touring
I hope she knows

[Pre-Chorus 1]
That them other girls try to get me
But I don't really give a damn
Yeah, my friends all tell me I'm crazy
Maybe I am

[Chorus]
Rosaline, she's with me
All you boys better leave her be
I don't care what they think about it (Oo-oh)
Loves me right, holds me down
That's my queen with the broken crown
And I know when she's 'round, I found it (Oo-o-oh)

[Verse 2]
My girl ain't in Hollywood
She ain't no star
Don't know about fancy things
No fancy car
PR says the day the artist
Looks good on the red carpets
I still be her man regardless
Cause that's my heart

[Pre-Chorus 2]
My fans say I could do better
But I don't really give a damn
And my friends all tell me I'm crazy
Maybe I am

[Chorus]
Rosaline, she's with me
All you boys better leave her be
I don't care what they think about it (Oo-oh)
Loves me right, holds me down
That's my queen with the broken crown
And I know when she's 'round, I found it (Oo-o-oh)

[Verse 3]
"Yeah, I never wish" she tells me
"Boy, you ain't hard"

[?] deal in the dark

[?] dress shirt
Let her call me Michael
Hold the crown if her head hurt
Last year, where the hoes at? (Right)
This year, them hoes are so whack
Once you go pose you can't go back
My mama told me when you get it
Go on and hold that

[Chorus]
Rosaline, she's with me (Uh)
All you boys better leave her be (Alright)
I don't care what they think about it (Ey, ey ey)
Loves me right, holds me down
That's my queen with the broken crown
And I know when she's 'round, I found it (Oo-o-oh)

[Outro]
All them other girls just can't compare (Oo-oh)
I don't give a damn if they call me weird (Oo-o-oh)
I just feel good every time she's near (Oo-oh)
Everybody else just disappears (Oo-o-oh)

[Verse 1]
They' talkin' 'bout a revolution
The victims want to contemplate
They don't believe the evolution
The party wants to demonstrate
We're waiting on a confirmation
We gathered 'round the town of folks

[Pre-Chorus]
But the world is burning anyway
I gotta stop time, stop time

[Chorus]
Sleep, sleep, sleep all day
We were partying all night
And we sleep all day
Sleep, sleep, sleep all day
We were partying all night
And we sleep all day

[Verse 2]
Only one person can drive the car
I'm focused on the destination
It's so hard for anybody to hide
They see it's from the constellation
They care less about your seven nations
They fall over laughing when you cry

[Pre-Chorus]
But the world is burning anyway
I gotta stop time, stop time, stop time

[Chorus]
Sleep, sleep, sleep all day
We were partying all night
And we sleep all day
Sleep, sleep, sleep all day
We were partying all night
And we sleep all day

[Bridge]
All night
Can't sleep
Can't stop
I can't lie
Realize my one time stop time

Ohoh-ohoh
Ohohoh

I kissed the world, it's burning anyway
Anyway, stop time, stop time, stop time

[Chorus]
Sleep, sleep, sleep all day
We were partying all night
And we sleep all day
Sleep, sleep, sleep all day
We were partying all night
And we sleep all day

[Outro]
Wake up
Wake up
Look in the mirror
Dream of me all day
Dream of me all day
Wake up
Wake up
Look in the mirror
We were partying all night
And we sleep all day

And I won't hold back from you, baby
And I won't go back on you, baby (Grind on me)

Good love, oh, ooh, yeah
We're breaking, baby, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Pretty Ricky]
Baby, grind on me
Relax your mind take your time on me
Let me get deeper, shorty ride on me
Now come and sex me 'til your body gets weak
With slow grindin', baby

[Outro: Tory Lanez]
You blow my mind, more than all the time
You know how, baby
Kissing on the floor and I still got it for her
Panties on the floor and condoms in the drawer
Cashed apple stones and I gassed in your Rover
Pull up to my house, sit that ass on my sofa
She know I'm in love, she wanna get over
She wanna get more than anyone before her
Body so curvy, I can't ignore her
Gotta get it in for this time, 'cause she
She don't want love
Grind on me, baby
Back it up, sound for me, baby
Oh Lord, sound for me
Yeah time's up, oh time
You blow my mind, more than all the time
You know how, baby

[Verse 1]
I used to think 'bout how you came through
Did your thing, I did my thing too
You got some nerve to say I ain't true
I could do that but girl, I ain't you
For you girl, I'm so selfish
Wanted you for myself, it's selfless
And maybe it's time
That you remember how we (That you remember how we)
Look

[Chorus]
Girl, you remember how we came through
Back in the day we had the same crew
And lately, it feel like we ain't cool
Like you ain't sure, like you act like it ain't true
But girl, you used to call me baby
Girl, you used to call me baby
And me plus you used to be wavy
And now you don't even think about the times
When me and you would pull up, yeah
Shawty, we came through
Me and you would pull up, yeah
Shit ain't the same boo, even you changed too, yeah

[Verse 2]
Takin' love, yeah
Makin' love when I'm fuckin' on you, shawty
All I want to do to you is
Just remind you that we came through
Just remind you that them other bitches ain't you
Just remind you of the shit I could have gave you
Should have saved you
Should have made you mine
Just give me next time

[Bridge]
Used to call me baby
You'd appreciate me
Where did we go wrong?
Still tryna hold on
You were my baby
And I don't know about lately
But I'm on this road, oh no
I'm for real this time, shawty, look

[Chorus]
Girl, you remember how we came through
Back in the day we had the same crew
And lately, it feel like we ain't cool
Like you ain't sure, like you act like it ain't true
But girl, you used to call me baby
Girl, you used to call me baby
And me plus you used to be wavy
And now you don't even think about the times
When me and you would pull up, yeah
Shawty, we came through
Me and you would pull up, yeah
Shit ain't the same boo, even you changed too, yeah yeah
Part 1: LICK

[Intro]
Yeah, uh

[Verse]
Look, bustin' out the lick and now I got it, bitch, I'm re'd up
I will never run off on the plug they got me keyed up
Bankin', it's so many Franklins in my shit, you think a nigga know Aretha
(Yeah, uh)
Bustin' out the lick and now I got it, bitch, I'm re'd up

Part 2: Drive You Crazy

[Intro]
I'ma, I'ma go easy on you niggas
I'ma go easy

[Verse 1]
I'm lyin', really comin' for these niggas this time
It's a full-time job tryna keep 'em in line
Yeah the full court pressure, givin' niggas the stretcher
I could kill your whole team combined, who want pressure?
More than a nigga that's ballin', I need a Espy
More than a Miami papi that's on a jetski
Ice on Wayne, whole chain on Gretzki
When I start winnin', don't you rap niggas text me
Grinnin' at the view of your corpses in a fortress
'Bout to make Forbes list, everythin' is gorgeous
Indoor B-ball courts lit where the floor sit
Still runnin' shit like faucets in an orphanage
Blog niggas gettin' they core clicks off of whore shit
Rap niggas all at they peak, I got the door slit
On star island, cigar smilin'
Drive a couple miles south hit the beach, bitches start wildin'
I done came from the cop car sirens, block ball violence
Bunch of lil niggas stealing hot cars wildin'
Tops chopped off 'til the cops start wildin' and the cop cars find us
Must you remind us, wintertime climates
Slickest set of "set up" bitches that try to line us
I have no infatuation with niggas
Only made the money cum, I'm masturbatin' the digits
Matter fact I'm on tour inflatuatin' the figures
Used to be in low income, now see the show, income
Shit would make you sick, meanin' of a gross income
I deserve every dollar here and then some
And I pray I never dress like y'all
Only bird on my shirt is when I press that raw
It's umbrellas on my sweater for bitches thats under weather
Blowin' kisses at the cheddar when I test that jaw
I, never lose, never snooze, crackin' Crystal sippin
Yaught pimpin' on another cruise
Foreign model from another niggas pedestals
On the top, clock tickin' on you other dudes
Think I'm typin' in a site with all these W's
Only watchin out for dough and niggas busting moves
My drive crazy, I-80 in a Lamborghini screamin' "Rock-a-bye-baby"
Bad bitch just touched down, she Tom Brady
Me I'm Tom Ford, there's more to the Concord
I been in the jungle, nigga, broke and on my last
You was on the feet, nigga, I was on my ass
You was in the sheets, nigga, I was on the ave
You was in the class nigga, I was on the dash
Hustlin' in corners, swearin' I was a goner
Welcome to the USA, I was a foreigner
Fame was a beautiful bitch, so I joined her
Came now I'm lookin' for chips, get the coin up
I remained, all summer all fall
Still gettin' money when the wheels fall off
Real ass nigga even when it's called off
Real ass nigga even when it's called off, my nigga

[Intro]
Uh, yeah
For real this time shawty, for real
Ooh, oohwee
Oh nah-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah
Uh, look

[Verse 1]

Someone that understands how I feel
'Cause we could fuck the world up
It ain't about the talk, it's the feel
When me and you cut up
'Cause girl you know I
Won't waste your time

[Pre-Chorus]
This is what I need
Pretty, sexy woman next to me
Baby, we could start a family
Shawty we can plan it to the tee, yes

Someone to come over and chill, yeah

Somebody that's willing to build

[Verse 2]

That person that knows just what to do
With no reminders
So baby, if that is you
Then come sign our love for this private show
And it's just us two
And now I'm all up, tryna find your love
Is what I wanna do

[Pre-Chorus]
This is what I need
Pretty woman layin' next to me, yeah-oh
Please, if you wanna stay and never leave, I'm down

Someone to come over and chill, yeah

Somebody that's willing to build

Dancin', dancin'
Touchin' with no hands
She get bands, she expensive
My life is expensive

[Verse 1]
Count me up, expensive
Lookin' like this money that I throw is endless
Rolls Royce and the Benzes
Fuck boy, you will never make the friend list
Strip club, flexin' with my manses
All I see is niggas bitches through my lenses
Ain't gon' lie, that bitch is temptin'
I wanna fuck you but you know I'm too expensive
Foreign bitch and she don't know her grammar
Talkin' money, only time I understand her
All my pieces here like a scammer
I could fuck the bartender and the dancer

[Chorus]
Out in V Live still talkin' like she know me
New Toronto nigga that finesse like Ginobili
Dancin', dancin'
Touchin' with no hands
She get bands, she expensive
My life is expensive

Boss bitch in the mansion

Fuckin' every bitch you on the 'gram with
Hoppin' out the Wraith, now I'm lookin' like a scammer
MIA, I just landed
Crashed a new Gallardo, did the damage
G5, speakin' Spanish
She said, "dale que tu puedes" and I slammed
Broke bitches drinking but ain’t paying shit
All in my section, we kick bitches out for standin'
500 thou' off of dancin'
She wanna fuck me, but she know I'm too expensive
Tell lil' mama don't fuck up her chances
You tryna get your money, girl, I understand it
Steal that pussy like a bandit
No I can't fuck with you, you too much propaganda

[Chorus]
Out in V Live still talkin' like she know me
New Toronto nigga that finesse like Ginobili

[Outro]
And we still at the V Live
Strip club, you in the big time

Nah-nah-nah-nah-nah-oh, oh yeah
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
And I'm still up runnin', lookin' for you, yeah

And I met her, hard time sweat up
It was in the game and that wasn't your thing and you in some Margiela
I was just another nigga tryna holla, figured, I would politic ya
So I tried that on the low, baby
I know you deny that, keep it low with a nigga
And I still roll in Miami with the side, run the time back
You got a nigga but I'm still your nigga on the low 'cause

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been gone for way too long
Down Miami, been up waiting
Girl, this feeling's way too strong

[Chorus]
I'm one call away
If you wanna go, oh-oh, yeah
Girl, I'm just one call away (One call, baby, I'm one call)
Girl, I'm just one call away (One call, baby, I'm one call)

[Verse 2]
Still on her, still want her, still get her
Still kick the melody when I sing up
Hit record all about you, I figure
You would have to hear it some way
Girl, I've been searching and searching, ain't found it
All of the things that you do just remind me
Where did you go? Girl, you were just beside me
All of the signs, girl, I'm out of time, but I guess I

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been gone for way too long
Down Miami, been up waiting
Girl, this feeling's way too strong

[Chorus]
I'm one call away, baby
I just wanna sing to you, woah, yeah, yeah
Girl, I'm just one call away (One call, baby, I'm one call)
Girl, I'm just one call away (One call, baby, I'm one call)

[Outro]
One call, baby, I'm one call

When you say I'm just a friend (Damn)
Woah, yeah, I wanna be the nigga that you call on
I wanna be the one to give you some
I wanna be the one to woah
I know what this sound like, it's crazy
You could be 'Yoncé, I'll be Jay Z
I know that just sound cliché, maybe
I'm more than just a friend, pretty lady

[Chorus]
You got what I need, yeah
You say I'm just a friend, woah, yeah

Tellin' me I'm just a friend
Quit tellin' me I'm just a friend, yeah

First off, I know you got it
You know I got it too
So why do you flirt with me and then
(Say I'm just a friend)?
Ooh, this time
I wanna do it better this time
I wanna get me out the friend zone
It is so good that your friends know
I know what this sound like, it's brazy
You know how I get down, I'm crazy
'Fore you in it, go down, I'm blazin'
'Cause I'm not just a friend

[Chorus]
You got what I need
Say I'm just a friend, woah, yeah

While I'm poppin' on this bitch just like the new year
All my bitches so outdated, got the new year

She can fuck her for some lean in the new year
I'll be stuntin' on you bitches on the new year
You got one bitch, nigga, I got two yeah

$auce Baby

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I might walk in with my niggas just like, "Fuck it"
Bitch, I walk in with no niggas? Bitch you buggin'
I might take like thirty-thousand out and chuck it
Go to V Live just to see them bitches bust it
Young rich nigga, I came up sellin' (OG)
I was on the corner, why them niggas jealous?
I was never on the phone talkin', female-ing
But I always got it sent like it's emailin'
Yeah, bitch I got the sauce, I don't need to talk on the track
I can't hear the line like hushy hushy in the Bay
Rich young nigga, drop a pot off in your lap
Top trapper of the year, I'm gettin' top off in the trap, yeah
Ballin', whole team ballin'
Every time we walk up in here, it look like the whole team's Jordan
It's too much designer that the whole team's sportin'
So you look at us and think the whole team's spoiled up

[Bridge]
Suck a nigga dick or something

[Verse 2]
It's a young nigga with the dough
I just bought a chopper with a scope
With this bad bitch, keep it on the low
Happy eatin' chicken, thuggin', sleepin' on the floor
For my bitch in bathrobes, let me move like an asshole
All because the way the cash flow
I'm in Lawrence and I'm tourin' with a bad, bad, little one
From Houston like a nigga with the Astros
I got ten toes, penny bitches in our pent-floors
On your bitch, I got the infos
Haters act up when they know I'm out with that pacheco
Bitches see me and they move like they nymphos
I like bitches looking good in all their Snapchats
Fuck around and make a movie, let me snap that
You can fuck those bitches easy, ain't no Kat Stacks
Don't be hatin' on a nigga when I smash that

[Outro]
Fargo, yeah

Oh, yeah

[Chorus: Ginuwine]
Make my life complete
You are so sweet
No one competes
Glad you came into my life
You blind me with your love
With you I have no sight

[Verse 1: Tory Lanez]
Oh baby, need you to see my Mercedes
And I think that it's time
Can't deny that you're on my, on my mind

Long as we wake up in the morning
You are so sweet, no one compete baby
My only one, just like the morning sun
My whole life has changed

[Chorus: Ginuwine & Tory Lanez]
My whole life has changed (my whole life has changed)
Since you came in, I knew back then
You were that special one
You were that special one for me baby
I'm so in love, so deep in love
And I never knew it would be
You make my life complete
You are so sweet, no one competes
No one can
Glad you came into my life
Glad you came into my life
You blind me with your love
With you I have no sight

[Verse 2: Tory Lanez]
I love you so that I can't let you go
Make sure you know that I be on my selfish
'Cause I see no one else in the party
And you're on your grown and sexy for me
Since you got me here
All that, shit I do, is for you

[Chorus: Ginuwine & Tory Lanez]
You're very special baby

Glad you came into my life

You blind me with your love
With you I have no sight

[Outro: Tory Lanez]

She know I'm straight thuggin' when I come through
Tell me what's love, when I need that
Pull it down for me shawty, lemme see that

Leave your nigga back, I'm tryna fuck tonight
Oh, you still on the down low
Still creep on your boy, still freak on the down low
You know what I'm round for
I done came round to see you drop down on me
Do it slowly
Buss it all open like you got a slow leak
I've been in the streets with three or four freaks
She is so bad might need a police
Stomach on flat, ass obese
Walk oh how the fuck you got in those jeans
I just wanna touch ya, fuck ya OD
Know you got a man but this is lowkey

[Chorus: Ashanti & Tory Lanez]
What's love, got to do, got to do with it, babe
What's love, what's love, what's love if you got it for me babe
What's love, it's about us, it's about trust, babe
We're supposed to be about each other
What's love, got to do, got to do with it, babe
What's love, what's love, what's love if you got it for me babe
What's love, it should be about us, it should be about trust babe
We're supposed to be about each other

[Verse 2: Nyce]
And I got two different girls on me
It ain't easy, to get 'em off me
'Cause I pull up in that light foreign
Shawty you see me, you can't ignore it
I ain't fucking with you dumb broads, got my dawgs, get 'em off
There's a lot of bad bitches I done pissed off, did wrong, dipped off
Still a nigga mean with the wrist
She gon' take it off, course she ain't with the shits
That's your girlfriend but she ain't give a shit
Clean in this bitch and the watch on my wrist cost a key and a brick, woah
What's love got to do with it
I could show you just what to do with it
Come through, I'ma let you get it
And you know what I do with..

[Chorus: Ashanti & Tory Lanez]
What's love, got to do, got to do with it, babe

[Verse 1]
Yeah, it's heavyweight
Pulled up in that bitch and yell "My pieces hit for everything"
Oh, diamond necklace like spaghetti links
She was tryna front, I told her "I can fuck you any day"
Wap up in my pocket, that's the Fetty way
Poppin' like I'm Pablo at the Medellin
Drunk as fuck, I'm goin' off the Hennessy
I look like my pieces hit for everything
I think that your bitch could be the one, yeah
Smokin' dope, I hope that I don't lose a lung, yeah
I got bad bitches they wanna have fun, yeah
So gon' fun yeah, but don't be frontin', yeah

[Chorus]

Shawty, I bet that I can fuck you anyway
Diamond Pateks and the Audemars
Bitch, my pieces hit for everything

[Verse 2]
Bad bitch, she look like a weddin' day
She gon' let a nigga slice the weddin' cake
I smoke lots of weed and yeah, that's everyday
I get high in every single way
I just met a bitch, her name was Tiffany
Fuck her like I just had an epiphany
Maybe it's the Henny or the piff in me
Wake up like I'm 'bout to fuck your bitch today
I hope you that 'bout it, you ain't all talk
I love when you don't wanna hear the small talk
I'm still lookin' for my name in your call log
My girl, there's somethings we should call off

[Chorus]
I can fuck you anyway
You gon' bust it down, I fuck you anyway
Diamond Pateks and the Audemars
Bitch, my pieces hit for everything
Are you gon' let me demonstrate?
Shawty, I bet that I can fuck you anyway
Diamond Pateks and the Audemars
Bitch, my pieces hit for everything

[Intro: Solange (Sampled)]
What
You and me will always be tight
Family every single day and night
Even when you starts acting like a fool
You know I'm loving every single thing you do

[Verse 1: Tory Lanez]
Fuckin' you made me proud of me
'Cause I know that you doubted me
Even told me I would never get wit' ya
Told me I could never get wit' ya
But this pride in me
Wouldn't let you slide by me
That's when I came back 'round
I played my game with no respect, I finessed ya to make me seem down but
I finessed ya, it was all a stresser
I was your nigga, messed up, fucked your head up
Shoulda never came 'round
You let me in and I let you down
I was wrong 'cause I fucked up the game, baby
Your name crazy in the streets, got 'em sayin' things
My pride was the cause of it all
I apologize for the flaws in it all, wrongs in it all, 'cause

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
You and me... always be tight
Family every single day and... uh
And even when I starts actin' like a fool
Somehow I always can fall back on you
I know my pride, ain't always like myself
It's hurtin' you more than anybody else
And every day, what I try not to do
Is let my pride get between me and you

[Verse 2: Tory Lanez]
Baby, I shoulda listened when you told me
I would do better as a homie, yeah
Right there, I shoulda took a note
But pride was buggin' on me
I shouldn't, I shouldn't make excuses now
'Cause I know that it's useless now
You know what the truth is now
You swear you know how I do shit now
So I'll be gone 'til November
Talkin' old Timberlands in the winter
With this .5 on my side and my .40
You moved on but you still are my shawty
I don't wanna lie because I'm right wit' ya
You always pick me up, I don't get ya
I been tryna find your heart, I'm still tryin'
You can find someone else but you're still mine, 'cause

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
You and me... always be tight
Family every single day and... uh
And even when I starts actin' like a fool
Somehow I always can fall back on you
Know my pride, ain't always like myself
It's hurtin' you more than anybody else
And every day, what I try not to do
Is let my pride get between me and you

[Refrain]
Shit, I used to be in love and now that's finished
And it's usually a dub, tonight I'm wit' it
All that dancin' in the club, girl, you bartendin'

[Verse 1]
She been workin' at Starlets
Said she don't dance, she just bartend
Shawty got the whole fuckin' bar lit
Bring the bottles to the team, get the squad lit
Sippin' on the way, on the way
And she got the work, got the work
Need to fly you out right now
Need to get you to the house right now, got a lot right now
It's some niggas in ya' past that
If I see you with 'em, I can promise I'll be out right now
You wouldn't say I'm actin' out right now
But it just ain't the time to doubt right now
I promise, you know that I'm honest
I promise to keep this shit true
I've been down from the bando
Work that we flipped and the line rolls
Trap queen working at the bando
Trap king gettin' to the bands though
Now you went and got another man's dough
How you went and fucked up the plans though? No, no

[Refrain]
Swear I used to be in love and now that's finished
You wasn't used to being loved and I can't trip
I wasn't supposed to be in love with you, just sittin'
I wasn't supposed to give a fuck, but

[Chorus]
Girl I'm sick, girl I'm sick, girl I'm sick, girl I'm sick
Can't lie I'm sick, girl I'm sick, girl I'm sick, girl I'm sick
Can't lie I'm sick, girl I'm sick, girl I'm sick, girl I'm sick

[Post-Chorus]
You already know, I know that you know
(Shoutout Problem)

[Verse 2]
She go to Liv on a Sunday
Can't even give me that one day no more
You said you would never change
And look how you changed, we don't even do things
You left the old me, for some new things
You got a new thing but I know you miss what we had
And I know what I done did was fucked up
But you just don't get me back like that, no, no, no
How you gon' let another nigga get one up on me?
Part of me say, "Fuck you," part of me like, "I need you"
'Fore the feelings, waiter please bring me a Dom P
Yeah, uh

[Chorus]
Deep down I'm sick, girl I'm sick, girl I'm sick, girl I'm sick
Can't lie I'm sick, girl I'm sick, girl I'm sick, girl I'm sick
Can't lie I'm sick, girl I'm sick, girl I'm sick, girl I'm sick

[Post-Chorus]
You already know, I know that you know

[Refrain]
She used to be in love, she used to be a dove
She used to be the one
She used to be the one as usually in all the clubs
She used to be the one
She used to pull up at the crib, at 2:36 in the mornin'

[Intro: R. Kelly]

Put this, put this stand up in your trunk, babe
So buckle up cause this can get bumpy, babe
Honey, we gon' mess around and get a ticket, babe

Switch lanes, hit the signal
Take a break, hit the hazards when we park

[Verse 1: Tory Lanez]
Woah, babe, you're so wet, I'm slippin', I'm slidin'
Woah, babe, I can not wait to get to your body

Doors locked don't interrupt us

You can scream my name up in there

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
'Cause I like your style, have a grown man wishin'

[Sample]
I don't wanna be (Be without you, be without you)
I don't wanna live (Live without you, live without you)
I don't wanna go (Go without you, go without you)
I don't wanna be alone
I don't wanna be (Be without you, be without you)
I don't wanna live (Live without you, live without you)
I don't wanna go (Go without you, go without you)
I don't wanna be alone

[Chorus]
I don't wanna be without you
Fuck around and sleep without you
I don't wanna go
Lord knows I just can't be alone
I don't wanna be
Fuck around and sleep
You know that I can't go
I don't wanna be alone

[Verse 1]
You know I can't be by myself
Thinking 'bout you with someone else
Feels like no one knows how I feel
Now let me know this shit is real
No waste no time on it, even with the way it feels
No waste no time on it, you know that you can keep it one hundred in here
Now don't be afraid to keep it honest girl
But don't leave cause you know that I want you girl to want me
I don't wanna be alone
You know that no one fuck you like I do
Nobody love you, touch you like I do
It ain't my first time with you
But I'm gon' show you what I do

[Bridge]
Start your marks and get ready
'Cause I'm down if you let me
You know I don't wanna waste time
But I don't wanna be in love

[Chorus]

But I feel this thing between us
And I don't wanna let it go

[Outro]
Start your marks and get ready
'Cause I'm down if you let me
You know I don't wanna waste time
But I don't wanna be in love

[Chorus]
Slow down, it's for you

[Verse 1]
Can't nobody put it on me, the way you put it on me (Yeah)
I said can’t nobody put it on me, way you be doing that, the way you did it on me, uh
Could've had ya, I did it wrongly
Could've bagged ya, I bidded on it
Even back when my niggas was sippin' Henny on me
He was like "I betcha can't bag Maggie", I had to go on in
She was gwanin', pretty darkskin, pulled up on it
Got the number, now I'm scorin', Mike Jordan
Fuck them niggas, you know them niggas type boring
Fly with me, 'cause you know a nigga type soaring
Get in that pussy and I'm like Gordon
Sex in the air and the dirty Sprite pouring
Got a nigga feelin' like we on a night flooring
Even if we on the ninth floor but
Hit the department stores in the mall and buy everything ya like sportin'
Shawty, you know ain't no price on ya
Shawty, you know ain't no price on ya
Shawty, you know ain't no price on ya

[Interlude]
Shit, I guess

You make it like mine for the winter and you could be yours for the summer, summers with me, for spring, summer, you feel?
Nah for real, though
You see me, you know I'll allow it

[Verse 2]
And when I put it on you
Tell me you gon' let me put it on you
Tell me you gon' let me pull up on you
Tell me you'll hop in that brand new coupe
Songs like this remind me of Keisha
Times like this remind me of Teisha
Used to sneak in, while yo' mom's sleepin'
We would play it off, like it's on TV
Riskin' it all up in these dark streets
Tellin' you I love you for the wrong reasons
Tellin' you I love you when they start squeezing
But really I just need somewhere to come creeping
I never meant wrong, but I could've been honest, I
I know I'm wrong but I, the 4 o'clock fall ins, all in the morning
Have me gwanin' and goin' in all for you, baby
I fell halfway for you, I did that thing for you
Made this pathway for two
How you gon' act like it ain't for you? No
We can change, winter to the summer on a cruise, oh
Turn around, look up by the pool
Starin' down, looking at my view while you look up at the views, ooh

[Outro]
Slow down
Slow down
Slow down
Part 1: Talk to Me Nice

Talk to me nice, set the mood off in here
Still downtown, whole crew's up in here
All the dogs with me, make it hard just to move up in here
Like is it the right time, baby?

[Verse]
This is the right time
Pour up a white wine
All of these bands on me

Givenchy for all of my niggas
We pull up in slippers, in nighttime
Fuckin' bitches in the white robes
Let me know that it's the right time
All my niggas, they be reppin' it
Red bottom when I step in it
Niggas with me, gotta let 'em in
Sos with me, that's a definite
Nyce with me, that's a definite
Now you met up with the dogs
Gotta fuck 'em all 'fore you meet the President
Walked in, all cleaned up
Man whole clique on bust down
Walked in, got 2 "W"s
Now I look like touchdown
Pulled up in the i8
With a shirt sayin', "Why hate?"
Niggas talkin', I'ma violate
Bitch I'm fuckin' up the tristate
Uh, Givenchy for all of my niggas
2017, we ain't leavin' a cent on the table
For all of you niggas
Be comin' for all of the figures

Don't even call em your bitches
And baby, I'm all in Givenchy

[Chorus]
Talk to me nice, set the mood off in here
Still downtown, whole crew's up in here
All the dogs with me, make it hard just to move up in here

Just invested in two choppers and they on me now
Bitch, all you heard was 'grr grr' when I'm hoppin' out

I've been mobbin' round the city for like two days
Stashin' all this dirty money in the suitcase, woah

Don't you know that we got plenty choppers?
Any bitch inside my kitchen cook like Betty Crocker
Niggas say that they gon' rob me, bitch, don't make me stop you
Uncle Speedy, B.M.F., he down to let it drop you
They like...
Hit G Weed on the cellphone
Make that call from Compton, they'll be out on Melrose
Trained shooters and they down to touch the railroad
And they down to do you colder than the hail snow, woah
That shit tell you that I'm poppin' now

Word around my city is I'm poppin' now, yeah
Bitch, don't make no moves in here, just top me down, yeah
You was talkin' shit but now you ridin' dick, you ain't slick
Why I keep a couple HO, HO's like I'm Saint Nick
I just got the Benzo back, you niggas outta luck though
You say that's your main girl, then why she tryna fuck for?
My chain on scammer, big T Montana
Withdraw like diamond, my bitch on Pamela
Came through on a hot block with the top drop and the diamonds
Stain blue on the hot block in a drop-top and I'm shinin'
Pocket rocket on me if a nigga wanna creep up on it with recliner
Starin' in my rear-view if a nigga tryna creep up on me from behind me
Certain niggas tryna text me
Play them niggas like a bass flute
All you niggas is some waste yutes
Boy I will come and erase you
Lookin' like I'm in the city slappin', cockin', clickin' up like I'm Nino
If he treat the forty-fifth it split him out and singin' to me like Selena

[Outro]
Oh no don't approach me
'Cause I got that thing on me, and that shit loaded
Hope you fuck niggas get shot all out your sneakers
Got some real niggas they watching from the bleachers
And you know my shooters don't come in no Ubers
'Cause they can't hop back inside 'em when they shoot ya
That's word to Hollywood soldiers
I mean you know what kind of sauce this is when you smell it, baby
Set It Off

[Verse 1]
Rollin' up, I’ll do you proper
Parked the Benz all in the plaza
Smokin' that lava, smokin' it loudly
Every time we fuck you be moanin' and wildin'
Liftin' your leg up, shit gettin' wetter
Fuck you so long that I'm fuckin' my bread up
Spend the whole night just to get this shit settled
And you got it set up

[Chorus]
Fuck me, set it off
We done talked and we set it off
I'ma fuck, you just set it off
So fuck me and set it off
Fuck me, set it off
We done talked and we set it off
I'ma fuck, you just set it off
So fuck me and set it off

[Verse 2]
Grabbin' on a nigga designer
I'm tryna find you, girl, you a diamond
Bad breed, bad gyal, throw that Rihanna
Swear the whole world can hate as long as we shinin'
You know I spend days on that corner, we grindin'
You was there before the days when a nigga was grimey
You so good at scopin' out a nigga that wanna line me
Put me in the house with 5-0 tryna find me
Girl, I'm on the Wi-Fi so I'm fuckin' you wildly
Girl, I'm from the dot so I'm fuckin' you wildly
Put it in the spot, got you moanin' and wildin'
Shawty close the door and just fuck me in silence

[Chorus]
Fuck me, set it off
We done talked and we set it off
I'ma fuck, you just set it off
So fuck me and set it off

Better

[Verse]
I still wanna fuck you, you know what I do, shawty
I'm out with the crew, shawty, you know how I move, shawty
I've been with the thugs too, on that avenue, shawty
Sellin' on the avenue, you know what I had to do
I'm not 'bout to act with you, you know how I had to move
Grimey with the shooters, shawty, that's just how I had to move
Silence when you wait, girl, I'm up on the way, girl
Don't let me just wait, girl, don't let me mistake, girl
You know what I do, you know who I be with
I be on that G shit, fucked around three shit
All up on the couch, girl, we was on that freak shit
I be freakin' you, shawty, you ain't 'bout to move, shawty, no

[Chorus]
And to think that thing that it don't make it better
Fuckin' you has seemed to make it better
Things I try to do to make it better
And to think that thing that it don't make it better
Don't make it better
And to think that thing that it don't make it better
Don't make it better

[Skit]
Tory: Yo, what up?

[Cam'ron's "Hey Ma" playing in the background]

[Skit]
Girl 1: So are you fuckin' with him or what?
Girl 2: Fuckin' with who?
Girl 1: Bitch, don't play dumb. Tory
Girl 2: I mean, yeah
Girl 1: You know what I mean. Did you...
Girl 2: Did I fuck him?
Girl 1: Wait, yeah
Girl 2: But you know he used to fuck with my sister, Keisha. And then he gave me this CD and he said nobody's heard it yet. But I don't know if I should even listen to it or not
Girl 1: Bitch, if he wrote it for you, why not?
Girl 2: I mean, I guess, just, let's play the first song
Girl 1: Alright, well, stop talkin' and let's put it in

[Verse 1]
You see the swave is an undeniable force
You see I wanna talk swave but don't know swave talkin'
Now I go by the name of Slim Juice
Keepin' it pimp proof through the tape proof
And I don't know if y'all have enough vernacular in your system for this swavey
Now when you swavey, you ain't no lame man 'cause you out here makin' history
Now I'ma let my brother come up here to the mic
And give y'all a lesson on here this swave play, thank you  brother

[Chorus]
Bitches on my uh 'cause I'm swavey
Niggas talkin' slick 'cause I'm swavey
Lame suckers, they know for gang G
Big old rock chain, it's lookin' like the 80's
We don't talk, we make statements

[Interlude]
Oh yeah bruh, I mean let me take a second
This is that grade A swave play
Hand me my tail comb, baby

[Verse 2]
It's the force speakin'
So call up all of your coaches and tell them all of they ballers takin' the off season
I see your flaws like I'm palm readin'
And it's the don 1 speakin', it's the under palm treein'
Cloud speakin', palm peakin', on my own readin'
The time for me to see it, the times I'm keepin'
So they sent that palyer, you ain't even follow that rhyme
I'm not on your time, to catch me, roughers gotta rewind
I mean, I thought that you congratulate me
Turn around and fabricate me
The game changin', look how that fame changed 'em
It's what they say behind the line and now they friends hatin'
Wow, it's friggin' amazin'
It's crazy how I came from a young nigga
Into my country's number 1 nigga
Wow, palms thicker
I just figured fun;s thicker
This the don't you put me in the midst of mixup
I need loyalty
Now the fiends need a fix up
This is exactly what you paid for
They make time and make way for us
Tory Lanez orb, Mr. Paid For
You sure? Yeah, I'm safe sure
Haters hatin' more
There's more money than in the safe drawer

[Outro]
Need I say more? I brought my nigga with me. I mean when life gives me 100 reasons to cry, I show life I got a million reasons to smile. I mean 'cause in the end, it's not gon' matter how many raps I took or how many moments I took breath away. Swavey, I mean you gotta be yourself man. I mean 'cause the ones that mind don't matter, the ones that matter don't mind. Oh yeah, I don't do hip-hop music, or R&B. I do swavey, so that is the genre

[Intro]
This is the voice of the swave, Tory Lanez. He's not an artist, he's a selection. All things swavey, in Swavey we trust. I'm back, baby, better than never and never better than never

[Verse 1]
I opened Pandora's box and got Pandora swave
Now every time I dress, a nigga over swavey
Ain't gotta rap, my shows pay
And when I go to dinner, my hoes pay
Got the bow, we look like Ohio
Line me up some women, I make sure they single file
Got these women whinin' like I sprayed them with Biscotto
With your favourite chicken tryna get it like the lotto
Ain't got time for you, it's Swavey, I back the bottom
Got 'em talkin' 'bout that big paper, I'm stackin' bottles
And I'm shinin' like a light saber that's swervin' back
I be ballin' like a white Laker, that's workin' heavy
I got paper like the mayor, I can't do nothin' but swave it out
Girls on my dick 'cause it ain't bigger than my bank account
I mean my dick is big but there's just too much of a bank amount
Bravo switch the beat up, everythin' they think about

[Chorus]
Pandora swave, yes I'm in that
Charlie Sheen, trickin' women
Bunch of fly flock of women chillin' with me
Charlie Sheen, trickin' women

[Interlude]
Now, we're gonna take a break, have a rest stop. Just havin' some technical difficulties. It's just too much swave happenin'

[Verse 2]
My girl got shape like a cinderblock
I get more paper than a printer god
I don't buy my clothes, I let my women shop
'Cause they know how I'm s'posed to look when I go out
Heavy shard lazy, like it's four cities with my glasses Varsayse
Oops I mean Versace, Herachi, from 9th street
Women they harass me, they ask me to dine me
I swim, put money on these 8-7's, tell me what you talkin'
Trickin', ballin' like I play for Memphis, mean I'm on my Grizzley
Might as well just call me Michael Pippey
My last broad couldn't hang, I threw her like a frisbee
Word to the swave, I got a chick off that, nigga go on, holla
Put that big bank roll look like oblongata
But this big car note look like long thong thotta
Swave maker original dime thotta, swavey

[Chorus]
Pandora swave, yes I'm in that
Charlie Sheen, trickin' women
Bunch of fly flock of women chillin' with me
Charlie Sheen, trickin' women

[Outro]
Don't worry, the swave will only be here forever

[Verse 1: Lil Yachty]
Fuck a fake nigga, I can die by myself
I only drive in sport, 'cause the faster the better
Basketball seats, I got NBA leather
Shoot a nigga quick, if he fuck with my cheddar
Niggas yelling whip, but they not in the kitchen
Niggas swear they crippin' 'til they see the blood drippin'
Nah, I don't bang, but I hang with the shooters
They look over me like DJ Esco do future
I say stick to myself, 'cause these niggas pussy
Pussys only pussy, don't you disrespect me for no pussy
I can see it in your eyes, you broke as hell
Sitting, waiting for the day the homie bet you with the bail
We don't front, you won't get fronted if you ain't known
Said your face, car, good but you don't leave your home
Got this Carly red bitch sittin' in my home
I'ma blow her back out and send her ass home
Ice, neck, wrist, watch crazy though
Ugly black nigga straight snatchin' hoes
Costa Rica hoes
Put the beam on him now he lookin' Hindu
I don't fuck with 'em, unless they payin' first
Nigga run up on 'em with that, .40
Lil Yachty, bitch, I'm, uh, boring

[Verse 2: K$upreme]
Red dot on his head, now he lookin' Hindu
These niggas fufu
Scottie Pippin 33 shot, aimed right at you
Nigga come through with the purple drink (Leanin')
I be off the goop, I be out the booth
And my backwood, 3.5 with the boof
Skinny nigga smoke a lotta weed, like I'm Snoop
And I'm chasin' dreams, R.I.P. Lil Snupe (Damn)
Pull up in that all blue, pour a four in the muhfuckin' Mountain Dew
I be high, like the mountains too
I told that bitch to lay it off my roof
Hop in my coupe, let off that roof
And I only want the top, nicknamed your roof

[Verse 3: Lil Yachty]
I'm in L.A. whippin' Reese, sippin' juicy juice
Hanging by a noose, on my master shit
Kick him in a pit, on my trojan shit
You niggas make me laugh, on some Seth Rogan shit
Double 

[?] bitch, yeah, I'ma fold the bitch

[Verse 4: K$upreme]
In my hand a .30 jock
In my hand a .30 Glock, nicknamed it .40 Glock
Meet me fucking kitchen, do you smell what I'm cooking, like the rock
I walk right past her door, I hope she looks outside
I know the better life is right there by your side

Show me the better life
Show me the better life
Show me the better life
Show me the better life

She haunts my dreams all night, I wonder who she is
Never, ever, ever in my little life, have I fell quite like this

Show me the better life
Show me the better life
Show me the better life
Show me the better life
The taste of love is in your mouth
Or might that be the taste of blood?

Lay her down, in the arms that beg for her
Lay her down over my heart

Valentine, you curse me every year

A breath away from your heart
You’d like to think you’ll be loved one day

Lay her down, in the arms that beg for her
Lay her down over my heart

Valentine, you curse me every year

[Intro: Tory Lanez]
Know you messin' with a winner, baby
I mean we only with the best though
You know I never fail, right?
I mean but it's not about me

[Verse 1: Tory Lanez]
'Cause we can leave the season in a bliss
Say the best silence is me with a kiss
Well, I guess I got a meetin' with your lips
In case with your face and agree with your hips
They say love's just agreement with a twist
Me, I see love is the reason we exist
And baby, you the sweetest, see you click
And I would hate to see you leave for someone else who ain't this
Yeah, I know your ex man ain't shit
Try to get another but the next can't hit
It's daylight and we ain't even came yet
And I ain't gotta even know her name yet
I hit the spots that your ex can't get
Even though X marks it, I'll be in the star ship
Bringin' you the stars 'til you star sick
Then I turn it round like a boss spin, daily costin'

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
Back to the crib
Thinkin' 'bout takin' you home after the club
Shawty, you turnin' me on in the club
One shot, it's happy hour in the bed, shawty
Two shots, it's happy hour in the bed, shawty

[Verse 2: Tory Lanez]
Excuse me girl, I'm not tryin' to interrupt you from talkin'
But you're somethin' special that just caught my heart
I wonder why
But hey, how you doin' anyway?
Girl, you can have anythin'
Right after the club
'Cause your home girls came with they dresses on
And they hair all done from they hair salon
And they might as well get they drinkin' on
Here's your favourite song

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
Back to the crib
Thinkin' 'bout takin' you home after the club
Shawty, you turnin' me on in the club
One shot, it's happy hour in the bed, shawty
Two shots, it's happy hour in the bed, shawty

[Verse 3: Kid Ink]
It's clear to see, I wanna take you home
Happy hour in the bed, bring a friend, 2 for 1
Let's have another drink, I can tell you a freak, tired of sex on the beach
The way you dance, I swear it looks like you havin' sex with the beat
Quarter past 1, still ain't tired, turnin' me on, no assembly required
Legs long, island ice tea, when you wanna leave?
Car's outside, valet got the keys, let's chill, feel the breeze
What you think? Is that somethin' we can sip to? Just wanna get you

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
Back to the crib
Thinkin' 'bout takin' you home after the club
Shawty, you turnin' me on in the club
One shot, it's happy hour in the bed, shawty
Two shots, it's happy hour in the bed, shawty

[Outro: Tory Lanez]
Swavey, you know you bad though
It's cool 'cause I like it, it's happy hour
On again and on again
Woo, that boy that got that voice, boy

[Verse]
Ayo, what's happenin'?
I just took this time to stop the mixtape just to win
I mean I walk down the block and I win
I keep tyin' my shoe, every day like win
Can't stop winnin', win
Disgustin', I can't stop winnin', win
This a disease, I should not win
So many times
I mean I should not be winnin' this many times, win
Jae Fresco is down the block and win
Again! I can't stop it again, it's just win
Keeps winnin', win
Just can't stop winnin'
Hey Sonny Diamonds, he was just engineerin' my track and win
All over again, bro, it's fuckin' crazy, win
I mean if you're lookin' for us, we'll be out in Dubai just winnin', win
Now remember folks, when you go with the swave, you win

[Intro: Tory Lanez]
I mean this time, like everythin' is swavey
Innit bruh, everythin' is swaved out
Swavey jean jackets, swave Adidas track shoes
Swave everythin', Canada

[Verse 1: Tory Lanez]
My down chick never had a father
But now she call me daddy, he don't have to bother
Her ass big, my stacks larger
Girl, come and get this money that's your last offer
Model in the whip, look like Olive Wine
Kiss me when I holler, you miss out on guap
Women wanna plug 'em 'cause I'm in the game
Stop playin' with that brains, I ain't into games
Me, I'm in the women and I'm spendin' change
I pay for the girl if that chick a dame
Lemme take a second, one, two
My bitches rare, make 'em wear 'em, one, two
Say my name, say my name, what you want, nigga?
It's a party, where the women? We don't want niggas
I'm O ballin', like I'm O'Neill
Talkin' slick, I'll make them niggas eat the whole meal

[Chrous: Tory Lanez]
Gettin' brain in the whip bumpin' N Rhymes

Your women love me, yeah I knew that

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
I say, 100k, I blew that, they like how you do that?

Steppin' out the G4, where my parachute at?
Louboutins sneakers is so bloody, where my shoe at?
'Cause I got 'em red bottoms, nigga you ain't got 'em
Swizzy in designer, I'm so swavey when I rock 'em
I'm lookin' like a million cash, but better yet, my stash
If a nigga owe me money, I'ma take it out his ass
Ten bad bitches, fuck 'em ten times
You either gettin' it or hatin', it's a thin line
Hope you gettin' yours 'cause I'm gettin' mine
I rock this Audemaur, ain't never set the time
Pretty women and they all tens
I be swingin' 9 like I'm golfin'
Jumpin' out the water like a dolphin
At king of diamonds store, throw money and we all in

[Chrous: Tory Lanez]
Gettin' brain in the whip bumpin' N Rhymes

Hit the J with the friend from the westside
Bad women, I hit about ten times

Your women love me, yeah I knew that

[Verse 3: Tory Lanez]
I'm livin' large for a young nigga, my bad
I'm livin' large 'cause my fun's bigger
I'm gettin' green like a drug dealer
If you ask me, I say, "Fuck niggas"
I'm on my own, I'm all alone
I took her from the club and never brought her home
Don't tell your daddy, leave his daughter home
'Fore that nigga look and see his daughter gone
I make 'em hotter than an iron four
Say you hit my chick, why is you lyin' for?
Don't even get him play, why is you tryin' for?
She want the scream and I'm a dinosaur
And it's 24 hours 'til that offer gone
Spend 20 thou', shoulda left it all at home
I ain't trippin', I'ma make some more
Squad full off sweet women, I'ma make you smart

[Chrous: Tory Lanez]
Gettin' brain in the whip bumpin' N Rhymes

[Verse 1]
You a cute nigga if you hatin' 'cause I'm nice
Know that I'm ballin', they call a nigga Jerry Rice
I'm back on my schedule, you know I'm bumpin' in the field

Apart from my niggas, you niggas tryna do dirty

It's Canada nigga, I got the country on my BI
Two bad women, I bet I can turn 'em bi
Hol' up, call me Mr. Cash Get It
Orange Lamborghini, lookin' like we classin' up
You're on the phone millionaire, be your last dinner
Tell them goons get my back and they ain't even add niggas
Turn up the speakers pimp and you know it penetrate
I came to the club, I sat that bitch on 28s
I ain't on a budget, you know I'm spendin' money great
But I still go to dinner and I make 100k
Shinin' on my schedule, I spend 90 on my bezzle
And I'm lookin' hotter than an iron on a kettle

You know swavey, that's the model, so we only backin' models, Swavey

[Chorus]
I woke up, I'm still cute
That's your new girl? She'll do
Old money, mills do
New shoes on the coupe, where the roof?

[Verse 2]
I think that it's time we put you niggas in the lay off
Know that I'm ballin' and put a nigga in the Playoffs
Canada bull ridin', Pirellis in the coupe
Don't gotta be watchin' them jack boys on the stoop
It's money we makin', you know a nigga really get it
And we gon' ball because we stackin' 'til we tippin'
I'm blowin' the money on me, you know I'm gettin' paper
And if you trip, trippin' then I gotta see you later
All the women buggin', she just chucked it for a bill
Baby by the field like we duffin' off a pill
And I'm wearin' Js, 150 for my sneakers

[Chorus]
I woke up, I'm still cute
That's your new girl? She'll do

Oh yeah play boy. Naw, baby, put that jacket on. Leave them heels on. Now take it off quick, Swavey, baby

[Verse 1]
She said she born up Tiny Island in Tapioca
I heard she got 10 from deported out in Mexico
They tried to send 'em home but she say, "Let me go"
They put the tracker in her purse so they know where she go
I told her run, run, run, run, run
This country no win ting for you, you, you and me
Beautiful refugee
And even when she stayin' with me in the tropical
She always checkin' off her phone and say she got to go
Would love to keep her here forever but I can't
And the harsh reality of what I think

[Chorus]
'Cause she's on the run, yeah yeah, she's on the run
She's on the run to America, oh
So tell me why they wan' take from me?
My beautiful refugee
She, she's so sweet
So why they wan' take her from me?
My beautiful refugee
Why they wan' take her from me?
My beautiful refugee
So why they wan' take her from me?

[Verse 2]
They always seem to know just where she go
Up in the Hamptons, had her dancin', tell her go
She know they follow her everywhere that she go out
Don't need to tell her 'bout the government, she know about
She say, "Why, why them chase me?
I just want to roam free
As a beautiful refugee"
She say she hate it when they catch her on a J
She on a mission, she say she will never fail
She told me every second counts, can't let a day go
She say they wanna deport her back to Tapioca

[Chorus]
She's on the run, yeah yeah, she's on the run
She's on the run to America, oh
So tell me why they wan' take from me?
My beautiful refugee
She, she's so sweet
So why they wan' take her from me?
My beautiful refugee
Why they wan' take her from me?
My beautiful refugee
So why they wan' take her from me?

[Intro]
Aw yeah, bro

I'm just joinin' in intercourse
With the daughters of America

[Verse 1]
Man, I'm so cool, I be ridin' all swavey
Chillin' with some girls all they all Caucasian
I live in the colours, I see all y'all chasin'
And if you don't believe me, I say all y'all racist
Been thinkin' 'bout this plan for a long time
I told my boss F you, man, I'm gon' ride
And all them thievin', I'm believin', chicks that think that I'm conceited
Tryna pull a Michael Jackson while they take my dick and beat it
Here's a middle finger for you, hope you like it
Standin' on the ceilin', feelin' higher than a fly kid
And I say F your friends 'cause they always up in my shit
And I been here so long, long that I'm sky sick
I'm so swavey, they say that time is of the essence
No need to worry, baby, I am of the freshness
Would it be the diamonds on my necklace?
That's my time tell, come home then rewind

[Chorus]
I need a place we can go, get away
It's a place where all my problems go, Swavey
I need a place we can go, get away
It's a place where all my problems go, Swavey
Ready to ride, woo
Ready to ride, ready to ride

[Verse 2]
Man, been drivin' down the runway the wrong way
Local radio lettin' my song play
Canadian jewellery on my arm, eh
All of the lights got me feelin' like a Kanye
It's been a long day, my diamonds dancin'
So your girl wanna be my prom date, yeah, long as she bomb, hey hey hey
Tell your friends to tell they friends friends friends
That I'm multiplyin' money by the tens, tens, tens
This the move that we makin', it's the money you see
Say you love bein' you, when I know you would love to be me
It's easy for you to try to read me
I keep it funky, fresh and freezy
Never greezy, you ain't see me
Man, I just need to be up on a resort of some sort
I want girls who come forth and be part of my comfort
I'm a young nigga, I love sports, I love my girl but I plug whores
I make it fast like jump doors, take all the cash, feel no remorse

[Chorus]
I need a place we can go, get away
It's a place where all my problems go, Swavey
I need a place we can go, get away
It's a place where all my problems go, Swavey
Ready to ride, ready to ride
Ready to ride, ready to ride

If I could I'd slap yo ass through this verse nigga

[Intro]
I mean I figured, I figured I'd give you the real me
So you could feel me, yeah

[Verse 1]
This is what I call the makin' of the motherlovin' greatest
Amazin' how I made it through the gutter to your playlist
Some still wondered, I tunnel through all the hatin'
And I made it to the top, y'all can stop your debatin'
I lay face with my face to the pavement
Days when I slept on the floor, my aunt's basement
Ain't lookin' for remorse, I just showin' you the basics
Course I was forced to make it or be the wasted
Niggas could've loved, instead they engraved hatred in they hearts for me
Please God, turn the cards for me
I'm on top of the world with no apostrophe
I know my mother's up there with you
I know she lookin' down at me through a clear picture
Bear with me, let me share with you
'Cause in my lifetime, I jot it down when I write rhymes
See I was left lane cruisin', I wasn't in my right mind
How could y'all judge me?
If y'all don't love me, just say you don't love me
Fuck it, I ain't lookin' for your love nor judgement
Long as this money more comin'
Niggas I don't love nor trust them
The grind got me addicted to cash flow
Room spinnin', feel I'm sippin' in a fast forward motion
Tell the waiter pass more portion
Gotta thank God for my mom, she could have had an abortion
I'm true meanin' that dreams can come true
If somethin' that's a lie can never become true
So if you got a dream, believe and just you
'Cause when everybody gone, who left? Just you
We can master crash up bein' active
We are more than people, we are the masters
If I wasn't here, I prolly be in the casket
Gotta get money, nigga, fuck livin' average
Come on niggas, you gotta think smarter
When you ain't got much, you gotta think Sparta
Life swing at you, you gotta swing harder
Think before I shoot, it's more Vince Carter
Uh, I been alone since 14
Was forced to be the man on my own since 14
Stand for more things but plans for more dreams
They put me in positions to sit inside the land of no dreams
How could you blame me? This is my life, nigga
This no entertainment and nigga, this is real
If it's fakin', I never claim it
My life written in stone, this shit is ancient
This is ancient like a slave ship
Niggas pussy 'cause I take trips all around down
Now I'm on my grizzly jams, to the damn town
Know I'm on curve busy like a pretty, brown round nickel

[Chorus]
I can't let the time just pass me
So don't worry 'bout me
Baby I'm outchea
Dreams that I'm chasin', I can't forsake them
But I'm gon' chase my dreams until I die
So don't worry 'bout me
Baby I'm outchea
Dreams that I'm chasin', I can't forsake them

[Outro]
Yeah, constant repetition
It's passive aggression
I mean I been doin' this so long
It's like I feel like
I could go twice what I already did
Feel me

[Intro]
Oh yeah, I mean I'm glad y'all tuned in
It's been a great tape
I mean but I couldn't do it without leavin', Swavey
Extraordinary nigga, baby
I only do extraordinary things

[Verse 1]
Look, I be skippin' class, fast women with ass
Last niggas to smash was the team bigger than that
I don't see niggas though, figured it be rap 'cause
We fast livin' ballers and the bad bitches spoil us
I am takin' shots, celebratin' me guap makin'
Pussy niggas pissy mad at the way that God made it
Live, familiar to y'all, I made it to the top
Hatin' ass niggas, had to go get you past niggas
So I ball, she in like my drawers
When I was only a fetus, I keep it on only the G'est
These dames see us, freeze us like the gang mistreated
Women good gushy, only hit it when I need it
I got the game on the lot like it's house arrest
Got your dame on my jock, gave her mouth a rest
Playin' beer pong, money and my hair long
Therefore dog, I'm pluggin' hoes 'til I'm gone
Me and Sunny D, lovin' the freaks and fuckin' for free
That's why them real niggas fuck with me
Plus the hoes love us, on the mission to get this dough from us
They tryna poke a hole and so, I bring my own rubbers
But no love for hoes with no number
Oh, I'm so fucked up, been livin' in the moment
These hoes don't want you when you lease, they want you when you own it
Yes, Canadian best, I don't you know it homie, motherfucker

[Chorus]
Bollin' in my two door, cut the beat up
Layin' back without the seat up, no come drive with my feet
Niggas lie, it's why these niggas surprised
They ain't never met a nigga this G
Bollin' in my two door, cut the beat up
Layin' back without the seat up, no come drive with my feet
Niggas lie, it's why these niggas surprised
They ain't never met a nigga this G

[Outro]
Hand me my tail comb Cindy
This is an extraordinary nigga named Slim Juice
I keeps it pimpin', playa
And I ain't into the name talkin'
But all that swave blockin' gon' get you fucked up
Now Tory Lanez is a playa
And he ain't got no time to be jivin' with you anti-swavin' ass
Bumb ass niggas
Every time we do, it's gon' be swavey
And you ain't never, ever, ever, ever, ever gon' witness
Another Canadian nigga genre like this here brother
Tory motherfuckin' Lanez, Swavey

[Intro]
Oh yeah, oh yeah

But you never hear me

[Verse 2]
You got a walk so mean
Slow down and let me walk with you

But you look better than a picture
And she the flyest

Now shawty, tell me where you goin' with them jeans on
She be lookin' real like somethin' I ain't ever seen before

[Pre-Chorus]
I would do it all for you
Said they should do it all for you
And girl, I swear that them jeans you wearin' lookin' swavey
You should let me talk 'em off of you
And girl, I know we ain't in love
But my heart is in your hands
So please don't break it, no
Why won't you give me a chance? Oh baby

[Chorus]
Girl, I'm excited

Lookin' for a G to get you things you never had, babe
Don't I know ya, don't I know ya
I swear girl, I know your type

[Verse 1]
See she was Christian before, now it's Christian Dior
More bags on the dinner shop, let yours in store
Now she all that, where that what you call that
You give her your number, it's a wonder if she call back
Used to compliment me, used to call me nice names
Now the only time she callin' me is for a pricin'
Thinkin' it the gravy, used to be my lady
Ever since that paper, baby, she been actin' shady
Feeln' like a candy kid at the mall
Hair, manicured nails, maxin' out my cards
Tryna keep it faithful, no relaxin' with the broads
Now to find out that my passion was a fraud
Man, I must be dumb, even though she bad
She can't be the one, she just want my cash
Ooh, girl, you so scandalous, baby
And if you ain't got no money, you can't handle this lady, no no

[Chorus]
Oh, shawty be frontin' like my main hoe
But I know she only want me for my pay roll, ayo
Don't I know ya, don't I know ya

Oh baby, I know you like Swave
Lookin' for a G to get you things you never had, babe
Don't I know ya, don't I know ya
I swear girl, I know your type

[Verse 2]
I was like, "Hey pretty thing, can I get your name?"
She replied laughin' and didn't say a thing
Damn, I felt ashamed but then I used my brain
Opened up my coat and showed her two diamond chains
When I met her, yeah the deed just got exchanged
Before I hit the range, she gave me a phone call
Told me if I played her right, she'll take all the gloves off
Man, this hoe is so lost and scandalous

[Chorus]
Oh, shawty be frontin' like my main hoe
But I know she only want me for my pay roll, ayo
Don't I know ya, don't I know ya
I swear girl, I know your type
Oh baby, I know you like Swave
Lookin' for a G to get you things you never had, babe
Don't I know ya, don't I know ya
I swear girl, I know your type

[Bridge]
I don't know why these girls, they want something from me, from me
I don't know why these girls, they want something from me, from me
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know

I don't know, I don't know, I don't know

[Chorus]

Woah woah
(We were born in black and white)
Woah woah (We got rock in our roll, fight the good fight)
(We were born in black and white)
Woah woah (We got rock in our roll, fight the good fight)

[Chorus]
We got a young face with an old soul
We're at the right place, the right time and we stay gold
It's a new age but it gets old
So we gotta stay, gotta stay, stay gold

[Outro]
We were born in black and white
We got rock in our roll, fight the good fight
We were born in black and white
We got rock in our roll, fight the good fight

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Niggas wanna bang in the squad, don't wanna put the work in
Say you want my money, scared of fame, better murder then
See the chopper, bullets too big, you can see the doctor surgery
Mask, can't identify the burglars
But we know you givin' up the confidential information
Say you got the cheese, you a rat, that's a perfect fit
Niggas wanna hate on a slick money makin' mitch
Love takin' pussy niggas hoes and give 'em the D
OHB, it ain't nothin' for me to buy a bitch

Got them shooters in the cut, say the word, we fuck the party up
Throw that money up, yeah, that bitch a dub
Fuckin' with the plug, goin' up, we gon' fuck the party up

[Verse 2: Young Blacc]
I'm turnt up and they know that, poked up like Funk Flex
45 in that 12 back and I'm posted up in that four hat
See this nigga, this gold rap, kill a nigga then go rap
Talkin' 'bout that Draco, one phone call, that's a snatch (Yeah)
Give it to a nigga if you really want it
Bitched poppin’ hella pills, hit me in the mornin'
Ha, a nigga lyin' 'bout theyself
I'm talkin' 'bout niggas who killin', dyin' by theyself
You say we from the same hood, where I see you at? (Where you at?)
And I ain't never seen movin' in a hoover hat
Ha, switchin' sides, just confused 'cause you famous
We all OG nigga, tell me what his name is
Get your weight up lil' nigga, I'm pushin' four place
It's still puttin' big drugs on the interstate
No name, that's knock out, pea brains wanna Glock out
Niggas need to pass the light niggas, this my house

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Rollin' up the bud, yeah, that bitch a dub
Yeah, we know the plug, smokin' all the drugs, 'bout to buy the club (Yeah!)
Killin' all the pussy, nigga, get your bodies up (Yeow!)

Got them shooters in the cut, say the word, we fuck the party up
Throw that money up, yeah, that bitch a dub
Fuckin' with the plug, goin' up, we gon' fuck the party up

[Verse 3: Young Lo]
Yeah, my whole team supreme, grew up in the crack '80s
Still got the plug on it, get your 4 in the baby
Out the mud, bustin' drugs with my nigga Hoody Baby
Drop the ice in the pot, now it's back to back Mercedes
See I'm all about the check, still reppin' Tex
Still rep the set, mile high, smoke Luigi on the jet
50 in these Balmains, this a youngin' from the lanes
Yeah, I'm geeked up, mixin' up the mollys with the Xans
And I'm stingy with the Act', keep the red from my bitches
We gon' pop a half a Perc', I'm on that, even on a Skittle
And the tongue gon' work, play that pussy like a fiddle
Bet you I can make you squirt, have your face all in the pillow

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Rollin' up the bud, yeah, that bitch a dub
Yeah, we know the plug, smokin' all the drugs, 'bout to buy the club (Yeah!)
Killin' all the pussy, nigga, get your bodies up (Yeow!)
All this ice up on my body, we the Mighty Ducks
Who got the bud? Who givin' it up?
Got them shooters in the cut, say the word, we fuck the party up
Throw that money up, yeah, that bitch a dub
Fuckin' with the plug, goin' up, we gon' fuck the party up

[Verse 1]
When this train rolls down the track
I'm not coming back
Gotta one way ticket, I'm going home
Back where I started from

[Chorus]
Oh, take me down south
Will you take me home, Lord
Will you take me home, Lord

[Verse 2]
The last time I saw you
I was meant to say "I love you"
I've been right and I've been wrong
But I'll always miss you when I'm gone

[Chorus]
Oh, take me down south, yeah
Take me down south
Oh, will you take me home, Lord
Will you take me home, Lord

[Chorus]
Oh, take me down south
Take me down south
Take me down south
Take me down south
Lord, will you take me home, yeah
Will you take me home, yeah

[Outro]
Wanna be next to my baby, yeah

But don't get popped by them crooked-ass cops (noo)

[Chorus: Akon (Kardinal Offishall)]

Ohhhhhhhh hey!

We killed the dance again
Mash up the place and it's a memory
Control the spot like some big time bad boy

[Chorus]
"Ooh, ooh, just ain't enough love"
("Just ain't enough love")
"Ooh, ooh, just ain't enough love"
("Just ain't enough love")

[Verse 1]
These are the words my baby spoke
As she bid her last goodbye
With tears in my eyes as she walked from my side
I sadly asked her why

[Chorus]
She said, "Ooh, ooh, just ain't enough love"
("Just ain't enough love")
"Ooh, ooh, ain't enough love"
("Just ain't enough love")

[Verse 2]
Now I was too busy, but that girl of mine
I'd buy her gifts from time to time
So sure this would satisfy, 'til she up and left me
With this reply

[Chorus]
She said, "Ooh, ooh, just ain't enough love"
("Just ain't enough love")
Because, "Ooh, ooh, just ain't enough love"
("Just ain't enough love")

[Verse 3]
I said, sweet thing, sweet thing, please don't leave
I'm so sorry I made you grieve
So confident pretty words would make her stay
But I heard her say as she walked away

[Chorus]
She said, "Ooh, ooh, just ain't enough love"
("Just ain't enough love")
She said, "Ooh, ooh, just ain't enough love"
("Just ain't enough love")
She said, "Ooh, ooh, just ain't enough love"
("Just ain't enough love")
She said, "Ooh, ooh, just ain't enough love"
("Just ain't enough love")
She said, "Ooh, ooh, just ain't enough love"
("Just ain't enough love")
She said, "Ooh, ooh, just ain't enough love"
("Just ain't enough love")
She said, "Ooh, ooh, just ain't enough love"
("Just ain't enough love")
She said, "Ooh, ooh, just ain't enough love"
("Just ain't enough love")
Where Henry goes
I don't know
But I wanna see the places in his dreams he seems to love

And when he looks
To the sky
There's a city in his smile and there's an ocean in his eyes

Where Henry goes

I just wish
I knew his mind
So I could follow him to far off places that he's been sometimes

But he's too gone
To open up
Just like punching walls, it always hurts 'cause it never gives enough

With Henry's love

He won't ever love the way I did
But everybody's falling hard for him
'Cause Henry has
A laugh like fire
And it's spreading through the streets and burning on telephone wires

I don't know
Just what it is
But he's driving all the good girls bad with that evil smile of his

Oh, Henry is

He won't ever love the way I did
But everybody's falling hard for him
He won't ever love the way I did
But everybody's falling hard for him
I think that we met about a week ago
You said that you liked the shape of my nose
And I told you the places that I wanna go
Someday

I can still remember how your fingers felt
Clawing at my insides till I melt
I don't wanna say the way it really felt

There's a sort of feeling that you make me have
Snow cones and your dad's baseball cap
I don't like the feeling that it makes me have

I could turn you inside out, you know
I could turn you inside out, oh, don't you know?
I could turn you inside out, you know
I could turn you inside out, but I don't know

I keep on thinking about what used to be
Rainbow high school memories
Back when both of us were only seventeen
But I don't wanna think about used to be
I don't wanna miss you in my sleep
I don't wanna think about it when I leave

I could turn you inside out, you know
I could turn you inside out, oh, don't you know?
I could turn you inside out, you know
I could turn you inside out, but I don't know
I wish we had chances to talk like this
A little more often
But you were always dealing with your girlfriend's shit
And I was always feeling broken over it

I like the way your hair looks in the sun
And when you're banging into everyone
I go to all your shows to watch you play
And afterwards I hang out, only if you stay

I wish you never got your heart so broke
I wish you didn't sleep with her when you were drunk
I wish you didn't make out in your friend's bedroom
'Cause she won't ever love you like the way I do

And you deserve better, yeah, you think you don't
Yeah, you deserve better than the ones you want
And you deserve better, yeah, you'll never see
You deserve better from someone like me

[Verse 1]
Soft face
Playing in the autumn streets with blood laced shoes
I fake
Stomach aches when I'm in school to wait there for you
Yeah, I do

[Verse 2]
Old flames
Grow and die with every year but you stay hot
'Cause you're fucking crazy
You skinny dip in your neighbor's pool
But you won't get caught
No, you won't

[Chorus]
I think I'm falling, baby, oh yeah, I'm falling
And I won't ever let you go
I think I'm falling, baby, oh yeah, I'm falling
And I won't ever let you go

[Verse 3]
Skinned knees
Face down in the autumn street, a concrete rash
And you cried
Shed a tear for auburn blood that you won't get back
No, you won't

[Verse 4]
I left
Burning streets in Tennessee for a northeast feel
But summer
Always hurts, think of you first and your skin peel
Yeah, I do

[Chorus]
'Cause I was falling, baby, oh, I was falling
Now I won't ever let you go
Yeah, I was falling, baby, oh shit, I'm falling
Now I won't ever let you
No, I won't ever let you
No, I won't ever let you go
Oh, I know that you won't ever give it up
You keep it in your pocket it will never see the sun
But you can't deny what's pouring out of your blue eyes
I see the love behind
And I know what's in your mind
But you won't let me behind those crystal eyes

Oh, I know it's coming out in other ways
I don't need to hear all the things that you won't ever say
'Cause I can see right through
What's coming out of your blue eyes
I'll peel the love behind
I know what's in your mind
Why won't you let me inside, baby?

I'll always give you another try
I'll always give you another try
I'll always give you another try
To let me behind those crystal eyes

Oh, I know that you are not the type to show
All that you're feeling, that's how the healing goes
'Cause you can't move past
What's lingering in your blue eyes
I know there's love behind
And I see what's in your mind
But you won't let me behind those crystal eyes
Oh, I know what you won't ever give it up
You keep it in your pocket, it won't ever see the sun
But you can't deny what's pouring out of your blue eyes
I see the love behind
And I know what's in your mind
Why won't you let me inside, baby?

I'll always give you another try
I'll always give you another try
I'll always give you another try
To let me behind those crystal eyes

I'll always give you another try
I'll always give you another try
I'll always give you another try
To let me behind those crystal eyes
Oh, my sweetie
Did you think my love would leave me
So strong that it was palpable?
But feeling can be fallible
Just look at where it leads me

Oh, my baby
Did you have to call me crazy
Just for thinking I was comfortable?
You wanted me to lose control
Just look at what you've done to me

Because it was you that left me on the line
And now it's me that has to rob you blind
And take the light out of your eyes
But kiss me one last time
Before we say goodbye

Because I don't wanna play like that
You know you had your chance to love me back
And you took your time
Oh, my honey
Don't you find it kind of funny
That I put my heart out on the line?
And now it's yours against the knife
Your blood as sweet as honey

Oh, my baby
Did you have to call me crazy?
Now it's you whose body's on the ground
It's you whose chest can barely pound
Just look at what you've made me

Because it was you that left me on the line
And now it's me that has to rob you blind
And take the light out of your eyes
But kiss me one last time
Before we say goodbye

Because I don't wanna play like that
You know you had your chance to love me back
And you took your time
You say you gotta leave the party in 10
You're never leaving with all your best friends
You go home
You're always leaving alone

I waited for you out on the back porch
You never came but it had happened before
It's true
I'm always left waiting for you

It feels crazy that we're getting so old
It feels crazy that we're all so

You don't drink even a couple of beers
And you don't smoke weed or face your favorite fears
And your dreams
The point of being seventeen

Because we miss sleep and we all don't care
You're contradicting your long dark hair
And your youth
You should be dancing till your face turns blue
Then you wonder why you're feeling so old
Then you wonder why you're feeling so

Grown
Grown
Grown
Grown

Everybody's asking 'bout my future plans
I'm still trying to get into your pants
I know
I should be letting it go

But something sticks in the way you laugh
Smiling through your dad's baseball cap
I know
I should be letting it go

Then I wonder how I'm feeling so old
I can't believe that we're all so

Grown
Grown
Grown
Grown
Everybody's changing and they're moving away
I kissed you hardest on the moving day
You went cold
The only time that August froze

You said you'd visit every chance that you got
Now somebody tells me that you're moving on
I know
I should be letting it go

But then I wonder how I'm feeling so old
Will we still know each other when we're both

Grown
Grown
Grown
Grown
I don't even know who I am
And I don't think that I really give a damn
'Cause you are everything I need to know it seems
I trace and memorize your curves and lines
Until my fingers start to bleed

We could go some place alone
Don't you see?
We could go somewhere it snows
Just you and me
We could go to Switzerland
Never come back home again

You, you like the cold, at least that's what I hear
So we could waste away the days
Until we waste away the year
'Cause you're the only one I need and I'm the only one for you
And Zurich's nice for growing old and that's all I want to do with you (with you)

We could go some place alone
Don't you see?
We could go somewhere it snows
Just you and me
We could go to Switzerland
Or some place we've never been
Take this house we're living in
Never call it home again

[Verse 1]
I feel numb, in the night
Would you fight for my life?
Am I there in the dark of your mind?

[Pre-Chorus]
If you leave, I will stay
I will cry, I’d break
Love is blue, I’m the one untrue
For you

[Chorus]
I see your heart start to break
Your blood your bones start to shake
I took your line and earthquake away
To save you
I see your heart start to break
Your blood your bones start to shake
I took your line and earthquake away
To save you, to save you

[Verse 2]
A touch so sweet, it's alright
As we float into the light
I am here in the black, I'm behind

[Pre-Chorus]
Feeling bold, feeling brave
Lucky chance we take
If you fall (if you fall), I will still
I'll kill for you

[Chorus]
I see your heart start to break
Your blood your bones start to shake
I took your line and earthquake away
To save you
I see your heart start to break
Your blood your bones start to shake
I took your line and earthquake away
To save you, to save you

[Bridge]
I see your heart
Your bones are shaking
I see your heart
I'm here to save you

[Chorus]
I see your heart start to break
Your blood your bones start to shake
I took your line and earthquake away
To save you
I see your heart start to break
Your blood your bones start to shake
I took your line and earthquake away
To save you, to save you
Passed you on a side street
Brushed across your wrist like a razor blade
You won't ever know me
I still let my dreams fill with your face
Oh, no

Love could be a heartbeat
Love could be a thought that clouds your brain
Show me why my heart beats
Give me how it feels without the pain
Oh, no

I just wanna know what you're like
I just wanna try

Missed you from my bedroom
I like to pretend i know your name
And whether you like cats and dogs or if the
Movies that we watch are all the same
Oh, no
I just wanna know what you're like
I just wanna try
Do you think it's sweet
I'm nervous talking to you
Or am I just a freak?
Sat by me on the bus on the way back to school
I wish that I was cool
Like you

I guess it's kind of me
I never try
You drove me home last week
I would've died for a kiss
You smell like cigarettes and how chocolate tastes
It makes me wanna die, but I guess I can wait

I wanna kill myself, I'm gonna go to hell
I'm gonna kill myself, I wanna go to hell
And he's the way I'm gonna do it

Something in my veins is gnawing at me
I wanna kiss your face
'Cause you smell like cigarettes and how chocolate tastes
It makes me wanna die, but I guess I can wait
I wanna kill myself, I'm gonna go to hell
I'm gonna kill myself, I wanna go to hell
And he's the way I'm gonna do it
You're already loving me like I'm long gone
You're already thinking that I'm not the one
I'm already feeling like you're letting go
I can hear it in your voice at 2 a.m. when we talk on the phone

I'm already missing hanging at your shows
Going home with bruises that might never show
Making out in my bedroom with the door closed
Hoping that my mom and dad would never come back home

[Refrain]
Lovely, she looks straight out the movies with her red hair
Like the girl they loved back in the eighties
I wish she would go back there

[Verse 1]
Because she's got you wrapped around her finger like dental floss
She'll pick you out her teeth just like her last meal
Baby you're already lost

[Verse 2]
I wish I could catch your eye the way that she does
No, I'm not the type to turn you green love
But I can mend your heart real well
Because I sew all my clothes together and my patches on
To my jean jacket where your heart belongs
I can make you feel brand new

[Chorus]
Maybe I just wanna know what it's like
To be loved by everyone or
Maybe I just wanna be good enough for you
Maybe I just wanna know what it's like
To be loved by everyone or
Maybe I just wanna be good enough for you

[Verse 3]
Love me like the girl you see up on the movie screen
I could be the reason for your heart beat
I could be the one you need
Because I've got everything that she has got but looks babe
Let me feel the fire that your love makes
I just wanna be your dream

[Chorus]
Maybe I just wanna know what it's like
To be loved by everyone or
Maybe I just wanna be good enough for you
Maybe I just wanna know what it's like
To be loved by everyone or
Maybe I just wanna be good enough for you

[Refrain]
Lovely, she looks straight out the movies with her red hair
Like the girl they loved back in the eighties
I wish she would go back there

[Verse 1]
Your eyes shining with the stars
Laying out in your backyard
I won't ever sleep tonight, I swear
'Cause that's when you come to me
As I'm drifting into dreams
I can barely close my eyes, I swear

[Hook]
It's always the same thing

[Verse 2]
You've been hanging in my brain
Causing all my stomach aches
I can only think of you these days

[Hook]
It's always the same thing

[Chorus]
You've been spending all your time
Living on the backside of my eyes
Sleeping pills won't clear my mind, no way
'Cause I've been spending all my time
Looking at the backside of my eyes
And you're the one I always find there, babe

[Hook]
It's always the same thing

[Verse 3]
Fill my head with pillow talk
I've been feeling low too long
Need to hear your voice a while, my love
'Cause I just miss the way you taste
When you're hardly still awake
Lying next to me, I'll let you have, my love

[Hook]
It's always the same thing

[Chorus]
You've been spending all your time
Living on the backside of my eyes
Sleeping pills won't clear my mind, no way
'Cause I've been spending all my time
Looking at the backside of my eyes
And you're the one I always find there, babe

[Outro]
It's always the same thing
It's always the same thing
It's always the same thing
Everybody wants to have
The kind of love I get to have
With you

Because no one wants to be alone
Life's much darker on your own
It's true

Everybody wants to feel
The kind of love they know is real
Like I do

Because I just want you in my life
Kissing circles on my thighs
Like you do

The late night calling
Goodbye stalling
You're the one for me
And I think everyone can see
Everybody wants to have
The kind of love that drives them mad
Like I do

So I don't know just what to say
When I feel your heart slipping away
Like I do

Late night calling
Goodbye stalling
You're the one for me
And I think everyone can see

The late night calling
I'm still falling
But do you still love me
Because you're the only one I need
And I think everyone can see
So why are you still wavering
Why are you still wavering?
Touch your wrist to the burning radiator
That's the feeling in my head
Because you could have me now or later
But you turn it down instead

Touch your feet to the icy floorboards
That's the way your heart reacts
When I tell you I want something more
You're always pulling it back

Has love just left you fine? (you're fine, oh)
Has love just left your mind? (your mind, oh)
Because you still bleed in mine (in mine, oh)
And I'm not doing fine

Touch your wrist to the burning radiator
That's the fever in my mind
Because you could have me now or later
But I know you won't be mine

Has love just left you fine? (you're fine, oh)
Has love just left your mind? (your mind, oh)
Because you still bleed in mine (in mine, oh)
And I'm not doing fine
Jacob was the only one
Who ever taught me how to love
And now i'm leaving for the north
Without a kiss goodbye

I know that he'll be okay
And i know i'll get there someday
But there's a hurting in my chest
When he's not by my side, oh no

Never been with one like him
Feel him lean in for the kiss
I open up my eyes real quick
To make sure his are tight

I guess i never thought of it
As missing how he made me limp
He's melting into my own lips
I'd let him bleed me dry because

I know what it's like to be alone
And i don't wanna talk about it on the phone, no
I just wanna see his face, touch his lips, be the only one he wants to kiss
I can feel us separate
The moment i step on the plane
I hope he doesn't cry so hard
His eyes are dry for days

'cause that's for me, the one who leaves
I wanna be the only side that
Has to feel the sorrow in my
Stomach like a knife baby

I know what it's like to be alone
And i don't wanna catch up with him on the phone, no
I just wanna see his face, touch his lips, be the only one he wants to kiss

I know what it's like to be alone
And i don't wanna talk about it on the phone, no
I just wanna see his face, touch his lips, be the only one he wants to kiss

I know what it's like to be alone
And i don't wanna catch up with him on the phone, no
I just wanna see his face, touch his lips, be the only one he wants to kiss
Memories
Drowning in the deep end when your love recedes
Everything you gave me, like a stone: it sinks
I can feel you floating away

Summer was
The ending of a heat wave so we bathed in lust
Just to keep form burning in the august rush
When everybody's moving away

Feelings swell
Redder than my eyes when all the sorrow fell
Dripping down my cheeks and I'm not doing well
Missing you is eating me up

Memories
Sunday mornings sleeping in your company
I could feel the sunlight washing over me
Now I feel it washing away
Tell me do you think about me
When I'm lying on your heart
Tell me do you dream about me when you sleep out underneath the stars
'Cause I don't want a hollow smile
I want all that's on your face
And I won't only want to love you I want something that I can't replace

Yeah I want to know what's real
What's been purified to heal my wounds
Tell me is it you?

Saw you on the street one summer evening you were empty as could be
You were lying in the road just waiting for the cars to set you free
You asked me if we could run away
Someplace nobody would know
But I don't wanna be your fool if you're not the one who's gonna take me home

Yeah I want to know what's real
What I'm so damn scared to feel
Yeah I want to know what's real
What's been purified to heal my wounds
Tell me is it you?
Tell me is it you?
Tell me is it you?
Missed you from the Hudson River
When the water whispered out your name
Feel my swollen bloody knuckles
Distance makes my feelings act the same

There's an aching in my stomach
Memories still turn me inside out
I want more than chocolate daydreams
Wanna taste your sweetness in my mouth

I don't know why I feel blue
Maybe I'm still into you
I don't know why I'm so blue
Maybe I'm not over you
I woke up at three a.m
Tears were laying in my bed
Like you
Used to

So I drove for a half an hour
To sleep outside of your friend's house
In my car
To be where you are

I was there the night before
Puking out of my car door
And you gave
Me a mix tape that you made

Each song was a memory
A day that you had spent with me
I cried
All night

Nothing's ever hurt like this, I swear
Broken bones and scraped up knees could not compare
I'll never be next to you but I memorized the feel
Nothing's ever hurt like this but at least it was real

[Akon]
When I see you
I run out of words to say (oh oh)
I wouldn't leave you
'Cause you're that type of girl that make me stay (oh oh)

I see the guys tryna' holla
Girl I don't wanna bother you
'Cause you're independent and you got my attention
Can I be your baby father
Girl I just wanna show you
That I love what you are doin' hun

I see you in the club
You gettin' down good
I wanna get with you, yeah
I see you in the club
You showin' thugs love
I wanna get with you

[Chorus:]
You're so beautiful
So damn beautiful
Said you're so beautiful
So damn beautiful
You're so beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful
You're so beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful
You're so beautiful

[Dulce María]
En tu abrazo, quisiera volver a nacer
Paso a paso perderme en tu piel, perderme en tu piel
Quiero que me ames más, más, más
Y no quiero que me digas bye, bye, bye
Sólo quiero que me ames más, más, más
Y no quiero que me digas bye, bye, bye

[Akon & Dulce]
I see you in the club
You gettin' down good
I wanna get with you, yeah
I see you in the club
You showin' thugs love

[Chorus]

[Akon]
Where'd you come from you're outta this world to me (ohh ohh)
You're a symbol of what every beautiful woman should be (oooh wee)(ohh ohh)

[Dulce María]
Quiero que me ames más, más, más
Y no quiero que me digas bye, bye, bye
Solo quiero que me ames más, más, más
Y no quiero que me digas bye, bye, bye

[Akon & Dulce]
I see you in the club
You gettin' down good
I wanna get with you 

[quiero que me ames más]

I wanna get with you 

[you're so beautiful]

[Chorus]

[Verse: Khalil]
Bad chick, she getting naughty (Naughty)
My group is at the scene, tell your friend I'm sorry (Sorry)
We pull up to the club and then we start to party (Uh-huh)
Last time was in a Bent, this time brought out the Rarri (Damn)
Have a hundred by my neck, I'm still the old me (Uh-huh)
Yeah, I heard them ni‏ggas talkin', they don’t know me (Uh-huh)
She said she ain't been here before, but she gon' see (Uh-huh)

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
I said meet me at the club, tonight
All them bottles on me
You can meet me at the club, tonight
And you can stand in front of me
I said meet me at the club

[Refrain: Justin Bieber]
We could go slow, oh, nobody would know, oh
Take it to our section, baby, we could make a show, oh
Grab my hand, let’s go
Take it nice and slow
Is 'bout that time we hit the road, it's ‘bout that time we roll, roll

[Bridge: Justin Bieber]
Only you'd understand (Only you'd understand)
Only you 'til the end (Only you 'til the end)
Only you

All them bottles on me

[Refrain 1]

[ x2]
Is this what summer feelz?
Like when I'm on the go
Citrus in the air
Her sundress on the flo-o-o-or

[Hook]
And in the winter
And in the summer too
You just love me
In the worst way

[Refrain 2]

[x2]
In the winter you're hatin' me
In the summer you love to be
My mistress or my baby
But that's ok with me

[Hook]
And in the winter
And in the summer too
You just love me
In the worst way

[String Instrumental break]

[Female Harmonies]

[Verse]
Summer feelz is the worst time ever
Some niggas never make it back
And fall for the weather
The girl that you love is probably gone for forever
(Forever, ever, forever,ever?)
Maybe
The summer breeze resembles the Devil’s breath
If you feel like teen spirit, then scenes put you in check
So niggas in my neighborhood hustle ‘cause the paper good
And hoes let their flowers bloom when the weather's good
Cops swing ‘round when the sun beam down
Relationships fade like the side of my head
You say you’ll miss me next winter
You'll wonder what is real
But thats ‘cause summer feelz

[Intro]
See you, I go wild; see you, I go wild
See you, I go wild; wild, wild, wild

[Verse 1]
Oh, my darlin'
Every time I see you, baby, I go wild, go wild
Every time I see your face, I feel an earthquake coming on
You shake me up and break me down
'Til all my self-control is gone
You're all the things I've ever wanted, girl
Underneath the rising sun

[Pre-Chorus]
But the hand of fate says no
There's someone else and you love him so
But just one look at you, my heart cries for you
And I love you, love you, love you

[Chorus]
Every time I see you, baby, I go wild, I just go wild
Every time I see you, baby, I go wild, go wild

[Verse 2]
You've got sweet magic in your eyes
And it makes you the master of my soul
Just one look and all, all my strength, darlin'
Fades away under your control

[Pre-Chorus]
You and your love I see each day
You're too in love to look my way
And when you passed me by
My heart starts to cry
'Cause I love you, love you, love you, love you, baby

[Chorus]
Every time I see you, baby, I go wild, go wild
(I go wild, I go wild, I go wild, I go wild)

[Verse 3]
You know I love you
And I place no one above you, darlin'
Just one look, some kind of power reaches every inch of me
Melting all my resistance slowly
And oh, my darling, so tenderly, oh...

[Outro]
Every time I see your face, darlin', I go wild, go wild, darlin'
Every time I hear your name, baby, I go wild, my darlin', I go wild

[Chorus]
At last, at last
I found a love for me
At last, at last
I found a love for me

[Verse 1]
Into my life she came, people
A life full of misery
Bringing with her the sunshine
To warm the very soul of me

[Chorus
At last, at last
Oh, I found a love for me
Do you believe me? At last
Oh, I found a love for me
(One more thing)

[Verse 2]
I knew right away
As soon as our eyes first met
That her heart and mine would soon entwine
Into a love no one would ever forget

[Chorus]
Ah, at last
Oh, I found a love for me
At last, huh, yeah
I found a love for me
Oh, yeah

[Bridge]
Whoo
Your love, your love
Your love, your love is mine
Listen
She's sweet, so sweet
Lord, she's the apple of my eye
Her lips, yeah, look like two rubies
And she stands about so high
When she kisses me I'm feeling thunder
Oh yeah, yeah
I found a love for me
Oh, everybody needs someone to love
I'm so glad that I found mine
There's someone somewhere for everyone
And it's only a matter of time
Before you say it

[Chorus]
At last
Ooh, I found a love for me
Baby, at last, ah
I found a love for me

[Verse 1: Trey Songz]
Usually hear the phone late night like now
She usually say no, but she almost always breaks right down
She finna drive an hour to my house, right now
Can't wait to break the walls and knock all your lights out
She said that she should probably be alone right now
How long has it been?
Why are you even all up on my phone right now?
You leave my body weak
Then you disappear for weeks
And I'm way too strong right now
Where you been?
Why do you go missing?
Where you be when I need your attention?
I know that you need that (need some)
Tell me you don't miss it you don't want it right now
Cause all I need to hear, you can lay it back down
Tell me you don't think about it, that's a damn lie
Don't nobody make it feel, make it feel like when I'm inside
You don't got to gas me girl, I'm full up
Imma let you get some sleep, get some give up
She said you really want this pussy, you would pull out

[Chorous]
Come and see me for once
Come and see me for once
You don't ever come to me, you don't ever come to me
All she ever say is, come and see me for once
Come and see me for once
You don't ever come to me, you don't ever come to me

[Verse 2: Mike Angel]
Waist too slim, got a face like Rihanna
Say you sick and tired of the drama
I just want to give you oh na na
While your dad and mom top shotta
I know I haven't called in a long time
I been in the zone on my own time
No days off talking long nights
Never at the crib on the long flights
I just gotta know if it's mine tonight
I got some time tonight
Imma roll the gas oh
Who could fuck your bed up
Face down hit the ass up
You know I keep it wetter
Imma hit it every angle
Neighbors know my name
Got you screaming Mike Angel

[Chorus]
Come and see me for once
Come and see me for once
You don't ever come to me, you don't ever come to me
All she hit me with is, come and see me for once
Come and see me for once
You don't ever come to me, you don't ever come to me

[Verse 3: Trey Songz]
You been putting time aside for me
You say I never got the time for you
I be in the zone, I be worried about my own thing
Girl, I know it's wrong to be this selfish
But I got some problems inside I don't never tell nobody
But there's something when I look in your eyes
That say it's okay for me to love you
Say it's okay for me to trust you
Say it's okay for me to need you
Imma put it out there, yeah
I'm scared
Stopping at the store
You want anything from here?
Ten minutes Imma be there
All she sayin'

[Chorus]
Come and see me for once
Come and see me for once
You don't ever come to me, you don't ever come to me
All she ever say is, come and see me for once
Come and see me for once
You don't ever come to me, you don't ever come to me

[Verse 1]
Moving on and getting over
Are not the same, it seems to me
'Cause you've been gone, I'm growing older
But I still can't seem to get you off my mind
And I do believe I feel you all the time

[Verse 2]
Moving on and getting over
Are not the friends they used to be
It's been so long since I got to hold you
But I still can't seem to get you off my mind
And I do believe I feel you all the time, all the time

[Bridge]
Tell me I can have the fact you've loved me to hold onto
Tell me I can keep the door cracked open, to let light through
For all my running, I can understand
I'm one text away from being back again
But I'm moving on and I'm getting over
I'm getting over, I'm getting over
I got to get over

[Verse 3]
Moving on and getting over
It's been so long; it just goes to show you
That I still can't seem to get you off my mind (get you off my mind)
And I sure would like to see you one more time

[Outro]
It's taken me so long just to say "so long"
And baby it's so wrong, but I'm moving on
I'm gonna get a new girl
A something-I-can-do-girl
To try to get me through, girl
'Cause I'm moving on
I'm moving on
And I'm moving on
I'm moving on
And I'm moving on
Consider me as good as gone
'Cause I'm moving on
I'm moving on
Moving on, baby
Moving on
Moving on

[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, look

[Verse 1]
Damn, won't you get her her paradise
Somethin' more than a store with a pair of Nikes
That we probably can't afford 'cause the wearin' price
So instead, we just window shop
At night time, gotta keep her windows locked
'Cause niggas outside with they things on cock
And money so low though, through they been throwin' rock
I heard he savin' up for that Benz old drop
But if cops knock 'em down and his ears gon' flop
So the ink from his pen gon' drop
'Cause when we do the crime, everythin's blown out
I help the portion, women havin' abortions
And we as black males should not be black male
We can make planes instead of them crack sales
Think about it, you ruinin' someone's life
And if they come back, you doin' it to 'em twice

[Chorus]
Let's all to sleep
Just a dream a day
Way them clouds ain't grey
And you're miles away
So just let your head
Think away the pain
From your cloudy day
Because now you stay in a beautiful place

[Verse 2]
Damn, won't you give a man good livin'
Good cookin' that ain't comin' outta hood kitchen
Build a better community that we could live in
Give us better predicaments that we shoulda been in
I mean not all of us bad, some got a good vision
And our role models gettin' shot up in the hood slippin'
The fall out's appall seen
How do we graduate if drop outs all we see?
And when we sleep, the only time that we offer peace
Wish I could wake up and all my pain's all a dream
All as God's human beings, come all a team
Where everybody on the bus on the car to be
We need difference in the world, predominantly
Need change, more than an Obama speech
We need to listen like the times when our mama speaks
So we can finally expand like we oughta be, uh

[Chorus]
Let's all to sleep
Just a dream a day
Way them clouds ain't grey
And you're miles away
So just let your head
Think away the pain
From your cloudy day
Because now you stay in a beautiful place

[Outro]
How could we see clearly if the circumstances we've been born into are not as golden or bright as others? How does someone do so right if only seein' so wrong? How does a community change for the better to change another community? The answer is one word, self. You see you must first change yourself as a person before you can change someone else or correct anyone on their own problems. Only he without sin has the right to judge someone with sins in their wrong heart. Some people are good hearted, some people are bad hearted. Good and bad people both have their differences but one thing they have in common is sleep. You see no matter how long you stay awake, you will always need to sleep. And in that sleep, you exist in another world, another realm. You will wake up in the morning only to have to go to sleep that same night. And then you exist again in the dream world. Keep the dream alive. Mr. Peterson

[Intro]
When I'm all alone
And my world come crashing down
Do I know who knows me?
Truly, you not gon' fool me
Say, when I'm all alone
And my world come crashing down
Do I know who knows me?
Truly, you not gon' fool me

[Bridge]
God, I'm sorry for acting (ooh)
I am for real
I never meant to make my mama cry
I apologize, I'm truly sorry
I'm sorry for acting (ooh)
I am for real
I never meant to make my mama cry
I apologize, I'm truly sorry
Damn right, I'm truly sorry
Yeah right, I'm truly sorry
I apologize, I'm truly sorry

[Verse 1]
Took a lot of pills just to kill my emotions
And now I'm finna kill all the thrill in my notions
I took a lot of pills just to kill my emotions
And now I'm finna kill all the thrill in my notions
I needed all the pills for the thrill in my notions
A little bitty pill, Advil, Ibuprofen
I'm faded, mmm, I'm faded
I'm faded, I'm faded, I'm done, done
Yeah, I'm done, done

[Verse 2]
I'm not a tycoon
I'm not a wise dude
I'm not a perfect nigga, but I got the right mood
I know she wonders what just goes on in my head
She try to get to know me, but I rather fuck instead
See, sex is therapeutic for the lonesome
We rather be alone, but hormones just really want some
So I keep my hands to the sky, and my knees to the ground
And my sins hit the seas, I need holy water now
See: H, A, double P, Y
Is what I'm tryna find, but it always seems like
Somethin' tryna break me down, or pull me under
Callin' on my Brio, think I might have wrong number

[Outro]
I think I might have wrong number
Callin' on my Brio, think I might have wrong number
I keep callin' like every day of the week
I'm callin' on my Brio, think I might have wrong number

[Verse 1]
Silly motherfuckers wanna doubt me
Well, that's cool with me
I never let them haters talk around me
Save the bullshit for your USB
How you mad at mad decent, fuck is you meanin'?
Commitment ain't no joke, that shit ain't got leases
Decisions, decisions whether it pull up or whether it miss 'em
Fuck it
Deuces I'm tuckin'
All of them niggas, they bitches, they bluffin'
Suc-cess, I part seas like I'm Moses
And when it come to talent, yes I do possess
(They don't lie)
I really am, a motherfuckin' killer better get it on cam
Jealous of your friends so you act like you friendly
Even if you in Vegas you never see the envy
Ethiop king, mama she said
Every solo man got a little highlid
Word, my pussy's better you need to center
Hate it when they talk about themselves to feel better

[Pre-Chorus]
Concealed, come see the pros
Never mention cons 'cause you hate 'em on the low
She bomb.com, but she probably a hoe
But then again I'd probably hatin'
Let's get to singin' uh

[Chorus]
You think I'm crazy
I don't deserve ya
And that I'm lazy
I'm such a monster
You probably will never get around
To let me defend myself, so when I'm singing to you now like
Yeye, yeye, oh-alright girl
Yeye, yeye, oh-okay girl
Yeye, yeye, oh-alright
When ya all up in my ear
I'm singin' yeye all night
(Like)

[Verse 2]
Respect, get my feet wet
If a nigga got a problem hit him with a reflex, bitch I'm
Fly like a sea jet
So I don't joke around, bitch
No, I ain't Heath Ledger, look
I'm a fiend to the rap, but the rap make a fiend
If your flow too dry, I'll prescribe vaseline
I'm the newest motherfucker on the motherfuckin' scene
He said no way, way
I said yeyeye

[Bridge]
It's west side 'til I die
Can I flex out in my ride?
It's west side
It's west side
It's west side 'til I die
Bitch, it's west side 'til I die
Can I flex out in my ride?
It's west side
It's west side
It's west side 'til I die
Rep

[Verse 3]
Do you D-I-E if you R-I-P?
The questions I ask when I'm in too deep
The moment you laugh is the moment I leave
There's no time for jokes, man
I call what I see

[Pre-Chorus]
Concealed, come see the pros
Never mention cons 'cause you hate 'em on the low
She bomb.com, but she probably a hoe
But then again I'd probably hatin'
Let's get to singin' uh

[Chorus]
You think I'm crazy
I don't deserve ya
And that I'm lazy
I'm such a monster
You probably will never get around
To let me defend myself, so when I'm singing to you now like
Yeye, yeye, alright girl
Yeye, yeye, okay girl
Yeye, yeye, alright
When ya all up in my ear
I'm singin' yeye all night

[Verse 1]
Every night I sleep and dream of you
You was the one I thought I'd never lose
Losing is just another part of life
Living is dead without you by my side

[Chorus]
Now I'm holding onto memories
Hoping you would return back to me
So I can breathe
So I can breathe

[Verse 2]
Taking for granted what was always free
Freedom was known, will you come back to me
Come back to me, come back to me
I was a fool who thinks I had a voice in the matter
Now I'm alone and left without a choice

[Chorus]
Won't you reminisce on memories?
Hoping you would return back to me
So I can breathe
So I can breathe, yeah

[Bridge]
Ooh, girl, I know I'm wrong
Should have never let you in all alone, oh, no, no
Because I was unworthy and you were all I needed
And I tried to let it go, ooh, I can't help it

[Chorus]
Won't you reminisce on memories?
Hoping you would return back to me
I been reaching out on every breath
On every breath, baby
Just release this tension in my chest
So I can breathe
Girl, so I can breathe, baby

[Outro]
Girl, I know I'm wrong
Should have never let you go all alone, baby

[Verse 1]
I need your body in ways
That you don't understand, but I'm losing my patience
'Cause we've been going over and over again
Girl, I just wanna take you home and get right to it
Know I gotta kiss it, baby
Give it to me, lick it lick it inside and out
You know that I just wanna make love
Want you to scream and shout
And baby, when I'm deep in it now
I'ma slow it down, 'cause ain't no speed limit
When we're moving at the speed of sound
We gon' turn all the way up when the lights down
Why your pussy so damn good, miss lady?
Go and put that booty up, baby, one on one
You know I'ma go crazy when your legs in the air
You know your panties never getting in the way
You know I kinda like it, when you make me work for it

[Chorus]
Ayy you, gal, inna di tight up skirt
Get that ass in the bed, I'ma lock the door
Shake that ass like boom shakalacka, boom shakalacka (boom, boom)
We don't need nobody watching us (yikes!)
No eyes but your eyes
Ain't nobody here but you and me
Licking your private parts (Boom shakalacka, hahaha)
And I know you love your privacy

[Verse 2]
You don't need a shower, you already wet
Know that pussy power, telling me, I ain't ready yet
I say, "Fuck it," face my fears, baby
When I lick it, I put tears in it
Put my face in it, eat it like a dinner date
You know I love foreplay, 12 play, everything
Know my lovin' don't change
I don't really give a fuck what a hater say
'Cause you fine, baby
And it's alright 'cause you're all mine, baby, ooh, hoo
Girl, I'ma let you get crazy

[Chorus]
Ayy you, gal, inna di tight up skirt
Get that ass in the bed, I'ma lock the door
Shake that ass like boom shakalacka, boom shakalacka (boom, boom)
We don't need nobody watching us (yikes!)
No eyes but your eyes
Ain't nobody here but you and me
Licking your private parts (Boom shakalacka, hahaha)
And I know you love your privacy

[Verse 3]
Baby, I promise I won’t tell nobody
Just long as you let me hit it like every night
I could give a fuck ‘bout the club, 'cause that pussy tight
Do a split on it, drop it, baby, show you right
I'ma split your weave and you askin' me to stay the night
Whipped cream on your titties, then you suckin' on my dick with ice
Oh my God, oh my God, my bitch get me right
Ain't gotta pay for that pussy, my dick can change your life
I'm tired of missionary, wanna see you on your face
Put that ass up in the air, I'm lovin' how that pussy taste
Damn, on your side, on your side
Stop runnin' from this dick, I ain't 'bout to let you slide this time

[Chorus]
Ayy you, gal, inna di tight up skirt

Naked all over my sofa, ooh yeah
Girl, we couldn't be any closer
You feel me right here, huh (ooh)
And nowhere but right here
Is where you're 'bout to get satisfied
You ain't even gotta go out tonight, let's not kill the moment
Before we do the freaky shit, I bought you roses
Sexy lingerie, you know I know your size

[Pre-Chorus]
You can't get away from me
Girl, I'm about to put in overtime
Sit on my face,  murdered the pussy, so you know you're about to drop the case
But let's not play with time, ooh

[Chorus]
Tell me what to do, baby (come on, come on, come on)
Tell me what to do, baby
I just wanna please you right (right)
How you want me to kiss it, babe? Just tell me, girl (just tell me, girl)
Tell me what to do, baby (baby)
Tell me what to do, baby (baby)
Speed it up or take it slow (slow)
So tell me, baby, please 'cause I need to know

[Verse 2]
Don't play around, you know I stay up in my feelings, baby
And all I want us to do, is just feel it, baby
I don't want to bust first 'cause I want you to get yours
Don't worry, ain't no pressure, baby
Dripping, I'ma make a waterfall
I be painting inside her walls
Got you screaming like, oh woah
Fucking up the way you walk, ooh yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
You can't get away from me
Girl, I'm about to put in overtime (oh)
Sit on my face, murdered the pussy, so you know you're about to drop the case
But let's not play with time, ooh

[Chorus]
Tell me what to do, baby (baby)
Tell me what to do, baby (oh, oh, oh)
I just wanna please you right (right)
How you want me to kiss it, babe? Just tell me, girl (just tell me, yeah)
Tell me what to do, baby (baby)

Speed it up or take it slow (slow)
So tell me, baby, please 'cause I need to know

[Verse 3]
Have it any way you want, babe
'Cause I just want to make you cum all over the place, I won't let your drought go to waste
Let the bed shake, let me hit it 'til you get a headache, fuck you the long way
Rock your body, rock your body, put you on top and let you ride it, ooh, oh oh

[Chorus]
Tell me what to do, baby
Tell me what to do, baby
I just wanna please you right (right)
How you want me to kiss it, babe? Just tell me, girl (just tell me, girl, yeah, yeah)
Tell me what to do, baby (baby)
Tell me what to do, baby (baby)
Speed it up or take it slow (slow)
So tell me, baby, please 'cause I need to know

[Verse 1]
Remember when we swam in the ocean?
Now we know what's deep inside
Remember when we ran in the open?
Now we know what's in the wild
Used to think that this love was Heaven sent
How did we get lost? Can't get back again
Tell me, is there light on the outside?

[Chorus 1]
So are we leaving this Garden of Eden?
Are we leaving this Garden of Eden?

[Verse 2]
Used to walk around your apartment
Nothing but a smile on me
But tonight I'm so self conscious
Isn't it so clear to see?
Nothing's ever perfect in Paradise
Don't know what it's worth 'til you pay the price
When you bite your tongue does it draw blood?

[Chorus 2]
So are we leaving this Garden of Eden?
Are we leaving this Garden of Eden?
Now I know what I know
But it’s hard to find the meaning
Where do we go?
'Cause we don't believe in this Garden of Eden
(Eden, Eden, Eden)
This Garden of Eden?
(Eden, Eden, Eden)

[Verse 3]
I have cried for you, and I'll ride for you
I would die for you, but would you do that for me?
Tell the truth, what you wanna do
Is it me and you?
Are you with me, honey?
I have cried for you, and I'll ride for you
I would die for you, but would you do that for me?
Tell the truth, what you wanna do
Is it me and you?
Are you with me?

[Chorus 2]
So are we leaving this Garden of Eden?
Are we leaving this Garden of Eden?
Now I know what I know
But it's hard to find the meaning
Where do we go?
'Cause we don't believe in this Garden of Eden
(Eden, Eden, Eden)
This garden of Eden
(Eden, Eden, Eden)

[Bridge]
Remember when we swam in the ocean?
Now we know what's deep inside
Remember when we ran in the open?

[Chorus 3]
So are we leaving?
(Are we leaving this Garden of Eden?)
Are we leaving?
(Are we leaving this Garden of Eden?)
Now I know what I know
But it's hard to find the meaning
Where do we go?
'Cause we don't believe in this Garden of Eden
(Eden, Eden, Eden)
This garden of Eden
(Eden, Eden, Eden)

[Intro]
Aw yeah, winner of the year, baby
Swavey

[Chorus]
This everythin' I ever wanted, oh
I let that beat drop queen on your ass, nigga
Remember nights I used to feed for this cash, nigga
And got me feelin' like oh la la la la
This everythin' I ever wanted
And got me feelin' like oh la la la la
This everythin' I ever wanted
Everythin' I ever wanted

[Verse 1]
Need to flaunt it, but never seen it honest
My European mami probably on a job, nigga
I ain't gon' lie, I'm with some breezies at the spot, nigga
Went to car dealers to niggas from sippin' malt liquor
Damn, that feelin', feelin' better than the feelin' before
Shout out to Fresco on the brillo, we did it, we blow
My middle finger to them haters, you can take your picture
I let the instrumental paint the picture, Swavey
My game doper than a king smoker
Your favourite artist might be dope but I remain doper
I seen those rappers lane over 'cause your lane over
That's lames for ya, dame over in my Range Rover
Guess I'm just super fly when I'm super duper high
I be runnin' circles with the swave, hoola hoop or fly
I'm on the apex, might lose on my iText
How could you be flyin', you ain't even learn to fly yet? Swavey

[Chorus]
I let that beat drop queen on your ass, nigga
Remember nights I used to feed for this cash, nigga
And got me feelin' like oh la la la la
This everythin' I ever wanted
And got me feelin' like oh la la la la
This everythin' I ever wanted

[Verse 2]
I'm on mic, 1, 2, cuffers they want you
Haters all just confused, lovers they love you
But just don't wanna show it, so much that they keep it
Hold it inside they soul and roll it
Envy emotions that a hater try to keep inside
Be shoutin', "Nigga, don't watch me" but they be peepin' right
I set the standard so high, these is what the beaches like
Paid my security nigga, so I don't need to fight, hand me my mirror back
I'm in my tuxedo, Rolls Royce that bought Rigo
Reup, reload, the books we throw
The clubs be sold, you know, you know, 2 doors, 2 hoes
So 2 doughs to you niggas takin' pictures with your new folk
A fantasy stuntin' in them Phantom seats
Everyone who hated regret it, Loyota lookin'
I'm still amazin', still I made it through the buckets of rubbish
So motherfuck it, it's done sucker, we comin' before the game

[Chorus]
I let that beat drop queen on your ass, nigga
Remember nights I used to feed for this cash, nigga
And got me feelin' like oh la la la la
This everythin' I ever wanted
And got me feelin' like oh la la la la
This everythin' I ever wanted

[Outro]
This a public service announcement, remindin' you to keep it swavey at all times, baby. I mean it's not flockin' if it's not flockin', think about it. We rockin' clothes we can't pronounce, man. I need an accent to announce what I'm wearin' right now. Swavey, never rugged, nigga. Ow. I mean if I see you sideline hatin' because my pavement worth more than your faces, na I mean, I understand. And I ain't tryna stunt or nothin', I'm just keepin' it 100 with the thugs of the youngin's. 'Cause some buggin' got your main girl want me. I mean I might just take her, treat her to some makeup and a lil bit of extra bacon. After that, we shake it, she probably gon' get naked. Oh yeah, Fresco

[Chorus]
I let that beat drop queen on your ass, nigga
Remember nights I used to feed for this cash, nigga

[Intro]
You used to be mine
You used to be mine
Sendin' this one now to a lil lady out there. I used to see her, I mean, she used to be mine, right

[Verse 1]
Look, reminiscin' on the times we had
Made things fine when the times was bad
I couldn't write a rhyme to define your class
Even though I spent time 'til the timin' passed
You used to rock two shoes, miss beautiful
Jimmy Choo shoes and the kiss you would do
From my heart, girl, you had me from the start
There was somethin' 'bout her, I couldn't live without her
The good love with somethin', you couldn't get me outta
I can't lie, I had my first doubts
I thought that you was too pretty for this to work out
I was surprised how this situation turned out
I guess things ain't the way the seem for what it means
Even though we was only younger teens
You always seemed to keep a certain love for me
That's why I'll never know why you set my lovin' free
Tell me if I'm wastin' time
Or does what I'm sayin' register in your mind?
Rememberin' things we used to do
And they keep bringin' me back to you

[Chorus]
She used to be my girl
She used to be mine oh mine
I said that you were my girl
Before you met that other guy
She used to be my girl
She used to be mine
She used to be mine oh mine
I said that you were my girl
Oh I, oh I, I wish you were here right now, girl
Oh I, oh I, I wish you were here right now, girl
Oh I, oh I, I wish you were here right now, girl
Oh I, oh I, I wish you were here right now, girl

[Verse 2]
I know that this might take some time
But at least tell me what's on your mind
So many heartaches that keep happenin' and you know it
And girl, I hate this feelin' but I can't control it
Shawty, girl, I'm down because you ain't around
Oh well, gone for now, hope you hear this now

[Chorus]
She used to be my girl
She used to be mine oh mine
I said that you were my girl
Before you met that other guy
She used to be my girl, my girl, my girl, my girl

[Outro]
Reminiscin' on them times, babe. Real hip hop, baby. I say all them times thinkin' 'bout it, got me here reminiscin', yeah

[Verse 1]
Relaxing on the couch is how it started out
Telephone ring, what's this all about?
12 up in the AM, we'll keep it on the phone
I wish my little breezy say she's all alone
Shawty, what you doin'? Won't you come on over?
We can make a movie, TV show like Oprah
Girl, we can get it on until the passin' time
We can cut it down until her body cums
Ay, you wanna ride, well baby, come on
I'll give you my game if you give up the score
By the way that Goose is on your pillow there
So take a shot for later, can help by the dance

[Chorus]
Girl, you at the house
Take a shot for later
It's about to go down
I'ma work that body out
I'ma work that body out
Shawty, let me work it out

[Verse 2]
Shawty, got a body, let me work it out
Up until it's day and we gon' burn it out
Girl, you need a lover, won't you stop playin'?
Even at the bottom, you my top lady
Girl, we'll do everythin' that we ever did
I promise after this you'll be finished with him
Baby girl, I'm hopin' you stay true, baby
'Cause all I wanna do is freak with you

[Chorus]
Girl, you at the house
Take a shot for later
It's about to go down
I'ma work that body out
I'ma work that body out
Shawty, let me work it out

[Verse 3]
Oh you lookin' bad, oh you lookin' mean
Damn you got your body, look at your physique
Damn you look amazin', single and you freaky
You should be my baby, you should leave with me

[Chorus]
Girl, you at the house
Take a shot for later
It's about to go down
I'ma work that body out
I'ma work that body out
Shawty, let me work it out

[Outro]
Baby, let me touch up on it
Help you make it feel the way it should feel
For real, for real, let me make you feel like
Let me make you feel like
Let me make you, let me, let me make you feel like
Touch me, you just wanna love me
I just wanna make you feel good
I just wanna make you feel good, so good
To the point where you know what to do
With yourself, with yourself
With yourself

Come here, baby. Right here. Yeah, that's it. Classic

[Verse 1]
Ay girl, I know it's been a long while since we last talked
It's been about a couple years now, we been away too long
I wish that I could pick it up, from where we left off
Now girl, I know it ain't the same now, I heard you got a man
But look at what you look like, girl, you don't understand

[Chorus]
If we get caught up in the mood, crack a bottle of the Rosé
Would you wanna be my boo? Would you wanna be my shawty?
What if we go out, do all your favourite things
Everything's alright, tell me do you think this could be
A situation, situation

[Verse 2]
Uh, seems rain is the weather
Know the situation ain't makin' things better
But nowadays, shawty duckin' under pressure
'Cause it seems conversations full of fuck it and whatevers
Still she love me, it's a blessing
Still she got another lover and she love when they together
But fuck it, it's whatever
'Cause we ought to get to touchin', you don't know what do next
A situation come usually
But she ain't love the man her man used to be
I just wanna see it truthfully
I just wanna see it truthfully
I just wanna see it truthfully
I just wanna see it truthfully
The situation is serious, had to break it down
Let's lay under the summer, lemme break you down
Muai tai dinners, you penners with cubes in 'em
Religion True denims that match mine, you damn fly
Look you better than Miss Curly Sue
I would cop you the ring, rocky pearly blue
Baby, we can be a match, that'll surely do
With my fly stacks and curvey you
Just hit me in the early now

[Chorus]
If we get caught up in the mood, crack a bottle of the Rosé
Would you wanna be my boo? Would you wanna be my shawty?
What if we go out, do all your favourite things
Everything's alright, tell me do you think this could be
A situation, situation

[Bridge]
Now baby, what if we go out
What if we do your things
Like everything's alright
Tell baby, do you think
Now baby, what if we go out
What if we do your things
Like everything's alright
Tell baby, do you think

[Chorus]
What if we go out, do all your favourite things
Everything's alright, tell me do you think this could be
A situation, situation

[Outro]
Listen baby, I know you with him and all, but you need to be with me. I could treat you way, way better. I know you like that. So let it be a situation, baby

[Verse]
Shorty residential, I can be your sponsor
I don't want your love baby, just give me them tonsils
Honey know I'm fly like a fuckin' air marshall
Dot niggas ball, it don't matter what it cost you
My niggas on they chains like a motherfuckin' fence
Someone tell them lames hit the motherfuckin' bench
80 for the frames on the eyes of a king
Eyes out for the shirt, iPod for the ring, that's the iPhone
Bad bitches wanna bite me like a python
I'm in your skin like hair with the lice on
It like shit, you can get your face split
Like a zit that you pop when you think it's hot shit
I don't know how I did it, I don't know how I did it
I get so much pussy man, that I don't know how I get it
I be on that I hit it, you be on that I get it
You be on that grown shit, I be on that I live it
Ridin', I'm dippin' dirty, them bitches, they gettin' flirty
I'm high and I'm sippin' purple, I lie no, I'm in the dirty
Them bitches they wanna fuck, I pass to my nigga Kirky
We fuck then we get up early, you want it then get it early
The haters they black ball, paper the back ball
I hit em in the front and leave they brain in the back yard
It's paper to stack dawg, so why you niggas stallin'?
If you ain't stackin;, don't be actin like you ballin'
Actin like Spalding, all up on the court side
Ridin' for the north side, nigga come through
I'm lookin' smoother than a door slide
Move a couple units in, we can get the Porsche ride, livin' by the shore side
When I was just a youngin', imagine little 5-10
Nigga with a onion with some wishes for the bunion
Money ain't a power, ain't a fuckin' nigga stuntin'
I keep it too real that's why these fuckin' niggas frontin'
I put it on his head and let another nigga done him
Never touch the work, I let another nigga run 'em
Pack the Louis luggage, got the one way out to London
We just passed through customs, me and Jae be out the country
And I'm somethin' like a teepee, niggas can't see me
If you pullin' hoes, you gotta rope one for Stevie
Bitches couldn't play me if they burnt me on a CD
Model after model, shit is lookin' like a repeat
I fuck a bitch and pull the swave out of her
Shout my nigga Honey, it's gon' be a loud summer
That's my little sister and I'm very proud of her
Now back to the business, 'bout to blow this cloud bubble
And I, I do this shit, I'm too legit
Refuse your bitch, like a Skype call
I'm killin' germ ass niggas like some lysol
I'm eatin' through the game, it's like a rice wall
But yeah, can I say it any clearer?
That a nigga got your boo but ain't tryna get your scare, get it?
I slide through a chick like debit
Then she eat the dick like credit
Got a new trend and I just might set it
Should of let your mom know, I can get your mind blown
I can kill that bird on your shirt, you can die slow
This that SLS now get the fuck up outta my throne, motherfucker, oh yeah

[Verse 1]
Normal things against him, Jordans with the lacin'
Shawty's more gold than a new diamond ring
That are made and deserves you and neither should never hurt you
She you deserve better than a new finer thing
If it's nothin' to do, tell him pick up the phone and call up a new driver
If it's nothin' to do, tell him pick up the phone and call up a new driver
No more cryin' on the sofa 'cause shawty, I'm comin' over soon
To come and give you this good lovin' and security

[Chorus]
Whenever you need me, girl, you my favourite
Let me take you higher, hop on a spaceship
And we'll get it on
We'll do it all over night
Whenever you need me, girl, you my favourite
Let me take you higher, hop on a spaceship
And we'll get it on
We'll do it all over night

[Verse 2]
Now she done talk that talk, even better, she walk that walk
And heaven's got me thinkin' you were made just for me
All the time you be shinin', you're not a dime, you're a diamond
Baby, you should be in movies, I would pay to see
Oh I, oh I, oh I, oh I
Ay, oh I, oh I

[Chorus]
Whenever you need me, girl, you my favourite
Let me take you higher, hop on a spaceship

[Bridge]
Feel like I'm livin' in the dream, baby
Feel like I'm livin' in the dream, baby
Feel like I'm livin' in the dream, baby
Some people make rumours
And they can say what they like
But baby, I think you special
And I'm glad you're in my life
Every night before I sleep
Girl, I need it all the time
And I pray that one day
You will be
I been waitin' the moment since you came into my life
For a second, that said I don't need

[Chorus]
Whenever you need me, girl, you my favourite
Let me take you higher, hop on a spaceship
And we'll get it on
We'll do it all over night
Whenever you need me, girl, you my favourite
Let me take you higher, hop on a spaceship
And we'll get it on
We'll do it all over night

Yeah, okay, I'm blowin' money fast but no, they don't call me Rick
Fresh up out that Callie, Louis duffle full of sticks
I know what to look so white, mama named Vicky
I told her stop suckin', girl, you givin' me a hickie
Name's on the record, wonder on the beat
Get your stamped out like we're drummin' with the feet
I'm a D Wade nigga, swipe it, comin' with the Heat
Lamborghini bird, it be hummin' when it speak
Know I'm in the buildin' like my desk up in the office
Now my money longer, doin' neck up on an ostrich
I'm so f'in' gone that I've tested alcoholic
And yeah, I'm rappin' like I'm reppin' for my college

[Chorus: Sean Kingston & Tory Lanez]
Messin' with the kid, no, yeah, I know a big hoe
Ride around town in my new Murcielago
Canada, oh woah
Canada, oh woah
I get the money pronto, sittin' in the condo
Better cuff your girl 'fore I fly her to Toronto
Canada, oh woah
Canada, oh woah

[Verse 2: Tory Lanez]
Boy, I'm back up in it like I'm flackin' with your main
High pay longer than the highway lane do
We be talkin' money, shawty, don't you like my ligo?
I ain't coughin' nothin', I just play 'em like a banjo
And your girl know I'm sippin' rum, rum
Give you tongue, tongue 'til I get it dumb, dumb
How I do it, I'm the new Sean Con
Money like a lawyer, got it in a lump some
Stuntin' in my Lambo, hotter than some combos
Don't you know the cash streak as far as the land go
Your girl moanin', Alanso

[Intro]
Just lemme breathe

[Chorus]
I feel like I'm goin' crazy, love me or hate me
Who's gonna save me from myself?
When I feel like there's no one else
When it feels like there's no one left
To keep my feet on the ground
'Cause I'm happy now but I'm crashin' down
Who's gon' save me from myself?
To keep my feet on the ground

[Verse 1]
I feel everybody needs somethin' from me
Me, I just feel like I need me some money
Or somethin' real soon, I need a deal soon
The only paper comin' are these fuckin' bills due
But wintertime comin', I ain't fuckin' chill proof
Mind tellin' me, "Chill, money's comin' real soon"
Still I feel I'm under like I'm stuck in milldew
Surrounded by fake people who don't speak the real truth
My girl hate me, think I'm creepin' with the duck
Or think I'm sleepin' with another but she don't even trust 'em
She wanna leave 'em, she don't love 'em
I understand, I just wanna let you know I wasn't, but fuck it then
Just know it's huggin' when it's huggin'
You always know it's real when it's comin' from the stomach
See this is how I feel, these the problems I'm confrontin'
I wish that I could clutch 'em and crush 'em, but fuck it

[Chorus]
I feel like I'm goin' crazy, love me or hate me
Who's gonna save me from myself?
When I feel like there's no one else
When it feels like there's no one left
To keep my feet on the ground
'Cause I'm happy now but I'm crashin' down
Who's gon' save me from myself?
To keep my feet on the ground

[Verse 2]
I wake up every day up on the floor
Waitin' for the day I'm on my tour
Prayin' for today to be the score, maybe not, maybe sure
I wanna better myself, I wanna make me more
I wanna live good, I want the lake and shore
I want the sold out shows with a great applause
I wanna be the star player in the game of cards
But when I take the score, it's like they hate me more
And child openings ain't openin'
So he prays to God hopin' that'll help but some hope in him
Now he's feelin' low again, exploadin' and openin' on folks of him
All he wants to do is get his vocals spin
They don't even see him like it's invisible clothes he's in
They must love to tease and that's the reason they provokin' him
Cheesin' with the coldest grin, he don't like to show it so he holds it in
Just know that I know it, man, yeah

[Chorus]
I feel like I'm goin' crazy, love me or hate me
Who's gonna save me from myself?
When I feel like there's no one else
When it feels like there's no one left
To keep my feet on the ground
'Cause I'm happy now but I'm crashin' down
Who's gon' save me from myself?
To keep my feet on the ground

[Bridge]
Look at me, I'm just like you
Got my own list of problems
Yeah, who gon' save me from myself?
Crashin' down, but I'm happy now, but it's

[Chorus]
I feel like I'm goin' crazy, love me or hate me
Who's gonna save me from myself?
When I feel like there's no one else
When it feels like there's no one left
To keep my feet on the ground
'Cause I'm happy now but I'm crashin' down
Who's gon' save me from myself?
To keep my feet on the ground

[Verse]
Now Mr. Peterson, this is completely phenomenal. You know, I've never seen such a transformation in my life. Now, you know, you come in here with your wip-de-doo and your Nike shoes and you know, I mean, I'm not gonna lie, I wasn't a believer. This is a fiasco of epic proportions. I mean, for lack of words, I mean, this is fuckin' amazin'. I mean, I'm just gettin' pumped by just watchin', you know? It's like, it's like. I mean Shanaenae's finally got her math equations done. You know, Jay's finally got it easy, he's answerin' questions in class. And even that other guy down the street, what's his name? Tyrone? Well uh, Tyrone's finally comin' up to the chalkboard. And you know, this is just, we've never seen this at all in our schools before and I just wanna say Mr. Peterson. You know, throughout the whole dopeness that you're bringin' and everythin', I mean, it's been a pleasure sir. It's been a real pleasure

Little niggas gettin' change like Clark Kent's
Little niggas on they Jane like Tarazan
Pop up like what's up like Martin
I've been bein' the boss

We are not the same but I'm not a Martian
I'm just richer and livin' my life bigger

Sip liquor with fine bitches
I enjoy livin', self employed livin'
Deploy women, let a d-boy hit it
No when a t boy get you
Can be the decoy like Leroy did it

[Interlude]
Everythin' is swavey, everythin' is swavey
Fuck around
I'm gon' take your lady, we gon' make a baby
I'm just jokin'

[Verse 2]
I'm just strokin' her back like lotion
I just opened the pack like Motrin
I dip slow in the back like Oakland
And tell a hoe, "Give me room" like Roslin
No excuse for the use of the potion
Nigga, we just out here tryna function
Gold grill, give a lil bitch cold chills
I don't really give a shit about a hoe still
But I will let her ride like a four wheel
'Cause she do eat a dick like oatmeal
Nigga got 2 L's like roshell
Told me make it wet and I lake her, O'Neal
And I'm so trill and your hoe feel
That I'm so real and she know well
No better, no cheddar mean no retta ski mask
And a gpad, said she got tryna hoe
Yo end up niggas hatin' on the way dope get up
'Til I get off beat, it's a ten on street
And I'm back on beat, yes I'm back on track
Yes, I'm back on feet on the one two like everybody on three
Payed ass nigga, the money elevatin'
That's hella swave ass, nigga
Make these jealous hatin' niggas want to way that trigga
What's funny is I know these niggas from way back, nigga
Like damn, niggas like wam
In a yellow Lam', shit look like scrambled eggs
Money as long as a tall bitch legs
Y'all niggas small as a small kids head b
Boss is a pussy and you all dickheads
She don't give a fuck 'bout a small dick head
She just want to fuck, make a quick bread
Better follow me, don't be mislead
And I'm hated on like I'm tryna get head
Eat a nigga dick like you tryna get fed
Your old favorite rapper just went dead
Okay, my guys to get you here
I can pray to God, forgive your sins
Ain't no wastin' time, I'm gettin' those inns
Like a hotel, hoes know well that I'm so well
Like 4's on the coat tail, white hoes in the motel
Roll well with the cigar
Fuck around right now motherfucker, I will make you see God

[Outro]
That's enough free shit for y'all niggas, man
By the way, my nigga Jae say fuck y'all niggas
Yeah, Canada, nigga
I got your bitches in my knapsack
I got your bitches in my knapsack
I said I got your bitches in my knapsack
Got your bitches in my knapsack
Sincerely Tory, March 26, nigga
Get a motherfuckin' hard copy
Buy my shit on iTunes, nigga

[Intro]
Okay, hold on, just let me uh, check my voice
Niggas, niggas, niggas
Okay, alright
And now, the feature presentation

[Chorus]
Stay schemin', niggas tryna fuck my bitch, my bitch, my bitch
Stay schemin', niggas tryna fuck my bitch, hey
But why you tryin', tryna fuck my bitch?
Tell me why you tryin', tryna fuck my bitch?
Leave her alone, don't fuck my bitch
But you stay schemin' on my shit

[Outro]
Alright, let's get back to the song
Aight then

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
Gold medals, them my role models
Rollin' old models lowered old schools, flowin' cold
And goin' gold follows
Flower bearin', call it petals to the floor
Power sharin', call it devils to the door
Power, power, 'til ain't no devils anymore
Flower-flowers, they be droppin' at the feet of my sun
Move a thousand miles per hour down the street of my slum
And who do I meet, to the beat of my drum?
It was little Susie Uzi, she sold crack and was a killer
All-bitch dope tip, wasn't trappin' with no niggas
Had a long money minor, do that action for them figures
Her influence fully automatic, crackin' off the Richter, yeah!
Walked up to my ride, asked me "Could she get inside?"
She pointed at her pistol so I properly replied
Told me, out here in the streets, she ain't have no competition
And with me up on them beats
Then we shared the same description
With a blunt between her lips, she said
"Now here's my proposition:
You just write a bunch of raps for me and I'ma go and spit 'em
Then we take 'em to the radio, the DJ better spin 'em
Then we take 'em to the record store
And sell a couple million," woo!

[Chorus: Gizzle & Lupe Fiasco]
I already got the money, already got the bitches
I see these other niggas, I'ma do it how they did it
From a trapper to a rapper, trapper to a rapper
We gotta gon' do it
Trapper to a rapper, now nigga, make it happen

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
Ugh, told me call up Soundtrakk, have him send a couple beats
Not that "Superstar" shit, she wanted somethin' for the streets
Said it might take like a month, she said, "It better take a week"
Gave my arm a little punch and then she pointed at her heat
Said, "I saw that thing the first time, you don't gotta do it twice
But I need a lil' more info on exactly what I write
Some details 'bout a female, 'bout your life and what you like"
She said, "My life is like a bitch, and I'm just like my life"
Then pow-pow-pow-pow-pow! Yeah, them niggas started bustin'
Like that boycott was over and that "we" had overcome it
She said, "Nigga, hit the gas," went from zero to a hundred
Now we runnin' from some killers, I was so sick to my stomach
She was hangin' out the window, with that thumper she was dumpin'
Had a look upon her face that made me think that she was cummin'
We was swervin', jumped the curb, and ditched the whip and started runnin'
Tried to jump over a wall, but it was a little tall
So we ducked behind a bush and that's how we got overlooked
I was shook and breathin' hard and she was sittin' there smokin' kush
Then we both started to glow, we looked around like, "What is this?"
And then we looked up and a light
Came down and pulled us to a ship like, "What the fuck?"

[Chorus: Gizzle]
I already got the money, already got the bitches
I see these other niggas, I'ma do it how they did it
From a trapper to a rapper, trapper to a rapper
Trapper to a rapper, now nigga, make it happen (Shit!)

[Verse 3: Gizzle]
Well, now, this the shit I'm talkin' 'bout, the shit that I've been on
Yeah, lightyears outer space, but still a bitch feel right at home
Now where the bitches? Get them intergalactic asses to clappin'
Break down some of that candy and roll it up in a wrapper for a rapper
Nah, I could never go back to trappin'
And who needs Atlanta when you're on Saturn gettin' a lap dance
With a lit match in your left hand and your right hand is a gas can
And at any given moment, I could burn this shit up
Why you standin' there just lookin', nigga? Turn that shit up
Hop in some of this alien pussy, let me know how it work
I'm just sayin', I'm gon' be there and I ain't in no rush
(Nah nigga!) Nah nigga, I ain't in no rush

[Verse 4: Lupe Fiasco]
Ayy, I thought you couldn't rap, when you learn how to do that?
Then what you need me for, if you already know how to flow?
Ayy, fuck that, we gotta go, we'ldn't be in this hoe
If you told me from the jump we wouldn't be on this UFO
But I think that I can fly us, stole a key so I can try it
Never thought that I would ever be a flyin' saucer pilot
But first thing's gon' be first, when we get back to that earth
I'ma go back to them raps and you can go back to that work, nigga

[Chorus: Gizzle & Lupe Fiasco]
I already got the money, already got the bitches
I see these other niggas, I'ma do it how they did it
Nigga we're goin' home, home!
From a trapper to a rapper, trapper to a rapper
Trapper to a rapper, now nigga, make it happen
You can kill me, I don't care—no!

[Outro: Gizzle & Lupe Fiasco]
Ayy, look, the basic thing is
You can do whatever you wanna do
Like I ain't 'bout to pass up on all this shit, you see this?
Like we time jumpin' and shit
You wanna go back and do what, just rap?
You can rap up here!
Yeah nigga, just rap
No, you can't, nigga, this is Space
You can't, fuck that, we goin' home
DROGAS!

[Intro: Lupe Fiasco]
Say these niggas ain't ridin' on low, oh
Push Benz through the bitch, ayy, and a nigga gotta go, oh
DROGAS, I need a trophy for this shit, dawg
I need a trophy for this shit

[Hook: Lupe Fiasco]
City of the year, city of the year, that's where I'm from
City of the year, city of the year, they don't want none
City of the year, city of the year, them hoes can't come
Go hard or go home, I'm turnt up in the 'Go zone
City of the year

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
Ayy, born in the middle of the West
Lil' nigga, livin' in the middle of death
Raised 'round killers, that's why little impress
I'm sorry white folks, if it sound I'm a little oppressed
And I'm sorry, my niggas, but I think you the best
You don't need no Khaled, 'cause that's on me, valid
Let me push my brother, we don't need no malice
Niggas raised in the projects, now they gon' need a palace
Niggas want JJ's, don't eat salads
Fourteen with a AK, and he'll let a nigga have it (raaah raaah)
Fireworks in K-Town, man it's so tragic
Fireworks on the lakefront, shit look like Magic

[Hook: Lupe Fiasco]
City of the year, city of the year, that's where I'm from
City of the year, city of the year, they don't want none
City of the year, city of the year, them hoes can't come
Go hard or go home, I'm turnt up in the 'Go zone
City of the year

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
My city look pretty in the summer
6th grade, moved out to the hundreds
Prolly wouldn't have made it hangin' 'round my mama's
Harvey World where I made my come-up
Bishop was a BD, Dope claimed Lord
Cliqued all up, put it all on CD
Neutron don, but I prolly been a GD
God knows best, so he put me where he need me
Puttin' truth in all these rhymes
State tried to shut a nigga down, gave my nigga Chilly all that time
People think it came out of nowhere, it's all by design
They took away the chiefs and the streets lost their minds

[Hook: Lupe Fiasco]
City of the year, city of the year, that's where I'm from
City of the year, city of the year, they don't want none
City of the year, city of the year, them hoes can't come
Go hard or go home, I'm turnt up in the 'Go zone
City of the year

[Interlude: RondoNumbaNine]
Turn up, let's get it
Turn up, life in the Windy City
Chiraq, Lupe, what up bro?
In the 'Go zone, in the 'Go zone

[Verse 3: RondoNumbaNine]
Go hard or go home, we turnt up (we turnt up)
I'm from Chiraq
When we come around, we rush stuff (we rush stuff)
I gotta keep that
Cause when I come around, they act tough (they act tough)
Chi Lupe, I'm so hard, I'm burnt up
City of the year, that's my shit, I'm ridin' 'round in traffic
Cdai, he got the mop stick, ain't shit change, I ain't quit
Ain't shit change, I ain't switch, I'm just smart, tryna get rich
I'm so high, you in a ditch, I'ma get mine, Money Makin' Mitch
You talkin' shit, you don't exist, I can leave you lost in the mist
I'm Rondo, real as it gets, either with me or you against

[Hook: Lupe Fiasco]
City of the year, city of the year, that's where I'm from
City of the year, city of the year, they don't want none
City of the year, city of the year, them hoes can't come
Go hard or go home, I'm turnt up in the 'Go zone
City of the year

[Intro: Tory Lanez]
SLS 'til the death
Warner Brother forever
And shout out to Kids
Trill girl Camillo

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
I ride for my niggas, dawg
I ride for my niggas
.45 on my niggas, sold
.45 on my niggas
Stay schemin', niggas tryna fuck my bitch

[Verse 1: Tory Lanez]
Damn, life so long
Fuck her, she ain't wanna hit the bong
Fuck it, I got bunches for the next bitch
Drip drippin' on the dick like it's Nesquik
I had your bitch doin' somersaults
All my motherfuckin' life, I been an underdog
All my motherfuckin' life, I been an underdog
All my motherfuckin' life, I been an underdog
All my, all my, all my-my-my
All my motherfuckin' life, I been an underdog
That's why I gotta stack this paper 'fore the summer, dawg
Big dick on your chick tit like a underbra
Vegas with my top hoe, drop top with the top
Chop plates, slop slow, tell a hater lock load
He can keep grillin' 'cause them killers on the top floor
Tatted like a botso
It's one tequila, two tequila, three tequila, floor her, baby, this is shot four
Got this bitch jumpin' like I'm standin' on the hop floor
Spittin' like a snot nose, sneeze on the drop rose
Niggas lookin' hungry and the cheese like a pot roast
Young niggas with the shit
Got these niggas pissy that this young nigga gettin' it
I keep tryin' ball out, keep sharin' bitches
'Cause with bitches, niggas fall out
Been a situation, that niggas had to crawl out
Niggas talkin' tougher when you seein' them stall out
Phoney ass hoe tryna ball out
Shit, I can say that they inspire me
But for what they are, not these niggas that they tryna be
I love life, nigga
Bandana tie like thug life, nigga
Murder on the track just because, my nigga
Then I kill that shit, that's enough life, nigga

[Interlude: Tory Lanez]
Ladies and gentlemen, I did my little thing but it's not about me right now. It's about my older brother in this motherfucker,  Sos Couture. So give it up for the man I'm about to let out of the motherfuckin' cage and let's get nasty

[Verse 2: Sos Couture]
I had the block doin' backflips
Make crack flip and hallways that smelled like cat piss
Pass packs to bad kids who had dreams
Of pushin' fast whips that would attract fast checks
I hustle, hustle so suffer from havin' to watch shit
Cold nights consisted of frost bitten fingers and cracked lips
Weekends in Hawaii and I spend it all at Saaks 5th
Didn't save for dimes 'cause at the time to see my lacked sense
Though I could account for everywhere that them packs went
I wasn't tryna rap sickles, I was tryna wrap bricks
3 Os in one night, called that the hat trick
3 hoes in one night, called that the hat trick
Model my stories if I told you my story
My guts and glory, that have you flabbergasted
Take a long puff of the pushin' pinger and pass it
Tryna live life to the fullest, tryna pass on the casket
8 balls served, no ragged
Cops on my ass tryna break up my rackin'
Ratchet 'cause I hit the block, harder than a crackin'
Soldiers got to crack, right up and they crackin'
And make it all disappear in 10 minutes, that's magic
But the destruction of a young mom, that's tragic
But it all depends on whoever you askin'
The school teacher or the fiend in the street scratchin'
Thankin' my nigga Fresh, kicks plus 10
Fresh my nigga, I hate to, hate to be him
Bitch, you wasn't with my shittin' in the bed
Bitch, you wasn't with my shittin' in the bed
Gettin' hard up in the boulevard and even harder in the jail cell
Prosecution, lies and judge deny his bail
But my mind gets stronger as the time sells
Like they gave me time to realise where my crime fell
But a man to help, tryna sleep in the belly of the beast
Where I need me a seroquel
But even lookin' in the mirror kills
Shit, at times I give myself the chills, watchin' as the anger builds
But don't rush, I got my back to build
And my shoes laced, in the place where the wolves prey
Yeah, yeah

[Outro: Tory Lanez & Sos Couture]
Yo man, leave it, lemme talk, lemme talk my shit, man. Give me a second. Y'all niggas, y'all niggas stay schemin', man. Y'all niggas stay plottin' on the real ones. Persons told you to motherfuckin' manage it. Somebody should have popped you right in the mouth the first time you put your hands in the cookie jar. Say I got the rhythm. One Umbrella. Canada. Sincerely Tory, March 26, my nigga. You already know what it is, it's Fres, don't make me put that in the end. Canada, Canada

[Verse 1]
How do I tell you to when it's just all a lie?
I don't even need you now, feel like I'm living to stay

[Pre-Chorus]
When we get closer, I love you
But when it's all over, don't love ya no more
I say fuck it's, it's fucked up
No baby, it's all fucked up
Don't even need to have to say go
Get your highs and your leather, take off
'Cause I just wanna take you there, baby
Let me take you there

[Chorus]
Sextasy, you next to me
Love me down, I love the sound

[Verse 2]
You don't know what I can do with your body
You don't know just how I feel when you're naughty

[Pre-Chorus]
When we get closer, I love you
But when it's all over, don't love ya no more
I say fuck it's, it's fucked up
No baby, it's all fucked up
Don't even need to have to say go
Get your highs and your leather, take off
You just wanna touch
Touch me, babe

[Chorus]
Sextasy, you next to me
Love me down, I love the sound
Sextasy, you next to me
Love me down, I love the sound

[Intro]
We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard

[Verse 1]
Y'all niggas done heard about this right?
But you ain't never heard it sound this good
I'm straight, the whip good, the liq good
It's just hood
Same niggas yellin' out, "Fuck me"
Are probably mad 'cause they bitch would
A nigga hold that spot, you can blow my cock
Like the mother fuckin' tip good
Tip trill. shit real
You can get it on for the day right
Yeah, she'll get it on if the pay right
Yeah, she'll put it all in the face like
Like blood to a great white
Like a thug on a late night
Like the snub to the face of a chum
Gettin' mugged by a thug in the daylight
I'll be on the road to the fly shit
So we don't have time for the games
And all these hoes on my dick
Really tryna ride for the fame
So what we gon' to do Jay?
Should we let 'em ride? Let 'em hang?
Hell naw, nigga F them hoes
Shit we got plenty more, we can let them go

[Chorus]
Ain't gotta believe in me if you don't
You can think whatever you want
You can doubt it, I'm about it
You'll see soon, you'll see soon
I swear I'm headed to the moon
I got these people goin' dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb
Fuckin' stupidio
Oh yes they go dumb, they go dumb, they go dumb, they go dumb
It's fuckin' stupido, dumb

[Verse 2]
One way trip to the moon, aw nigga, don't trill
'Cause house and the whip coming too, aw nigga, don't flail
'Cause we already did that, we done left here and we been back
And the best here, we done been that and shit, y'all know what it is
So why y'all play like it ain't? Play like it ain't?
Nigga I ain't sayin' what it ain't
But I know you think it's lies from the cars you drive t
To the money you claim in the bank
Yeah, motherfucker
Bet on the stand, I'm the man, motherfucker
Roll with some niggas that'll blam on suckas
Beach house, put you in the sand motherfucker
'Cause I'm stayin' on top, like tans on niggas
See I am what I am, a nigga, damn on a man
And I need a outta state chick with some fake tits, nigga, Pamala Anne
Are you still on my dick? Damn nigga, scram
Y'll niggas can't hang with an ape, I don't care y'all say, I'll damage your man

[Chorus]
Ain't gotta believe in me if you don't
You can think whatever you want
You can doubt it, I'm about it
You'll see soon, you'll see soon
I swear I'm headed to the moon
I got these people goin' dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb
Fuckin' stupidio
Oh yes they go dumb, they go dumb, they go dumb, they go dumb
It's fuckin' stupido, dumb

[Outro]
So young, lil nigga go dumb
So young, lil nigga go dumb
So young, that lil nigga go dumb
So young, don't make the nigga go dumb
So young, don't make the nigga go dumb
So young, y'all make a nigga go dumb
So young, don't make the nigga go dumb
So young, y'all make a nigga go dumb
So young, don't make the nigga go dumb
So young, y'all make a nigga go dumb
So young, don't make the nigga go dumb
So young, lil nigga go dumb

[Intro]
The house is unusually quiet this evening

[Chorus]
Looking around, and you're no where to be found
Searching high and low, I feel like my eyes go
Anywhere the wind blows
Am I too late to show up?
Oh, yeah yeah yeah yeah
No, my
Stole my heart
Stole my heart, heart

[Verse]
And this is the part where you think you found her but really you never found her
You found out you didn't need her, instead of lovin', you leave her
And wound up cuffin' some 22 year old whose name is Lisa
And found out Lisa don't need you but keep you just for the reason
She couldn't get over Paul who's 20 studyin' law
And gettin; that major paper and pushin' the latest Range
And lately you made a change 'bout how you claimin' your dame
You found out Lisa ain't it and you want that love to remain
But who you came into shit with but fuck it you such a nimwit
You loved her she fuckin' missed it, you lied she upd and listened
Goodbye as you uppedd and kissed him, she tried but you upped and dissed her
So why is the fuckin' question and why is you fuckin' stressin?
You need it back, but she disagree with that
See while you was cheatin', chasin', yeah she was out rereplacin'
Findin' another lover that someone won't keep her waitin'
So she got on the ball, and met this nigga named Paul, who Lisa chasin'

[Chorus]
Oh, yeah yeah yeah yeah
No, my
Stole my heart
Stole my heart, heart
Looking around, and you're no where to be found
Searching high and low, I feel like my eyes go
Anywhere the wind blows
Am I too late to show up?

[Intro]
And now, the Energy Blues

[Verse 1]
Energy
Sometimes I think I'm runnin' out of energy
Seems like we use an awful lot for
Heatin' and lightin' and drivin'
Readin' and writin' and jivin'
Energy, you'd think we'd be savin' it up

[Verse 2]
Energy, you can get it by dammin' up a river
Energy, a windmill can make the breeze deliver
But even with millin' and dammin'
Our needs are so much more demanding
Energy, we have to use some kind of fuel

[Verse 3]
Chop, chop, chop, the cavemen used wood to start their fires
Chop, chop, chop, they made all the tools that they required
Chop, chop, chop, inventions got more and more inspired
The fires got higher and higher
And clearings got wider and wider
Energy, they were burnin' 'bout all their wood up

[Verse 4]
Then one day men discovered that coal would do it better
Miners dug, and it looked like it might just last forever
It seemed like the final solution
It started an Industrial Revolution
Energy, we just keep on diggin' it up

[Bridge]
In 1859, way out in western Pennsylvania
A man had built a rig that got some laughs from folks who came there
But then suddenly, a mighty roar came up from the ground
And soon a gusher gushed and soaked all who stood around
Now no-one knew, who that gusher blew
The petroleum years were on us
And that so many cars and trucks would come to cause a crisis
And then!?

[Verse 5]
Energy, we're looking to try and find some new kind of
Energy , exploring to try and make a new find of
Nuclear and thermal and solar
If we miss we'll get colder and colder
Energy, we've gotta stop usin' you up

[Verse 6]
So don't be cross when momma says turn that extra light out
Just turn it off till we find us a fuel that never runs out
If everyone tries a bit harder
Our fuel will go farther and farther
Energy, we're gonna be stretchin' you out

[Intro]
Oh yeah yeah yeah
Yeah, oh yeah yeah yeah
Yeah, oh yeah
Oh yeah yeah yeah

[Verse 1]
I can't believe it I did it all to get it and livin' and riskin' it all to live it all
For suckers that shitted on me and bitches that didn't call
And niggas that doubted, hated, plotted my town fall but never got it
I made it, I'm watchin' they frown fall
Ain't no better feelin', nigga, sayin' you better kill it
The last nigga that got it done did it big
And you could potentially do it bigger
Eventually to the figures that move you in the position here enemies shoot to kill you
I am livin' fast and I have notice time is an essence
And I'm thankin' God in a clock, I noticed time is a blessin'
And bitches just like the feds, cuffin', try and arrest them
My luck was on this dummy while on this ride to progression
I'm barely focused on jewelry, fuck it diamonds' a stresser
I want you to love me for me and I was shinin' on my chest
So I do livin' while enjoyin' the finer things
I owe the shit outta y'all for givin' me fucking wings, thank you

[Chorus]
How does it feel now? The rain is calmin' after the row
How does it feel now? The rain is calmin' after the row

[Verse 2]
And I owe this shit all to Shawn for showin' me all the wrongs
He told me I have a chance, I told him, "It's fuckin' on"
He knew my verses was wild, he sat and nurtured my style
He always would have these discussions, I sat and I heard him mad
He said, "Don't get caught up with women, don't be concerned with a child
They vividly ain't the catcher, this industry it ain't with you
The niggas you callin' friends is the niggas that play to get you
And always stay on your grind if it's dollar signs that you picture and shit
Remember your sound and remember who found you
And when you blow, just remember who was never around you
All them niggas that clowned you and the bitches that downed you
When you doin' something they go and go and look at you or somethin'
But all they do is frontin', so fuck them, to you, they nothin'
See that you knew they stuntin', they act like you new or somethin'"
So livin' good and enjoyin' the flyer things
I owe this shit all to Shawn for giving me fuckin' wings, my nigga

[Chorus]
How does it feel now? The rain is calmin' after the row
How does it feel now? The rain is calmin' after the row

[Verse 3]
I be like hell, ain't no way is not over
My memory takin' me back to that day in October
Me and my brother Jay was sittin' right there on that corner
Our faces was full of tears, just waitin' to blow up
All our niggas was job stuntin', we shoulda been job huntin'
But fuck it we was some drop outs, ready to rob somethin'
And I'm livin' in sin, I'm a shawty nigga
Jay helped me settle down, always got me, my nigga
Was live in broken homes, took me from open homes
His mother let me live inside her house with open arms
Cold as December night, shit, you remember right?
We stayed up late, just fantasizin' 'bout that lemon life
Now that I got it, you need it, I'm fuckin' 'bout it
I see it and everywhere we gon' be there nigga, I'm promisin'
Livin' good, enjoyin' the finer things
I owe this shit all to you for givin me fuckin' wings, my nigga

[Chorus]
How does it feel now? The rain is calmin' after the row
How does it feel now? The rain is calmin' after the row
How does it feel now? The rain is calmin' after the row
How does it feel now? The rain is calmin' after the row
How does it feel now? The rain is calmin' after the row

[Chorus]
Let's leave the past behind the master mind of love
Try to enjoy the moments I won't get again
After graduation, when time goes past, remember me for long
Where do our high school memories go?
Where do our high school memories go?
Where do they go?
You know what I'm sayin'
She comin' down real clean on 'em shit

[Verse 1]
Memories are just wrong, me and my niggas holdin'
Smokin' loud in the parkin' lot, tryna chap teens and enroll
Little niggas just gettin' it, pool party we dip in it
17 and I'm extra leanin' and no model chick stand next to me
I'm in there, swimmin' wear 'til the lights out and it's dim next
My niggas sayin it's fuck that, I hit the jam and take bus back
Nigga, 9th grade was all that, skippin' class with no hall pass
I had a crush on lil Kiki but that damn girl ain't never call back
And we so young
You and I get higher then a fuckin' tube sock
We hit the west to 2Pac
And I wish I can get this fuckin' pictures in 'cause they gone

[Chorus]
Let's leave the past behind the master mind of love
Try to enjoy the moments I won't get again
After graduation, when time goes past, remember me for long
Where do our high school memories go?
Where do our high school memories go?
Where do they go?
This that SLS nigga
Swavey

[Verse 2]
I remember tellin' Keisha put that ass on the floor
Lil nigga rolling', whip stolen, hands on my dope
I'm gettin' this cash, tonight I'm gon' smash
Fuck waitin', debatin' where we gon' end up when it pass
We up in the lot, some comin' down
Losin' you when you lyin', tune to Tuesday, you buyin'
Star nigga O'Brian, bad bitches on my end
Two 50 for the bus fare, I'm fresh as swave so it's fuck yeah
Don't take that shit, don't talk shit, I hit the movie don't watch the shit
And that's young niggas we on loud
Baggin' chicks and smack a nigga, calm down
Now niggas causin' troubles all now
'Cause this the movie, sip the jam, let me know if you down

[Chorus]
Let's leave the past behind the master mind of love
Try to enjoy the moments I won't get again
After graduation, when time goes past, remember me for long
Where do our high school memories go?
Where do our high school memories go?
Where do they go?

[Bridge]
Wait this here, this for the city, this for the city of a thousand dreams
This for the city, this for the city of a thousand dreams

[Chorus]
Let's leave the past behind the master mind of love
Try to enjoy the moments I won't get again
After graduation, when time goes past, remember me for long
Where do our high school memories go?
Where do our high school memories go?
Where do they go?

[Intro]
Yeah, Carolina High, shit blows
Carolina High, shit blows

[Verse]
Somebody told me the women I used to fuck with tried they luck with all my past niggas
I figured they no Cinderellas with no glass slippers
They only fall for big money ballers and cash getters
Just like the women I used to love in my past letters
We claimin' fuck 'em but them niggas love 'em
That's why when winter come around, you find them niggas cuffin'
That's why when women come around, you find them niggas bluffin'
That fly nigga come around, you find your chick is nothin'
'Cause see, women attracted to them niggas with status
And we niggas attracted to these bitches with ass and tits
Chanel bags with some fashion tips
To keep 'em sexy round they ass and hips
Shit, I heard Aneesa got a baby now
I heard Alisha got a lady now
I heard them streets done got crazy wild
I heard my nigga black car caught a motherfuckin' crack charge
And he in the pen servin' 80 now
Wow, shit got real after high school
Remember Kelly was so friendly back in night school
'Til she moved with this nigga named Ty
Got her high, now that bitch is movin' colder than an ice cube
I know minimum wage will kill ya
And trust me, I ain't got to work minimum wage to fell ya
'Cause when he out the cellar, for wish without he sellin'
Is court cases is spillin', he tryna pay for appealin'
And still, they label him villian and still that cable need electricity
Bills up to the ceilin', he can surely make a deal if fuck
If you don't feel him, I don't know about you
Emergin' all you bad girls, take that whore 'bout ya
They love when niggas low 'cause he ain't thinkin' all about ya
And don't be strippin' 'cause a nigga need some dough up out ya
That shit is crazy and it always made me wonder why
You made 200 dollars, give that man 105
I see your face could see your place, you need to come and find
Baby, you are a human, you ain't no wonder line
And way too smart to be undermined for a fuckin' dime
And for some sense up in your brain, I think it's fuckin' time
See these Carolina blues is what marijuana do
Lot of women gotta lie to niggas that they lyin' to
And because of this, it make it harder to define true
And because of this, it make it harder to define you
And I'm always talkin' 'bout some women that I should have got
And always talkin' 'bout some pussy that I should have popped
And always talkin' 'bout some pussy that I should have shot
And when I see that lil motherfucker, nigga watch
In all reality, I'm probably gon' see him on a day that I don't want it
Fuckin' leave him but really this shit is crazy
And maybe, I might just leak him
But whatever I choose to do and you just better believe him, nigga, Carolina high

[Outro]
If you don't feel me, I don't know
I don't know

[Intro]
Um, what up? It's your boy, it's your bad ol' Tory Lanez, man. And um, I figured a tape wouldn't be right without one of these so. You know how we gon' do it. Sunny on the boys, me on the beat. You know I'ma create some crazy shit like them doowop boys and corner boys back in the day. Let's go

[Verse]
This a story 'bout this girl, her name is Lori
And she livin' right down the street
Ooh baby, with the high school range
Walkin' down 7th street
And you know what they say
'Bout a girl in here is perfect for me
But I'm young and I got high school dreams
Of bein' your dancin' king
Now this story just a little bit different
'Cause Lori 'bout 23
And it's sad that I wanna get a little hot
'Cause I'm only like 17
Girl, I don't wanna wait
Forever for your love
Not another day
So tell me, are you down?
Are you down?
So baby, are you down?
So tell me, are you down?

[Outro]
So you know, I walked into her now. That's pretty much what I told her. She just busted out and just said, "And you know and you know and you know." I'm not, nah she good. Alright, that's that um. She did them ones or twos, man on the microphone on and um, I'm outta here and you know like. You know you
Don't speak it, you don't speak what you don't know. Shoutout all my SLS niggas, we outta here. All my corner boys comin' with me, we outta here. Move back off your shit, my nigga

[Verse]
Kid 1: If I had me a million dollars, I get me a Porsche 959
Kid 2: I get me a sports car like a Jaguar
Kid 3: Damn, I get me a Ferrari Testarossa with V12 engine. Get me a Porsche 930, straight 6 turbo engine. Get me a Vector B12, twin turbo. Go from 0 to 60 in 7.8 seconds. So don't even talk
Kid 4: Yeah but who cares 'cause you ain't never gon' have a million dollars anyway
Kid 3: I will to
Kid 4: Who's trippin' now?
Kid 3: Ain't nobody trippin'. I'm gon' have it. Someday, I'm gon' have it

[Verse 2: Shake]
Hey.... today..... made 2k today
Super done, fill it up
Say your prayers, tell'em stuff
Got the cup, this is tough
Let it go, that's enough
Welcomed to the streets
We wasn't welcomed in our own homes
We ain't got the juice, so we sippin' on Patroooon
We been up for three days, fill a cup with your pain
Now we goin' crazy, now this LIFE amazing
Now I don't wanna raise it, now we makin' waves man
Now we makin' waves man
Now we makin' waves man!

Oh baby now you speakin turnin' tables
I'll catch you on the weekend if I'm Abel
Oh baby now you speakin turnin' tables
I'll catch you on the weekend if I'm Abel

To the other side, to the other side
How many times?
To the other side, to the other side
How many times?
How many tries is it gon take
Until you see that I won't break
I feel lifted for the summer
Let me be for heaven sake
If you come around again
I have to say it loud again
You must love the sound of it
You must love the sound of it
If you come around again
I have to say it loud again
You must love the sound of it
You must love the sound of it
If you come around again
I have to say it loud again
You must love the sound of it

Moma said "School called"
I wasn't showin'
Sorry momma they don't let me speak my mind
I'm a poet

This is for the kids and you know it
TOAST! TOAST! TOAST! TOAST! TOAST!
Now we toastinnnnnn'
TOAST! TOAST! TOAST!
Now we toastinnnnnn'

[Verse 1]
Take my love aside
Talking of my appreciation, babe
Touch me, feel me on you
Half of me, know we can't play no games

[Pre-Chorus]
Love in the bedroom
Feeling I'm addicted to it
Knocking the headboard
Baby, I'm addicted to it

[Chorus]
I wanna make love to you daily
We can do our thing 'til the sun comes up
Baby, if this love was a symphony
If love was a symphony
Then we'd be the high notes
Yeah, raising the high notes
Raising the high notes

[Verse 2]
Take my confidence in
Make it bigger 'cause girl, I need you
Give me necessary
All the things to, all this love, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
Love in the bedroom
Feeling I'm addicted to it
Knocking the headboard
Your my gun and I'ma pull the trigger just to show it

[Chorus]
I wanna make love to you daily
We can do our thing 'til the sun comes up
Baby, if this love was a symphony
If love was a symphony
Then we'd be the high notes
Yeah, raising the high notes
Raising the high notes

[Outro]
Take me away from it
Pretty little symphony
Pretty little symphony

[Intro]
I'm leanin'
You don't even know

[Chorus]
I'm leanin'
Rollin', zonin'
Tell me you don't mean it
You don't mean it, you don't mean it
Sippin' on somethin' strong
And you don't wanna even know
Sippin' on somethin' strong
When I got nothin' to lean up on
Sippin' on somethin' strong

[Verse]
I'm paint fallin', my place stalln'
They in the whip, they hatin' on me
They say they love me, they snakin' on me
They outside, they waitin' on me
Aw yeah, I'm ready
Smokin' up and I'm steady smokin'
They holdin' down on it, posed to hold me up
Ballin' niggas so heavy
And I'm ridin' clean, hoes outta me
But they tell the truth to them niggas
Fuck y'all, I'm 'bout to fuck y'all
I'm glidin' through with my niggas
I got cash to fuck
With a ass like that, I have to fuck
Oh oh, now let me come down, ooh, I'm dippin'
We takin' shots tonight, Scotty Pippen
It's this bitch, call me Pippen in this bitch, yeah

[Chorus]
I'm leanin'
Rollin', zonin'
Tell me you don't mean it
You don't mean it, you don't mean it
Sippin' on somethin' strong
And you don't wanna even know
Sippin' on somethin' strong
When I got nothin' to lean up on
Sippin' on somethin' strong

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Cold enough to chill my bones
It feels like I don't know you anymore
I don't understand why you're so cold to me
With every breath you breathe
I see there's something going on
I don't understand why you're so cold

[Verse 1: Adam Levine]
Are we taking time or a time out?
I can't take the in-between
Asking me for space here in my house
You know how to fuck with me
Acting like we're not together
After everything that we've been through
Sleeping up under the covers
How am I so far away from you?

[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]
Distant, when we're kissing
Feel so different
Baby, tell me how did you get so

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Cold enough to chill my bones
It feels like I don't know you anymore
I don't understand why you're so cold to me
With every breath you breathe
I see there's something going on
I don't understand why you're so cold, yeah

[Post-Chorus: Adam Levine]
Whoa, yeah
Whoa, yeah
I don't understand why you're so cold

[Verse 2: Adam Levine]
What you holdin' on, holdin' on for?
If you wanna leave, just leave
Why you wanna bite your tongue for?
The silence is killing me
Acting like we're not together
If you don't want this, then what's the use?
Sleeping up under the covers
How am I so far away from you?

[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine & John Ryan]
Distant (Oh), when we're kissing (Yeah)
Feel so different (Yeah)
Baby tell me how did you get so

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Cold enough to chill my bones
It feels like I don't know you anymore
I don't understand why you're so cold to me
With every breath you breathe
I see there's something going on
I don't understand why you're so cold, yeah

[Post-Chorus: Adam Levine & Future]
Whoa, yeah
Whoa, yeah
I don't understand why you're so cold, yeah
So tough, it’s a cold world
Whoa, yeah
So tough, it’s a cold world
Whoa, yeah
So tough, it’s a cold world
I don't understand why you're so cold

[Verse 3: Future & Adam Levine]
Never thought that you were like this
I took the tag off, and made you priceless
I just spent half a mil' on a chandelier
Now you tryna cut me off like a light switch, yeah
Tryna stay in our league
Saying that you need some time to breathe
Thinking that I'm sleeping on the four-letter word
But the four-letter word don't sleep
We goin' two separate ways
You ain't been actin' the same
You gotta go, girl, where your heart used to be
You gold-dig every day
I switched the four-door to the two-door
'Cause I can't let my driver hear what you say
Girl, I tried to give you space
Baby, tell me how did you get so cold

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Cold enough to chill my bones
It feels like I don't know you anymore
I don't understand why you're so cold to me
With every breath you breathe
I see there's something going on
I don't understand why you're so cold

[Post-Chorus: Adam Levine & Future]
So tough, it’s a cold world
Whoa, yeah
So tough, it’s a cold world
Whoa, yeah
So tough, it’s a cold world
I don't understand why you're so cold, yeah
So tough, it’s a cold world
Whoa, yeah
So tough, it’s a cold world
Whoa, yeah
So tough, it’s a cold world
I don't understand why you're so cold

[Intro]
It's the Far East Movement keeping it stupid
Damn it feels good when the beat got you grooving
The Far East Movement keeping it stupid
Daymn it feels good when the beat got you grooving

[Hook]
Damn it feels good (whatcha say now)
Damn it feels good (come on people are ya with me)
Damn it feels good, damn it feels good, damn it feels good

(whatcha say, whatcha say, whatcha say now)

[Verse 1: Kev Nish]
To do what?
Move something, loose something
Damn it feels good when the beat got you bumping
Like Saturday night fever
Grabbing the microphone like it was a fifth of tequila
So dance with your two left feet to the ceiling
We freak in the morning and freak in the evening
Smile like you mean it, you hot señorita
Yo DJ, the music is making me feel it

[Verse 2: J-Splif]
We breaking the sweat from all the grooving we be doing
Alarms catching up the vinyl till it gets ruined
When we be vibing our forces are colliding
Our music be refreshing like a big stick of trident
Call me Johnny Cochran 'cause we set ourselfves free
And make ya'll feel good like James Brown on ecstasy
Whatever it takes to bring a spot, we about to bring it
Having you dance like hooligans to our brand of music

[Hook]
Damn it feels good (you know it feels good)
Damn it feels good (all you people are you with me)
Damn it feels good (that's right)
Damn it feels good, damn it feels good, damn it feels good

Damn it feels good (come on, ya'll have a good time)
Damn it feels good (a little louder)
Damn it feels good, damn it feels good, damn it feels good
(whatcha say, whatcha say, whatcha say now)

[Verse 3: Prohgress]
It feels good when I'm being me
Girl, like I'd buy you a drink
I get mines for free
You like to brag like you getting ahead
I block it out 'cause I think about me getting some head
That's how my mind works when I be scheming
I'm calling you Poseidon you swallowing seamen
Take you to my room and you talking while you giving me dome
You gotta keep on low, like yo' parents are home

[Verse 4: Kev Nish]
On tour with me and my fam (FM)
Hear the radio playing our jam (Oh yeah)
All the people being real feel good to me
Like a 100 degrees with air conditioning
With no condition we share the same prescription
Vision of love, happiness and good living
Give thats to your neighbor put your hands in the air
If it feels damn good let me hear you say yeah

[Hook]
It's the Far East Movement keeping it stupid
Damn it feels good when the beat got you grooving
The Far East Movement keeping it stupid
Daymn it feels good when the beat got you grooving

[Hook]
Damn it feels good (a little louder)
Damn it feels good (come on people are ya with me)
Damn it feels good, damn it feels good, damn it feels good
(whatcha say, whatcha say, whatcha say now)

[Verse 5: J-Splif]
Damn it feels good when I finally get that number
From that chick you been sweating all summer
Tonights the night, she go 'n gave you a chance
Tie your game face tight, executing your plans
Check into a room, with nothing to do
Pick another best way for you to disprove
You two under tube, go set up the mood
While I move to the beat and tap on the grooves
It's the F-A-R E-A-S-T- M-O-V-E-M-E-N-T

[Verse 6: Prohgress]
I got the day off and it's time for partying
And I ain't getting up at 6 in the morning
We go 'n dress how we want, we go 'n drink what we want
After the club it's on, yo where the weed at
That's how we do it, I know you feel the music
So bounce to the sounds of the Far East Movement

Damn it feels good (ya know it feels good)
Damn it feels good (what whatcha say now)
Damn it feels good, damn it feels good, damn it feels good
(whattcha say, whattcha say, whattcha say now)
Damn it feels good (uh huh)
Damn it feels good (it's the movement)
Damn it feels good, damn it feels good, damn it feels good

I got a mic in my hand with something to say
Everyday represent Californ-I-A
Sit back take a trip down memory lane
Take me away down memory lane
I got a mic in my hand with something to say
Everyday represent Californ-I-A
Sit back take a trip down memory lane

[Verse 1: Prohgress & J-Splif]
We was young then
Back when we couldn't get a pack of cigarettes
Back when we couldn't say that a brother changes
Back when every day was another day
Breaking rules, skipping school when we getting high
Chilling back in the caravan spitting rhymes
On the block 5-0 try to chase me
We bone out freestyle onto the main speed
We are the one now we having fun
Each pound on the ten and we practicing
To the double 1-0 we ain't seen no
With some mean hoes blowing halloween smoke
At the hotel room where we popping beers
Like another 1-2 'cause our homie's here
And our cousin Kev Nish from the C-Town
Last piece of the puzzle we complete now

[Hook]
I got a mic in my hand with something to say
Everyday represent Californ-I-A
Sit back take a trip down memory lane
Take me away down memory lane
I got a mic in my hand with something to say
Everyday represent Californ-I-A
Sit back take a trip down memory lane

[Verse 2: Kev Nish]
North California dreaming
In the city of rain, got a brother scheming
On my way to a school, high five with the sunshine state
Save a few tips parking cars, valet
Writing rhymes in my five star
One way, highway, L.A. with my life in a car
Bumping California love with my homie by the glove
Turn the radio down dog
Here we are
I must have woke up late
All my friends graduated and I still ain't changed
Every sun that sets in the west is a breath of my chest
And there ain't much left

The west gots flavor, congratulations
This was for the west, so now try and see
The west gots flavor, congratulations
This was for the west

This was for the west
Everyday represent Californ-I-A

[Verse 3: All]
Don't forget how this love started
We was in it all the way, never half hearted
Breaking rules, skipping school, but we getting wise
Dollar signs ain't the reason that we getting signed
But the dollar signs keep alive family ties
I got a back pain digging 

[?] you and I
On the grind see the stars bright lights
Ain't nothing changed
Move east around the world till we're back in L.A
Backstage elevate, rolling a J
Zone out, concentrate, stretching my legs
Freestyle, meditate, uh, nothing to say
As the lights go off play the beat DJ
Now raise your hands from side to side
Far East Movement in the house tonight
Kick old school rhymes for you to feel
Put your hands in the air if you keeps it real

[Hook]
I got a mic in my hand with something to say

Get (what) go (what) hands (what) up (what)
Freeze, everybody move east

[Verse 1: J-Splif]
All aboard the FM express
We reach every city to the right of the west
Validate your passport and join the ride
Keep your mind state free, leave your trouble behind
We in a state of nirvana with no Cobain
And we blazing marijuana, but no cocaine
Come and take the journey with 3 MCs
We working hard, spread the love and move east

[Verse 2: Kev Nish]
Live line by line, work 9 to 9
And Imma stuggle for my peeps
Trying to live through eyes
So pops, I'm about to make you proud
So you can tell all your friends what the fuss about
Catch the extra ordinary kid on the corner
The neighborhood, next door kid from California
To make you change with a pocket full of quarters
FM greet that hit to make ya wanna move east

[Hook]
Rock that beat, stomp your feet
We won't stop 'till the club move east
Get (what) go (what) hands (what) up (what)

[Verse 3: Prohgress]
We step up in the club and it's mayham
Got yourself some hands, better raise 'em
You holding on a drink, gotta pound it
Hear the beat, crank it loud as the sound gets
It's the movement, kicking up another notch
At the spot, iPod, on the parking lot
If you smoke weed, drag on Bruce Lee
Puff puff pass, we keep move east

[Verse 4: J-Splif]
To my party people in the place to be
Reach for the ozone and stomp on your nikes
Let yourself go, sip on some cisco
Hope you get loose for them pollos getting loco
Ready for you player, do your thing
Collect to thoughts and brush the dirt off your game
With a little work you'll be pimpin' with ease
If the homes say no, ain't no

Stop it's time for revolution
Move east around the world like you right brain stupid
That's why Imma defy the eyes of evolution
If you think I can't do it, Imma keep on proving
Imma punk on a mission with a vision of soul
Kick for, for my skin to my bone marrow
It's a drive called fresh, right at the west
On a quest for Far East Movement

[Verse 6: Prohgress]
So take it in, brother digest it
We kicking knowledge, but we make it sound festive
Free, I don't fuck, jumping up the damn page
Let my lyrics loose and my sprits on a rampage
Damn is the weapon that I rectify the army
Punches from the pro, packing power like Ali
Throw like a butter knife, smooth for the beat
I'm a bad, bad man telling ya'll to move east

[Hook]
Rock that beat, stomp your feet
We won't stop 'till the club move east
Get (what) go (what) hands (what) up (what)
Freeze, everybody move east

[Verse 1]
3 A.M. and my neighbors hate me
Music blasting, shaking these walls
This time Mary Jane won't save me
I've been working later, I've been drinking stronger
I've been smoking deeper but the memories won't stop

[Chorus]
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't get high, I can't get by, I can't get through
I can't stop thinking 'bout you

[Musical Breakdown]
(You, You)
(You, You)

[Verse 2]
Like poison coursing through me
So clear my vision is blurred
The haze won't put my mind at ease
I've been sleeping later, I've been breathing stronger
I've been digging deeper but the memories won't stop

[Chorus]
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't get high, I can't get by, I can't get through
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
(I can't stop thinking 'bout youuuuu)
(You, You)
(You, You)
I can't stop thinking 'bout you

[Musical Breakdown]

[Bridge]
I want you all
Say it before you run out of time
I want you all
Say it before it's too late
I want you all
Say what I am feeling now
I want you all
Waiting is insane

[Chorus]
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't get high, I can't get by, I can't get through
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
(You, You)
(You, You)
I can't stop thinking 'bout you

[Intro: Lupe Fiasco]
And they say, and they say
And they say-ay-ay-ay, and they say

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
Uh, yeah, one time for the drama
Halcyon vibes got me feelin' like a llama
At peace with the beast in these streets
At least I think that I am
Meditate away the drama or I'ma just go bananas
Life's a beach but no Bahamas, I just wanna wear pajamas
Whole life I been fightin' on piranhas
With katanas inside of my hand
I just wanna lay down, play sounds for the coolout
And, fall asleep on the pool couch
And, wake up to the new wave
And, take a break from the schoolhouse
Yeah, I don't wanna hear about it
Wouldn't be in here without it, not true
I don't wanna be alone, I ain't leavin' you at home
What's bein' on your own without... you?

[Chorus: Jake Torrey]
Oh wow, you make me feel like a wild child
Oh wow, you make me feel like a wild child

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
Yeah, two times for the photo
Where the land, man, I don't know
Revolution to the bone door
Underground styles, shoulda came out of Stone's Throw
Yeah, for the good food and good times
Good moves, good friends and a good mind
Confident you'll compliment my consciousness
'Cause you were born under this sign
I just need a little peek
Little look in the book of important things
'Cause you can do, try to
Get loose without doin' a damn thing
Yeah, I don't wanna hear about it
Wouldn't be in here without it, not true
I don't wanna be alone, I ain't leavin' you at home
What's bein' in the zone without, you?

[Chorus: Jake Torrey]
Oh wow, you make me feel like a wild child
Oh wow, you make me feel like a wild child
I'm singin' it, oh wow, you make me feel like a wild child
Yeah, oh wow, you make me feel like a wild child

[Bridge: Jake Torrey]
In the backseat or the backyard
Feeling like we got no problems at all
I'm so happy when I'm with you, with you

[Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco]
Make me feel so free when I'm with you
When I'm with you
Make me feel so free when I'm with you
When I'm with you
Three times to be good to myself
Relax back, that's good for my health
So do not devise on my bae
I don't wanna be with nobody else
I ain't worried 'bout nothin'
I ain't heard about nothin'
I ain't workin' on nothin'
But my perfect lil' woman

[Chorus: Jake Torrey]
Oh wow, you make me feel like a wild child
Said oh wow, you make me feel like a wild child, like a wild child
I'm singin' now, oh wow, you make me feel like a wild child
Yeah, said oh wow, you make me feel like a wild child
Oooh wild

[Verse 1]
Blood rushin' to my head like cold
Players on my mind like Shake', plays on my mind like stage
Stays for a while like fades
Fades to the black like Jay's
Wavin' from behind like Ks
Made it from behind like AIDS
Made it to the map like Waze
Take it to the trap like maze
Can't take you back like trades
Bae shake it in my lap like Jackie Joyner-Kersee havin' seizures
Jesus, what's a nonbeliever to a preacher?
This ain't the kind of rap the opps and the thots like
Told 'Trakk put the bat back on the spotlight
Cartagena, serve snacks at the cockfight (realest)
Need new batteries for the Glock lights (realest)
Put the mix on the oil 'til it lock tight (realest)
Cause they gave it to all the young niggas
DROGAS dedicated to all the drug dealers
Find out how they all gon' come kill us
Try Containment Unit, the walls, they can't fit us
Who the Ghostbusters gon' call to come get us? And

[Chorus]
Ayy, over-D off of this
But baby don't die 'til the dopamine hit, yo
Ayy, this one ain't for Billbo'
You can stream the album on Silk Road
Drug rings for more dough
So they baggin' like Bilbo
Jackin' like Jill for a pill at the Hollywood Hills though
Fame is a drit-ug
I want my name all lit up
And leave out the world how I came in the clitter
Over-D off of this
But don't fall asleep 'til the dopamine hit, hey

[Post-Hook]

[Verse 2]
Big watch, big watch, you can see it
Lot of diamonds in the Cartier
'Less I'm thinkin' 'bout the money, I can't concentrate
Don't talk if you ain't ball enough to commentate, yeah
That's a Super Bowl every time I contemplate
Limited edition, bitches
I'm just livin' off the interest
I don't really care about niggas
Denzel, put the money in the blender
For the esés, shower posse with the SKs
For the haters that be hatin' on the Jefés
Half-naked hoes, they be dressin' just like X-rays
... Rated
All the way through, don't like nothin' plated
Simps think they got cool, I'm just stickin' to the basics

[Chorus]
This-this-this-this-this-this-this
This one ain't for Billbo'
You can stream the album on Silk Road
Drug rings for more dough
So they baggin' like Bilbo
Jackin' like Jill for a pill at the Hollywood Hills, though
Fame is a drit-ug
I want my name all lit up
And leave out the world how I came in the clitter
Over-D off of this

[Verse 1]
Honest, I'm crossin' my heart and I'm hopin' to die
I promise, I promise, and they don't know why
I promise, I promise, I don't be gettin' high

No champagne, no vodka, no, none of that, man

Just ask me a question, I'll give you the truth (yeah)
I got me a Benzy, it ain't got a roof
I'm smart but I'm poor, yeah, I'm smart but I'm poor (yeah)

[Chorus: SIMON SAYZ]
See this shit go 'round and 'round
Hope you get up to speed and you're alright
All I ever wanted was the dove view
And all the people elevated, stay high
High, elevated
All I wanna see my niggas sittin' on top
More than high, high, elevated
All I wanna see my niggas sittin' on top
High, more than high, high

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
It drops without
Then without doubt I'm without drought
How else could a spit out bout
Swat at bats, without outs?
Rain delay
What's that I came to say? Get it wet like Training Day
With no drain away, you with it yet, they ain't related
Lupe got him an H and K
And handle that Heckler, Kramer way
Rain delay
Aight, nigga, put the game away
You mean like rain delay?
She said, "If I pop it then you gotta pay me"
So I make it rain for the ladies
Off that, skin where mosquitoes can't walk at
Off course, we ball with hoes
In the club, I golf that
But ball back, games where it rains and they halt that
We gettin' cold, better salt that
In my brain, it is stormin'
When it rains, it is pourin'
Spit out 'bout, swat at bats
Commissioner Gordon, not a sportsman
Your reigns, not important
But I'm Jordan

[Chorus: SIMON SAYZ]
High, more than high, high
High, more than high, high
High, more than high, high
High, more than high, high
See this shit go 'round and 'round
Hope you get up to speed and you're alright
All I ever wanted was the dove view
And all the people elevated, stay high
High, elevated
All I wanna see my niggas sittin' on top
More than high, high, elevated
All I wanna see my niggas sittin' on top
High, more than high, high

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco & SIMON SAYZ]
Why I always gotta say it for you?
Why you be as quiet as a DP with an oral?
Why on TV it's adorable?
In 3D it be horrible
Somethin', somethin' stored you
It's like sayin', look, Duval too tall
Or the cue ball is too small
I make two fall in the pool hall
And my new car I carpool
You all finna carnival
Through balls, think about to fall
Get a new doll to my boo, aw
High, more than high, high
Sweet
High, more than high, high
Sweet
High, more than high, high
Sweet
High, more than high, high
Sweet
Enough room for you niggas to eat, deep
That's a keeper homie, whole lot of square foot to sweep
I clean, trampoline, flow lift you off of your feet
Tell your king pass the throne or I'll kick you off of your seat
Like a drummer, I'll kick you off from your seat
Like a drum kit, kick you off with my feat

[Outro: SIMON SAYZ]
High, more than high, high
High, more than high, high
High, more than high, high
High, more than high, high
High, more than high, high
High, more than high, high
High, more than high, high
High, more than high, high

Gotta kill these dollars, it can't be an assault
Need your real love, mama, you can't be in my thoughts
Oh no, I knew a ten down in Houston

Man, girl, I made a killin' off these drunk ass niggas tonight
Ayy, bruh, that shit was goin' up, man
But damn, they ain't had my pole clean today? I'm sick of this shit
This bitch spilled her mothafuckin' drink on my goddamn shoes

Preacher's daughter, holy water
Be reborn, beginner
'Round and 'round we know
It's like dollar bills to save
Make it rain on that collection plate
Need a dollar bill to save
Make it rain on that collection plate
And your dollar bills can save
Make it rain on that collection plate
You made it clap, now take it back (Pray)
You made it clap, now take it back (Pray)
You made it clap, now take it back (Pray)
You made it clap, now take it back (Woo)
Watch it all wash away (Hmm)
Watch it all wash away (Yeah, pray)
Watch it all wash away

[Intro: Salim]
Oh no
Yeah, yeah, yeah, oh

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
What if I said, love was a lie though?
It was more like hate with a eye closed
And the other eye, had the eye rolled
That's contempt and ignorance, I know
But what do I know?
Only thing that I seen was the inside, of a blindfold
And you just as blind as me
So how I look? Askin' you where do I go
Eye and I keep high hope alive though
That love's not a lie it just likes to lie low
Likes to hide right there in plain sight
And you got to find it with your eyes, closed
And in the dark, you see the part
Of your partner that's the heart
If you die, it's like apartheid, we can bring it back to the, start

[Hook: Salim]
It's not designed to make you feel that way now, baby (oh no)
No, it's not designed to make you feel love
It's not designed to make you feel that way now, baby (oh no)
Oh no, yeah

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
On second thought, leave apartheid in the grave
But the heart part, that can be saved
The hard part's makin' sure it don't break
Into little sharp pieces that are hard to replace
Hard to find spare arteries these days
In decent shape and know things'll decay
And at these rates you're gon' need to be paid
Like three-ty ways just to see D. Wade
To the place that sells these parts
That you couldn't keep safe from the stee-art
So why would we waste our art on your mistake
When you was drivin' reckless? Didn't pump the brakes
Hate to have to shoot you down
A fine runnin' heart makes a soothin' sound
It's junkyard love in your future, pal
Didn't appreciate it then, bet you do, now

[Hook: Salim]
It's not designed to make you feel that way now, baby (oh no)
On no no!
It's not designed to make you feel that way now, baby (oh no)
Oh oh oh, yeah, hey baby
It's not designed to make you feel that way now, baby (oh no)
Noooo baby
It's not designed to make you feel that way now, baby (oh no)
Never gonna make you feel, nooo, babe

[Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco]
And in the futuristic
Love will be reduced to physics
Computer digits made by robots
That use statistics, algorithms and group logistics
The mood-resistant
Downloadable thing that's used specific
Easily updated with few commitments
Can find its way home if you forget it
Say, maybe on a starship tour
Heard a knock at your starship door
It was the girl that you had met at the starship bar
Had a dance on the starship floor
But then you got starship sick
So you had to run to the starship store
And then you got those starship pills
But when you back, she wasn't there no more
She says, "Hope you got a starsuit at the starship store
Maybe we can take a trip
To take a look at the stars around parsec 4"
And it was the most beautiful thing
You both had ever seen in your lives before
And she pulled out her love
So you reached down in your starsuit for
But your pockets empty now the moments passed
And it'll probably never happen like this again
I guess it didn't work out for you in the, end

[Hook: Salim]
It's not designed to make you feel that way now, baby (oh no)
On no no, yeah a-yeah
It's not designed to make you feel that way now, baby (oh no)
Not designed! Not designed baby! Hoo, hoo baby
It's not designed to make you feel that way, now, baby (oh no)
It's not designed to make you feel that way, now, baby (oh no)
Not designed! Not designed! No no no no no no no oh

[Outro: Salim]
Oh oh
No no, baby
Hoo hoo, ahh, baby

[Intro: Lupe Fiasco]
Uh, thank you!
Heheheh, uhh, check, check

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
When you got popped up and you got locked up
And the block shot up and your girl knocked up
And your kids be like, "Who gonna watch us?"
Your mama, they nana
When you ball too hard or your money got spent
So you got kicked out, you ain't have no rent
But you still had a place where you could go
Tell me where you went, your mama
Soon as they let me outta jail
Went straight to my mama's house
Need someone I can talk to
And a little more time to work all these dramas out
That lawyer money, that bail money
Those letters in the mail never fail you, homie
Who visit when niggas don't visit?
Man, she the realest, boy, let me tell you somethin'
You better love your mama

[Chorus: Salim, RXMN & Lupe Fiasco]
I love my mama (I love my mama)
More than I love myself (more than I love myself)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, said I love my mama (I love my mama)
More than I love my health and I love my wealth (more, more)
And I love my niggas and I love my bitches (more, more)
And I love my car
More than I love my heart (ooh)
Oh-wha-wha-wha-wha-wha, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
Yeah, now some mamas might be your confidant
Some mamas just good for shoes
Some mamas might be your drinkin' buddy
Some mamas might not be cool
Some mamas might wait 'til you get home
Some mamas might come up to your school
And fuck you up in front of your friends
Cause you don't make the rules
Really thought that you was doin' it today
Now you sittin' there lookin' all stupid in your face
When you get home, just tell her you sorry
And put on this song, start movin' to the bass
"Boy, cut that shit off!"
Goddamn, mama, they made this song for you
Said through the powder and the problems
Gotta honor my mama, so that's what I'm tryna do
Ayy, better love my mama

[Chorus: Salim, RXMN & Lupe Fiasco]
I love my mama (I love my mama)
More than I love myself (more than I love myself)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, said I love my mama (I love my mama)
More than I love my health and I love my wealth (more, more)
And I love my niggas and I love my bitches (more, more)
And I love my car
More than I love my heart (ooh)
Oh-wha-wha-wha-wha-wha, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

[Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco]
Yeah, now some might think their mama ain't perfect, she is
All in her face, better get in your place
You one of her goddamn kids
Now some might think their mama ain't worth it, she is
Gotta help her out no matter what it's 'bout
No matter whatever she did
Now some might think they mama ain't here, she lives
She lives, she lives
She lives, she lives
She lives, she lives

[Chorus: Salim, RXMN & Lupe Fiasco]
I love my mama (I love my mama)
More than I love myself (more than I love myself)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, said I love my mama (I love my mama)
More than I love my health and I love my wealth (more, more)
And I love my niggas and I love my bitches (more, more)
And I love my car
More than I love my heart (ooh)
Oh-wha-wha-wha-wha-wha, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

[Intro]
Stupid ass lil bitch
Let me introduce you to this motherfucker, bitch

[Verse 1]
Okay, I scorched out that mirror
Bake shakin' my mirror
Diamonds talkin', HD
Can't speak, I'm not clear
Bitch, I ain't no fair
Wild buck 'cause you stare
2 seater McLauren
Hit the broad and I clear
Any niggas try put one on son
Shoot that nigga like one on one
I be in the B nigga, come on, come
Bakes knockin' like ba dum dum
Lookin' in my watch, see 10 in it
Everythin' I got, got a bean in it
Benzes, Benjamins
At Benihannas, I been spendin'
I fly the nigga, I'm finna stunt
Whip elephant, trunk in the front
I hit it once and then I jump
To the next hoe, I'm finna fuck
I drop her off, don't pick her up
Got a white girl, she thin as fuck
But she rich enough to get a Bentley truck
So I'm in her jump like when I cut

[Chorus]
When I'm in a thot, don't you hoes tell me nothin'
When I'm in the spot, don't you hoes tell me nothin'
Pull up in a drop, can a hoe tell me nothin'
Pulled it off the lot and I drove like it's nothin'
Say nothin', like what, what, hey what, shut up

[Verse 2]
I came here like uh
Fucked your bitch on accident
She smoke the dope like uh
She sittin' back, I'm cappin' it, I'm 'bout it
Nigga, got a lil swave brain right there, nigga
It's a lil too much swave
Okay, the realest nigga, your orcha
Smoked the dope in my hard top
Bitches all on my dick
Find a job and get a part time
Why you hatin' on me for?
Why the fuck you want our time?
With money spend, they callin' me
Like everybody on your line
Had a rich lil extra one
She got cake and that paper on
She ain't here but that money round
I dick her down and I take it from her
Swave shark, no khakis
Tonight I might fuck that bitch
And I ain't fuck for like 2 weeks
So I used your girl for my practise
I say how'd I do that? How'd I do that?
Fly your bitch out, tell her boo that
Parlez vous francais, shawty party out in Paris
And rendez-vous back
Baby, you naughty, I'm nice
Sippin' that lotty on ice, blue top Bugatti I drive
Sippin' hypnotic while tippin' that body
And whippin' Bugatti all at the same time
That's swave nigga, swave nigga
Killin' that pussy, I grave dig her
Look at my seats, that's swave, nigga
Motherfuck your DJ, nigga
He ain't got no T Lanez, nigga
He ain't got no Kanye, nigga
Fuck you talkin' nigga, slow your talkin'
Wanna close your mouth and just say nigga, let's go

[Chorus]
When I'm in a thot, don't you hoes tell me nothin'
When I'm in the spot, don't you hoes tell me nothin'
Pull up in a drop, can a hoe tell me nothin'
Pulled it off the lot and I drove like it's nothin'
Say nothin', like what, what, hey what, shut up
What, say what, say what, shut up
What, say what, say what, shut up
Say what, say what, say what, shut up

[Verse 1]
Drugs in mornin', pain in my side
Out there it's war and when my life gets hard

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, you're scared, take my hand
You can feel again
I won't tell no one
You secrets safe with me
Mind all I've got
Baby, let's sing to me

[Chorus]
Now you don't want no one else
Nobody, nobody
Now you don't want no one else
Nobody, nobody

[Verse 2]
I'm so deep inside
I might sink tonight
Just hold on my hand, don't be afraid
We're livin' for the risk, girl
And I know, I know, I know
I can't save you from sinking tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, you're scared, take my hand
You can feel again

[Chorus]
Now you don't want no one else
Nobody, nobody
Now you don't want no one else
Nobody, nobody

[Bridge]
Baby, I want you to get that

[Intro]
Misunderstood ain't gotta be sad
Understand my language, let's air these niggas out
Canada, you know they tell me never break your promises and I won't

[Verse]
And I promise this shit could really get ugly, life is a joy
Deep water rap, this shit is Tyson and Floyd
I'm ringsidin' for niggas that been quiet
Fly nigga enter buildin', we Bin Laden
This is for the bum ass bitches that's dick ridin'
And this is for them numb ass niggas that's been plottin'
I been hotter than all of these young niggas
So why the fuck are they pullin' me back and I'm slingshottin'?
The wall, y'all niggas ain't ballin' with tall figures
I do this shit for the city, I'm doin' it outta duty
And killin' the instrumental and doin' it outta pity
Why haters are tryna knock me and bitches is out to get me
This is what I signed up for
I admire all them people outside in that line up for
I'm the reason why these younger niggas tryna abort
Tell 'em get it, tell 'em get it 'til their time up, boy
Please, niggas hate the numbers and they fear addition
But they love you when you broke and you in their position
Just beware when your nigga in love with bigger bossin'
'Cause that same nigga lovin' be that nigga crossin'
Pickin' duckin' the visions of bigger budgets
We ignore haters and all them niggas they fuck with
They the same suckers that run and tell you they love you
As soon as you turn your back, they be tellin' lies to the public
Well uh, tell your lies, tell your lies, tell your lies, nigga
Just makin' sure you don't end up tellin' to my niggas
Ready for war, we talk machetes and swords
And throw you a celebration, we got confetti galore
I'm ready, like a runner that's only racin' for willin'
These niggas is mad at me, I'm only makin' a killin'
It's history in the makin', I gotta make it appealin'
And Shawn made me a star and I gotta make him a million
A couple shows over, I'm in my own quota
I play the boss and the counci,l I own Yoda
You might tell I'm like Kell with that orange soda
I make you niggas hoes sit at your own yoga
Gettin' money 'til the day when I can feel awareness
I can tell my time comin', I can feel it's madness
Know it's comin', know it's comin' like I know these nigga
Knowin' money, blowin' money, I'm so fuckin' careless
Never judge me for the shit that I say on the record
I'm double stackin' like the king when you playin' in checkers
I run rap now so young back down
Because I'm way too high to come back down

[Outro]
Sincerely. Put the money in the duffel, That's the answer to the problem. It's Tory

[Intro: DJ Drama]
Ay, Tory, I really didn't wanna interrupt
I mean it feels like you was holdin' this shit down on your own, right?

Shout to SLS

[Intro]
Shut the fuck up when you talk to me

Call me Mr. Never Ever Have A Car Rented
I pull up to the dealer, buy any car in it
Bitches sayin', "Aw yeah" 'cause I'm Authentic

Women takin' pictures like a nigga hop out the fire

Bitch, shut the fuck up when you talk to me

[Chorus]

[Interlude]
Come on nigga, you won't beat me up nigga, you just BMW nigga. The fuck wrong with you? My bitch don't push my buttons, nigga. The only buttons she push is the ones that stole them cars, nigga

[Verse 2]
Could tell you all you need to know, I'm gon' say
I've never got dropped, had to drop ('You can't handle the truth')
You ain't want to flex, I got people on the Tecs
Swavey on the T's, got the sneakers comin' next
Just so I can ball, I went and bought me a Rawling, nigga
Gettin' closer to gold and weigh up out of this song
Play like you got that hate like when we be cakin' in Jordans
Niggas hatin', ain't no fuckin' talkin' in this star, nigga
You don't wanna fuck around, get your life tooken
Uh uh fuck around, get your wife tooken
Black Phanton in the night lurkin'
Like a black plane with a flight bookin'
Okay, I just bought a Rollie, plus the Phantom and parolies
Niggas yeah, they can't stand, I'm on the man, they wanna know me
Holy Bible by my bed, I keep that rifle by my head
Niggas find me, I'm gon' let it through, I'm grimey on the grit and that for real, nigga

[Pre-Chorus]
And the whole room full of drugs
Whole corner niggas camouflaged
Shut the fuck up when you talk to me
Bitch, shut the fuck up when you talk to me

[Chorus]
I'm fuckin' awesome
I'm fuckin' awesome
I'm fuckin' awesome

[Outro]
You know what I'm sayin', nigga? Niggas can't fuck with us, just hatin' ass niggas so we fuck. I got a Persian rug for every bad bitch I got. Fuck is wrong with you niggas, man? Canada

[Intro]
Pass the weed. Ay nigga, ay you seen that bitch Chloe upstairs, nigga? Bitch was damn near dancin' on my leg, nigga. Ay, ay kill that shit. Now who the fuck is that over there? That don't look like Gotti car? That is that nigga shit. These niggas tryna ride on us, nigga. Fuck that. Hey everybody take your positions, I gotta get my shit upstairs, man. Hey, T Ray, you comin' with me, man. Thes niggas ain't finna fuckin' ride on us

[Verse]
As I stand here in this fuckin' mirror
Pistol in my hand, it’s nothin' but bloody stairs
Cold glasses, watchin' up in the stairs
They watchin' from a corner, cops hop the blocks on her
I tried to make paper, was makin' the block warmer
Aroma of gettin' cake and chasin' cash, tag laser like
I got a stripper that’s workin' for good dollars
I predict myself later in life for some good father
Conflicts of a nigga, so I feel it
Shit I ever wrote, I bet this probably be the realest
And this population full of highly poppin' armadillos
It’s only gettin' realer but these niggas never book 'em
Back in my days, we sold drugs and never took 'em
But look what it’s comin' into
I’m livin' in a war and got pussy up on my mental
Niggas murdered my cousin in front of my grandmother, you the one that had vent to
When rappers got the nerve to make you kill, it’s uneventful
Fuckin' murderer, rappers find you and murder you
That could change me to the same word that I heard you were
But I don’t care about the cycle though
I’m 'bout to lift 'em in the air like you’re Michael yo
A pair of Jordans, black clothin', the Air Forces
Woke up leanin' somethin' like I pad noxious
Fuck the clutch and grab the Nina and that new tutu
Pulled it out from under the sweater and tu tu tuf

[Chorus]
Niggas, young ringin', gun singin' like
Young ringin', gun singin' like

[Verse 2]
Still in shock, never ran up off the block
'Til I felt the shot nearly ring across my top
100 meter dash was the way I start to drop
Thinkin' at my thoughts like damn, man I shot
Another nigga, could’ve been some niggas’ pops
Or brother nigga, hustle figure, help a nigga’s guap more
Wasted out was niggas, been addicted to this pot
Instead of gettin' guap, niggas got evicted from the spot
Could’ve picked the lock, should’ve been a nigga but I’m not
That ignorant just figured that this bickerin' will stop
Liquor run this shot, gotta get my mind off that
Back on guard, my mind on track
Livin' a life of sellin' drugs to niggas gettin' signed off rap
Wasn’t in my plans, neither was this gun up in my hand
But you know how niggas get, not knowin' why niggas weird
And niggas is old and stupid, always doin' hot nigga shit like
Fuck 'em, can’t without 'em, I duck 'em
I figured that if them niggas is with you, there ain’t no trust in you
You love' em from a distance, doin' thug don’t go with niggas
'Cause that could be your greater reason why you’re here in prison
See first 48, I seen the closest niggas snitchin'
And since then, I ain’t been provokin' niggas when they see
I rather can and deal your man the handle on my business then
Dip into the light like I was damn near fishin', gang

[Outro]
Ay, fuck out, fuck out, nigga. Ay Tory, Tory nigga. Get the fuck in the car, we gotta get the fuck up outta here. Shit. Fuck man, these niggas got Mugz and Bogs, my nigga. God fuck. Shit. Ay my nigga, ay nigga, wake the fuck up right now, my nigga. I feel like I'm havin' a prophecy or somethin', nigga. Nigga, Mugz and Bogs ain't get a second chance, nigga but we did. We gotta make it straight with God, nigga. Shit, we don't even know if it's gon' be a second chance next time, Tory. Ay Tory, ay wake the fuck up, my nigga. Tory

There's somethin' exotic, you got it, you did

[Pre-Chorus]
But we ain't gotta waste no time
Just relieve the stress that's on your mind
So tell me your secrets, shawty, I can keep 'em

Relax your mind while we smoke this sweet
I'ma take your body, shawty, all I gotta say is
You know you shouldn't do it, girl
You know you shouldn't do it, girl

[Chorus]
This is all that, this is all that

Girl, give me the feature
Don't spit me some me thing

Your body, I had it
She smokin', I call it but you teasin'

[Pre-Chorus]
But we ain't gotta waste no time
Just relieve the stress that's on your mind
So tell me your secrets, shawty, I can keep 'em
These niggas can't fuck, they won't ever feel you like I do
Relax your mind while we smoke this sweet
I'ma take your body, shawty, all I gotta say is
You know you shouldn't do it, girl
You know you shouldn't do it, girl

Nothing is real

[Verse 1]
Fixing a hole in the ocean
Trying to make a dove-tail joint, yeah
Looking through a glass onion

[Instrumental Outro]
I know it's late but I can't sleep tonight
'Cause I got something on my mind
I could try one more time to turn out the light
But I just can't make myself unwind
'Cause every time I close my eyes I see your face
And I find my eyes wide open, and I'm starin' into space
Some think it's been too long this time
I can hardly stand another day
With all the miles and miles between us
Can it be that tomorrow holds a promise
Of joy for you and me?

In a little while I'll be on my way
So hold on, baby, just-a one more day
In a little while I'll be on my way to you
Oh, yeah
Come tomorrow I'll be home, and you can be satisfied
'Cause we can leave this lonely life behind
In the mornin' I can wake up with a smile
'Cause I'll be on my way back home to you
Feelin' better by the mile
In a little while I'll be on my way
So hold on, baby, just-a one more day
In a little while I'll be on my way to you
In a little while I'll be on my way
So hold on, baby, just-a one more day
In a little while I'll be on my way
So hold on, baby, just-a one more day

Pocket watchin' on the sideline, poppin' at my door
Diamonds in my face, watch lookin' like a popo
Girl, you lookin' fine, tell me what you tryna do
'Cause I got all the time for you, yeah yeah

[Verse 1]
If they ain't get in the door why the hell they talkin'?

Wanna waste no time, baby girl, I am that guy
Tell them other niggas better stand in line
Bag a body if you play with mine

[Hook]

You a broke boy, that's a joke, boy
Walk, walk inside the club, tryna split a girl
Why you choke, boy? Do you smoke, boy?
You get no love, no
We got more bottles, more bottles
Rollin' round my town, smokin' loud

[Hook]
Pocket watchin' on the sideline, poppin' at my door
Diamonds in my face, watch lookin' like a popo

[Verse 1]
Georgia, Georgia, I love your son
And when he gets older, he might be the one
He might be the one
Georgia, Georgia, he has beautiful bones
And he never lies or picks up his phone

[Pre-Chorus]
And sometimes in the pouring rain
He'll fall in the mud and get back up again

[Chorus]
And if you find me, will you know me?
Will you take me, or will you fall?

[Verse 2]
Here is my day plan, here's my new machine
He is a fine new addition, so young and so clean
So young and so clean
He came up through the water without a sound
With my back to the shoreline, I dreamt that he drowned
I dreamt that he drowned

[Pre-Chorus]
And sometimes, when he looks at me
I know he needs you, you're all that he sees

[Chorus]
And if I breathe you, will it kill me?
Will you have me, or watch me fall?
If I fix you, will you hate me?
And would you fuck this and let us fall?

[Hook]
I'm talkin' 'bout sweet, sweet f'in love
I'm talkin' 'bout sweet, sweet f'in love
I'm talkin' 'bout sweet, sweet f'in love
You give me that sweet, sweet f'in love

You give me that sweet, sweet f'in love
La-la-la-la-la-la-la

[Break]
Break it down
Like when it's real quiet
And there's nobody else but me and you
And you can hear everything I'm thinking, even when I don't say it
This life is so sweet in here
We should just go in there, I don't care
Wherever we are, it's like, it doesn't even matter, anywhere
'Cause I take you

[Hook]
Sweet, sweet f'in love
I'm talkin' 'bout sweet, sweet f'in love
I'm talkin' 'bout sweet, sweet f'in love
My baby give me sweet, sweet f'in love

[Verse 1]
When you feel it in your body, you found somebody who
Makes you change your ways like hanging with your crew
Said you act like you're ready, but you ain't really knew
And everything in your past, you wanna let it go

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been there, done it, humped around
After all that this is what I found
And everyone of y'all are just like me, yeah
It's too bad that you can't see that you've got it

[Chorus]
You got it, you got it bad
When you're on the phone, hang up and you call right back
You got it, you got it bad
If you miss a day without your friend, your whole life's off track
And you got it bad when you're stuck in the house
You don't wanna have fun, she's all you think about
You got it bad when you're out with someone
And you keep on thinkin' 'bout somebody
You got it bad
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh-ho, ooh, oh, oh, oh, yeah

[Verse 1]
Want to, but I can't help it, I love the way it feels
It's got me stuck between my fantasy and what is real
I need it when I want it, I want it when I don't
Tell myself I'll stop everyday, knowin' that I won't
I got a problem and I don't know what to do about it
Even if I did, I don't know if I would quit but I doubt it
I'm, I'm taken by the thought of this

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know this much is true
Baby, you have become my addiction
I'm so strung out on you
I can barely move but I like it

[Chorus]
So then it's all because of you
Said it's all because of you
Said it's all because
Never get enough
She's the sweetest drug
She's the sweetest drug

[Intro]
Hands all over your body
Hands all over your body
(Oh, yeah, oh, yeah)

[Bridge]
Boy look at what you started
Hands all over my body
Hands all over your body
(Oh, yeah)

[Chorus]
I like it when you touch me
I like it when you touch me
I like it when you touch me
I like it when you touch
I like it when you touch me
I like it when you touch me
I like it when you touch me
I like it when you touch me

[Verse 1]
1 , 2, Step into the moonlight
Get you purple blue white
Let me set the mood right (For you babe)
How long, did we check my powers
Took you out the shower
It's late it's been hours

[Bridge]
Oh, yeah
Boy look at what you started
Hands all over my body
Hands all over your body, oh yeah, oh, yeah
Hands all over your body, oh yeah

[Chorus]
I like it when you touch me

Nothing, no body, between us, you can touch it (Babe)
Nothing, no body, between us, you can touch it (Babe)
Nothing, no body, between us, you can touch it (Babe)
Nothing, no body, between us, you can touch it
Nothing, no body, between us, you can touch it
Nothing, no body, between us, you can touch it

[Verse 1]
I always believed that love was surrender
And I wouldn't go down without a fight
I always left room for other contenders
'Cause I might change my mind

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Damn, I used to be so cold
Would never ever get too close
Didn't ever wanna lose control
But from the moment that I tasted
I knew that I would have to chase it
You said hold up, I want you to be

[Chorus]
A one woman man
A one woman man, oh
Want you all to myself
Don't want nobody else
All your loving
All or nothing
Won't you be
A one woman man (one woman)
A one woman man, oh (one woman)

[Verse 2]
You made me believe that love was forever
And love could sustain us through every fight
I let go of all of the other pretenders
They were wasting my time

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I never thought that I would say this
But I can see us having babies
I could see it from the start
That I might give you my heart
From the moment that I met you
Knew that I would never let you
Slip away, it's okay
You can make me

[Chorus]
A one woman man
A one woman man, oh
I want you all to myself
Don't want nobody else
All my loving
All or nothing
I can be
A one woman man (one woman)
A one woman man, uh (one woman)

[Bridge]
I could never say I loved you
I kept up my guard
But you broke in my house
You've stolen my heart
Now I've given you the key
Got all of you for all of me
But baby, I promise to be

[Chorus]
A one - woman man, oh
I want you all to myself
Don't want nobody else
All my loving
All or nothing
I can be
A one woman man (one woman)
A one woman man, uh (one woman)

[Intro: Tory Lanez, Stacey & Calvin]
Ah, this is your captain speaking. Thank you for flying with Flock Fresco air crafts, where we flock freshly. If you are not flocking, you are dying. We will be landing shortly so keep your seat belts on and stay seated. Don't forget to put those lighters in the air and keep your speakers bumping. Enjoy your stay, over and out

Mr. Lanez, your craft will be landing in approximately 5 minutes
Thank you, baby
Oh yeah and Stacey, do you know where Calvin is with my luggage
Yeah, last door on the left
Thank you, baby. You're a doll
Hey Mr. Lanez
Yessir
Go get 'em

[Verse: Tory Lanez]
Uh, la-la-la-landin' out a rocket ship
Pick my head from out the glass, breathin' check for oxygen
I don't know where I'm at, compass check, where's the map?
Fuck the world and if you don't love a nigga, wear a hat
Landed on this atmosphere, all I hear is snare and clap
Took everythin' that I feared, rerecord, hear it back
Told me that my mother died, me, I wasn't clear to that
I look in the mirror, my reflection doesn't mirror back
Grandma say I'm hella dense, father say intelligent
Aunt Suzanne let me be free, been my nigga ever since
Brock always supported me, Moses thought me morals he
Showed me what to do, now I make music, so accordingly
Yeah, I swear everything happens for a reason
Day to day begins and every day creates a season
I take off my space gear, pull myself from placement
Open up the slidin' doors and hop up out the spaceship

[Chorus: Carlisha]
When the lights are blinding
And everything that surrounds your being
And tonight's your landing
In the new world, and planned this
And you're just landing
You're landing, you're landing, you're landing
You're landing, you're landing, you're landing
And you're landing, you're landing, and you're landing, you're landing, and you're landing, you're landing
And you're landing, you're landing, and you're landing, you're landing, and you're landing, you're landing (Yeah)
When the lights are blinding
And everything that surrounds your being
And tonight's your landing
In the new world, and planned this
And you're just landing
You're landing, you're landing, you're landing
You're landing, you're landing, you're landing (Yeah)

In Hollywood I'm shootin', I'm aimin' for your heart
You in movies, but baby, you play the star
Oh, that girl, that girl that don't notice me
And I wanna stay in there and want you to know it's me
Slide a ring on your index, buy you a white gown
Actually bought that, I'll buy you a nightgown
For you to spend one night and you to lay right here
'Cause you in my thoughts, in my dreams, even nightmares
I think I'm goin' crazy, or maybe I'm just obsessed
To see them hurt you, make me upset
See baby, you ain't found the one yet
And I just wanna be your sunset
So I'm hopin' that you see 'em
That nigga ain't your life, I wanna be him
And you, you say you tired of him leavin' ya
But even I can see the future from keepin' ya
I know just what you want, babe
And you want me to love you
So I give you my all, babe

[Chorus]
But instead of you I probably love that Hollywood life, Hollywood life
I probably love that Hollywood life, Hollywood life
I said I probably love that Hollywood life, Hollywood life
I said I probably love that Hollywood life, Hollywood life
I said I probably love that
I know just what you want, babe
And you want me to love you
So I give you my all, babe
But instead of you
I probably love that that

[Verse 2]
That Hollywood life, Hollywood status on Hollywood nights
A Hollywood actress on Hollywood flights
Afflicted and addicted by the Hollywood lights
Like I am, but damn, we know we got a purpose
And I ain't even begin to reach the surface
But I swear that you the Earth's gift
We spendin' time, baby 'cause I know you worth it
Dislike us, they can't dislike us
Long as your thumbs up, baby, hitch hike love
And if you ever need for any God damn reason
I swear that my heart stop beatin'
It sound like, quiet
'Cause girl, I'm on a diet for your love
You try me and I swear you'll realise who the one
Even my girl say don't leave her for that Hollywood
She say don't leave her for that Hollywood
To tell the truth, look, I probably would
To tell the truth, look, I probably would

[Chorus]
Instead of you I probably love that Hollywood life, Hollywood life
I probably love that Hollywood life, Hollywood life
I said I probably love that Hollywood life, Hollywood life
I said I probably love that Hollywood life, Hollywood life
I said I probably love that
I know just what you want, babe
And you want me to love you
So I give you my all, babe
But instead of you
I probably love that that
I probably love that that
I said I probably love that that
I said I probably love that that
I probably love that that

Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Homegirl on the road, she doin' promo
You said, "Keep our business on the low-low"
I'm just tryna get you out the friend zone
'Cause you look even better than the photos
I can't find your house, send me the info
Drivin' through the gated residential
Found out I was comin', sent your friends home
Keep on tryna hide it but your friends know

[Chorus]
I only call you when it's half past five
The only time I'd ever call you mine
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
'Cause I'm messed up, that's the real me
'Cause I'm messed up, that's the real me, babe
I only love you when it's half past five
The only time I'd ever call you mine
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
'Cause I'm messed up, that's the real me
'Cause I'm messed up, that's the real me, babe

[Verse 2]
I'ma let you know and keep it simple
Tryna keep it up don't seem so simple
I just keep my business on the low-low
You gon' have to do it at my tempo
Always tryna send me off to rehab
Love started feelin' like it's decaf
I'm just tryna live life for the moment
And all those and their mothers want a relapse

[Chorus]
I only call you when it's half past five
The only time I'd ever call you mine
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
'Cause I'm messed up, that's the real me
'Cause I'm messed up, that's the real me, babe
I only love you when it's half past five
The only time I'd ever call you mine
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
'Cause I'm messed up, that's the real me
'Cause I'm messed up, that's the real me, babe

[Bridge]
Hills have eyes, the hills have eyes
Who are you to judge, who are you to judge?
Hide your lies, boy, hide your lies
Only you to trust, only you

[Chorus]
I only call you when it's half past five
The only time I'd ever call you mine
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
'Cause I'm messed up, that's the real me
'Cause I'm messed up, that's the real me, babe
I only love you when it's half past five
The only time I'd ever call you mine
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
'Cause I'm messed up, that's the real me
'Cause I'm messed up, that's the real me, babe

If it ain't about the dog, we ain't feelin' ya
A lot of rappers been soft for a long time
'Bout to put the hoodie on dog all times
They said pain is back
I said, naw, Bain is back
The Dark Knight blitzing with the hoodie on
Listen, I'll come through your block
Make all your niggas really missing
(Where they at?)
Where they at now?
You want that real shit, don't 'cha?
You want that street shit, don't 'cha?

[Verse 1: DMX]
Man, cats nowadays be spittin' that fuck shit
Bird ass niggas spittin' that duck shit
I'm from the old school and that there we don't fuck with
Been locked down on lockdown so you suck a dick
Four ways to get in when you fit in: floor, chair
Before you climb the ladder try to find the stairs
Just the go-getters, flow spitters
That roll with us are gorillas
Cold killers that blow triggers
You got niggas, but my niggas know your niggas
And what my niggas know 'bout your niggas, they ho niggas
Oh no niggas, and I call 'em "oh no niggas" 'cause the last thing them bitches said was, "oh no" nigga
You're about to go, nigga
And the last thing your people heard was
"Amen from the pastor and release the birds"
We gonna' end it with the word, may God rest his soul
And though it looks like he's sleeping, to the touch he's cold

[Hook: Swizz Beatz]

[Verse 2: DMX]
Gimme the second chance, so respect the stance
You plan to go reckless and you make reckless plans
So, respect that we can dance
Bitch ass nigga
Motherfuck you and your man, we can do it with the hands
Fuck I need a gun for?
I done fucked a lot of bitches already
So when it come to pussy you just one more
Hit 'em with the 'what for'
That's when you know a nigga's a bitch and he's still gonna' get the hand, but you like, "What for?"
Really? You want more?
I come through with the click, click boom - click, click, boom
Put it through your front door
Brains on the wall like paint
'cause I don't need to know what it is as long as I know what it ain't
Ain't a fuckin' thing fake about me
The devil spent so much time ruining my life
What would the snake do without me?
Keep running your fucking mouth and see what happens to niggas that keep running they fucking mouth
They get knocked the fuck out, nigga

[Hook: Swizz Beatz]

[Outro: DMX (talking)]
Real niggas recognize real niggas man
A real nigga ain't gonna go through the trouble of trying a real nigga
Cuz he know a real nigga will get down just like he get down
And he don't want that headache
He'd rather push up on a soft ass nigga
He spot a bitch nigga from a mile away
And carry 'em just like, know what I mean?

[Verse 1: Trey Songz]
Ask if we ever made love before
She said we never make love no more
I guess she just talking in general
She said she never even been in love
The only want a body

And I'm sorry, yeah, I'm sorry
'Cause I know just what it feels like

[Verse 2: MIKExANGEL]

Bottom of my teeth golden now
Only backwoods, I can roll a pound
Homies locked, I can hold 'em down
Got Givenchy stars on my shoulder now
New grib, new bitch, true Crip, whip like a bowlin' ball
Yves Saint Laurent or the Dolce shades, I don't even know though, sure

Only socks and my wife beater, her brain better than a mind reader

Let a nigga brag Pitt
Legend of the fall took the year like a bandit
Bought mama a crib and a brand new wagon
Now she hit the grocery shop looking lavish
Star Trek roof in that Wraith of Khan
Girls get loose when they hear this song
100 on the dash get me close to God
We don't pray for love, we just pray for cars

[Pre-Chorus]
House so empty, need a centerpiece
20 racks a table cut from ebony
Cut that ivory into skinny pieces
Then she clean it with her face man I love my baby

You talking 'bout me, I don't see the shade
Switch up my style, I take any lane

[Verse 2: MIKExANGEL]
Heart beat in my chest, that's been broken but I bounce back
She say she need me, won't leave but, but I doubt that
Tell me that it's real, won't you love me like for real
You say that you want me, don't you disappoint me
Ooh, it feels like I been wasting all of time

Ooh, feeling so good, like we in another world
Hands grippin' all on round the waist, sauce drippin', we be outta space

I got a little wine for you (What else?)
I got a little time for you (What else?)
You know I keep you so spoiled (What else?)
I rub you down with that oil
She just caught a vibe, I'ma angel in the office
She want me aside, wanna show me how that mouth feel
Yeah, in the brand new Mercedes, she ain't even my lady
I treat her like my baby
Them other dudes so shady, ridin' round with a boss
Fuckin' round with the stars, take your ass straight to Mars

[Chorus: Trey Songz & MIKExANGEL]
Vibe, we just caught a vibe
Vibe, we just caught a vibe

[Outro: Justine Darcenne & Chisanity & MIKExANGEL]

Watchin' you preform
Oh, now here we go with the bullshit
Yeah, girl, that's what you be on

[Pre-Chorus: Trey Songz]
Throwing that old shit all up in my face

And I'm always wrong, that's okay
She said that this can't be love, no way
Hold up now, won't you wait one second

[Chorus: MIKExANGEL & Trey Songz]
If it ain't love then why, does it hurt so damn good, why?
If it ain't love then why, why, would I give my lives to you?

[Verse 2: Trey Songz]
Every time we argue, every time we fight
Don't it feel good when I make it all right?
Girl, you know this all, you know this all mine
You so disrespectful, but it's all fine
I just started talkin' 'til she sayin' nothin'
I just let her win, yeah, end of discussion
Swear that I be in my own motherfuckin' way
Swear she don't judge, that's always the case

[Pre-Chorus: Trey Songz & girl]
Throwing that old shit all up in my face
Girl: Old shit, new shit. Whatever
Knowing that you don't have much room to say
Girl: We talking about you right now. Don't even try that

Girl: Don't even come at me like that
She said that this can't be love, no way
Hold up now
Girl: Tremaine
Won't you wait one second

[Intro]
I am ready right now
Uh huh
I look up I don't even know no more
I think it's funny how it go down
I don't even know no more, official shit

[Chorus]
I'm hangin' halfway off the balcony
Overthinkin' 'cause my job is way more than a salary
Everything around me gold like I just practiced alchemy
I realized when it comes to girls
That chemistry means way more than anatomy
She mad at me, she been mad at me

[Verse 1]
I'm the livin' proof
That you don't need a master's just to be a masterpiece
People passin' faster than I'm passin' weed
My daddy tell me, "Stay strong, son
And be the man you have to be
Holdin' ship down, don't crash at sea"
Brrrt! Paper on my phone line
It's on my phone like fax for me, that's facts to me
But I don't want it if it can't change shit drastically, dramatically
'Cause actually, I realized time's the most valuable, actually
So I'ma call my favorite girl and she gon' bring that ass for me
And as for me, I'ma text the room number right now
So you ain't gotta hit the front desk and go ask for me
Don't ask for me, don't ask for me
Don't ask for me
Lot of shit been goin' on, things goin' wrong
So don't ask for me

[Chorus]
I'm hangin' halfway off the balcony
Overthinkin' 'cause my job is way more than a salary
Everything around me gold like I just practiced alchemy
I realized when it comes to girls
That chemistry means way more than anatomy
She mad at me, she been mad at me

[Verse 2]
She been mad, I've been on the go, on the road
On a roll more than a roller coaster
They can't throw me off track or slow
If I did, I got a long list of hoes on hoes
That quote on quote, say I told you so
Heaven on earth, every night is paradise
I pray I didn't die or overdose, never that
I kept it a hundred, never change, not even for five 20s
Still smokin' at 5:20 like it's 4:20
On a quest for more money, more hungry
Just got my fortune read, she said it's more comin'
Yeah I got the force but never force nothin'
Do it for the love, I'm Forrest Gumpin'
In my city I'm Warren Buffett
I mean business, the shirt is tucked in
The gun's tungsten, fuck it, I'm who not to fuck with
Who the bad bitches gon' fuck with and lames just don't fuck with
My stock's risin', I'm goin' public, if I write it, it's gon' publish
You're fuckin' with the best, no discussion

[Interlude]
So disgusting
It's that 3 and a third shit
Straight up

[Chorus]
I'm hangin' halfway off the balcony
Overthinkin' 'cause my job is way more than a salary
Everything around me gold like I just practiced alchemy
I realized when it comes to girls
That chemistry means way more than anatomy
She mad at me, she been mad at me
She been mad

[Outro]

Dear Girl, I love everything about you
Your mind, your heart, your body, everything
it's nothing about you that I don't like
That which makes you different is what makes you special
I love when you're silly, I love when you smile , make a funny face I just melt
It's beautiful to see a girl that's honest and free
You live your life with no apologies
You know who you are you don't care what anyone thinks about your life that kind of confidence is the sexiest thing in the world to me, the sexiest
You know sometimes you catch me staring at you
yeah I know I know, I just can't help it sometimes
I'm trying to figure you out
you like a book I'm like desperately trying to read
I don't care what's in it, I just want to know what it says
your mind fascinates me, I wanna learn from you
I want you to teach me everything you know
The best life lessons came from listening to you
I wouldn't be who I am if it wasn't for everything you taught me
I named my album after you because - you inspire me
You always on my mind when I create music, always
I want you to love the music I create for you
I hope it makes you feel good
I hope it makes you dance, I hope it makes you happy
It's like, I'm with you even though I'm not there in person
Is that weird? I don't know, maybe
and you already know I mean, and you know I mean no harm
I'm not like these other guys, I'm a lil different
and I'm desperately trying to get you to think about me as much as I think about you , I just want you to notice me
I have no problem admitting that not even Marilyn Monroe
Who Cleopatra? Not even Joan of Ark, that don't mean nothing to me
I just want a different girl, and that's you
Love Pharrell

[Verse 1]
Something told me it was over
When I saw you and her talking
Something deep down in my soul said, "cry girl"
When I saw you and that girl walking out

[Chorus 1]
Ooh
I would rather, I would rather go blind, boy
Than to see you walk away from me child and all

[Verse 2]
I was just, I was just
I was just sitting here thinking
Of your kiss and your warm embrace
When the reflection in the glass that I held to my lips, now baby
Revealed these tears that are on my face, yeah

[Chorus 2]
And baby, and baby, I'd rather be blind, boy
Than to see you walk away, walk away from me, yeah
And baby, and baby, I'd rather be blind now
Than to see you walk away from me

[Outro]
Something told me it was over
When I saw you and her talking

[Verse 1: Kev Nish & Prohgress]
If y'all don't let me in imma bust the door
FM in the house don't adjust your dial
Throw your hands in the air 'till you touch the clouds
Blast off 'till your feet don't touch the ground
We be electric sound off planet rock
We stars on the track X docked the spuk
We back to the future, watch the clock
5, 4, 3, 2, 1, music stop
You ain't going nowhere like Jabba the Hut
Your shit ain't tight like Jabba the slut
We the Far East Movement blazing the cut
So when I knock knock better open it up

[Hook]
Knock Knock, open the door
Knock Knock, open the door
We break it down, we break it down
We break it down, we break it down now
Knock Knock, open the door
No more room upon the dancefloor
We break it down, we break it down
We break it down, we break it down now

[Verse 2: Kev Nish]
Party people, the spaceship has landed
Far East Movement about to happen
Intergalactic ladies dancing
Attacking the map, rehab the planet
Ooh, in the twilight zone
I'm Buzz Lightyear with a shot of patrone
We're the Buzz Lightyears out your area code
So cover your ears we're about to explode

[Verse 3: Prohgress]
Kaboom, we like a supernova
All you other MCs it was nice to know ya
The flames on favor, and smoke the doge
You the bitch, I'm a bed, you gots to move over
Bitch, get your ass up out of my orbit
There's a tiger in my voicebox, shit is verocious
Y'all moving like trees
We shooting past y'all then, ludacris speed

[Hook]
Knock Knock, open the door
Knock Knock, open the door
We break it down, we break it down
We break it down, we break it down now
Knock Knock, open the door
No more room upon the dancefloor
We break it down, we break it down
We break it down, we break it down now

[Interlude]
We came here to bring you what you ain't heard before
Be been knocking like the police, imma break down the door
Knock knock
All my DJs, knock knock
All my MCs, knock knock
All my B-boys, knock knock
All my ladies, don't stop, break it down now

[Verse 4: Kev Nish & Prohgress]
Podcast from my space station
From the west coast to the FM nation
Ready, set, go, here comes the invasion
Let yourself go, no one here to save ya
We masters of the universe
Trapped inside a cubicle
Gasping like I'm mad
Running laps around Jupiter
Captains of the uterus
That's the we way we're doing it
Blasting Hip Hop to a brand new universe

[Hook]
Knock Knock, open the door
Knock Knock, open the door
We break it down, we break it down
We break it down, we break it down now
Knock Knock, open the door
No more room upon the dancefloor
We break it down, we break it down

[Outro]
Knock knock

Be been knocking like the police, imma break down the door
Knock knock
We came here to bring you what you ain't heard before
Knock knock
Be been knocking like the police, imma break down the door

[Verse 1: Kev Nish]
Yo it's 12 o' clock, finished up another gig
Willie Nelson got me singing "On the road again"
I'm home soon, and I love you too
*smooch* on the cheeck, grabbed my bag and left the room
Another day no dollar but I love what I do
You know a soldier gonna miss that home cooked food
Don't forget to leave them lights on and lock them doors
Imma think of you, every time I rock them shows

[Verse 2: Prohgress]
When I'm packing my bags, I'm packing memories
Packing cigarettes for some laughs drags up my rap pack
Momma don't cry, I gotta do what I love
And in the end you know I'm safe
'cause I'm rolling with blood
Sweating tears ain't no fear, we be working for years
N time to hesitate, 'cause the future is near
The sun sets on the window in the blink of an eye
I can't live with myself if I don't give it a try

[Hook: Ken Oak]
Another day, I'm far again from you
On the road again, another show again
Don't forget to say I love her too
On the road again, another show again
Sleeping as the lights are passing by
On the road again, another show again
Dreaming just enough to stay alive
On the road again, another show again

[Verse 3: J-Spliff]
Out the front door, heading east on the high way
I'll be gone 'till friday, away for five days
When I get back we most defs gonna celebrate
You need to relax, I promise to stay celibate
No matter where we at I'm thinking of my better half
When these hoes tap those I'll pass them to the staff
Your boy ain't no fool them forbidden fruit
First thing I do off the stage is calling you

[Verse 4: Kev Nish]
You see the girls in the bright spotlights
My life like a mirage silhouette in the night
No one know me by my first name, simple and plain
Only know me by my rap game, simple and vain
I'm on the road, rocking shows I'm the same as before
You know no one really know me like my girl next door
Every episode is only with the same sad stories
Never tried a second with my FM homies

[Hook: Ken Oak]
Another day, I'm far again from you
On the road again, another show again
Don't forget to say I love her too
On the road again, another show again
Another day and I'm away from you
Can't forget to tell my baby that I love her too
On the road again, another show again
A million street signs passing me by
But I'll never forget the streets that keep me alive
On the road again, another show again

[Verse 5: Prohgress]
You gotta understand that my life is different from yours
I'm really giving up a lot when I be leaving on tour
Student loans are killing me man, they're keeping me poor
But they my motivation to kick down the door
My pops look me in the eye and sees the sparkle is gone
But he's not there to see the sparkle when we finish a song
Or the spark inside my heart when we 

[?]
These sparks started up a fire, and no turning back now

[Verse 6: J-Spliff]
People come and help us out
When we try to rock them crowds
Come together scream and shout
Check what all the fuzz about
We the three infamous FM on your dial
Travelling via bus driving any mile
If you knew all the trials and tribulations we been through
You be showing love shared by cousins and nephews
Give credit when credit is due when we trough
We acting a fool as a crew just for you

[Hook: Ken Oak]
Another day, I'm far again from you
On the road again, another show again
Don't forget to say I love her too
On the road again, another show again
Sleeping as the lights are passing by
On the road again, another show again
Dreaming just enough to stay alive
On the road again, another show again
Another day and I'm away from you
Can't forget to tell my baby that I love her too
On the road again, another show again
A million street signs passing me by
But I'll never forget the streets that keep me alive
On the road again, another show again

[Hook 1]
If you broke clap your hands
You got less than a dub, clap your hands
If you can jiggle your change, clap your hands
Clap your hands, come on clap your hands

[Hook 2: Mary Jane]
Everything's gonna be alright
Man gas prices making me work overtime
Everythings gonna be OK
Sleeping on the floor is better for your back anyway
Everything's gonna be just fine
Who needs electricity when you got the streetlights
The next day the sun will still shine
Even if you ain't paying your rent on time

[Verse 1: J-Splif]
Alarm ring so I spring out my bed
Must have slept wrong theres a kink on my neck
Stress of daily living thinking damn will I make it
In the cold hearted world being broke it forsaken
In our society money's vital like arteries
Ain't no comedy when you broke and have a family
It's the poverty that makes it hard to live honestly
My hands getting dirty nobody respects modesty
The dollar bill is the blame for mans ill
The dollar bill breeds every inch of mans kill
I know how it feels to be laid on them bills
Make the minimum payments still the interest builds
Empty out my pockets grab a fistful of lint
Thinking of a hustle 'cause I gots to pay rent
Through my paper and pen I pour my heart and my soul
Change the situation quick 'cause I'm sick of being broke

[Hook 2: Mary Jane]
Everything's gonna be alright
Man gas prices making me work overtime
Everythings gonna be OK
Sleeping on the floor is better for your back anyway
Everything's gonna be just fine
Who needs electricity when you got the streetlights
The next day the sun will still shine
Even if you ain't paying your rent on time

[Verse 2: Prohgress]
Yo I met this fly honey, shorty was fine
Ask her for the time she was a quarter to dimes
Looked her in the eye got caught up in the whirlwind
Started with a look and all a sudden she my girlfriend
I started taking her out
But telling me about her town was all that she could talk about
Days turned to weeks and I started to believe her
Roads that were paved with gold, so we moved east
But the moment that we got up off the airplane
She looked away from me and said that everything's changed
I held her close and told her baby it'll be OK
Then I felt her right hand push me away
Leaving me alone, I left a good thing at home
Family and friends and a college education
Lady liberty done had me confused
So I work whistling the blue collar blues

[Hook 1]
If you broke clap your hands
You got less than a dub, clap your hands
If you can jiggle your change, clap your hands
Clap your hands, come on clap your hands

[Verse 3: Kev Nish]
What I've been through ain't nothing new under the sun
Just letting you know, that it's a new day
Still struggle the same, the trouble the same
Imma save every dollar 'til I make a change
You know I dig through the ashtray to make that change
I give a bum a dollar hope to make a change
Sweat on my blue collar never see no change
I pay more but my W2 still the same
Politicians go past 'till the well runs dry
Shells don't fly, death in the east paid by
Hard working tax paying non voten unspoken
Every day damn people the government can't notice
You focus on the fact that I can't do the math
Then you call us into class 'cause we don't finish class
But we won't finish last broke begging for cash
When I make more than you, you can kiss my ass

[Hook 2: Mary Jane]
Everything's gonna be alright
Man gas prices making me work overtime
Everythings gonna be OK
Sleeping on the floor is better for your back anyway
Everything's gonna be just fine
Who needs electricity when you got the streetlights
The next day the sun will still shine
Even if you ain't paying your rent on time

[Interlude]
To the mom with 2 jobs 'cause daddys away
Just do your thing
To the bum on the freeway begging for change
Just do your thing
To the student working hard to pave their own way
Just do your thing
And if you ain't there yet but you wanna get paid
Make that change

[Hook 1]
If you broke clap your hands
You got less than a dub, clap your hands
If you can jiggle your change, clap your hands
Clap your hands, come on clap your hands

[Outro]
You wanna get that dough and get that cash
You wanna make that money today
You gotta get that loot and eat that food
You gotta do what you do to get paid

But now I’m from Decatur nigga, I’m from the East Side, gotta stay down for the hood, yeah, yeah, you know. Anyway let’s keep this shit rolling

[Verse 1]
Look at you, kids, with your vintage music
Comin' through satellites while cruisin'
You're part of the past, but now you're the future
Signals crossing can get confusin'

[Pre-Chorus]
It's enough just to make you feel crazy, crazy, crazy
Sometimes it's enough just to make you feel crazy

[Chorus]
You get ready, you get all dressed up
To go nowhere in particular
Back to work or the coffee shop
Doesn't matter 'cause it's enough
To be young and in love, ah, ah
To be young and in love, ah, ah

[Verse 2]
Look at you, kids, you know you're the coolest
The world is yours and you can't refuse it
Seen so much, you could get the blues, but
That don't mean that you should abuse it

[Pre-Chorus]
Though it's enough just to make you go crazy, crazy, crazy
I know, it's enough just to make you go crazy, crazy, crazy

[Chorus]
But you get ready, you get all dressed up
To go nowhere in particular
Back to work or the coffee shop
It don't matter because it's enough
To be young and in love, ah, ah
To be young and in love, ah, ah

[Bridge]
Hmm (Ah, ah)
Hmm (Ah, ah, ah, ah)
Hmm
Don't worry, baby
Hmm (Ah, ah)
Hmm (Ah, ah, ah, ah)
Hmm
Don't worry, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
And it's enough just to make me go crazy, crazy, crazy
It's enough just to make me go crazy, crazy, crazy

[Chorus]
I get ready, I get all dressed up
To go nowhere in particular
It doesn't matter if I'm not enough
For the future or the things to come
'Cause I'm young and in love, ah, ah
I'm young and in love, ah, ah, ah, ah

[Outro]
Hmm (Ah, ah)
Hmm (Ah, ah, ah, ah)
Hmm
Don't worry, baby
Hmm (Ah, ah)
Hmm (Ah, ah, ah, ah)
Hmm
Don't worry, baby

[Verse 1]
Oo, you say you're feeling bad cause
The least thing makes you cry
Sounds like a real bad case
Of a girl who needs a guy
I think I know the perfect jewel
One you ought to try
Take a heart that's full of love
On this you can rely

[Chorus]
If you need some quick reaction, take this heart of mine
And if you need some satisfaction, take this heart of mine
And if you're tired of being lonely, take this heart of mine
I think I can help you if you'll only take this heart of mine

[Verse 2]
I may not be a doctor who can cure your ills
Goodbye to all those different drugs and hard-swallowed pills
My remedy is older than the tale of Jack and Jill
My prescription is the kind you love to have refilled

[Chorus]
If you need some quick reaction, take this heart of mine
And if you need some satisfaction, take this heart of mine
And if you're tired of being lonely, take this heart of mine
I think I can help you if you'll only take this heart of mine

[Outro]
Oh, medicine won't cure you
Just leave you at the most
The relief is only temporary
Pretty soon will go
But love can last a lifetime
When two hearts are close
Take as much as you want to
There is no overdose
I bought you violets for your furs
And it was Spring for a while, remember
I bought you violets for your furs
And there was April in that December

The snow drifted down on the flowers
And it melted where it lay
The snow looked like dew on the blossoms
As on a summer day

Yes, I bought you violets for your furs
And there was blue in the wintry sky
You pinned the violets to your furs
And gave a lift to the crowds passing by

You smiled at me so sweetly
Since then one thought occurs
That we fell in love completely
The day that I bought you violets for your furs

The snow drifted down on the flowers
And melted where it lay
The snow looked like dew on the blossoms
As on a summer day
I bought you violets for your furs
And there was blue in the wintry sky
Darling you pinned the violets to your furs
And gave a lift to the crowds passing by

You smiled at me so sweetly
Since then one thought occured
We fell in love completely
The day that I bought you violets for your furs
I got a tech, I got a Uzi
Guns on Obama, thats a Bazuka

[Verse:  Skippa Da Flippa]
Black Gucci shoes, Black Gucci shoes, (swear)
I was Gucci'd down when Gucci made the news
Spiked louboutins I bought some for my friends
Givenchy on my kin I can't wait to do it again
I'm movin' fast and forward I'm movin' fast and forward
And when I go and walk in, they so low they close the store
Pair of New Margielas, go in Neimans cop some more
I'm movin' fast and forward

[Verse: Young Thug]
Hoe wet in them 

[?] my swag everlastin', bitch I'm
Servin' my woes, cabbage
Skippa he started that dabbin'
Feel like a robber kidnappin' they're jackin'
Searchin' for the tools
Doin what I eat I'm clean
Watch

[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract]
This is everything I ever wanted though
Dreaming of a candy store
Brother couldn't tell me more, no, so
I need moments where I could be left alone
Yeah, she let me ride along
To a place where I belong, woah, though
If you niggas ever get your money right
Would you still be robbing niggas?
Would you still be lying to yo momma? No
Don't you know I do this for your family?
'Cause mine ain't believe in me
Left my hood so easily
Eat, sleep, wash sheets, repeat
Watch teachers teach

[Verse 2: Merlyn Wood]
High and on the damn sidelines where the bleachers be
Always feel like city streets, wish I was back in my sheets, shit
Most days I don't wanna be me, shit
Don't watch this, teen watch TV, shit
My whole family look like some Gucci shit
Shoutout my hood, they racist as hell, shit
I'm 'bout my papers like some damn immigrants, bitch

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract & Merlyn Wood]
One day I'ma get my bread up
All my real niggas been fed up
One day I'ma get my bread up
All my real niggas still fed up
One day I'ma get my bread up
All my real niggas been fed up
One day I'ma get my bread up
All my real niggas been set up

[Verse 3: Dom McLennon]
I cannot explain it
Dropped down to my knees beneath the stars and started praying
Life put me here for a reason, I am not complaining
Look me in my eyes, I'm not here for your entertainment
Do you follow?
I ain't here as your role model
That pill is way too big to swallow
I hollowed out my path
Borrow all my sorrow but don't expect me to take it back

[Verse 4: Ameer Vann]
I been dripping candy paint, grew up Willow Avenue
Turned a right on Yellowstone, you see what them players do
So I chuck the deuce who make us home to Herschelwood
And shout out to my cousin Mo, he got off a prison sentence
Lock him in a penitentiary, he ain't takin' niggas with him
Or his daughter either, so send the lord to keep her
'Cause the police killin' fathers, man, it hard to keep 'em
And that's what's in my blood, besides the oil and reefer
I'm in the black slab, tryna catch the reaper
It's a four inside my cup, I crack the seal and fill it
It's a hole inside me, I try to pour and fill it
But in the bottom, another monster, there's somethin' with it
I'm still that little nigga with the little twisties
Waitin' for the bus, and I just missed it
That's why I'm still hungry, why you robbin' niggas?
That's why I dream bigger, fuck a couple dollars
I want a hundred million, and one for all my niggas
And twenty for my mama, she need some bigger ceilings

[Bridge: bearface]
I'm waiting on the birds to call me I, fly
I'm waiting on the birds to call me I
Oh I, oh I
I'm waiting on the birds to call me I, fly
I'm waiting on the birds to call me I
Oh I, oh I
I'm waiting on the birds to call me I, fly
I'm waiting on the birds to call me I
Oh I, oh I
I'm waiting on the birds to call me I, fly
I'm waiting on the birds to call me I
Oh I, oh I
I'm waiting on

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract & Merlyn Wood]
One day I'ma get my bread up
All my real niggas been fed up
One day I'ma get my bread up
All my real niggas been fed up
Chorus:
As, I hit the bong
I wonder, what went wrong
With my mainstream hip hop fans
As, I toke along reminiscing weed we smoked on all day, and all night long

I'm the rap star Afroman, off the charts and I feel the pain
Wishing I wouldn't rack my brain, 2 Chain and Little Wayne
I wonder, wo.wo.wo.wo.wonder
Why, is it because I got high you don't think I'm fly
Call me one hit wonder, curse me to the day I die
One hit wonder, I hit the blunt and just wonder

Verse: 1
How can I be just a one hit Wonder
83 albums, hitting like thunder
You think 1 hit is all I got
But I play 90 minutes or a 3 hour slot
1 hit that's 1 song, the average song 4 minutes 20 seconds long
Explain how I entertain for hours, drunk and hot, supernatural powers
Afro fans would act a fool, If I don't sing hits like "Back to School"
I get complaints from my fans, If I don't sing hits like Tall Cans
Afroman you suck, if you don't sing "She Won't Let Me Fuck"
I might have to fight, If I don't sing "Lets Get Drunk Tonight"
I can't leave alive if I don't sing "Colt 45"
Colt 45 and two zig zags, baby that's all we need
Chorus:
As, I hit the bong
I wonder, what went wrong
With my mainstream hip hop fans
As, I toke along reminiscing weed we smoked on all day, and all night long

I'm the rap star Afroman, off the charts and I feel the pain
Wishing I wouldn't rack my brain, 2 Chain, and Little Wayne
I wonder, wo.wo.wo.wo.wonder
Why, is it because I got high you don't think I'm fly
Call me one hit wonder, curse me to the day I die
One hit wonder, I hit the blunt and just wonder

Verse: 2
Afro, Afroman, sing "I Live in a Van"
Come on don't be no wussy
We wanna here "In Your Pussy"
Afroman, I'm bomb as hell, I wrote songs like "Palmdale"
Leave the stage they yelling no
They wanna here hits like "Sell Your Dope"
Hush, the crowds callin my name
Hits like "Hush" bring me fame
How can I be just a one hit wonder
I hit the blunt just wonder

Chorus:
As, I hit the bong
I wonder, what went wrong
With my mainstream hip hop fans
As, I toke along reminiscing weed we smoked on all day, and all night long
I'm the rap star Afroman, off the charts and I feel the pain
Wishing I wouldn't rack my brain, 2 Chain, and Little Wayne
I wonder, wo.wo.wo.wo.wonder
Why, is it because I got high you don't think I'm fine
Call me one hit wonder, curse me to the day I die
One hit wonder, I hit the blunt and just wonder

Verse: 3
Encore, yes indeed they like my hit song "Tumbleweed"
I made another hit for yah, "Just My Paranoia"
Your party is live, but my party is live(er)
When I say "Colt 45", the gangster, the frat boy and the Hippie
Wanna here that hit song "Mississippi"
Pass me the spliff, I wrote a hit song "Graveyard Shift"
Everywhere I go people make a fuss, I wrote "Back on the Bus"
They pay me green baby, know what I mean baby
I wrote that hit song I'm a "Dope Fiend" baby
How can I be just a one hit wonder
I hit the blunt just wonder

Chours:
As, I hit the bong
I wonder, what went wrong
With my mainstream hip hop fans
As, I toke along reminiscing weed we smoked on all day, and all night long
I'm the rap star Afroman, off the charts and I feel the pain
Wishing I wouldn't rack my brain, 2 Chain, and Lil Wayne
I wonder, wo.wo.wo.wo.wonder
Why, is it because I got high you don't think I'm fly
Call me one hit wonder, curse me to the day I die
One hit wonder, I hit the blunt and just wonder

[Verse 1]
Silence lays like lace around my mind
Delicate embrace I need sometimes
Guides me when I'm on my way back home
Tells me when I'm truly all alone

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And when I get sick of the silence
I get back on the highway
Could be going nowhere
I can be going your way
Sick of the silence
But I'll be somewhere new by dawn

[Chorus 1]
They could be
Better, better, better, better, better
Better, better, better, better, better
Better, better, better, better, better
Oh, oh-oh-oh

[Verse 2]
And can you can recall that moment at all
When we warmed up way last June?
And how many times do we talk through the night
And sleep in way past noon?

[Pre-Chorus 2]
But now I'm sick of the silence
Getting back on the highway
Could be going nowhere
I can be going your way
Sick of the silence
But I'll be somewhere new by dawn

[Chorus 2]
They could be better
They could be better
Better, better, better, better, better
Better
Better, better, better, better, better
Better, better, better, better, better

[Outro]
Be-be-be-be-be-better, better
Be-be-be-be-be-better, better
Better, better, better, better, better
Better, better, better, better, better
Better, better, better, better, better
Be-be-be-be-be-better, better
Oh, oh-oh-oh
Better, better, better, better, better
Better, better, better, better, better
Better, better, better, better, better
Be-be-be-be-be-better, better
Oh, oh-oh-oh
Better, better, better, better, better

It is surely time that the speech of the Black culture of America be recognized as a genuine dialect of English. It is in every sense of the word...
Yeah, uh, uh, uh

[Verse]
Allen with the picked 'fro, answer in the outlet
Alley-oopin' all the shit home
Powered-up, out for the assist
Don't panic when it get cold, we go at it, ho
How you want them ribs smoked, family? Uh
Ten toes, know you on your shit already
Big stone, granite and your fist balled
Standin' on the strip
Don't panic when the pig come
Scramble, get the big tall fetti, and then get home
Tally up—tally up the wins though
Don't think he said he pro-violence
But it's gon' be your problem if he did, though
I lived out the way, ayy
Palace where the Crips stay
Silent when the pigs came browsin' in his shit
Bang like two mallets, too callous for your bitch taste
'Member when they had my grandmammy on a drip drink
How much of that gin straight? Could have filled a fish tank
My doggy hit my cell, say he got me off the strength
Ask him, "That's just how it is?" say
"You die and then you live, huh?"
Your heart and then your limbs break
Just catch me when I slip, bro
What's poppin'? Like a hip bone
I told you, these niggas passin' like the Citgo
We passin', niggas know we keep the gas inside the spliff roll
The wind get the ashes in the end, bro
We been took your pass and your credentials, uh
Bad apple, daily clashin' with my kinfolk
Bad acid did damage to my mental
Show you right, it took some passages to get grown
They been called me savage from the get go
Uh

My girl is a mix of Aaliyah and Sade
I came a long way from that "Marvin and Chardonnay"
I pull out the driveway like I’m in a car chase speeding!
And if my bitch cheat she know I’m leaving!
No text, no call boy
That bitch airplane mode, cold
No peacoat, no time to change clothes
Same clothes, love if you living by the same code
G-code, leave ho
Fuck it you dead to me, back to my destiny

I know my great, great, great aunty was a slave (I know)
I could only imagine all the sacrifice she made (I can only imagine)
I could only imagine all the shit she had to take (I can only imagine)
I'ma make sure all the blood she gave wasn't in vain (Damn)
I sacrificed for your entertainment boy, I'm Mr. Anderson in the Matrix
Check the last name it's all facts and the human race is all about pacing (Damn)
Look at all the ones I outlasted, I'm the one at the end like I count backwards
Never satisfied, details classified 'til the afterlife, make a sacrifice, Don (Don)
Why can’t y’all recognize that we all came from sacrifice?
Why can’t y’all recognize that we all came from sacrifice?

Feels so good when I know you can feel me.

[Intro]
This is called being high as shit, for hours
That's the name of this song, nigga
"High as Shit for Hours"
Here we go, yeah

[Verse 1]
American hypocrisy, oh, let me count the ways
They came here seekin' freedom then they end up ownin' slaves
Justified it usin' Christianity which saves
Religion don't mean shit, there's too much ego in the way
That's why ISIS is a crisis
But in reality, this country do the same shit
Take a life and call it righteous
Remember when Bin Laden got killed, supposedly?
In a hotel lobby after a show, was noticin'
These white ladies watchin' CNN, coverin' the action
They read the headline and then they all started clappin'
As if LeBron had just scored a basket at the buzzer
I stood there for a second, watched them high-five each other
For real? I thought this was "Thou shalt not kill"
But police still lettin' off on niggas in the Ville
Claimin' that he reached for a gun
They really think we dumb and got a death wish
Now somebody's son is layin' breathless
When I was a little boy my father lived in Texas
Pulled up in Toyota, drove that bitch like it was Lexus
Put my bag in his trunk and headed off for Dallas
Out there for the summer, feelin' just like I was Alice
Lost in the Wonderland where niggas still sufferin'
Just like they was back home, and that's wrong
So now it's fuck the government, they see my niggas strugglin'
And they don't give a fuck at all, and that's wrong, yeah

[Chorus]
The type of shit that make you wanna
The type of shit that make you wanna let go
The type of shit that make you wanna
The type of shit that make you wanna let go

[Verse 2]
I had a convo with the President, I paid to go and see him
Thinkin' about the things I said I'd say when I would see him
Feelin' nervous, sittin' in a room full of white folks
Thinkin' about the black man plight, think I might choke
Nope, raised my hand and asked a man a question
Does he see the struggle of his brothers in oppression?
And if so, if you got all the power in the clout
As the President, what's keepin' you from helpin' niggas out?
Well, I didn't say "nigga," but you catch my drift
He looked me in my eyes and spoke and he was rather swift
He broke the issues down and showed me he was well-aware
I got the vibe he was sincere and that the brother cared
But dawg, you in the chair, what's the hold-up?
He said, "There's things that I wanna fix
But you know this shit, nigga: politics"
Don't stop fightin' and don't stop believin'
You can make the world better for your kids before you leave it
Change is slow, always has been, always will be
But fuck that, I'ma bust back 'til they kill me
Change is slow, always has been, always will be
But fuck that, I'ma bust back until they kill me—feel me?

[Chorus]
The type of shit that make you wanna (Aight, third verse)
The type of shit that make you wanna let go
The type of shit that make you wanna
The type of shit that make you wanna let go

[Verse 3]
Here's a thought for my revolutionary heart
Take a deeper look at history, it's there to pick apart
See the people at the top, they get to do just what they want
'Til after a while the people at the bottom finally get smart
Then they start to holla, "Revolution"
Tired of livin' here, destitution
Fuck that lootin', can you tell me what's the best solution?
I used to think it was to overthrow oppressors, see
If we destroy the system, that means we'll have less of greed
But see, it's not that simple
I got to thinkin' about the history of human nature
While this instrumental played, then I realized somethin' that made
Me wonder if revolution was really ever the way
Before you trip and throw a fit over these words I say
Think about this shit for a second, you heard the way
The children in abusive households grow up
Knockin' girlfriends out cold—that's called a cycle
Abused becomes the abuser and that's just how life go
So understand
You get the power, but you know what power does to man?
Corruption always leads us to the same shit again
So when you talk 'bout revolution, dawg, I hear just what you sayin'
What good is takin' over when we know what you gon' do?
The only real revolution happens right inside of you
I said what good is takin' over when we know what you gon' do?
The only real revolution happens right inside of you, nigga

[Chorus]
The type of shit that make you wanna (High for hours, nigga)
The type of shit that make you wanna let go (Volume one)
The type of shit that make you wanna
The type of shit that make you wanna let go

Has melted down

[Bridge]
I know something is lurking in
The depths of murky water
There are ripples and bubbles appearing
Over by the sunken ship
And bells are ringing in my head
I think I'm done - I think I'm dead
As something pulls my paddling leg under...
Asphyxiate: it's more than I can take
This briny, tangy, salty water in my lungs
And deeper, darker, bluish dread
The pressure's squeezing on my head
The Kraken's got the best of me this time

[Instrumental]

[Bridge]
I know something is lurking in
The depths of murky water
There are ripples and bubbles appearing
Over by the sunken ship
And bells are ringing in my head
I think I'm done - I think I'm dead
As something pulls my paddling leg under...
Asphyxiate: it's more than I can take
This briny, tangy, salty water in my lungs
And deeper, darker, bluish dread
The pressure's squeezing on my head
The Kraken's got the best of me this time

[Chorus]
Open water
Where's the shore gone?
How'd I falter?
Open water

[Verse 1]
Drifting in and out of sleep
Is my favourite state to be
I can see you next to me
And it is lovely

[Refrain]
Sleep drifter, sleep drifter

[Chorus]
I can feel you touch me
And I can hear you breathing
Please no one wake me
When I'm sleep drifting

[Verse 2]
Drifting in and out of sleep
Reality begins to fray
You'll become so close to me
In a hotel far away

[Refrain]
Sleep drifter, sleep drifter

[Verse 3]
I can know you're right here
And I can catch your crying tear
We can be so close, dear
When I'm sleep drifting

[Verse 1]
Drifting in and out of sleep
Is my favourite state to be
I can see you next to me
And it is lovely

[Refrain]
Sleep drifter, sleep drifter

[Chorus]
I can feel you touch me
And I can hear you breathing
Please no one wake me
When I'm sleep drifting

[Verse 3]
I can know you're right here
And I can catch your crying tear
We can be so close, dear
When I'm sleep drifting

[Chorus]
I can feel you touch me
And I can hear you breathing
Please no one wake me
When I'm sleep drifting

[Refrain]
Sleep drifter, sleep drifter
Sleep drifter, sleep drifter
Sleep drifter, sleep drifter
Sleep drifter, sleep drifter

[Chorus]
I can feel you touch me...
And I can hear you breathing...
Please no one wake me...
When I'm sleep drifting

We don’t want your tiny hands
Anywhere near our underpants

Grab 'em by the pussy
Grab 'em by the pussy

You can do anything

[Chorus: Big Sean]
Thanking God for all my setbacks
'Cause He the reason I'm able to get back
This feel like my Sunday morning jetpack
Feel like I sent the prayers up and got blessed back, woah
Yeah
Feel like I sent the prayers up and got blessed back
This feel like my Sunday morning jetpack
Yeah

[Verse: Big Sean]
This the feeling know that I been missing some days
This feel like I'm headed to paradise one way
This feel like the family dinners that we used to have
On Sunday with Grandma in the kitchen making rum cake
Or the spread she used to do for Thanksgiving, man
This feels like the first time I heard Killa Cam
Pink Timb's, in the Lamb, mixing it in with Dilla and
Headphones to the ceiling fan, bucket hat like Gilligan (Yeah)
Lately, I been talking to ghosts
Didn't learn faith in school but that's what I'm testing the most
You know I still rep you when you're gone, though
I got a picture of us on the front lawn
With me, Grandma and Mom, that night I went off to prom
Wishin' you could see the lights all dijon and parmesan
Funny thing about it, you always act like you knew
You told me I would feel it would happen before it do
And you taught me I'm a product of everything I go through
And you and Grandma went broke so we would never get bruised
You the reason that I ever touched my first Franklin
Fast forward, I'm in Kanye crib with Kirk Franklin
It reminded me of how we used to dress up
As a family and go to Sunday service, and be in church singin'
Ain't been to church in a while, but it ain't just 'bout how you just praise Him
In the building, it's about how you praisin' Him while you out
You taught me to remember that when I get set back
Been through the worst times to get the best back
Wishin' for a time machine to jet back
To my all time low self and throw me a jetpack, woah
And see you again, needless to say
Back when I dated Alisha, Simone, or any other
Girl look like Lisa Bonet whose jealous of me and Jhené
Who you would always advise would be in the way
You was right, but I had to learn for myself
I guess a time came for me to earn for myself
I hope that this is somewhat a thank you for all your help
Hope the angels take care of ya 'til I see you myself

[Bridge: The-Dream]
Praise
So many times
I prayed for you
I put up prayers for you
Praise
For all the times
That you prayed for me
All the nights you stayed by me
All the nights that you cried
And all the days I coulda died
Because of you, I survived
Because of you, I'm still alive

[Chorus: Big Sean]
Thanking God for all my setbacks
'Cause He the reason I'm able to get back
This feel like my Sunday morning jetpack
Feel like I sent the prayers up and got blessed back, woah
Feel like I sent the prayers up and got blessed back
This feel like my Sunday morning jetpack
Yeah

[Outro]
ELDER SEAN: You gonna let it ring forever? Answer that!
MAN: Yo, she keep calling. Yo, and your dad left you a voicemail, and your girl keep calling
SEAN: Ah fuck... I got to call her back. Ayy, yeah, pass it to me, real quick. Hello? Hey Ma

[Chorus]
You do the right thing, you know you inspire me
You do the right thing, you know you inspire me
Can't go wrong (This one's for you, you, you)
You do the right thing, you know you inspire me (You, you, you)

[Verse 1]
You tried to keep me away from temptation
Introduced me to The Temptations
Marvin Gaye and Isley Brothers
Dancing so hard the living room shaking
Yeah we dance in the house
My mama's the man of the house
Mama you too good for them men
Even dad, you too good for him
Mama, you know you inspire me
You deserve early retirement
You text me, tell me to take my vitamins
When I got a new love you invite 'em in
When we break up, you don't like 'em then (No)
Loyal, loyal, swear you super loyal
Worth more to me than striking oil
You deserve the life I'm tryna show ya
I remember all of the sacrifices
Growing up in debt, but never hungry
Rich in everything except money
That's that faith that you can't buy
But I buy that new crib, you look right in it
I buy that new car in the color that you like it in
And play my song every single time you drive in it
That's 'cause you inspired it (yeah)

[Chorus]
You do the right thing, you know you inspire me
You do the right thing, you know you inspire me
Can't go wrong, wrong, wrong
You do the right thing, you know you inspire me

[Verse 2]
I know it's hard to get me on the line
I'm busy like every other time
Since I got a house in that other town
You wonder when I'ma come around
I know you worry about me
I give you attitude like, "Don't worry 'bout it"
Don't hit ya up like I don't care about you
But I hold you down, I swear I got you
I know I got problems communicating
I probably should've went to school
And got that degree in communications
I should be with you on vacation
I should take you where you should be taken
Asia, Africa, Dubai, anything you want, I do buy
Just want you to know I do try
To take care of ya, mama
You the one, you the one, you the one
You the moon, you the stars, you the sun
I'm so happy I'm your son
I'm so happy I'm your son
You love me since day one
Since before day one
So before the day's done
I gotta, gotta let you know

[Chorus]
You do the right thing, you know you inspire me
You do the right thing, you know you inspire me
Can't go wrong, wrong, wrong
You do the right thing, you know you inspire me

[Outro]
Look, mama, you know you inspire me
If I ever made you not feel like it, then this is my apology
So sorry, look, dear mama, you know your son shine for ya
I'm Sean for ya, my lady
Don't you ever let 'em talk to you crazy
Anything for the fam, how you raise me
I'm yo baby but you still my baby
Ayy

[Intro: Charli XCX]
Ay, ha!

[Verse 1: Charli XCX]
Pull up, pull up
Bass in the trunk
Valet gon' pick up, pick up
Hop out the Benz
Freaking weekend
Dressed to the nines, lookin' like tens

[Pre-Chorus 1: Charli XCX]
Quick, snap a pic, then go
Walk through the club past the velvet rope
Got a manicured man on my manicure hand
Oh, damn, it's my song on the stereo
And it goes like...

[Chorus: Charli XCX]
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
I'm drunk, and I'm on a roll
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
He said, "Girl, can I take you home?"
And I was like...
Ha-ha, hell yeah, baby
Ha-ha, hell yeah, baby
Ha-ha, hell yeah, baby
Ha-ha, let's go

[Verse 2: Charli XCX]
Pull up, pull up
Don't give a fuck
My girls gon' switch up, switch up
Here in the crowd
Wearing the crown
Me and my man gon' get down, get down

[Pre-Chorus 2: Charli XCX]
Walk to the bathroom stall
Wanna push him hard up against that wall
Might be spilling my glass, but I got that class
So I'm gonna make him wait if he wants it all
And it goes like...

[Chorus: Charli XCX]
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
I'm drunk, and I'm on a roll
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
He said, "Girl, can I take you home?"
And I was like...
Ha-ha, hell yeah, baby
Ha-ha, hell yeah, baby
Ha-ha, hell yeah, baby
Ha-ha, let's go

[Bridge: Ryn Weaver and Charli XCX]
Oh, boys, they try to shout
They hoot and holla when they can
They see me out
Too bad I'm leaving with my...
My man, man
But if you ain't got one, take a stand, stand
Single ladies in the club, it's your jam jam
But if you got a ring on it, wave your hand, hand
Like a boss
Like a boss
Like a boss
Like a boss, boss, boss, boss, bossy, bossy

[Chorus: Charli XCX]
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
I'm drunk, and I'm on a roll
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
He said, "Girl, can I take you home?"
And I was like...
Ha-ha, hell yeah, baby
Ha-ha, hell yeah, baby
Ha-ha, hell yeah, baby
Ha-ha, let's go
Ha-ha, hell yeah, baby
Ha-ha, hell yeah, baby
Ha-ha, hell yeah, baby
Ha-ha, let's go

[Outro: Charli XCX]
Hell yeah, baby
Hell yeah, baby
Hell yeah, baby
Let's go

[Verse 1]
I went with you up to the place you grew up in
We spent a week in the cold
Just long enough to Walden it with you
Any longer, it would've got old
Singing "Ace of Spades" when Lemmy died
But nothing's changed, L.A.'s alright
I'm sleeping in my bed again, and getting in my head
And then, walk around the reservoir

[Chorus]
You, you must've been looking for me
Sending smoke signals
Pelicans circling
Burning trash out on the beach

[Verse 2]
One of your eyes is always half-shut
Something happened when you were a kid
I didn't know you then and I'll never understand
Why it feels like I did
"How Soon Is Now" in an 80s sedan
You slept inside of it because your dad
Lived in a campground in the back of a van
You said that song'll creep you out until you're dead

[Chorus]
And you must've been looking for me
Sending smoke signals
Pelicans circling
Burning trash out on the beach

[Verse 3]
I want to live at the Holiday Inn
Where somebody else makes the bed
We'll watch TV while the lights on the street
Put all the stars to death
It's been on my mind since Bowie died
Just checking out to hide from life
And all of our problems, I'm gonna solve 'em
With you riding shotgun, speeding, 'cause fuck the cops

[Chorus]
And you, you must've been looking for me
Sending smoke signals
Pelicans circling
Burning trash out on the beach

[Verse 4]
I buried a hatchet, it's coming up lavender
The future's unwritten; the past is a corridor
I'm at the exit, looking back through the hall
You are anonymous, I am a concrete wall

[Intro]
Hey, oh, yeah

[Verse 1]
Heartbeat sharply, marked by sharpie, not me
Mark me godly try and, taught me mark Pete Johnny
And the rest will walk me, got peace
No piece, never
Action talking madly
Happy, sadly, angry, don't you feel me?
Why are your words so trapped​?​ (Just remember I am the 13, 13, 13)

[Chrous]
Let me talk to you
Connect, connect, connect
(I'm the 12th disciple on the 13, 13)
And what's wrong with you
Let's connect, connect, connect
(I'm the 12th disciple on the 13, 13)
Go and call your connects, connects, connects
(I'm the 12th disciple on the 13, 13)
To get you high and forget about the rest

[Bridge]
Cause you rather keep it quiet
You never say enough
You rather let the silence
Take control of us

[Bridge]
Cause you rather keep it quiet
You never say enough
You rather let the silence
Take control of us

[Verse 2]
O-oh you gotta tell me how you found it (oh yeah)
Cool, you say what you know about it? (oh yeah)
And why did you come just for that? (Why just for that?)
And why are your words all so trash? (Tell me, tell me, oh)
But your body free, let me have a piece
Physically, get you mentally
Sexually, just vent to me
Spiritually, connect to me
Now you know what you meant to me
You all talk, you ain't gotta talk, give me something bae
8 o'clock in the front, give me something bae
To the party, pop a molly, now we going crazy
Now I'm contemplating, now I'm crazy
Taking her to the place she stay
And hoping that she fucking says
O-oh, you gotta tell me how you found it (oh yeah)
Cool, you say what you know about it? (oh yeah)
Cool, you sang it, tell me how it sounded? (yeah)
You read it​, and what you really think about it?
Oh what you really think about it? (Bout it, bout it, bout it)

[Chorus]
Let me talk to you
Connect, connect, connect
And what's wrong with you?
Let's connect, connect, connect
Go and call your connects, connects, connects
To get you high and forget about the rest

[Verse 3]
And still I seek this path of un-manifestation
Battling with lust and each his own temptations
Greeting waiting in the shadows times somebody give me patience
You forgotten it was temporary fell in love with this vacation
Dark paths, marked ass, the kill of lumination
Cutless and patents waiting for me by the station
Once your gone this all becomes and animation
Unreal and unable to have a motherfucking conversation
A moth- conversation

[Bridge]
Cause you rather keep it quiet
You never say enough
You rather let the silence
Take control of us

[Outro]
Heartbeat sharply, marked by sharpie, not me
Mark me godly try and, taught me mark Pete Johnny
And the rest will walk me, got peace
No piece, never
Action talking madly
Happy, sadly, angry, don't you feel me?
(13,13,13,13,13)

[Verse 1]
Sometimes I think I'm a killer
I scared you in your house
I even scared myself by talking
About Dahmer on your couch
But I can't sleep next to a body
Even harmless in death
Plus, I'm pretty sure I'd miss you
And faking sleep to count your breath

[Chorus]
Can the killer in me
Tame the fire in you?
Or is there nothing left to do for us?
I am sick of the chase
But I'm hungry for blood
And there's nothing I can do

[Verse 2]
But when I'm sick and tired
And when my mind is barely there
When a machine keeps me alive
And I'm losing all my hair
I hope you kiss my rotten head
And pull the plug
Know that I've burned every playlist
And I've given all my love

[Chorus]
Can the killer in me
Tame the fire in you?
I know there's something waiting for us
I am sick of the chase
But I'm stupid in love
And there's nothing I can do
And there's nothing I can do

[Verse 1]
Well, I am tired of being sad
I feel it when I wake up
And it just stays bad
It hits me like a sickness
Or a steamroller
Makes me wanna lay down
And get run over
But then I see you
Always smiling
Makes me wanna touch you
Keep from dying

[Chorus]
You're a brother to me
You're my partner in crime
You're the feeling I get
When I'm feeling fine
Part of me wants you
But most of me needs you
So I won't fall unless you ask me to

[Verse 2]
We talk for hours
Until finally
Sleep takes over
The amphetamine
In the darkness
I feel your fingers
They don't touch me
But there's a danger

[Chorus]
You're a brother to me
You're my partner in crime
You're the feeling I get
When I'm feeling fine
Part of me wants you
But most of me needs you
So I won't fall unless you ask me
You're a brother to me
You're my partner in crime
You're the feeling I get
When I'm feeling fine
Part of me wants you
But most of me needs you
So I won't fall unless you ask me to
I want to love you and treat you right
I want to love you every day and every night
We'll be together with a roof right over our heads
We'll share the shelter of my single bed
I want to know - want to know - want to know now!
I want to know - want to know - want to know now!
I got to know - got to know - got to know now!

I want to know - want to know - want to know now!
I want to know - want to know - want to know now!

I want to know - want to know - want to know now!
...every day and every night

I want to love you and treat you right
I want to love you every day and every night
We'll be together with a roof right over our heads
We'll share the shelter of my single bed
I want to know - want to know - want to know now!
I want to know - want to know - want to know now!
I got to know - got to know - got to know now!
I want to know - want to know - want to know now!
I want to know - want to know - want to know now!

I want to know - want to know - want to know now!
...every day and every night

[Intro: Whistling]

[Verse 1]
A great big bang and dinosaurs
Fiery raining meteors
It all ends unfortunately

[Chorus 1]
But you're gonna live forever in me
I guarantee, just wait and see

[Verse 2]
Parts of me were made by you
And planets keep their distance too
The moon's got a grip on the sea

[Chorus 2]
And you're gonna live forever in me
I guarantee, it's your destiny

[Verse 3]
Life is full of sweet mistakes
And love's an honest one to make
Time leaves no fruit on the tree

[Chorus 3]
But you're gonna live forever in me
I guarantee, it's just meant to be

[Interlude: Whistling]

[Verse 4]
And when the pastor asks the pews
For reasons he can't marry you
I'll keep my word and my seat

[Chorus 1]
But you're gonna live forever in me
I guarantee, just wait and see

[Outro: Whistling]

[Chorus]
I am not done changing
Out on the run, changing
I may be old and I may be young
But I am not done changing

[Verse]
I met me someone changing
We had some fun changing
Sometimes I wonder if she'll be the one
When I am done changing

Some of us stopped running
Some of us went home
Some of us don’t got one
So we'll build one of our own

Friends behind their fences
Looking at me strange
Wondering when I’m gonna come to my senses
But I'm still changing
And I can’t change my ways
I see the sky changing
Reminds me of my changing
Wish I could tie me a rope 'round the sun
'Cause I am not done changing

[Bridge]
Time's been talking to me
Whispering in my ear
Saying “Follow your heart
'Til it tears you apart”
But hearts keep changing
Hearts keep changing
Hearts keep changing
Hearts keep changing

[Instrumental Solo]

[Chorus]
I am not done changing
Out on the run, changing
I may be old and I may be young
But I am not done changing
Changing
Changing

[Intro: Big Sean]
Uh-huh, is it time?

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Look, I spent my whole life tryna improvise
I'm not saying that shit for you to sympathize
Spent my whole life tryna find the light that's at the end of the tunnel
I should have realized it was inside
So lately I been trying to get what's inside outside
So many people wanna see my insides outside
I'm from that city four hours east of Southside
Where everyone outside, but don't fuck with no outsiders
Going up, with the ones I hold it down with
Whole city got my back on some photobomb shit
Whole city blowing up on some old Saddam shit
Before this, I was the one hoes tried to go to prom with

[Refrain: Big Sean]
You know, take the fame, take the crib, take our cars
Now we gotta take the train, hood niggas takin' chains
Slavemaster take our names, 5-0 take the shot
And young souls take the blame, man but they can't take away
The light

[Chorus: Jeremih & Big Sean]
No matter how much they gon' shade you
No, man they can't fuck with the light
They can't stop the shine
They can't fuck with the light
Hell nah, the boy's that bright
Even if you take away my life, you can't take the light
No matter how much they gon' shade you

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Got the whole city on fire
Boy, this the flow that got Steph Curry inspired
This the flow that got Lebron James finna rewire
This the flow that got my whole family finna retire
Flows on flows, I might drown in this bitch
Ye found a pro, I guess I'm profound in this bitch
My dad from Louisiana, man the smallest town
Where if they know you're brown, they might hold you down and even hose you down, man
Since I'm his son, I feel like I gotta stunt hard
I took the hand that they gave me and played the Donald Trump card
And realized counting money never feel as good as counting blessings
And a loaded mind is more dangerous than a loaded weapon

[Refrain: Big Sean]
So when they take the fame, take the crib, take our cars
Now we gotta take the train, and hood niggas takin' chains
Slavemaster take our names, 5-0 take the shot
And young souls take the blame, man but they can't take away
The light

[Chorus: Jeremih & Big Sean]
No matter how much they gon' shade you
No, man they can't fuck with the light
They can't stop the shine
No, man they can't fuck with the light
Hell nah, the boy's that bright
Even if you take away my life, you can't take the light
No matter how much they gon' shade you

[Outro: Jeremih]
Don't let them take away your soul
No, no (No, no)
Don't let them take away what makes you whole

[Verse 1: Benjamin Clementine]
Here is our tree
That primitively grows
And when you go to bed
Scarecrows from the far east
Come to eat its tender fruits
And I thought the best way to perfect our tree
Is by building walls
Walls like unicorns
In full glory and galore
And even stronger
Than the walls of Jericho
But glad then my friend
Out in the field, we shall reap a better day
What we have always dreamt of having
Are now for the starving
It is love, that is the root of all evil
But not our tree
And thank you, my friend
For trusting me

[Chorus: Benjamin Clementine & (The Humanz Choir)]
Hallelujah
(Hallelujah)
Hallelujah money
(Past the chemtrails)
Hallelujah money
(Hallelujah money)
Hallelujah money
(Hallelujah money)
Hmmm
Hallelujah money
(Hallelujah)
Hallelujah money
(Oooh)

[Verse 2: 2-D]
How will we know?
When the morning comes
We are still human
How will we know?
How will we dream?
How will we love?
How will we know?

[Interlude: Benjamin Clementine]
Don't worry, my friend
If this be the end, then so shall it be
Until we say so, nothing will move
Ah, don't worry
It's not against our morals
It's legally tender
Touch, my friend
While the whole world
And whole beasts of nations desire
Power

[Bridge 2: 2-D]
When the morning comes
We are still human
How will we know?
How will we dream?
How will we love?
How will we know?

[Chorus: Benjamin Clementine & (The Humanz Choir)]
(Hallelujah money)
Hallelujah money
(Past the chemtrails)
Hallelujah money
(Hallelujah money)
Hmmm
Hallelujah money
(Hallelujah money)
Hallelujah money
(Oooh)
Hallelujah money
Hallelujah money
Hallelujah
Hallelujah money!

[Snippet]

[Intro]
On the come up
On the come up
Sun up
Bunch of young niggas on the come up
Come up
Gun up
All my young niggas on the come up
Bunch of young niggas on the come up

[Verse]
All my niggas live Italian
Eating spaghetti and salad
Last night, she just fucked a stallion
Inside of a palace
All my niggas live Italian
Loyalty is all I'm askin'
Wearing diamond medallions, (straight up)
My whole squad run the atlas
Look, I feel like I was chose to the take
Care of the ones I'm close to
Kitchen looking like whole foods
Got the fam around like it's soul food
Damn, I do this shit for the set
Working all year till we set
Quick to check a bitch, yeah, I check her even though life's a game of chess
Cause I'm living play by play, day by day
No time for her honestly
And her face looking like a young shawty
Cause I gotta get it a hundred ways
But you know 'bout being down and out...

[Intro: Big Sean]
Do or die
Look, all I wanna do is make the city proud, yeah
Wishing all the OGs could see me now, now, yeah
And when you feel something you can't see
But you know it's meant to be
You gon' realize that this is bigger than me yeah
Bigger than me, bigger than me
When the whole family depend on you to eat
And at night you can't sleep
You gon' realize that this is bigger than me

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Get it, get it, get it
I pray that you get it even if I can't get it with cha
I pray to God you never let the little things in life distract you from the bigger picture
Everybody in the city to me like a distant cousin, brother, little sister
I see myself in the young ones
When I look in their eyes it feel like a mirror
Corleone all on my own (Don)
Cartier all on my arm
All I hear is sirens  and car alarms
Niggas going to war with no armor on
First time I seen a dead body I was 14
And I felt the pressure
Like if I don't get it, I might end up next to him
I'ma take the dice and I'ma roll a 7
Seven, seven, seven, 7-11 it's 911 getting called around
The hood America's lost and found
Where niggas get lost and never found
All I ever wanted was to turn these Gs into Ms and a Mercedes key
Got it and I still felt incomplete
That's when I realized this shit was bigger than me

[Chorus: Big Sean & Flint Chozen Choir]
Bigger than me
When the whole town on their feet
And they all just waiting on you to speak
That's when you realize that this is bigger than me
All I wanna do is make the city proud, yeah
Wishing all the OGs could see me now, now, yeah
Ohhh ya ya yeah
Ohhh ya ya yeah
You gon' realize that this was bigger than me

[Bridge: Starrah]
Used to want that foreign
Got that foreign, now it's boring
Started touring
Swear to God that's when I realized this shit was bigger than me
Flex on niggas with a Rollie
Got that Rollie with the shine
But lost my time
That's when I realized this shit was bigger than me

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
I seen people in the same place 10 years later
Man that shit pathetic
God talking to me telepathic like it only happen if you let it
I can't spend my whole life looking at the same ceiling fan
When I feel like I ain't got no ceilings man
If I ain't special why I feel it then?
I gotta get on the road
I gotta be the one chose
I gotta come back and tell the greatest story they never told
This must be the feeling that you get when you know you close
And you know it's a way in even when the doors are closed
And realize this shit is bigger than me yeah

[Chorus: Big Sean & Flint Chozen Choir]
Bigger than me
When the whole town on their feet
And they all just waiting on you to speak
That's when you realize that this is bigger than me
All I wanna do is make the city proud, yeah
Wishing all the OGs could see me now, now, yeah
Ohhh ya ya yeah
Ohhh ya ya yeah
Ohhh ya ya yeah
Ohhh ya ya ya ya ya ya ya
Ohhh ya ya ya ya ya ya ya
Ohhh ya ya ya ya ya ya ya

[Outro]

[Myra Anderson:] Well no matter what, I'm proud of you. Even when you do stupid things that I have warned you about. You must get that from your daddy. I'm just kidding, you know I love you. You listening?

[Big Sean:] Yeah yeah, I'm listening. I love you too

[Myra Anderson:] In a way I feel like I'm living through you. Sometimes it feels like I got another chance at everything

[Big Sean:] Man that's deep you feel like that. I kinda feel the same way though sometimes

[Myra Anderson:] Yeah

[Big Sean:] With all the work that's goin' on I feel like this is like my second time doin' it so I know that sound crazy but, you know I just I don't know why I always imagine myself as like someone who failed at everything he ever did at life you know and I got to the end of life and just regretted it all and somehow, this is my chance to go back and get it all right. And when I wake up, with that mindset, you know, it completely changes my hunger, how I approach the whole day. I mean you decide to live your life like that then pshh, man I guarantee we'll live life to our best potential

[Big Sean (future self):] It's that simple. It's all about living in the moment. Period

[Hook: Kev Nish]
It's kinda simple love, but love ain't
You say you hungry girl, but I ate
Why you gotta get your way
Why you always gotta get your way
It's the love baby

[Verse 1: Kev Nish]
I'm at a loss for words, do I exist?
And poetry's the only way I express
Love is here and gone in a sec
By the time I finish writing you go on to the next
I'm always wrong 'cause I'm right where you left
You had the upper hand and you close in a fist
I'm damned if I ain't right to fight for my right
This time just chill for real, take a pill
Take time to hear your side, 'cause you hear mine
Love's blind so open your ears wide
Love lies, love's compromise
Love ain't the same if it ain't you and I
True, love ain't love if I let love die
Dinner and a movie, then we make love wild
Come on, give it to me, make it worth your time
You'll get your way, and you'll get mine

[Hook: Kev Nish & Mary Jane]
It's kinda simple love, but love ain't
You say you hungry girl, but I ate
Why you gotta get your way
Why you always gotta get your way
It's the love baby

[Verse 2: Mary Jane]
It's a bit strange what love can do
It makes the roses red, but it makes me blue
I wanna know why you make mistakes
The very next day you go away
And that's why when you say compromise
I think twice about making you smile
I wanna make you smile baby
But I write this song to let you know
That I'm dropping my pride
And I'm willing to try
This thing called love
Help me to love this thing called love
Let me love you baby

[Verse 3: Prohgress]
Love giveth, love taketh away
When we met, it was love in a day
But after time, you wasn't the same
I was blind, so what can I say
You met me at the right time, the right state of mind
Right when I saw you, I said you were mine
That was foolish, I wasn't watching the signs
I called you my dear, but I was caught in the lights
Of days and nights searching for that other half
The way you smiled had me so certain that
I found you, the queen to my throne
Even if we only spoke on the phone
You so far away, I though only in miles
But like Jimmy Cliff, I can see clearly now
The rain is gone, ain't it a shame
Why you always have to get your way
Where's the love baby

[Hook: Kev Nish & Mary Jane]
It's kinda simple love, but love ain't
You say you hungry girl, but I ate
Why you gotta get your way
Why you always gotta get your way
It's the love baby

[Verse 1]
We kick the raps to the things we see
Distracted by passion, a natural human being
'Cause we is I, FM is we
With wings to fly high to whatever we dream
Man it seems like a lot, but there's max sacrifice
What I decide is like effects on the life
Keep my eye on the ball
Live today for tomorrow
Here to answer a call
Pick me up when I fall
You know I got you
We need every hand that we have
With a master plan to blaze a path for a man
The movement, the blueprint
The world's influenced
A lot of your excuses
Just move it or lose it
We stand tall proud of our content
Listening its context
Ain't no type of contest
'Cause we bust like Kanye West
We balance it all
We, focus man
You know that we can't fall

[Hook]
We gotta focus
Global mass proportion
Gotta focus
FM keep your minds open
Focus, focus, focus, focus
Focus, keep your mind focussed
Focus, global mass proportion
Gotta focus
FM keep your mind open
Focus, focus, focus, focus
Focus, keep your mind focussed

[Verse 2]
Love to rock the microphone every chance we get
Mind is in the zone, Passion hit with every breath
This is our life story, completely non fiction
'Till the 

[?]
We hopefully complete the mission
State me, unify the rhythm of nation with patience
Moving 'till we back where we came from
Far east is relative, accept the melanin nomads
We face it, we embracing our cause
And we pop no collar, we don't rack bananas
Just spitting college hits 'till we get a mass following
We regular Joes within a regular flow
Extraordinary purpose to focus on more
Then you or me, he or she, please believe
Reach everybody from here to far east
Tell my thinkers, dreamers, hustlers, hoes
Put your mind to the test and let the plan unfold

[Hook]
We gotta focus
Global mass proportion
Gotta focus
FM keep your minds open
Focus, focus, focus, focus
Focus, keep your mind focussed
Focus, global mass proportion
Gotta focus
FM keep your mind open
Focus, focus, focus, focus
Focus, keep your mind focussed

[Verse 3]
Now take these words home and think 'em through
For the next rhyme I rhyme will be about you
King had a dream, yo, X had a vision
We have a purpose, everybody listen
Focus, this is 5 in the morning
Eyes barely open with hope that you finish your homework
Focus, this is 10 in the evening
Body's asleep, keep working 'cause there's mouths to feed
Focus, this is three ticks left in the championship
Make the winning three and return, earn a scholarship
Focus, this is 

[?] the booze, keep pushing it through
Rock the mic 'till the audience hears you
Focus, this is having the will to quit cigarettes
Fight the crave, don't fall to an early death
Focus, this is Kev Nish Spliff and Prohgress
Finishing this track for y'all hip hop heads

[Hook]
We gotta focus
Global mass proportion
Gotta focus
FM keep your minds open
Focus, focus, focus, focus
Focus, keep your mind focussed
Focus, global mass proportion
Gotta focus
FM keep your mind open
Focus, focus, focus, focus
Focus, keep your mind focussed

[Outro]
Focus, focus, focus, focus
Focus, focus, focus, focus
Focus, focus, focus, focus
Focus, keep your mind focussed

[Teacher] All right students, class dismissed

[Children] Hey chef

[Chef] Hello children

[Children] So what's today's lunch special

[Chef] The same as it is every day

[Children] What, what is it?

[Chef] Country fried stake, followed by my chocolate salty balls

[Children] Ahw, nuts!

[Intro: Jin]
We stuck in this cafeteria they call the industry
Serving up the same damn thing
I bet you thought it would never happen, huh?

[Hook: Jin]
You are now tunes into FM and Jin
We ain't never eating at the cafeteria again
You swaping hot outta rock greater spots
Since the days of fish sticks and tater tots
Four MCs with cocky flows
All you other rappers sounding like Sloppy Joes
You are now tuned into FM and Jin
We ain't never eating at the cafeteria again

[Verse 1: Jin]
The industry has got me fucked up
In the stomach where my ribs meat
Starving while I watch all of these other kids eat
I heard your signing bonus was a Lexus coup
I'm next in line, yeah Imma fight for the extra scoop
A natural entrepeneur, I was born on the job
Trade you half a biscuit for your corn in a cup
Most of y'all, they brag about keeping the heat close
I don't got beef, that's just yesterday's meat loaf
Damn, how can I put this delicately
Y'all is some leftovers like fronting like a delicacy
If they won't let me eat I will act on my own hunch
Forced once and for all yo to pack my own lunch

[Verse 2: Kev Nish]
This record be serving kids mystery meats
Same damn CD, week after week
With no nutrition nor ambition
The burger's getting hard and the jello's gibbling
The things that you cover with your government cheese
The kids that you're filling with your industry grease
If the cooks care less and cease or perish
Left out for days like peas and carrots
Peace from the far east now on your menu
Four foot boobs and your essential
Endent your regiment with the vitamin Jin
Put a spork in your mouth with a bite of FM

[Hook: Jin]
You are now tunes into FM and Jin
We ain't never eating at the cafeteria again
You swaping hot outta rock greater spots
Since the days of fish sticks and tater tots
Four MCs with cocky flows
All you other rappers sounding like Sloppy Joes
You are now tuned into FM and Jin
We ain't never eating at the cafeteria again

[Verse 3: J-Splif]
I'll be waiting in line
Rubbing my stomach 'cause I'm starving
Wasting my time, 'cause the cook is serving garbage
Plate full of empty getting dizzy like I'm carsick
Hunger pain made my brain take the kitchen hostage
Teachers never honest, keep 'em from the knowledge
Meals artificial, recipes filled with nonsense
Alarming the way they turn their face y'all
But I promise the staff won't eat this cold 

[?]
Shit is crazy more like boys' bathroom stalls
Better guard your plate 'cause I got a sticky paw
'Fore your fried chicken omelet and meals on the daily

[?]

[Verse 4: Prohgress]
I get the special of the day, goddamn I'm furious
I'm like John McEnroe, You cannot be serious
Changing up the menu and we're doing it right
So I'm throwing up my lunch to incite a food fight
Jug over the counter to catch the lunch later
Try not to attack with mashed potatoes and gravy
We ain't saving nothing here, we hailing a new year
So here comes the brand new flavor for your ear
Chilling FM the nuisence like Rayquan
Serving y'all food for thought fun with asians
Keep your hands high like you wanting some mo'
But this is where it ends, cafeteria closed

[Hook: Jin]
You are now tunes into FM and Jin
We ain't never eating at the cafeteria again
You swaping hot outta rock greater spots
Since the days of fish sticks and tater tots
Four MCs with cocky flows
All you other rappers sounding like Sloppy Joes
You are now tuned into FM and Jin
We ain't never eating at the cafeteria again

[Verse 1]
Another story of girl meets boy, and gets destroyed, uh, oh
Another promise broken in two, the lucky view of fiction

[Pre-Chorus]
Fade away, fade away
Teach me how to fade away
Another story of girl meets boy

[Chorus]
He's okay, she's broken
He's the ocean waves, she's chokin'
Fade away, fade away
Teach me how to fade away
Another story of girl meets boy

[Verse 2]
So picture perfect, it can't be real and all you feel is numb
You see them talking but hear no sound to hit the ground
And fade

[Chorus]
He's okay, she's broken
He's the ocean waves, she's chokin'

[Outro]
Don't want it, don't need it
Don't want it
Don't want it, don't need it
Don't want it
Don't want it, don't need it
Don't want it
Don't need it, don't, don't need it
Don't need it, don't, don't need it
Don't need it, don't, don't need it

[Chorus: Post Malone]
Damn, my AP goin' psycho, lil' mama bad like Michael
Can't really trust nobody with all this jewelry on you
My roof look like a no-show, got diamonds by the boatload
Come with the Tony Romo for clowns and all the bozos
My AP goin' psycho, lil' mama bad like Michael
Can't really trust nobody with all this jewelry on you
My roof look like a no-show, got diamonds by the boatload
Don't act like you my friend when I'm rollin' through my ends, though

[Verse 1: Post Malone]
You stuck in the friend zone, I tell that four-five the fifth, ayy
Hunnid bands inside my shorts, DeChino the shit, ayy
Try to stuff it all in, but it don't even fit, ayy
Know that I been with the shits ever since a jit, ayy
I made my first million, I'm like, "Shit, this is it," ayy
30 for a walkthrough, man, we had that bitch lit, ayy
Had so many bottles, gave ugly girl a sip
Out the window of the Benzo, we get seen in the rent'
And I'm like "Woah, man, my neck so goddamn cold”
Diamonds wet, my t-shirt soaked
I got homies, let it go, oh
My money thick, won't ever fold
She said, "Can I have some to hold?"
And I can't ever tell you no

[Chorus: Post Malone]
Damn, my AP goin' psycho, lil' mama bad like Michael
Can't really trust nobody with all this jewelry on you
My roof look like a no-show, got diamonds by the boatload
Come with the Tony Romo for clowns and all the bozos
My AP goin' psycho, lil' mama bad like Michael
Can't really trust nobody with all this jewelry on you
My roof look like a no-show, got diamonds by the boatload
Don't act like you my friend when I'm rollin' through my ends, though

[Verse 2: Ty Dolla $ign]
The AP goin' psycho, my Rollie goin' brazy
I'm hittin' lil' mama, she wanna have my babies
It's fifty on the pinky, chain so stanky
You should see the whip, promise I can take yo' bitch
Dolla ridin' in an old school Chevy, it's a drop top
Boolin' with a thot-thot, she gon' give me top-top
Just one switch, I can make the ass drop (Hey)
Ayy, take you to the smoke shop
We gon' get high, ayy, we gon' hit Rodeo
Dial up Valentino, we gon' hit Pico
Take you where I'm from, take you to the slums
This ain't happen overnight, no, these diamonds real bright
Saint Laurent jeans, still in my Vans though
All VVS', put you in a necklace
Girl, you look beautiful tonight
Stars on the roof, they matching with the jewelry

[Chorus: Post Malone]
Damn, my AP goin' psycho, lil' mama bad like Michael
Can't really trust nobody with all this jewelry on you
My roof look like a no-show, got diamonds by the boatload
Come with the Tony Romo for clowns and all the bozos
My AP goin' psycho, lil' mama bad like Michael
Can't really trust nobody with all this jewelry on you
My roof look like a no-show, got diamonds by the boatload
Don't act like you my friend when I'm rollin' through my ends, though

[Hook: Kev Nish]
Drop down, baby look hot
When you feel the beat knocking
Girl you just can't stop
And then you turn around
Like you're scrubbing the ground
All my girls in the club
Look back, reach down
And then they touch the ground

[You're the freak in the gig?]
Getting closer to the floor
Use your landing gear
And then we touch down
And you're moving it right
Every girl in the world
Gonna drop tonight

[Verse 1: Kev Nish]
It's time to make you feel so cheap
Raise your high heels to the heat
The hot sauce burn your belt
In the kitchen making 

[?] (I make it siss)
Sunset to 

[Soho?]
Dancefloor to dojo
All around the world

[I make you feel that super foxy?]
Momma watch me
Look, no hands when I rock your body

[Verse 2: Prohgress]
Keep doing what you're doing
Girl, t's all right
You gotta vibe for that body in its own right
You just lease something
To take it over the edge
And people know me as a girls' best friend
But this is more about us
Make me feel good, I'll make you famous
But it only works if you're doing the dance
So drop down baby, do it with class

[Hook: Kev Nish]
Drop down, baby look hot
When you feel the beat knocking
Girl you just can't stop
And then you turn around
Like you're scrubbing the ground
All my girls in the club
Look back, reach down
And then they touch the ground

[You're the freak in the gig?]
Getting closer to the floor
Use your landing gear
And then we touch down
And you're moving it right
Every girl in the world
Gonna drop tonight

[Verse 3: Kev Nish]
You on stage, legs for days
Wrapped around my head like I'm in a neck brace
I say I want you, mic check, one two
Every fool in the club trying to get a one two
I see your back from the frontview
Grab on your hips
Let me tap like a drunk dude
Snack like a kung fu kick
When the face hit
Mommy get the plane tickets

[Verse 4: Prohgress]
They got the strobe lights on
And they playing a song all night long
I see you moving so well
You're moving like a gazelle
You got me thinking funny thoughts
Of making you my gazelle
With that crucifix on your neck
You're so glamorous
Class like that makes Prohgress so amorous
Everywhere you go they flash cameras
Go and do yo' thing I ain't mad at ya

[Hook: Kev Nish]
Drop down, baby look hot
When you feel the beat knocking
Girl you just can't stop
And then you turn around
Like you're scrubbing the ground
All my girls in the club
Look back, reach down
And then they touch the ground

[You're the freak in the gig?]
Getting closer to the floor
Use your landing gear
And then we touch down
And you're moving it right
Every girl in the world
Gonna drop tonight
Drop down, baby look hot
When you feel the beat knocking
Girl you just can't stop
And then you turn around
Like you're scrubbing the ground
All my girls in the club
Look back, reach down
And then they touch the ground

Getting closer to the floor
Use your landing gear
And then we touch down
And you're moving it right

Far East Movement

[Hook]
It's time
We on a race for time
On pace the first name to blow your mind
It's time
5, 4, 3, 2, move
Make way for the new breakthrough

[Verse 1: Kev Nish]
It's time to see a new face under the mask
Time to change the lightbulb under the lamp
Time to hear a name representing a camp
Put an Asiatic face on rap
I'm a L.A. riot, the roofs on fire
The quiet type really ain't that quiet
Can't knock my hussle, take off my muzzle
Unleash the beast, expose the struggle
Like grandma dying from a common cold
And her remedy costs more than silicone boobs
Sitting at a desk in D.C
Decision making going back to B.C
Factory to presync, find the weak link
Tell them what we think
Vote and be free
People in Asia got no choice
Imma rap for my people and rock my voice

[Hook]
We on a race for time
On pace the first name to blow your mind
It's time
5, 4, 3, 2, move
Make way for the new breakthrough
We number one

[Verse 2: Trin Monster]
It ain't what you say, but it's what you show
My name is Monster and I came to crush the show
You on stage trying to bust the flow
Plus, you blow
Tell me what the deal is with these busters, yo
I spent three years trying to get to where I am
Shaking off all the haters, trying to stear my plans
Leeches who try to suck the life from my hands
So they can see me fall face flat and clap their hands
Fucking losers on a mission but I got the ambition
To make 'em listen to the lyrics I'm spitting
You know my business
Running hella fast when I crash I clash
I'm non stop slash top notch
40 meter dash

[Hook]
We on a race for time
On pace the first name to blow your mind
It's time
5, 4, 3, 2, move
Make way for the new breakthrough
We number one

Critics know my flow

[?] game for ya
And now we riding all day
In my lowrider
I get high like elevators
But this ain't Flow Rida
No rider can compare my swag on 1-0-0
I'm so fly I'm in the air
I'm like a young superhero
I'm a proud little kid
Everything tell it
From my neck to my hands
Once I started you got it
Got a charm full of stone
A belt full of thongs
Blowing out the money
Bitches landing in my home

[Hook: Bionic]
She clungs around my waste
Lowriding, low, lowriding
She likes the songs I played
Lowriding, low, lowriding
Lips look like candy cane
Lowriding, low, lowriding
Lowriding, low, lowriding

[Verse 3: Prohgress]
Yeah 20" subs, tweeters in the vents
A thousand Watt amps lowriding in the deck
Can't ride the way we ride
Scope 100 golden eye
Making my dose suicide dose
Stay open, we are so fly

[Verse 4: J-Splif]
I ride to the top with a chick by my side
Got my windows down an mirrors shaking
Blowtorch 'till I'm high, represent west side
When I pass by 

[?] my day ends
I got that big body, shavvy
Taking up two lanes
Take a peek real quick
We be gone in a tick
I'm out like David Blaine

[Hook: Bionic]
She clungs around my waste
Lowriding, low, lowriding
She likes the songs I played
Lowriding, low, lowriding
Lips look like candy cane

[Reporter] This just in! Robots disguised as import models and I-bankers are infiltrating the hoods, spreading the dreaded dress-alike-think-alike virus by way of those mighty Fung Wah busses. But fear not, according to the reports, the Far East Movement is here like a yellow menace. They're far east coast, far west coast, worldwide, in a word: unstoppable. From flushing Modstreet, East Broadway, Thirty Deuce, Fort Lee, Bayside, 8 Ave, Lauren's Ave, Santo, Alhambra, Little Saigon, K-Town, it's the anti-robot movement. We're not friends, we're family, believe that. Allright now back to your previously scheduled program

[Intro]
Shhh!
Hello?
Gangsta! Gangsta! (Hahaha)
Gangsta! Gangsta! (You ain’t gangsta)
Gangsta! Gangsta! (Nice try)
Gangsta! Gangsta! (Aha aha)
Sudden smoke

[Hook]
You ain’t no (Gangsta!), you ain’t no (Gangsta!)
You just somebody tryna act like you a (Gangsta!), like you a (Gangsta!)
But everybody know inside you ain’t no (Gangsta!), you ain’t no (Gangsta!)
You just somebody tryna act like you a (Gangsta!), like you a (Gangsta!)
But you ain’t, you ain’t
You ain’t no (Gangsta!), you ain’t (Gangsta!)
You think you know about the streets and know them (Gangsta!), and know them (Gangsta!)
But everybody know you wanna be a (Gangsta!), to be a (Gangsta!)
You think you know about the streets and know them (Gangsta!), and know them (Gangsta!)
But you don’t, you don’t

[Verse 1]
Turn on the radio
Yes I’m crazy don’t it?
They say the streets want dat
Well I guess we need to take a vote
And see who’s really in main control
And who’s in charge of the daily show
Is that really you when you makin’ them songs?
Or just tryna find you a way to get on?
Don’t think this industry real
So fuck what I say, I prolly get deal
From Decatur all the way to 

[?]
I done been there and I live there still
Am I comin’ through clear? Joe
Turn up my mic, maybe I can’t hear
Maybe I’m a lyin' ass nigga and I’m lookin’ at the wrong motherfucker in my rearview mirror
Yeah they say I’m lyin’
That ain’t B.o.B who be at there, grindin’
And crowd ain’t wavin’ their arms at me when I rap
They shoutin’ at the nigga behind me
So leave your destiny come my way
Cause you can’t see the hood on MySpace
Gangsta! Gangsta!

[Hook]
You ain’t no (Gangsta!), you ain’t no (Gangsta!)
You just somebody tryna act like you a (Gangsta!), like you a (Gangsta!)
But everybody know inside you ain’t no (Gangsta!), you ain’t no (Gangsta!)
You just somebody tryna act like you a (Gangsta!), like you a (Gangsta!)
But you ain’t, you ain’t
You ain’t no (Gangsta!), you ain’t (Gangsta!)
You think you know about the streets and know them (Gangsta!), and know them (Gangsta!)
But everybody know you wanna be a (Gangsta!), to be a (Gangsta!)
You think you know about the streets and know them (Gangsta!), and know them (Gangsta!)
But you don’t, you don’t

[Verse 2]
Yeah they call you gangsta
But many entertainers all get famous
But guess who’s behind all the stars and singers
I can count them all on all my fangas
For the past two decades
Been like a million niggas in this game
And it ain’t no way that it’s by mistake
That er’body just somehow sound the same, the shame
Now let’s brainwash a brain
Play one song over and over again
But only if it’s talkin’ ‘bout cars and bling
So kids growin’ up real hard to raise
Tryna be gangstas and ball away

Ay
How you spell America?
M-O-N-E-Y, hey
A million ways to win, a million ways to die
They ain't teach you how to make it, gotta improvise
A fight to get the biggest slice out the biggest pie
Wars for peace, wars for freedom, ha ha ha
But war don't really got a finish line, hey
Is it really gentrified or just genocide?
Is it for the civilized or assembly lines?
Corporate enterprise, eat off all your prison time, hey
When you commit a crime, now it's dinner time
It's not the money it's the greed that conceals ya
They say it's not the cancer it's the chemo that kills ya

[Hook]
What a sight, what a sight, what a sight
When the fire has started to rise
And then the people would say
Shoutin' "We run the night"
Sayin' "We run the night", yeah
What a sight, what a sight, what a sight
When the fire has started to rise
And then the people would say
Shoutin' "We run the night"
Sayin' "We run the night", yeah

[Verse 2]
Look, who put the con in economy?
Probably the same ones that put the sun in astronomy
Common sense ain't as common as one would think
To program you they do it subconsciously
You such a patriot
Down for your country but your country never gave a shit
Am I citizen here or am I just paying rent?
I think I finally understand just what the matrix is
What my location is
And niggas all anti this and anti that
Well you so anti everything that you anti black
And you so anti violence that you anti strap
Now you look hella unprepared when it's time to attack, bands

[Hook]
What a sight, what a sight, what a sight
When the fire has started to rise
And then the people would say
Shoutin' "We run the night"
Sayin' "We run the night", yeah
What a sight, what a sight, what a sight
When the fire has started to rise
And then the people would say
Shoutin' "We run the night"
Sayin' "We run the night", yeah
I don't know what's behind me
I couldn't tell you where she is
Images remind me
Of a time when we were kids

I know she knows we've got our own two worlds to live
Cuz she said:
You and me are lost

I can't speak for you

I could be wrong in saying
Everything falls into place
She wakes up early praying
Searching inside makes her day

I know she knows we've got our own two worlds to live
Cuz she said:
You and me are lost

I can't speak for you
I can't speak for you
Look at the sun
Look at the red behind your eyes
Look at the way everything fades

[Verse 1]
We're just walking, you and I
I can see it when I close my eyes
Hand in hand, side by side
Through a European dream tonight

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And you never see me
Struggling through my scene
That's what she loved about me
That's what she loved about me

[Chorus 1]
Take me there, take me there
I'm full of love that I'd love to share
My field to plow, my seed to sow
Once led me astray now it's leading me home

[Verse 2]
There's a star, there's a light
There's a celebration in your eyes
And it's silly though I try
What a funny world I live inside

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And I look the same
But I'm changing every single day
That's what she loved about me
That's what she loved about me

[Chorus 2]
Take me there, take me there
Some heart of gold says it's real, yeah, yeah
And polishes all my sinking stones
They drag me downtown where I'm never alone
The sky was red, he stared ahead
I saw him tread, one step more
Gets out of bed, he fills with dread
His dreams are dead, money makes him poor
He's been misled
Life's flown overhead
Overhead
Overhead
Ohhhhh
There's a bird trapped in his head but he ignores it instead
And his spirit has long fled and now he is hard to the core
She could have lead him to the rich sky
Wonders why she's not around anymore
He's been misled
Life's flown overhead
Overhead
Overhead
Ohhhhh
He said I can lead you to the red sky
If you just stop asking why
If you just stop asking why
If you just stop asking why
Why
And I said I will reach deep down inside
And stare with you ahead and give you all my red
And put it in your head and in your heart
And I will part and you will stay
But I will still dream of one day
Might not be so far away
Might not be so far away
Awake from your slumber
You’ve been sleeping far too long
Your eyes have been shut tight
I’d like to pry them wide for just one day
I found your naked body
Out in the fields
An empty shell down in a well
I’m sure it felt like hell
You had blood on your hands
And mud on your feet
And i said hey i knew i’d meet you one day
And like the wind from the east
I swept you away
I swept you away
I swept you away
And like the wind from the east
I swept you away
I swept you away
I swept you
I swept you
I swept you away
Then you rose from the day
Gave your eyes to the sun
And you looked at me
Said i’m not the only one
Music came back to your ears
And you danced and you danced
For all of the years
You’d forgotten how
To live for the now
We got footsteps moving slow we got less
Power and more control we got a man up there
Who's so big and bold it's getting old
Well i was walking in the garden and the first
Signs of morning were pewing through the l
Leaves and my blue suede shoes were collecting
Dew and the path it was leading back to you you
You you you
Well I was walking in the cathedral and the
Stained glass windows were shining down on
Me and the whispering voices were echoing
Inside and the candles they were burning just
For you you you you you
Well I've walked I've walked as far as my feet
Love go and I've tripped I've fallen on the muddy
Road but the path to home can't always be
Chosen by you or me is this the way it's gonna be
Oh no I hope you see me when the day is done I
Never knew I never dreamed of anyone like you
You you you you you
We got footsteps moving slow we got less
Power and more control we got a man up there
Who's so big and bold it's getting old
We've got footsteps moving slow we got less
Power and more control we got a man up there
Who's so big and bold it's getting old
We got footsteps moving slow we got less
Power and more control we got a man up there
Who's so big and bold its getting old

[Verse 1]
I'm back to the basics, Ya'll Masturbating
S.O.D catching cases in different places
I'm Kill Bill for real, S.O.D we here
I'm on some legendary shit bitch my flow is eternal
Smoking kush blunts, Writing bars in my journal
Nah fuck a journal writing bars in my brain
Cause i'm free-styling off the top of my membrane
All my guns is blasting, Lyrics everlasting
Yahhh Yahhh Trick yeah bitch call it magic
Kill Bill I will with the steel
I'm here for real, One mill. done deal
Got me to the money, Show me to this dummy
Sit back and take a toast, Now this nigga went ghost
Couldn't been intelligent, Ran inside his residence
Slipped past the security just like they did the president
Music rap game bitch why would i leave?
Don't compare me to him bitch i'm in my own league
I'm getting to the cheese, Spit my shit in Portuguese
I'm so hot like 35967439 degrees
I'ts an astonishment, When I get on the mic these rappers feel like they on punishment
Your favorite rapper's checking in just like its a hotel
Five star bitches on my dick boy oh well

[Bridge]
Pass me the candlestick
Lining up the canibus

Pass me the drough bruh
Yeah we bout' to roll up

[Chorus]
And i'm about to Kill Bill
Kill Bill
Nigga I said Kill Bill
Kill Bill

[Verse 2]
I'm on my Obama shit yeah its official
Presidential, Collar pop like a pimple
Old school game, Just like Atari
Mac'n on bitches, Just like Safari
One foot on the pavement and one foot in the milky way
And I'm soaring
Soaring

My branches scrape the sea of stars
My roots dig deep into this world of ours
And I'm grounded
Grounded

My reality is what I perceive
What I attract into my orbit
Worries fade into the haze
The air feels different this time 'round
Different this time 'round

Let's set sail
Start a fire
Learn to live a little higher
Let's pick the lock
Grab the reigns
Forget there ever were chains
'Cause there never were chains
Never were chains
Days move on and times they change
In a blink of an eye things rearrange
We're moving
Moving
We're sucked in and we're spat out
On the other side of the rabbit hole
But we find our way
Find our way

Do you want to be just a machine in this crazy society?
Pick the lock
Grab the reigns
Forget there ever were chains
'Cause there never were chains
Babe have you seen those leaves on the ground
At first they shone from the pavement in gold red and brown
And they've been trampled on and ridden over

And they're just sludge lying around
And I think it's time to leave this town

The trees whisper secrets of summer's love affairs
Of the carelessness tomfoolery that happened everywhere
But as the doors close
And the wind blows
The city sleeps
And the sky weeps
And I know I know
I know it's time to leave this town
Oh no you won't see me hanging around

But babe I'll be back
When the sun starts to seep through the leaves
When I can sing you a song
As you sing along
On these magic berlin streets
With our night riding
Midnight gliding
Morning dancing
Pavement prancing
You know oh you know
You know I'll be back to live this town
Oh you know I'll be back to love this town

[Hook]

And if one these fuck niggas talk bout robbin me

In Zone 1 they treat me like a king
Ok, fuck with Dre is a killing spree
To my bitch on the shopping spree
Hit the plug for 100 a Ps

[Verse]
Ripping my wrist till it bleeds
Smoking gelato, I'm hanging with the OG's

In a bugatti with a felony
Runnin from 12 I know they after me
Switchin to sixth gear you know Im flyin man
Pick up the pack in an audi like i am iron man
Hop out the coupe with arm, man
But playin' with Soulja, the draco bullets start flyin'
I got niggas that love hatin since weve been babies
Bust down particularly, hit me for the 80
Put a 30 in a Draco and then '0380
I stand in the kitchen, my track going crazy
I rerocked a brick bought my bitch a mercedes
I got shooters that love hatin, babies in the Vegas
I bet a 100k, I know that they hate it
Dray him my phone, say to the nigga, "We made it."

When I'm walking down the street, I'm just doin my thang
I'm singing in the shower like I sing in the rain
I'm blessed with every hour, second, day
I could take a breath, refresh to free
And better yet, me, true to my name
Kev Nish on a Sunday, who wanna play
Flip flops and socks, reeboks and tank tops
Hot dogs, coleslaw and my old boombox
Pumping old hip hop, 5 dog, snoop dogg, Tim dog
Then call my pops, waddup dog
LA, ain't the same less
I'm a do me, we can do we, individuality
Hustle for cheese
Struggle to feed
I'ma give a dollar for you, nothing deep
I could pop my collar for you, pass me the green
I'ma write a lyric or two, that's doing me

I got soul man
I'm ice cold man
I'm in control man
Cause I'm an old man
I got my own plans, my own shoes to fill
They laced up and I'm dressed to kill
Strolling down the boulevard
Honeys in their car drivin by looking hella hot
Pumping out their whip, Charging out like a credit card
Digging out my style even though I ain't living large
I'm a superstar but my cash on layway
Keep it sideline while I do things my way
'Cause I know in time, I'ma rise like the crime rate
I'm standing on my own two homies so life's great
I'm sitting sideways right hand on the steering wheel
On the freeway switching lanes, do it how I feel
I ain't looking for advice, so keep your lips sealed
I'm just doing me, do you and that's real

[Verse 3: J-Splif]
Raise your head to the sky 'cause we lacing the funk
We intertwined, you and I, let me say you with love
Now spread it 'round the table
'Cause I'm sick of the blood dripping in my neighbourhood
Hold your three fingers up
I come in peace from the east and my smile is free
Don't be afraid, do the same instead of pressing delete
I got faces to meet, and many places to see
A gang of friends around the world
If I wanna change scenes
Homie check these Steeles
I stroll at my own pace
In Retro Nikes I've come a long way
Looking fresh to debts
Looking for skirts to chase
'Cause I love the females like I love LA, yay
I see this lady along to my right
So I approach closer, I need to say hi
Know this chick got baggage 'cause she definitely fly
I'm just doing me, later I'll be doing you right

[Interlude]
Relax your mind and let your concious be free
Relax your mind and move to the melody
Relax your mind and let your soul be free

Relax your mind and move to the melody
Relax your mind and let your soul be free
Do you like we do 'cause I'ma do me

You were gonna come to me
And here you are

Make me your one and only
But don't make me your enemy
Your enemy

Perfect storm?
Cause once you're mine
Once you're mine

[Verse 2: Juicy J]
She's a beast, I call her Karma
She eat your heart out like Jeffrey Dahmer
Be careful, try not to lead her on
Shawty's heart is on steroids, cause her love is so strong
You may fall in love when you meet her
If you get the chance you better keep her
She's sweet as pie but if you break her heart
She turn cold as a freezer
That fairy tale ending with a knight in shining armor
She can be my sleeping beauty, I'm gon' put her in a coma (Woo!)
Damn, I think I love her, shawty's so bad, I'm sprung and I don't care
She ride me like a roller coaster, turn the bedroom into a fair
Her love is like a drug, I was tryna hit it and quit it
But lil mama so dope, I messed around and got addicted

[Chorus: Katy Perry]
So you wanna play with magic?
Boy, you should know what you're falling for
Baby, do you dare to do this?
Cause I'm coming at you like a dark horse
Are you ready for?
Ready for?

Perfect storm?
Cause once you're mine
Once you're mine
There's no going back

We on the phone every night till quarter past two
Picking a fight like we live on paper view
I'm out of air, need to give a brah some space
I don't care, 'cause this ain't the time nor place
I'm through with you, and back to me
Find a leave, Kev Nish living half a league

[Verse 2: J-Splif]
You can call me selfish but I need my space
Delete you of my list, us two is passé
Time to party, the wicked witch is dead
No more fighting for the sheets, put your ass in bed
You're all I needed so please give the step in
Don't ever call again and don't ever leave a message
It was good livin', time to set myself free
I don't care about your feelings, it's all about me

[Hook: Mary Jane]
I won't play no more games
Ain't no shame, in my way
It's not about you, you
It's all about me, me
All I need is some time
To get my peace of mind
It's not about you, you
It's all about me, me

[Verse 3: Prohgress]
Goddamnit girl, why you call agian
Give me some room, I need the oxygen
You know me, I gotta concentrate
So I ain't really have time for us to conversate
Ain't much for you to contemplate
'Cause we had our time, now be on your way (See ya)
I got a past like 

[?]
Why you take it serious, it was just a date

[Interlude]
Say hey, hey it's all about me
I ain't got what you looking for
Pass it on, move along

[Hook: Mary Jane]
All I need is some time
To get my peace of mind
It's not about you, you
It's all about me, me

[Verse 4: All]
And I don't waste no time, I'm at the club at 8
And I don't wait in line, you know how I play
Tonight's all about me, I'm the VIP
I ain't looking for love, so love better find me
Loving what I'm doing, it ain't that confusing
You ain't coming home so I'm gonna have to keep it moving
Y'all know how we do it, never stop the music
Keep the party going with the far east movement

[Hook: Mary Jane]
I won't play no more games
Ain't no shame, in my way
It's not about you, you
It's all about me, me
All I need is some time
To get my peace of mind
It's not about you, you
It's all about me, me
It's time to unwind
Leave your problems behind
It's not about you, you
It's all about me, me
All I need is tonight
To get my peace of mind
It's not about you, you
It's all about me, me

[Outro: J-Splif]
Shut the do', there's a draft coming in

[PK] This one's called beauty
Beauty is in the eyes of the beholder
But what if the only person that thought you were beautiful dies

[Hook: Tron]
I like the way you flow back and so
I like the way you flow back and so
I like the way you flow back and so
I like the way you flow back and so
Beautified is so beautified
Beautified is so beautified
Beautified is so beautified
Beautified is so beautified

[Verse 1: Prohgress]
I remenisce when I'm missing you
Can't dodge feelings when I'm drinking
My thining is blue
An angel with no wings, you fly the most
The reason why I push for these shows on the east coast
Had a chance you might discover
The love we had is younger
Kids what's unlike others
We share the different summer
It was special, like each one of God's creations
And to keep my word to you is my morning motivation
I hear you doing good, as we both know you should
One day I hope your talent brings you back to Hollywood
But until our paths cross I'ma keep my fingers crossed
And reflect our love lost
If you're listening at this moment you must think that I'm crazy
For the last time we met you've gone from girl to a lady
But it's one thing that I'm not embarassed of
'Cause everyone in this world has felt the first love

[Hook: Tron]
I like the way you flow back and so
I like the way you flow back and so
I like the way you flow back and so
I like the way you flow back and so
Beautified is so beautified
Beautified is so beautified
Beautified is so beautified
Beautified is so beautified

[Verse 2: Kev Nish]
I was chilling out way in this sway
If miss is ever gonna pass by me
A sudden day at the dock of the bay
Sun beating down on me like my grandpappy
Hold a sec, let me tell you, since she ain't come 'round
She like 5'3", dark skin, light on the pounds
With a face finer than mother Earth's natural
And them legs gracing that mini skirt, dancing wild
In a way, she make my Dickies hurt, crack a smile
She make a well rounded fella act unpractical
See this scar on my cheeck, I was catching a peek
Climbing the oak tree by the Creek on Elwood street
I'm spending weeks waiting outside of the ice cream ring
And when she working 9 to 5 she my ice cream queen
She never noticed I'm alive, but today she'll see
I bought a rose for miss era if she smile for me, please

[Hook: Tron & J-Splif]
I like the way you flow back and so
(Everytime you pass by)
I like the way you flow back and so
(Butterflies in my stomach thinking what to say next)
Beautified is so beautified
(You made me pour chicken soup over my sofa)
Beautified is so beautified
(For the very first time, I was sold)

[Outro]
Beautified is so beautified
Beautified is so beautified
Beautified is so beautified
Beautified is so beautified
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

[Hook]
Sit down, shut the fuck up
All my live motherfuckers get your hands up
Just say you, just say you
Just say we don't wanna hear it no more
Sit down, shut the fuck up
All my live motherfuckers get your hands up
Just say you, just say you
Just say we don't wanna hear it no more

[Verse 1]
Attention, time for action
Fuck the robots if they people bashing
Seen them take a hit with the chain reaction
Oh my God, three asian kids rapping?
Live and direct with the culture shock
I'ma transform mines like an autobot
Stand there, far away, 'cause I made the rock
Don't twist my arm 'cause it's made to pop
And embrace the terminator jack in my pants
I say fuck the dollar bill, suck and take it away
Throw Watts at the meter, man, jacking for change
Fuck the robots 'cause they all look the same

[Hook]
Sit down, shut the fuck up
All my live motherfuckers get your hands up
Just say you, just say you
Just say we don't wanna hear it no more
Sit down, shut the fuck up
All my live motherfuckers get your hands up
Just say you, just say you
Just say we don't wanna hear it no more

[Verse 2]
Streetlights is out, can't see my city
Kneedeep in hate, strongarmed and ready
Liquor stores lit up, little kids lit up
Knocking on your doors for years and now we fed up
Fuck the law, for years they suppress
Ready to a car bomb strapped to my chest
It's a true makeover, ready to call the silence
We the raw meat in the jungle full of lions
Sparks fly like the fourth of july
It's all been a lie, so we had a 4-29
The smoke is so think I couldn't see ahead of me
Wonder why we're fighting with the wrong enemy
And beat the trash if you've had enough
We do this for the love, three fingers up
Never seen, never heard, keep your face high
Get off your asses the movement ain't televised

[Hook]
Sit down, shut the fuck up
All my live motherfuckers get your hands up
Just say you, just say you
Just say we don't wanna hear it no more
Sit down, shut the fuck up
All my live motherfuckers get your hands up
Just say you, just say you
Just say we don't wanna hear it no more

[Verse 3]
There's a war going on where you least expect it
Inside the mind, the robots infested
Be yourself, let your true colors shine
We don't need clones, so pick your own life
Yeah, locked and loaded I'm ready for battle
If you ain't take the lead then follow my shadow
Take the saddle  straight from the horse's lips
I've seen this shit, I ain't just reporting it
Ain't nothing changed but the face and the names
So ain't no escape in this race that I claim
Stand up for your people, we placing the blame
On the motherfucking robots, they all look the same
And beat the trash if you've had enough
We do this for the love, three fingers up
Never seen, never heard, keep your face high
Get off your asses the movement ain't televised

[Hook]
Sit down, shut the fuck up
All my live motherfuckers get your hands up
Just say you, just say you
Just say we don't wanna hear it no more
Sit down, shut the fuck up
All my live motherfuckers get your hands up
Just say you, just say you
Just say we don't wanna hear it no more

[Hook: Prohgress]
I got a mic in my hand with something to say
Everyday represent Californ-I-A
Sit back take a trip down memory lane
Everyday represent Californ-I-A

[Verse 1: Prohgress & J-Splif]
We was young then
Back when we couldn't get a pack of cigarettes
Back when we couldn't say that a brother changes
Back when every day was another day
Breaking rules, skipping school when we getting high
Chilling back in the caravan spitting rhymes
On the block 5-0 try to chase me
We bone out freestyle onto the main speed
We are the one now we having fun
Each pound on the ten and we practicing
To the double 1-0 we ain't seen no
With some mean hoes blowing halloween smoke
At the hotel room where we popping beers
Like another 1-2 'cause our homie's here
And our cousin Kev Nish from the C-Town
Last piece of the puzzle we complete now

[Hook: Prohgress]
I got a mic in my hand with something to say
Everyday represent Californ-I-A
Sit back take a trip down memory lane
Everyday represent Californ-I-A

[Verse 2: Kev Nish]
I'm from the town where the stars don't shine
Smog in the air be impaired in your eyes
Hope stays afloat that the rivers stay dry
It's the FM crew kicking L.A. rhymes right
The mind state ain't the same out here
We got them hoes with the holla top
Bucket with a drop top
Friends that know friends that say they know 2Pac
Cousins of that friend got a video of Snoop Dogg
Chicken and waffles, baking red corn dogs
Cruising sunset, now we rolling down 

[?]
Seat back, feel that, we know where we at
California love on the subs, no feedback
Friday night favors, "Mr. Chuck, we need crack"
Wake up, wake up, revolution bring the beat check
L.A. to the yay, C-town to the day gone
Throwing back the Cali in the place

[Hook: Prohgress]
I got a mic in my hand with something to say
Everyday represent Californ-I-A
Sit back take a trip down memory lane
Everyday represent Californ-I-A

[Verse 3: All]
Don't forget how this love started
We was in it all the way, never half hearted
Breaking rules, skipping school, but we getting wise
Dollar signs ain't the reason that we getting signed
But the dollar signs keep alive family ties
I got a back pain digging 

[?] you and I
On the grind see the stars bright lights
Ain't nothing changed
Move east around the world till we're back in L.A
Backstage elevate, rolling a J
Zone out, concentrate, stretching my legs
Freestyle, meditate, uh, nothing to say
As the lights go off play the beat DJ
Now raise your hands from side to side
Far East Movement in the house tonight
Kick old school rhymes for you to feel
Put your hands in the air if you keeps it real
Now raise your hands from side to side
Far East Movement in the house tonight
Kick old school rhymes for you to feel
Put your hands in the air if you keeps it real

[Hook: Prohgress]
I got a mic in my hand with something to say
Everyday represent Californ-I-A
Sit back take a trip down memory lane
Everyday represent Californ-I-A

[Verse 1: Tory Lanez]
Yeah, okay, I'm blowin' money fast but no, they don't call me Rick
Fresh up out that Callie, Louis duffle full of sticks
I know what to look so white, mama named Vicky
I told her stop suckin', girl, you givin' me a hickie
Name's on the record, wonder on the beat
Get your stamped out like we're drummin' with the feet
I'm a D Wade nigga, swipe it, comin' with the Heat
Lamborghini bird, it be hummin' when it speak
Know I'm in the buildin' like my desk up in the office
Now my money longer, doin' neck up on an ostrich
I'm so f'in' gone that I've tested alcoholic
And yeah, I'm rappin' like I'm reppin' for my college

[Hook: Sean Kingston & Tory Lanez]
Messin' with the kid, no, yeah, I know a big hoe
Ride around town in my new Murcielago
Canada, oh woah
Canada, oh woah
I get the money pronto, sittin' in the condo
Better cuff your girl 'fore I fly her to Toronto
Canada, oh woah
Canada, oh woah

[Verse 2: Tory Lanez]
Boy, I'm back up in it like I'm flackin' with your main
High pay longer than the highway lane do
We be talkin' money, shawty, don't you like my ligo?
I ain't coughin' nothin', I just play 'em like a banjo
And your girl know I'm sippin' rum, rum
Give you tongue, tongue 'til I get it dumb, dumb
How I do it, I'm the new Sean Con
Money like a lawyer, got it in a lump some
Stuntin' in my Lambo, hotter than some combos
Don't you know the cash streak as far as the land go
Your girl moanin', Alanso
Tory Lanez's 'bout to take her far as it can though

[Hook: Sean Kingston & Tory Lanez]
Messin' with the kid, no, yeah, I know a big hoe
Ride around town in my new Murcielago
Canada, oh woah
Canada, oh woah
I get the money pronto, sittin' in the condo
Better cuff your girl 'fore I fly her to Toronto
Canada, oh woah
Canada, oh woah
All the creatures, on the beaches
Makin' waves in the motion picture
Won't you keep this, in between us
Search and seizure, wake up venus

The dollar bill will
Return the ill pill
Mom and Dad take your 'dont be sad' pill
Turn the screw and twist my language
Don't forsake me im contagious!

Theres a reason for the twenty-first century...
Not too sure but I know that its meant to be
And that it's meant to be

It's my favorite combination
Comin' down with the favored nations
Deep rotation, mutilation
Learn to give and take dictation
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
Like the Cain and Able
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
Time to run this table
There's a reason for the 21st Century
Not too sure but I know that's it's meant to be
And that it's meant to be

Read me your scripture and
Read me your scripture
Read me your scripture and
I will twist it
Show me your wrist and I
Show me your wrist and
Show me your wrist and I'll
Kiss it kiss it
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
Like the Cain and Able
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
It's time to run this table

Simple Soldier, hand it over
Stop and read what you just told her
Strangulation , altercation
Of all the sex and good vibrations

There's a reason for the 21st Century
Not to sure but I know that's it's meant to be
And that it's meant to be yeah
There's a reason for the 21st Century
Not to sure but I know that's it's meant to be
And that it's meant to be

[Verse 1]
Restless nights in Tokyo
Wanna hear all the sounds and see all the sights
From the Champs-Élysées to the Gundam Cafe
Gonna eat so much fish, I think I'm gonna be sick
Gonna blow all my cash on anime (Yes)
Don't try to stop (Yes) because I'm over 9,000 (Yes)
Just point me to (Yes) the pachinko machines (Yes)
I think I'm Kenshiro (Yes), I think that I'm Goku (Yes)
Can I just stay one more day?

[Refrain]
Reckless nights in Tokyo
Oh my God, it's Tokyo

[Verse 2]
It was premeditated, tried to get someone pregnant
It wasn't her fault, I'm just kind of psychotic
Left on my own, I would never come back
I'd probably hide in the suicide forest (Shit!)
This all started when I was a boy
I went to the dentist and he gave me a toy
It was Dragon Ball Z, a wrist-slap bracelet
Goku fucking ruined me

[Outro]
A love affair with Tokyo
(I love you all the time)

[Verse 1]
I'm never alone, I look at my phone
If I call you up, you're never at home
I love you all the time

I'm fueled up and high, a man among guys
A smile on my face, no reason to cry
I love you all the time

[Chorus]
I can tell by that look in your eye
Kind of look that roams around and sees another guy
I can tell your going to take your love away
I can tell by that look in your eye
Kind of look that roams around and sees another guy
I would beg you if I thought it would make you stay

[Verse 2]
Ce soir c’est le soir
Hey toi avec moi
Into your boudoir
Très bien ooh la la
I love you all the time
Tu ne responses pas
Ah dit moi pourquoi
This ain't au revoir
Together voilà
I love you all the time

[Chorus]
I can tell by that look in your eye
Kind of look that roams around and sees another guy
I can tell you're gonna take your love away
I can tell by that look in your eye
Kind of look that roams around and sees another guy
I would beg you if I thought it would make you stay

I would beg if I thought it would make you stay
I would beg if I thought it would make you stay
Ah dit moi pourquoi
Ah dit moi pourquoi
Ah dit moi pourquoi

[Intro]
Bedding Taylor Swift every night inside the Oculus Rift
After mister and the missus finish dinner and the dishes

[Pre-Chorus]
And now the future's definition is so much higher than it was last year
It's like the images have all become real
And someone's living my life for me out in the mirror

[Chorus]
No, can you believe how far we've come?
In the new age
Freedom to have what you want
In the new age we'll all be entertained
Rich or poor, the channels are all the same
You're a star now, baby, so dry your tears
You're just like them
Wake on up from the nightmare

[Post-Chorus]
Na, na na, na, na na, na na, na na
Na, na na, na, na na, na na, na na
Come on, oh, oh, oh

[Bridge]
No gods to rule us
No drugs to soothe us
No myths to prove stuff
No love to confuse us
Not bad for a race of demented monkeys
From a cave to a city to a permanent party
Come on, oh, oh, oh

[Outro]
When the historians find us we'll be in our homes
Plugged into our hubs
Skin and bones
A frozen smile on every face
As the stories replay
This must have been a wonderful place

[Verse 1]
Take off, little winged creature
It's nothing but teens in ravines
And antics on concrete down here
And are you really as free as all the great songs would have me believe?
Let me tell you why some day, birdie, you're gonna envy me
Some dream of a world written in lines of code
Well, I hope they engineer out politics, romance, and edifice
Two outta three ain't bad
Some envision a state governed by laws of business
Merger and acquisition instead of violence on nations
Where do I sign up?

[Verse 2]
Take off, little winged creature
It's nothing but fallen debris, strollers, and babies down here
And you may be up in the sky
But our paradigms are just as deep and just as wide
What with all our best attempts at transcendence
Something's bound to take
Soon, we'll live in a global culture devoid of gender or race
There's just one tiny line:
You're either born behind or you're free to peek inside
Life as just narrative, metadata in aggregate
Where the enigma of humanity's wrapped up finally
That, as they say, is that

[Outro]
Oh, that day can't come soon enough
It'll be so glorious
When they finally find out what's bugging us

[Verse 1]
Naturally the dying man wonders to himself:
Has commentary been more lucid than anybody else?
And had he successfully beaten back the rising tide
Of idiots, dilettantes, and fools
On his watch while he was alive
Lord, just a little more time

[Refrain]
Oh, in no time at all
This'll be the distant past, ooh

[Verse 2]
So says the dying man once I'm in the box
Just think of all the overrated hacks running amok
And all of the pretentious, ignorant voices that will go unchecked
The homophobes, hipsters, and one percent
The false feminists he'd managed to detect
Oh, who will critique them once he's left?

[Refrain]
Oh, in no time at all
This'll be the distant past

[Bridge]
What he'd give for one more day to rate and analyze
The world made in his image as of yet to realize
What a mess to leave behind

[Verse 3]
Eventually the dying man takes his final breath
But first checks his news feed to see what he's 'bout to miss
And it occurs to him a little late in the game
We leave as clueless as we came
From the rented heavens to the shadows in the cave
We'll all be wrong someday

[Outro]
Oh, oh, oh

[Verse 1]
Dance like a butterfly and drink like a fish
If you're bent on taking demons down with only your fist
And I've never known anyone who could lose himself in a bigger paper bag
The weaker the signal, the sweeter the noise
Hunching over an instrument that you now employ
Like the starvation army needs a marching piano in the band
Are you feeling used? I do

[Chorus 1]
Oh, I was pissing on the flame
Like a child with cash or a king on cocaine
I've got the world by the balls
Am I supposed to behave?

[Post-Chorus]
What a fraud
What a con
You're the only one I love

[Verse 2]
It's easy to assume that you've built some rapport
With a someone who only likes you for what you like yourself for
Okay, you be my mirror but remember there are only a few angles I tend to prefer
I'm only here to serve

[Chorus 2]
Oh, I was pissing on the flame
Like a child with cash or a king on cocaine
I've got the world by the balls
Am I supposed to behave?
Oh, I was dancing 'round the flame
Like a high-wire act with a "who, me?" face
I was living on nothing but water and cake

[Post-Chorus]
What a fraud
What a con
You're the only one I love

[Outro]
One I love, one I love

[Verse 1]
When the god of love returns there'll be hell to pay
Though the world may be out of excuses
I know just what I would say:
Let the seven trumpets sound as a locust sky grows dark
But first let's take you on a quick tour of your creation's handiwork
Barely got through the prisons and stores
And the pale horse looks a little sick
Says, "Jesus, you didn't leave a whole lot for me
If this isn't hell already then tell me, what the hell is?"

[Chorus 1]
And we say it's just human, human nature
This place is savage and unjust
We crawled out of the darkness
And endured your impatience
We're more than willing to adjust
And now you've got the gall to judge us

[Verse 2]
The spider spins his web, the tiger stalks his prey
And we steal fire from the heavens to try to keep the night at bay
Every monster has a code
One that steadies the shaking hand
And he's determined to accrue more capital
By whatever means he can

[Chorus 2]
Oh, it's just human, human nature
We've got these appetites to serve
You must not know the first thing about human beings
We're the earth's most soulful predator
Try something less ambitious the next time you get bored
Oh, my Lord

[Outro]
We just want light in the dark
Some warmth in the cold
And to make something out of nothing
Sounds like someone else I know

[Verse 1]
When my personal demons are screaming
And when my door of madness is half-open

[Chorus 1]
You stand alongside
And say something to the effect that everything'll be
Alright soon, smoochie

[Verse 2]
Chaos attends to creation
And when the shadows inside me vie for attention

[Chorus 2]
You stand alongside
And say something perfect like "concealment feeds the fear"
And hand me a sea peach
And say, "Come, come over here, smoochie"

[Verse 1]
One side says "Y'all go to hell."
The other says "If I believed in God, I'd send you there."
But either way we make some space
In the hell that we create
On both sides

[Verse 2]
One side says "Kill 'em all."
The other says "Line those killers up against the wall."
But either way some blood is shed
Thanks to our cooperation
On both sides, on both sides

[Verse 3]
One side says "Man, take what's yours!"
The other says "Live on no more than you can afford."
But either way we just possess
And everyone ends up with less
On both sides, on both sides

[Verse 1]
What's there to lose
For a ghost in a cheap rental suit
Clinging to a rock that is hurtling through space?
And what's to regret
For a speck on a speck on a speck
Made more ridiculous the more serious he gets?
Oh, it's easy to forget

[Interlude]

[Verse 2]
Oh, I read somewhere
That in twenty years
More or less
This human experiment will reach its violent end
But I look at you
As our second drinks arrive
The piano player's playing "This Must Be the Place"
And it's a miracle to be alive
One more time

[Outro]
There's nothing to fear
There's nothing to fear
There's nothing to fear

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
That was the last New Year I'll ever see
I wanna stay on that magic mountain
With lost souls and beautiful women
I drank some of Farmer's potion
And we were moving in slow motion

[Chorus 1]
The slower, the better
The slower, the better
'Cause there's no one old on magic mountain
There's no one old, old on magic mountain

[Verse 2]
And that was the very last barn I'm burning
So for now everyone is dancing
As if it's any time but the present
So for now every young thing in my path
I'll hold their face so long inside my hands

[Chorus 2]
The longer, the better
The longer, the better
'Cause there's no one old on magic mountain
There's no one old, old on magic mountain

[Verse 3]
The wine has all been emptied, the smoke has cleared
As people file back to the valley
On the last night of life's party
These days the years thin till I can't remember
Just what it feels like to be young forever

[Chorus 3]
So the longer I stay here
The longer there's no future
So I'm growing old on magic mountain
I'm growing old, old on magic mountain

[Verse 1]
It got too hot and so we overthrew the system
'Cause there's no place for human existence like right here
On this bright blue marble orbited by trash
Man, there's no beating that
It was no big thing to give up the way of life we had, oh
My social life is now quite a bit less hectic
The nightlife and the protests are pretty scarce
Now I mostly spend the long days walking through the city
Empty as a tomb
Sometimes I miss the top of the food chain
But what a perfect afternoon

[Verse 2]
Industry and commerce toppled to their knees
The gears of progress halted
The underclass set free
The super-ego shatters with our ideologies
The obscene injunction to enjoy life
Disappears as in a dream
And as we return to our native state
To our primal scene
The temperature, it started dropping
The ice floes began to freeze

[Verse 3]
From time to time we all get a bit restless
With no one advertising to us constantly
But the tribe at the former airport
Some nights has meat and dancing
If you don't mind gathering and hunting
We're all still pretty good at eating on the run
Things it would have been helpful to know before the revolution
Though I'll admit some degree of resentment
For the sudden lack of convenience around here
But there are some visionaries among us developing some products
To aid us in our struggle to survive
On this godless rock that refuses to die
“What has been is what will be,
and what has been done is what will be done,
and there is nothing new under the sun.

Is there a thing of which it is said,
‘See, this is new?’
It has been already
in the ages before us.

There is no remembrance of former things,
nor will there be any remembrance
of later things yet to be
among those who come after.”
- Ecclesiastes

Pure Comedy is the story of a species born with a half-formed brain. The species’ only hope for survival, ﬁnding itself on a cruel, unpredictable rock surrounded by other species who seem far more adept at this whole thing (and to whom they are delicious), is the reliance on other, slightly older, half-formed brains. This reliance takes on a few different names as their story unfolds, like “love,” “culture,” “family,” etc. Over time, and as their brains prove to be remarkably good at inventing meaning where there is none, the species becomes the purveyor of increasingly bizarre and sophisticated ironies. These ironies are designed to help cope with the species’ loathsome vulnerability and to try and reconcile how disproportionate their imagination is to the monotony of their existence.

Now all of a sudden they expect light in the dark, warmth in the cold, and to make something out of nothing. Cooperation among the species to achieve these goals eventually yields a worldview wherein some among the species believe that there are individuals for whom this type of work is maybe ill-suited. The contribution of the ill-suited is of a more abstract, inspirational nature. The ill-suited begin to make subtle distinctions among themselves that extend beyond “eaten by a bear/not eaten by a bear”. These distinctions involve do-it-ness, cool-face-and-body-ness, craftiness, etc. – an arrangement emerges where these traits can be traded in for better-than-ness. This better-than-ness really starts to run rampant, and the species begins to wonder if there isn’t a Sky-Man in the sky who is perhaps the source of all better-than-ness. It seems like a pretty good explanation for why the species is so important.

Sky-Man pretty much runs the show for a really, really long time, and his inner-circle of better-thans gets increasingly smaller and smaller, even though by the end of his reign everyone in the species considers themselves one. Unfortunately there are some better-thans who get together and decide that one way of better-than-ness is better than other betters-thans’ better-than-ness and teach their little half-formed-brain babies as much (most who interpret this distinction as “me’s” vs. “not-me’s”). “Not-me’s” eventually come to encapsulate everyone that is not a single “me” at any given time, and this paves the way for incredibly distasteful behavior until the species arrives at a place of such alienation and fear there is really nothing so horrible that one of them wouldn’t do to the other. To deal with this less than ideal state of affairs, which seems suspiciously incompatible with how progressive and evolved they are by this point, they set about to entertain themselves into an oblivion with politics, sex, ﬁnance, philosophy, and other games of war. This they do until they are so numb, and the idea of any “not-me” so untenable, that they are blissfully incapable of noticing they’re all dead. This happens more or less on an inﬁnite loop until the end of time.
Something like that.

Imagine if you will, as the album starts, that you’re way out in space looking at the earth and, though it’s impossible to “fall” through space, you start a free fall anyway in the direction of the bright blue marble. For the next 75 minutes you plummet toward the earth, losing more and more perspective on what an abstract and impermanent place our planet is, how predictably we step on the same rakes, slip on the same banana peels over and over again through the ages, quickly becoming more and more immersed in the very messy business of being a human – the dubious privilege of being here, the elusiveness of meaning, true love and its habitual absence, random euphoria and the inexplicable misery of others, truth and its more alluring counterfeits, the sophistication of answers that don’t make any sense, the barbarism of our appetites, lucky breaks and injustice, faith and ignorance, crippling, mind-numbing boredom, and the terror of it all ending too soon. Before you know it, you’ve delicately crash-landed and ﬁnd yourself lying on your back looking up at the stars. If you’re lucky, with someone you love; even if just for a day, a year, a lifetime. Though just an hour has passed you have no recollection of what the earth looked like from the far-ﬂung reaches of space, nor how simple it all seemed a matter of minutes ago.

I know everyone doesn’t feel the same about what’s going on right now. What for some is clearly garden-variety violent white nationalism serving as a catch-all for any number of paranoia-induced anti-fantasies foisted upon the poor and uneducated precisely by the ideologues bent on manufacturing voters who can be manipulated into voting against their own interests by making good and sure they remain poor and uneducated before cravenly blaming their problems largely on people bearing distinctions like race, gender, and sexuality so people forget everything that’s good about the American experiment, is to others an opportunity to wrench the country back from the inﬂuence of hypocritical corporate tyrants bent on enslaving our minds with spineless liberal rhetoric in order to justify wiping out the jobs of decent people so they can fulﬁll their fey utopian dream of an impossible global community designed to proﬁt only its architects (probably Banking Consortiums, pedophile rings, and deﬁnitely The Illuminati).

This album does not espouse either of those views.

Both of those views take for granted a certain degree of sophistication, or at least a knack for cooperation, that I’m absolutely convinced humans do not possess; not to mention some kind of innate logic to the proceedings here on Earth – which make a much better case for being some kind of demented joke than anything else.

The terrifying reality concerning the dilemma above is everything is chaos and no one is really in control of anyone or anything.

But what about the well-documented history of humans making life a living hell for other humans since time began?

There is no intellectual, political, or spiritual explanation that will ever satisfy anyone for longer than a moment, least of all this, the only explanation with any dignity. The explanation that appeases both our instincts for compassion and liberation. The explanation that we can either accept and move forward together or keep screaming to our respective heavens, “Why, God, why?”

Things are the way they are because this is how we, the human race, want them.

This is how we want it.

Hold the motherfucking phone. Josh Tillman, you have said and done some stupid fucking things since we’ve known you, but this is too much.

Now the liberals and the conservatives are both outraged because that is a sentiment that is so profoundly insensitive to the ways in which the other side is clearly wrong in objective ways regarding basic decency, but what’s the alternative? We’re either all complicit in this purest comedy, or the people who aren’t to blame are at war with the people who are to blame until everyone is dead. Simple as that.

Is progress possible? What does it look like? The conversion of everyone to our respective beliefs? Well, we’ve seen how that typically goes. The destruction of everyone who fails to conform? That’s not it. The erection of institutions with the power and infrastructure to enforce a rule of law with the good of as many as possible at heart? Not much evidence for that panning out.
What I recommend is this: we return to the Vedic cycle and submit ourselves to the likelihood that many of us will end up getting eaten by bears. It’s only natural. What if instead of imbuing our expectations for the quality of our lives to include perpetual happiness, dream fulﬁllment, excessive painlessness, existential certitude, material wealth, and all variety of romantic stimulation, we were just grateful for every day that didn’t involve getting eaten by a bear? What if progress only meant literally progressing from one day to the next without getting violently dismembered by a 9-foot tall, 500-pound grizzly?

The irony here of course is that many more humans than we’d like to think, most of whom are not reading the interminable liner notes to a folk rock album, do live in daily, perpetual fear of getting killed by a mammal far more terrifying than a bear, and I think you know the one to which I refer. This form of mammal attack is made all the more nightmarish by virtue of the fact that the mammal in question kills purely ideologically. Bears kill because they’re hungry; they’re very reasonable in that way. So maybe we should submit ourselves to their authority. Bears we can trust.

Bottom line is that as long as we expect to live in such a way – immune to the natural laws of this godless rock that govern everything else here – human existence will continue to be a cruel joke. I fear, however, that it is too late for us to go back into the natural order. We have no desire to return to our primal scene. We like the way things are. We’ve got sandwiches when we’re hungry! Airplanes for when we want to go somewhere! Social media when we want our voices to be heard by all God’s creation! We know that these magical conveniences come at a staggering price, and that excess for the few is based on the scarcity of the many, but that’s why we invented the business of globalization! We’ve already built the wall! It’s a great, great wall that goes up to the heavens and is as transparent as museum glass. It’s a beautiful wall that winds surgically through nations, cities, neighborhoods, and sometimes even homes. It is a globe within a globe, and those who live within its interior are as clueless as to what’s happening on the other side as we are to what’s happening right now on the far side of Mars.

There’s only one creature that can penetrate that wall, friends, and it is bears. Bears can smash through that glass like a pitcher of sugar water through a brick wall. The equalizing revolution of bear justice is coming too. Sooner than you think. As it gets hotter and hotter, they’re coming. They’re coming into our neighborhoods, they’re coming into our schools, into our churches, into our banks, into our places of business, into our governments, into our beds.

The joke is that the best we can do is keep on keeping on, which we’ve proven ourselves pathologically adept at. We’re going to save the planet alright, and it will be a glorious sacriﬁce just like the Sky-Man we invented showed us how.

Bears, man.

[Chorus: Thundercat]
Let me show you, show you the way
On the edge of dark there's the brightest light
A burning light on the edge of dark
Where no one can tell they’re worlds apart
We'll live with dark, just take the ride

[Post-Chorus: Thundercat]
It's your boy Thundercat

[Verse 1: Thundercat]
Heavy-hearted, but my burden's light
I just wanna live, and learn how to fly
When it's all over, breathe into the light
Sink or swim, I'm not scared to die

[Interlude: Thundercat]
Tell 'em how you feel, Kenny
Kenny Loggins

[Verse 2: Kenny Loggins]
Your heart is struggling, baby
Trying to believe
That there might be something you just couldn't see
But what if I told you, babe
It’s all so easy?

[Chorus: Thundercat]
Let me show you, show you the way
On the edge of dark there's the brightest light
A burning light, on the edge of dark
Where no one can tell they're worlds apart
We'll live with dark, just take the ride

[Post-Chorus: Thundercat]
Ladies and gentlemen; Michael McDonald

[Verse 3: Michael McDonald]
Wake up and dream, tear down the wall
Of all you believe that might not be true
Long as love lies waiting there
Just hold your face into the light
Though right now you might not know why
Long as love lies waiting
They ain’t know our way, baby

[Chorus: Thundercat]
Let me show you, show you the way
On the edge of dark there's the brightest light
A burning light, on the edge of dark
Where no one can tell they're worlds apart
We'll live with dark, just take the ride

[Outro: Thundercat]
Hey, how's it going? This is your boy Thundercat
If you're gonna fill your water bottle with vodka
Always make sure you have a friend with a bottle that actually has water in it

[Intro]
That, that, that, that, that, that be Maaly Raw!

[Chorus: Quavo]
Pulled off in an Aston, ten hoes in a mansion
Only two of 'em natural, other eight all plastic
They don't wanna go to college but the brain intelligent
Make me wanna do the Heisman when I drink the right medicine
Ball player, ball player, crib in the Himalayas
Put my bitch in the streets, you put your bitch on the shelves
Big weight, fish scales, blue bird in the mail
Feelin' like Blue's Clues, here come the mail, I wanna yell

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Yeah, fuck up a check (fuck it up)

Bustin' it open, we bustin' at necks
I let it go when I bust in her mouth
She come in the kitchen, you love her to death (ew)
Kickin' that shit like Bruce Lee
Zone, zone, zone, no 2, 3

Stacking that paper like loose leaf
Pull up in the hood, we too deep
Big Maybach, like 'scuse me
My friends dead like Uzi's
I don't play with no goofies, hell no!

[Chorus: Quavo]
Pulled off in an Aston, ten hoes in a mansion
Only two of 'em natural, other eight all plastic
They don't wanna go to college but the brain intelligent
Make me wanna do the Heisman when I drink the right medicine

Extra percent for my assassin
Tell my shooters, "Do 'em nasty"
No witness, no evidence (no evidence)
Put 'em all in a casket

[Chorus: Quavo]
Pulled off in an Aston, ten hoes in a mansion
Only two of 'em natural, other eight all plastic
They don't wanna go to college but their brain intelligent
Make me wanna do the Heisman when I drink the right medicine
Ball player, ball player, crib in the Himalayas
Put my bitch in the streets, you put your bitch on the shelves
Big weight, fish scales, blue bird in the mail

[Bridge: Quavo]
Here come the mail, I wanna yell

[Chorus: Quavo]
Pulled off in an Aston, ten hoes in a mansion

[Intro]
Meow, meow
Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow
Meow, meow, meow

[Verse]
I wish I had nine lives
I bet it feels real nice
Sitting in the sun
Letting the rays wash over me
No one watching over me
I do what I want
Everybody wants to be a cat
It's cool to be a cat
Everything the light touches
It's where I will roam
My roar would be so powerful
I would scare off everything

[Bridge]
Cool to be a cat (Meow, meow, meow, meow)
Cool to be a cat (Meow, meow, meow, meow)
Cool to be a cat (Meow, meow, meow, meow)
Cool to be a cat

[Outro]
Meow, meow
Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow
Meow, meow, meow, meow
Meow

[Verse 1]
Sometimes you have to let go
To free fall away
I won't judge you anymore
'Cause sometimes I needed to
Free fall far away
Out of sight, out of mind

[Verse 2]
I'm so tired
Where can I lay my head?
I'll just close my eyes
Hope I wake up dead
Don't want to live without you
Don't leave me out here to die

[Outro]
Maybe another time and space
When I can look you in the face
Far, far away
Maybe in another life

[Verse]
Young drifting light
Drift on by
Shine on me
Then pass me by
Warm me up
Then leave me cold
And when I die
Cave into your light

[Chorus: Thundercat]
At the end of it all (End of it all)
No one wants to drink alone
Baby, that's how it goes
Don't walk away from me

[Verse 1: Thundercat]
Fragmented memories
Sentences incomplete
That's when she said
"Don't wanna put up a fight anymore
I'm down to the end of my rope
And I'm freefalling
I'll search inside myself
I need to know why I act this way"
A whisper turns to a scream
I can't ignore it no more

[Chorus: Thundercat]
At the end of it all (End of it all)
No one wants to drink alone
Baby, that's how it goes

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
From my eyewitness binoculars (Uh-huh)
To Argentina and Africa (Uh-huh)
We mastered the (What?) pressure (Yeah)
Hazardous (Uh-huh), harassing us (That's right)
You laugh at us (You did)
More accurate at bagging dimes, now we bagging rhymes
Body bags, price tags on your forehead
Nine times out of ten, young niggas are nine or ten
When the line becomes thin, be a killer or fireman
Fill up the lavish pen if I needed to right my wrongs
I can't deny sin, condolences through these palms
I remember when your cousin was coming home
I bitched while we plotted to kill him 'cause we ain't know him
Unfamiliar faces make niggas nervous
Convicted court cases might hit the surface
Restricted territories might come through lurkin'
We ain't want none of that urgent call
Well, I'ma act Turk and fall on my identity, Percocets
And for all the headaches, I'm 'bout to bring confetti
Tumble out this barrel soon as it ring, you ready?
That was the word 'fore we moved on 'em
Treat him like Joe the Plumber
I wonder if someone comin' can see this tool on him
Immature and retarded is what you call me
Your cousin wasn't coming home from the pen, but from the army
If I can right my wrongs and pen this verse I read
Even though a bullet hit him in the leg, still walk on by

[Chorus: Thundercat]
At the end of it all (End of it all)
No one wants to drink alone
Baby, that's how it goes
Don't walk away from me

[Verse 1]
Travel through the light
Holy, holy
Take me to the highest mountain
And the lowest seas
Glory of your light
Break through

[Verse 2]
I want to experience all the light has to offer me
Bathing in your glow
Patterns in the light
Pressing new frontiers
Totally reborn
Don't be afraid of death
We'll be gone in the twinkling of an eye

[Outro]
Eye, eye, eye

[Pre-Chorus: Thundercat]
Can't open my eyes, girl
'Cause I'm just too wasted
You're taking me higher
Straight shots with no chaser
I'm up past the clouds
Can't come down, we're too faded
Way out in the stars
She said, "Come to outer space"

[Chorus: Thundercat]
Then she said, "Drink dat, drink dat"
"Drink dat, drink dat"
She told me, "Drink dat, drink dat"
"Drink dat"
Then she said

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
The night is almost over
But we still wanna party
Ain't no one in here sober
The weed I'm rolling's gnarly
These bitches love Sosa
These niggas want some molly
I'm just chillin', getting high as fuck
Looking boss in my Cavalli
Smoking papers, no blunts
Writing "Turn up" on our cups
'Cause we gon' do that
Someone get another bottle of gin
We just ran through that
Made a million out of nothing, thought you knew that
Hating on my crew swag, that's too bad
Walk up in the party, they like, "Who that?"
Pouring shots, ain't worried 'bout precautions or the cost
'Cause we going far, another drink, it might be a problem, I can't

[Pre-Chorus: Thundercat]
Can't open my eyes, girl
'Cause I'm just too wasted
You're taking me higher
Straight shots with no chaser
I'm up past the clouds
Can't come down, we're too faded
Way out in the stars
She said, "Come to outer space"

[Chorus: Thundercat]
Then she said, "Drink dat, drink dat"
"Drink dat, drink dat"
She told me, "Drink dat, drink dat"
"Drink dat"
Then she said

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
We young, black, Hollywood, we turnin' up
No turnin' down, even though we prolly should
I pass some drugs to you, it's prolly good
I know that we famous
Here's some red cups with shots
We should probably take 'em
Smoking out on private property
Haters stay up and watch while we drink
Music low in case the neighbors call the cops on us
Niggas hate and bitches hate, all in the same
So take this cup of Bombay and drink all of it straight
Starting to realize what this party shit can feel like
We take the movies and the songs, make 'em real life
Live for the moment, ain't worried what it end like
Go to the roof and hit the bong, have a good night
Now you should know what the play is
Don't really know what I'm feeling
Sometimes I go through these phases
That means we both feeling faded
I mean we both feeling faded
I really hope that we make it

[Pre-Chorus: Thundercat]
Can't open my eyes, girl
'Cause I'm just too wasted
You're taking me higher
Straight shots with no chaser
I'm up past the clouds
Can't come down, we're too faded
Way out in the stars
She said, "Come to outer space"

[Chorus: Thundercat]
Then she said, "Drink dat, drink dat"
"Drink dat, drink dat"
She told me, "Drink dat, drink dat"
"Drink dat"
Then she said

[Verse 1]
I want to go right, I'm safe on my block
Except for the cops
Will they attack?
Would it be 'cause I'm Black?
I want to ride away, off into space and into the sun
With all those spirits and space dust and aliens
Where we belong (Fuck yeah)

[Verse 2]
Although it seems like it's all crashing down
I just want to ride my bike
Through all the bullshit with the wind in my face
Miss me with that nonsense
I'm free as a bird (Free)
And light as the wind
Just leave me alone (Easy)
Just let me ride off into space (Space ride)
That's where I want to be (Space ride)

[Verse 1]
I'm your biggest fan, but I guess that's just not good enough
Is it 'cause I wear my hair weird or because I like to play Diablo?
Don't act like you don't know what I'm talking 'bout
'Cause I really don't wanna have to spell it out
The next time you call me
I'm gon' sit and stare at the screen
Waiting for the call to end

[Chorus 1]
You stuck me in the friend zone
That's that bullshit
I'm gonna play Diablo either way
You can come or you could go

[Verse 2]
Because I'd rather play Mortal Kombat anyway, hey
I'm all about my Johnny Cage
If you're not bringing bottles, I suggest you start to walk away
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
I can tell you've kinda got uncomfortable
So let me break it down for you
Don't call me, don't text me, after 2 AM
Unless you plan on giving me some
Because I got enough friends

[Chorus 2]
I would throw you in the garbage
'Cause you play too many games
I'm better off by myself
Loving you's bad for my health

[Outro]
No one wants to be in the friend zone
Friend zone
Friend zone

[Verse]
Here it comes
In and out and around
Feeling bare, almost there
Here it comes
This is the best part
This is the best part
Getting weak
But I'm doing fine
How are you? How are you?
Everything and nothing
Twirling around in my head
All at once, all at once

[Outro]
Where am I going?
Can you take me with you?
Can you take me with you?

[Refrain]
Into the fire
Black skies filled with smoke
Darker horizons ahead

[Chorus]
Out of the pan and into the fire
The descent into madness
Bright as day, dark as night, the inferno

[Refrain]
Into the fire
Black skies filled with smoke
Darker horizons ahead (That's right)

[Chorus]
Out of the pan and into the fire
The descent into madness
Bright as day, dark as night, the inferno

[Outro]
Welcome to the madness, madness
Leave your mind at the door, check out
Madness, madness, madness, madness

[Verse]
Bittersweet memories cloud my faded mind
And if I was so lucky, I could press rewind
Or could it be I'm crazy?
'Cause I've been wrong before
Let a nigga know

[Verse 1: Thundercat]
As I sit, as I sit
And I stare into the clouds
And watch the world turn
Is this where we belong?
Or is it a step to fill?
Makes me wonder, makes me think (Shoryuken)
Everything we do is weak
Turn down
Oh, 'cause look at the mess we've made
Who's gonna clean it up?
Oh my God, where's Captain Planet?
Perception, what you see
Compared to reality, so far away
You are so drunk, you miss it all (Yay)
Just make sure you have the right Jordans on
Or be left behind to rot and die
Face down in the gutter

[Verse 2: Pharrell]
This is gonna sound like I was just hitting the hash (Zone)
They make us think it's a race war when the war is in class (Show 'em)
Teachers come through the speakers, images through the glass (Foam)
Subliminal messages influencing the whole clash (Alone)
Black, white, gay, straight human beings all pee and want some ass (Chrome)
If you scared of different then you should not take the same path
If all lives matter when we mention black, why do you gasp? (Bro)
Behind our blue skies is the sun who's surrounded by black (Tone)
I love the camo but why have more ammo than MASH? (Don't)
Instead of blowing yourself up, take a love pill and laugh (You won't)
And laugh (Ha)

[Verse 1]
Sometimes you're alive
Sometimes you are dead inside
With the time to read between the lines of life and death
Sometimes it's okay
Sometimes it's the worst thing ever
Hopefully you won't get caught and get a DUI

[Verse 2]
You will see that it's not so bad
There's always tomorrow
Bottom of the glass
At this point you've made an ass
And your friends will let you know tomorrow

[Outro]
I'm so tired
One more glass to go
Where this ends we'll never know

[Chorus]
Three o'clock, just can't close my eyes
Something's wrong with me
No, I can't deal, I can't go to sleep
There's something in my heart
The streets keep calling me

[Chorus]
Three o'clock, just can't close my eyes
Something's wrong with me
No, I can't deal, I can't go to sleep
There's something in my heart
The streets keep calling me

[Chorus]
Drowning away all of the pain
'Til I'm totally numb
Sometimes you want to feel alive
But not on someone else's time

[Verse]
Morning heartache
Senses your love
I just can't catch a break
Squirrels and snakes keep me on my toes
Will you go down with me?
Don't care what you say
So many feels, bro
LOL, I'm so over it
'Cause nothing is real
I'd rather be up my mind
Than to be dead alive

[Chorus]
Drowning away all of the pain
'Til I'm totally numb
Sometimes you want to feel alive
But not on someone else's time

[Outro]
(Baby) I just can't catch a break
With my heart on my sleeve
And my planet of dreams
Yeah you know
I would run a thousand miles, so close your mouth

Girl you know you the shit

[Hook]
I can make two mil in a week
And I can get them pints for the cheap
And I can fuck your freak for the free
He think I robbed him but it wasn't me
I just took the doors off the Jeep
I can fit another whore in the suite
She gave me head and I gave that bitch a Jeep
She said I fucked her but I say it wasn't me

[Verse 1]
I'm fresh out the feds, I'm fresh out work-release
Got that strong and I think I'm Hercules
I'm the plug and I drop like once a week
I hit TZ and told him flood the streets
Me and BPM straight from BCT
Fuck that BT shit bitch re-up with me
And I see twenty-eight my motor eighty Gs
You wanna race me then let's bet a couple keys
I got this younger one, she suck me till I'm weak
Ain't fuck in three months and she still ain't missed a beat
Got this lil' young nigga and he think that talk is cheap
I'm on rotation on your feature, lose your seat

[Hook]
I can make two mil in a week
And I can get them pints for the cheap
And I can fuck your freak for the free
He think I robbed him but it wasn't me
I just took the doors of the Jeep
I can fit another whore in the suite
She gave me head and I gave that bitch a Jeep
She said I fucked her but I say it wasn't me

[Verse 2]
I can make five bricks off of three
And I can give your bitch something to see
At the Hawks game court side seats
I'm on Peachtree in the drop-top B
He want to be like me but Gucci too elite
Fuck them sucker niggas I don't want to speak
Orange Lamb', I pull up like trick-or-treat
I'm bag snatchin' like it's fucking Halloween
Master P 

[?]
I'm C-Murder I'm Pootang I'm Big Meech
This for my nigga that might never touch the streets
You never snitched then it's easier to sleep

[Hook]
I can make two mil in a week
And I can get them pints for the cheap
And I can fuck your freak for the free
He think I robbed him but it wasn't me
I just took the doors of the Jeep
I can fit another whore in the suite
She gave me head and I gave that bitch a Jeep
She said I fucked her but I say it wasn't me

[Sample]
You want me to give you a testimony about my life
And how good he's been to me
I don't know what to tell you about him
I love him so much with all my heart and my soul
With every bone in my body I love him so much
Because he's done so much for me

[Verse]
Ladies and gentlemen, allow me my testimony
I'm so blessed, I'm so blessed
And it feels so good, it feels so good
So good to be free
Oh keep your prayers
Keep your prayers in someway
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Let all your innovations lead the world
Can nobody leave me?
Can nobody leave me like you?
I want to thank you Lord
For all the love
Your love
Time after time, you lifted me up
No, no, you never let me down
Now that's what's up! (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
That's what's up (Ooh, ooh, ooh)

[Intro]
It's Wizop
Burr burr burr burr

[Hook]
Tried to play me off the street but I'm back on the block
Drew down on your partner, made him drop it like it hot
My posse's on Broadway, I'm Sir Brix A Lot
Say some slick to Gucci, I hit you in your jaw
When a rapper got beef, want a pay-per-view 

[?]
I'm a trapper when I got beef then I put you in a box
That's the love of your life, to me she's just another thot
Not no ordinary nigga, can't rock no ordinary watch

[Verse 1]
Slick as hell man, I'm fresh out of jail man
Fuck a cell case, marble on my staircase
As you can tell man, I don't fuck with twelve man
Can't catch me in it man, unless I beat twelve man
These niggas trap dry, no water in the well man
We see your ribs man, damn you're lookin' frail man
Look at my ring bling, motherfucker chain gang
You're selling bales man, then we on the same thing
You're reppin' Zone 6, then we in the same gang
I let my nuts hang, why you holdin' nuts, lang
You ain't a rat so I'm gon' treat you like a mutt, man
You tuck your tail so I'm gon' kick you in your

I'm a well man, a motherfuckin' well man
A pocket rocket on me and a pocket scale man
If I can't work, I've still got my clientele man
This for my 

[?], all my niggas still in jail man
All these critiques and AP's know they sick of me
Me and my niggas thick as thieves, 

[?]
Twenty years old, all my niggas got a brick at least
And this a drought and we ain't had no work for weeks
They call me Guwop One Punch, I knock out your teeth
I'm in a smoky 

[?] that I shoot out to tease
I pistol whip the sleep and go in your Lee Dungarees
Don't give a fuck about 'em, they don't give a fuck 'bout me

[Outro]
It's Gucci
It's Guwop
It's Wizop

[Intro: Shawty Redd & Gucci Mane]
It's 2017 nigga
Welcome home 'wop, blurr
Shawty Redd, new bitch nigga, y'all niggas motherfuck' at?
Pyrex pot
East Atlanta, Zone 6
Trap house
Nigga where y'all think this shit started from, nigga
It's Gucci
Ay Guc', welcome home my nigga, I salute to you my nigga
Ay, hol' up

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Let me take you back to my Shawty Redd days
Just sold ten bales, pulled up to the club blazed
In an all-red Charger with some with some on-set trays
Hittin' on all-red kush, got on all-red J's
Got a trap house in the 6 with a 12-foot fence
I'm Guwop the walkin' lick but can't nobody take shit
Had to shut the trap down, the red Dolce's hit
Had to crack it back up, the red dogs ain't shit
See your pack just touched, everybody want bricks
So you can tell the black cats they can suck my dick
It's just a Sun Valley nigga, I'm had tryna get rich
I killed your dog yesterday, you can call me Mike Vick
Say you never met a killer, then you never met me
Hold up, hold up, they done let the 'wop free
Hold up, hold up, he say he want a hundred keys
Well pull up, pull up, none for you and more for me

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
Gucci how you feel, like the richest nigga ever
Twenty-seventeen, still the slickest nigga ever
Ain't nobody in my lane, ain't nobody on my level
Leave the house without a strap, nigga never fuckin' ever
This a customized belt, so you would never fuckin' ever
Let a bitch stress me, I would never fuckin' ever
Let a nigga press me, I would never fuckin' ever
(It's Gucci!)
They say never say never but I never fuckin' ever
(It's Gucci!)

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
Don't go with my main squeeze, she ain't gotta fuck me
But bitch ain't never met a nigga that can hustle like me
And you'll never meet a nigga with a duffel like me
With the money and the mind and the muscle like me
I done rob so many niggas I can't even trust me
Gotta walk in with the strap, they can never search me
Call me Gucci the unmercable, they'll never merc me
I just bought a new convertible, they'll never touch me
I hate mice, I hate rats, nigga that's my pet peeve
I throw stacks, I shoot dice, nigga I'm so side street
If you ain't 'bout lettin' that pistol go, don't stand beside me
Said Guwop ain't got eight figures, I feel like you're tryin' me
'Wop

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
Gucci how you feel, like the richest nigga ever
Twenty-seventeen, still the slickest nigga ever
Ain't nobody in my lane, ain't nobody on my level
Leave the house without a strap, nigga never fuckin' ever
This a customized belt, so you would never fuckin' ever
Let a bitch stress me, I would never fuckin' ever
Let a nigga press me, I would never fuckin' ever
They say never say never but I never fuckin' ever
(It's Gucci!)

[Verse 1]
You've got an open heart
So you share what's inside
Thinking that all is said in confidence
But then you realize

[Chorus]
(Friendship is a small boat in a storm)
The sun is getting heavy
(Friendship is a small boat in a storm)
The cold is breaking my heart
(Friendship is a small boat in a storm)
This boat is incredibly unsafe
(Friendship is a small boat in a storm)
It's falling apart

[Verse 2]
Now play your part
You're along for the ride
Thinking that all is said in confidence
Yeah you realize

[Chorus]
(Friendship is a small boat in a storm)
Now I'm swimming in the sea
(Friendship is a small boat in a storm)
Floundering desperately
(Friendship is a small boat in a storm)
Tryin' to get a grip on my emotions
(Friendship is a small boat in a storm)
I'm falling apart

[Bridge]
Happy to know until the clouds start singing
The wind is high and the waves scary
Oh lord, only you know, I've had enough

[Chorus]
(Friendship is a small boat in a storm)
My momma said don't trust nobody
(Friendship is a small boat in a storm)
Cause they'll stab you in the back and take your money
(Friendship is a small boat in a storm)
You live and you learn
(Friendship is a small boat in a storm)
If you wanna live, you better learn so you don't burn
(Friendship is a small boat in a storm)
Yeah
(Friendship is a small boat in a storm)
Better start swimming, brother
(Friendship is a small boat in a storm)
Cause I'm drowning, I'm sinking brother
(Friendship is a small boat in a storm)
You live and you learn
That friendship is a small boat in a storm

[Verse 1]
Hey, you
I'm not bold or cool or masculine
Maybe you're just waiting for the perfect Latin lover to walk in
(I'm not him)
Between my penis and my chin
Is Camembert and shame
I used to be elegantly thin
I'm sorry, babe, we both missed that train

[Verse 2]
Ah, no
If I follow you, all your girlfriends will know
Then I'll wind up with the other fools
Wasting, wasting his time following you 'round
Another lonely guy with longing in his eye
But you said your man is bringing you down

[Chorus]
Someone sweep me off my feet
I am not an angel, I'm barely a man
I'm lonely but I'm here
Baby, understand, oh
Someone sweep me off my feet

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Someone sweep me off my feet
I am not an angel, I'm barely a man
I'm lonely but I'm here
Baby, understand, oh
Someone sweep me off my feet

(Verse 1)
Do it to the maximum, take it why you asking them?
Don't listen to them suckas when they say you too irrational
See I said I'm king and them lames started laughing
Same sucker now I want the king on the track
I composed several classics
U know like top back, dope boys
Bring em out, and what you know about that
Now they ask how I talk what you know about that
Dominated '06, now I'm going right back
See me reign hell, at a show just like that
Even Denzel'll say damn, I ain't know it like that
Yeah, still Bankhead you can tell
Ain't nothing changed but the name on the mail
Still kicking doors with them thangs in the air
Up in Benihana's, see me slang in dem chair
I will slang caine, no such thang as a jail
Said you need a hundred squares they just came off the scale
(Hook)

(Verse 2)
Do it like a ball playa, when you see me ballin
Stacks tall- ball playa from the stage to the air
Whether in Miami, Cincinnati or in Riverdale
Arizona, California, make it rain anywhere
Pullin that in public shorty who you think u finna scare?
I send a missiles at ya have ya going in your underwear
I tote a pair, fortyz on me, so you better tone it down
I suggest you juss prepare yourself for when it goin down
A-town, west side club, you should catch me
Right up at the top where Big Kuntry, Dro & Mac be
Jackers lying say they caught me slipping how could that be
I'm something like a stalker I be everywhere the strap be
The trap be, jumping with that 100 dollar slab
If I wanted I could get 100 on the tab
Sell em all double down do the math
Think I won't pull up in something with 200 on the dash

(Verse 3)
Do it like I wanna do it, do it right in front of you
Real vision pimpin I ain't seeing none of you
I do it for my partner Phil's daughter and his momma too
Do it for my oldest sons and they Grand momma too
Do it for my daughters and my youngest son momma who
Go buy what she want becuz she know it ain't a problem to
You do something to them and it's you I bring the drama to
You do it for a day or so, we do it for a month or two
I do it for my partner go make show them stuntin too
We do it with them plakas(?), ain't no problem where you running to?
We do it for the block, that why ain't nobody stopping me
I do it for my pop, and my cousins too they watchin me
I did it nonstop, now see how these rapper copy me
I made it from the bottom to the top, where I oughtta be
Who do it did good, and do it different
No matter what I do you know I do it to death
(Hook till fade)

[Verse 1]
Well, I'm not your rollercoaster, baby
I tell you, keeping it straight
Why I gotta roll the dice, gotta play, girl
For the people who pay?

[Verse 2]
Well, I'm not your rollercoaster, baby
You never let me explain
Why I gotta roll the dice for your problems?
You keep me playing this game

[Verse 1]
If you wanna know 'em
And you wanna show 'em
The love that you hide
In between your thighs
There's something waiting
Both of us can't deny
Give it a try

[Verse 2]
If you wanna hold her
You can take it slower
And dance through the night
Hold each other tight
That someone's waiting
Avid for your device
Isn't it nice?
Read my mind
Facing crystal imagery
I won't hide
Inside
The mystery of your eyes
I might find
Behind all the junk on your timeline

Still my time
Is running out to say goodbye
You can live your life
Or you can live your life on the timeline

Read your mind
Facing crystal imagery
I won't hide
Inside
The mystery of your eyes
I might find
You can live your life
Or you can live your life on the timeline

[Verse 1]
How come the weeping willow
Describes your imagery?
I've seen it fading yellow
An eager son within

[Verse 2]
Just see the colors bleeding
It's a beautiful sight to see
And when your vision's lazy
So do the paintings see

[Hook]
You see many of us lookin' for
Somethin' words can really not explain
Yeah, although many of us come and go
I always knew that I would find a way
I put my city on my back
Lookin' for another path
Yeah, although many of us come and go
I always knew that I would find a way

[Verse]
Too cold to catch a flu
Too hot to give a fuck
Too late to give it back
Too high to come down
Too wrong to be right
Too burnt to get a lack
Too strapped to get attacked
Too church for these slacks
This the type of habitat
My drivin' Lexus hard to find where niggas at
I got money on my head
Say my prayers, go to bed
Wind up dead, end up thinkin'
Tryin' not to end up dead
Had the idea, buzzin' right here
Fuck the light year
Tables done turned, fucked up my kin
Love to daydream but work the night shift
Now who gon' help us? Who gon' help us?
The red and the white and the blue has failed us
I can't promise I'ma make it better
But I can show you how to be successful
The poor get poorer, the rich get richer
Lives are lost, too much to measure
We all tryna make it up from the bottom
But nowadays, the bottom's lower than ever

[Hook]
You see many of us lookin' for
Somethin' words can really not explain
Yeah, although many of us come and go
I always knew that I would find a way
I put my city on my back
Lookin' for another path
Yeah, although many of us come and go
I always knew that I would find a way

[Bridge]
From the jungles of East Atlanta
You motherfuckers don't fuck up
Players always fuck up at the wrong time
Oh, will they rise and go?
And will they mind to say no
Oh, will they rise and go?
And we ain't livin' by the same code

[Hook]
You see many of us lookin' for
Somethin' words can really not explain
Yeah, although many of us come and go
I always knew that I would find a way
I put my city on my back
Lookin' for another path
Yeah, although many of us come and go
I always knew that I would find a way

[Hook: Young Thug]

[Verse: Young Thug]
I bought a trap car on Moreland Ave
Big lean making me lake no bath

After school picking up kids, attracting the staff

[Verse]
Bought my third fourway for my partner
And he faded me so my partner go back and robbed him

Wasted (Wasted)
And the more I drink the more I think about you
Oh no, no, I can't take it
Baby every place I go reminds me of you

[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]
Do you think of me? Of what we used to be?
Is it better now that I'm not around?
My friends are actin' strange, they don't bring up your name
Are you happy now?
Are you happy now?

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
I don't wanna know, know, know, know
Who's taking you home, home, home, home
And loving you so, so, so, so
The way I used to love you, no
I don't wanna know, know, know, know
Who's taking you home, home, home, home
And loving you so, so, so, so
The way I used to love you, oh
I don't wanna know
The way I used to love you, oh

[Verse 2: Adam Levine]
And every time I go out, yeah
I hear it from this one, I hear it from that one
That you got someone new
Yeah, I see but don't believe it
Even in my head you're still in my bed
Maybe I'm just a fool

[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]
Do you think of me? Of what we used to be?
Is it better now that I'm not around?
My friends are actin' strange, they don't bring up your name
Are you happy now?
Are you happy now?

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
I don't wanna know, know, know, know
Who's taking you home, home, home, home
And loving you so, so, so, so
The way I used to love you, no
I don't wanna know, know, know, know
Who's taking you home, home, home, home
And loving you so, so, so, so
The way I used to love you, oh
I don't wanna know
The way I used to love you, oh

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
No more “please stop”
No more hashtag boo'd up screenshots
No more tryin' make me jealous on your birthday
You know just how I made you better on your birthday, oh
Do he do you like this, do he woo you like this?
Do he lay it down for you, touch your poona like this?
Matter fact, never mind, we'll let the past be
May be his right now, but your body's still me, woah

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
I don't wanna know, know, know, know
Who's taking you home, home, home, home
And loving you so, so, so, so

Who's taking you home, home, home, home
And loving you so, so, so, so
The way I used to love you, oh
I don't wanna know
I don't wanna know, know, know, know
Who's taking you home, home, home, home
And loving you so, so, so, so
The way I used to love you, oh
I don't wanna know

[Verse 1]
Babe
Gotta know one thing before you ask my name
Be straight up and tell me what's your aim
A girl like me, see I don't play no games, no no
That's why I say
If you wanna be with me, go all the way
Do what you gotta do, just let me state
Is it real or is this just a fake? (tell me)

[Chorus]
What's good with you, baby?
Wanna get to know me?
What's really good, baby?
Do you have a lady?
Been near the hood lately?
Where you from and where you be?
What's good with you, baby?
What's good with you, baby?

[Verse 2]
Babe
You're sittin' over there, tryna figure out what to say
Make up your mind right now, don't contemplate
You know that I don't have time to waste, no no
Where do we go?
What this thing could be, we'll never know
There is just no way that we can flow
If you ain't being honest from the go (tell me)

[Chorus]
What's good with you, baby?
Wanna get to know me?
What's really good, baby?
Do you have a lady?
Been near the hood lately?
Where you from and where you be?
What's good with you, baby?
What's good with you, baby?

[Bridge]
Don't try playing with my mind
Boy, I don't have no time
For something that I know ain't good for me
Don't hesitate to say
You feel the chemistry
I wanna know, should I take a chance with you?

[Chorus]
What's good with you, baby?
Wanna get to know me?
What's really good, baby?
Do you have a lady?
Been near the hood lately?
Where you from and where you be?
What's good with you, baby?
What's good with you, baby?

[Chorus]
What's good with you, baby?
Wanna get to know me?
What's really good, baby?
Do you have a lady?
Been near the hood lately?
Where you from and where you be?
What's good with you, baby?
What's really good, baby?

[Outro]
What's good with you, baby?
What's really good, baby?
Been near the hood lately?
What's good with you, baby?

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
I don't wanna know, know, know, know
Who‘s taking you home, home, home, home
And loving you so, so, so, so
The way I used to love you, no
I don't wanna know, know, know, know
Who's taking you home, home, home, home
And loving you so, so, so, so
The way I used to love you, oh
I don't wanna know

[Verse 1: Adam Levine]
Wasted (Wasted)
And the more I drink the more I think about you
Oh no, no, I can't take it
Baby every place I go reminds me of you

[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]
Do you think of me? Of what we used to be?
Is it better now that I'm not around?
My friends are actin' strange, they don't bring up your name
Are you happy now?
Are you happy now?

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
I don't wanna know
I don't wanna know
I don't wanna know

[Verse 2: Adam Levine]
And every time I go out, yeah
I hear it from this one, I hear it from that one
That you got someone new
Yeah, I see but don't believe it
Even in my head you're still in my bed
Maybe I'm just a fool

[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]
Do you think of me? Of what we used to be?
Is it better now that I'm not around?
My friends are actin' strange, they don't bring up your name
Are you happy now?
Are you happy now?

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
I don't wanna know
I don't wanna know
I don't wanna know

[Bridge: Adam Levine]
Wasted (Wasted)
And the more I drink the more I think about you
Oh no, no, I can't take it
Do you think that I should just go on without ya?

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
I don't wanna know, know, know, know
Who's taking you home, home, home, home
And loving you so, so, so, so
The way I used to love you, no
I don't wanna know, know, know, know
Who's taking you home, home, home, home
And loving you so, so, so, so
The way I used to love you, oh
I don't wanna know, know, know, know
Who's taking you home, home, home, home
And loving you so, so, so, so
The way I used to love you, no
I don't wanna know, know, know, know
Who's taking you home, home, home, home
And loving you so, so, so, so
The way I used to love you, oh

I don't wanna know
I don't wanna know
I don't wanna know

[Outro: Adam Levine]
I don't wanna know, know, know, know
Who's taking you home, home, home, home
And loving you so, so, so, so
The way I used to love you, oh
I don't wanna know, know, know, know
Who's taking you home, home, home, home
And loving you so, so, so, so
The way I used to love you, oh
I don't wanna know

[Intro: Giggs & Drake]
(Ness on the beat)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, okay, okay, okay

[Verse 1: Drake & Giggs]
Demon just got out the can (Yeah)
I gave my bro an advance (Yeah)
Love is just not in my plans
Not even takin' a chance
Studio right in my yaad
I'm doin' ten in a week
How long I been on this streak?
Dream about work in my sleep (Oof)
Okay, I got a lock on the streets

Mizzy with the quick extension, ringin' off thirty (Rah!)
I've got bitches in the merky, swervin', lookin' all curvy

Lookin' all Christmas gift-wrapped, lookin' all turkey
Spen jumped out the Ghost in a suit, lookin' all churchy (Oof!)
Fingers all itchin', twitchin', lookin' all jerky (Jerky)
Whippin' that white girl (Yeah?), cookin' that Cersei (Dah!)

Could've just slapped man, but he wanted it further (Why?)
Batman, da-na-na-da-na

[Outro]
October Firm
And I've been running away from the wise man in my head
And he said, go, go, go, go get lost in the wind
And I've been hearing some whispers on the wind
And they said, run, run, run, run away for your sins
But don't leave that fiery mind behind
Take it along for the ride
And don't leave that fiery mind behind
Take it along for the ride

And there'll be an airplane flying across my soul
And it will role right on
I'll have to say fair well so long
And there'll be a steam train rolling across my heart
And I will have to depart
I will have to depart

But don't leave that fiery heart behind
Take it along for the ride
And don't leave that fiery mind behind
Take it along for the ride
And I've been running away from the wise man in my head
And he said, go, go, go, go get lost in the wind
He's been throwing caution to the wind
Filling an hourglass with his sins
He only cares for momentary winds

Yes he's been in the very all the beast
Oh he's had a burning hand
But he won't release

And he's walked the plane to the bitter end
And there's always gone to the storm

And fools rush in
Where angels fear to tread
But his hands are gold
And his heart is worn

Between the devil and the deep blue sea
A drowning man will clutch at a straw

He who lives by the sword
Will die by the sword
And all is fair in love and war
A-all is fair in love and war

He's been throwing caution to the wind
Filling an hourglass with his sins
He only cares for momentary winds
His highest worship has shaken his names

He's run with wolves to be standing here
He's walked on edges to have no fear
He's climbed the walls to see this view
And he's fought many wars
And lost very few

Between the devil and the deep blue sea
A drowning man will clutch at a straw

He who lives by the sword
Will die by the sword

And all is fair in love and war
A-all is fair in love and war

[Verse 1]
It ruffled up my feathers
And it barked on up my tree
When suddenly it seemed all the fingers
Were pointing on up at me

[Verse 2]
And the footsteps in the sand
Were all getting washed up by the sea
To leave me in stitches
Bursting at the seams
Bursting at the seams

[Pre-Chorus]
When the sun came out to greet me
I only saw the wolves from my dreams

[Chorus]
This is my Berlin Blues song
Sometimes life can get a little wrong
But it won't be long
'Cause it just makes me strong

[Verse 3]
And there is a place where we one day will delve
Where there's no more walking on eggshells
Where ideas are for free, oh it's the place to be
Your great mind's no longer the minority

[Verse 4]
And I'll see you there with your hands in the air
Where the canvas is bare
And there's no more despair
And your third eye will stare
Nothing can compare
There's not one care
And I'll see you there
I'll see you there
I'll see you there
I'll see you there

[Chorus]
This is my Berlin Blues song
Sometimes life can get a little wrong
But it won't be long
'Cause it just makes me strong

[Verse 3]
And there is a place where we one day will delve
Where there's no more walking on eggshells
Where ideas are for free, oh it's the place to be
Your great mind's no longer the minority

[Verse 4]
And I'll see you there with your hands in the air
Where the canvas is bare
And there's no more despair
And your third eye will stare
Nothing can compare
There's not one care
And I'll see you there
I'll see you there
I'll see you there
I'll see you there

[Chorus]
This is my Berlin Blues song
Sometimes life can get a little wrong
But it won't be long
'Cause it just makes me strong
Hey you
You with your head in the clouds
You've been running around

On the tight ropes you found
In the minds of the weak you seek to speak
With fire on your tongue
Flames on your lungs
Your bow has stun
Many a sweetheart

Hey you
You with your eyes on the prize
Don't you wear the disguise
That the truths of your lies unfold
To be told
To the victims of your steady rise
You're prize at the expense of the weak
You're on the peak and you dancing chick to chick with the devil's sweetheart
With the devil's sweetheart
Rebel Rose
Oh I've seen her for a while
She's got a smile that brings me to my knees

I'll remind her that I'll find her in between the trees

Oh please
Oh please, oh please, oh please

Rebel Rose
Won't you take me on home
I'm drunk and I'm stoned
I got no place else to go
And I know I don't wanna be alone

Oh no no no
I don't wanna be alone

Rebel Rose
I sure can't describe
The look in your eyes
There's no describing this
There's no denying this
Rebel Rose
From the tips of your toes to the end of your nose
Everybody everybody knows
Everybody everybody knows

Rebel Rose
Won't you take me on home
I'm drunk and I'm stoned
I got no place else to go
And I know I don't wanna be alone

Rebel Rose

[Verse 1: Nocando]
I was up in Berlin
Maybe it was Belgium
Talking up a whirlwind
Pretty young thing
Nobody's for certain
Riding her wave
God, she was surfin'
Two hearts hurtin'
Broke beat perfect

[?] to like pain
Sweatin' like rain on my (chain)
Left a little stain
Was she runnin' game?
I know I was runnin' game but

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
I wanna live
I wanna give
I've been a miner for a heart of gold
It's these expressions
I never give
That keep me searching for a heart of gold
(Gold all in my watch, gold all in my chain)
Keep me searching for a heart of gold
(Gold all in my watch, gold all in my chain)

[Verse 2: Anderson .Paak]
Searching for something
So we entered through the matter to find what we needed
It's so much harder than I fathomed, my logic divided
If all I wanted was a hit, then I'd probably be famous
To be respected by my peers was the reason I did it
Go five years in the struggle, ain't much to a nigga
When one week of livin' lavish can fuck up your liver
Who needs provision when you covered in diamonds and pendents?
Who needs the temporaries when bitches are dyin' to get it?
I copped the ring, I caught feelin', abandoned the bride
Sold that shit for half the price just to keep on the lights
Look in the eyes and be surprised if there's anything worth mentioning
Broken-hearted in misery, pity
But while I dwell, I owe a lot of niggas
Before I finished this sentence, I promised to make bail

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
I've been to Hollywood
I've been to Redwood
I crossed the ocean for a heart of gold
I've been in my mind
It's such a fine line
That keeps me searching for a heart of gold
(Gold all in my watch, gold all in my chain)
Keeps me searching for a heart of gold
(Gold all in my watch, gold all in my chain)

[Verse 3: Milo]
Here it goes, another diatribe from Leopold
Screaming at minors not to make the same mistakes when we're old
I was a miner for pyrite
Now I'm in PriceRite buying pie tins and thin mints
Shin splints for a retired digger downsized signal thin hints that I'm a retired nigga
I'm just looking for a woman who will let me sing in the shower now
For a woman who doesn't have Dwight Eisenhower brows
I feel dumb listening to Neil Young, I recline
The spiel was sung and still I decline
The laughing track was always lethal
And I can never remember what size you like your frappuccinos
You say those heart pains were a fluke
Praying to Saint Luke in the morning
Never glanced up from reading Marmaduke, I'm in mourning

[Verse 1: Ariana Grande]
We're too young to die
So let's keep living 'til it all falls down
Let's close our eyes
And let the moment drown the whole world out

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
We're in this together
Hear our hearts beat together
We stand strong together
We're in this forever
This one's for you
This one's for you

[Drop: David Guetta]

[Verse 2: Ariana Grande]
Waving colored flags
We won't surrender, there's no standing down
Love's a battlefield
It's full of winners, we're breaking new grounds

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
We're in this together
Hear our hearts beat together
We stand strong together
We're in this forever
This one's for you
This one's for you

[Drop: David Guetta]

[Bridge: Ariana Grande]
Oh yeah
Oooh
This one's for you
Woah

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
We're in this together
Hear our hearts beat together
We stand strong together
We're in this forever
This one's for you

[Verse 1]
Sometimes my love may be put on hold
Sometimes my heart may seem awful cold
These times come and these times go
As long as I live, all you need to know is

[Chorus]
This old dog ain't about to forget
All we've had, and all that's next
'Long as my heart's beatin' in my chest
This old dog ain't about to forget

[Verse 2]
Often a heart tends to change its mind
A new day decides on a new design
A new day gets set on another way
As long as I live, all I've got to say is

[Chorus]
This old dog ain't about to forget
All we've had, and all that's next
'Long as my heart's beatin' in my chest
This old dog ain't about to forget

[Intro]
SoFlo like An-
Oh shit
Yeah, SoFlo like, ayy, ayy

[Chorus: Post Malone & Ethan Klein]
SoFlo like Antonio, SoFlo like Antonio
Whatchu know about
SoFlo like Antonio, SoFlo he even stole my flow
Damn
SoFlo like Antonio, SoFlo like Antonio
Whatchu know about
SoFlo like Antonio, SoFlo he even stole my flow
Damn

[Verse: Ethan Klein]
SoFlo
Where you at, boy? Where you at, boy?
SoFlo
Where you at, boy?
Yo, I'm down at South Beach, Florida
You got all the beach before ya
And just when I thought he couldn't take it any further, damn
SoFlo is my father, damn
SoFlo is my father, damn
SoFlo is my father, damn
SoFlo is my father, damn
He stole everything from me
Can you please just back off?
Just let me have my fucking snow cone
It's got strawberry syrup, it's my favorite flavor
You can fuck my whole family tree, just let me be

[Interlude: Ethan Klein]
Fuck you SoFlo! Make your own shit!
Stop stealing shit from everyone
Make your own shit, dog!
Fuck off!
(Coughing)
SoFlo is my father

[Chorus: Post Malone]
SoFlo like Antonio, SoFlo like Antonio
SoFlo like Antonio, SoFlo he even stole my flow
SoFlo like Antonio, SoFlo like Antonio
SoFlo like Antonio

[Verse 1]
Look in the mirror
Who do you see?
Someone familiar
But surely not me
For he can't be me
Look how old and cold and tired
And lonely he's become
Not until you see
There's a price tag hanging off of having all that fun

[Chorus]
Uh-oh, looks like I'm seeing more of my old man in me
Oh no, looks like I'm seeing more of my old man in me

[Verse 2]
Walk on the outside, holding her hand
Someone familiar, her and her man
But it just can't be
Look at all the steps that brought you where you are today
Not until you see
As a heart grows stronger, sometimes love is pushed away

[Chorus]
Uh-oh, looks like I'm seeing more of my old man in me
Oh no, looks like I'm seeing more of my old man in me

[Outro]
Uh-oh, looks like I'm seeing more of my old man in me
Oh no, looks like I'm seeing more of my old man in me

[Verse 1]
There's thirty-thousand megatons pointed at her
And him and you and me and everyone we serve
I look out at the mirror, look out at the world
Thirty-thousand megatons is just what we deserve
And I don't get out of bed no more
Beasts learned to talk a bit just to survive
But we're not even beasts, it's a wonder we're alive
We're baser than the base, deaf and dumb and blind

[Verse 2]
I'll not stand for Maybelline, or Kyle or Jackie O
Or my sunburnt country burning people I don't know
I'll not stand alone, or sing in one tune
To see a Virgin air hostess serve Bolly on the moon
And if I was the man on the Moon, I wouldn't let us near
I'd stand on a crater with my shotgun to the sky
And leave us to our mines and our Tinder 'til we die
And the Earth will sigh, and the Moon will wipe its brow

[Chorus]
We need thirty-thousand megatons
Push the button now
We need thirsty-thousand megatons
Push the button now

[Bridge]
Out on the street, it's only vitamins and hate
We'll soon be out of Xanax and then it'll be too late
We need thirty-thousand megatons, why wait?
Why wait?

[Chorus]
We need thirty-thousand megatons
Push the button now
We need thirty-thousand megatons
Push the button now
God, I have been doing the same thing in the same place, working the same job for 45 years. You know that. Shit just flew by. What am I really even doing? God, I know we rarely talk, but every day I wake up I feel like, I feel like I blew it with my family, with her. These kids around me don't have no one to look up to. Should have been me. This job ain't me, man. This ain't what I'm supposed to be doing in my life, man

[Chorus: Big Sean & Jeremih]
I think I’m ready to jump out the window
And turn that nigga that you with right back into your friend, though
We already wasted too much time
And your time is the only thing I wish was mine
So yeah, oh yeah, I think I’m ready to jump out the window

[Verse 1]
Straight up, straight up, look
Know ya momma didn’t raise you to take no disrespect, yeah
I feel, I feel like real queens know how to keep the game in check, yeah
You cried on my phone the whole night
That time he crossed the line yeah, yeah, yeah
(Oh I was there) I went to straighten his ass out
And you told me never mind yeah, yeah, yeah
The question isn't, "Do he love ya?" The question is, "Do ya love yourself?"
You give the best advice to your friends and not take it for yourself
Remember when you used to come through and hit the Mario Kart
And you always picked the princess
I realized you was princess way back then
We the best thing that never happened, but

[Chorus]
I think I'm ready to jump out the window
And turn that nigga that you with right back into your friend though
We already wasted too much time
And your time is the only thing I wish was mine
So yeah, oh yeah, I think I'm ready to jump out the window

[Verse 2]
You been up at night, sleep deprivation
What's the hesitation? What's ya reservation?
You been trippin', trippin' with no destination
You need separation, you need recreation
Y'all been arguing every other day
Ya friends gotta step in and break it up like chill, chill, chill
It's no need to turn this into Kill Bill, look
Funny we ran into each other while we leaving
You walked in with a perm
And now yo' hair look like The Weeknd's
I know that you been needin' clarity
Don't mean to sit ya down and turn this into therapy
But you gave too much time to that boy charity, hear me

[Chorus]
I think I'm ready to jump out the window
And turn that nigga that you with right back into your friend, though
We already wasted too much time
And your time is the only thing I wish was mine
So yeah, oh yeah, I think I'm ready to jump out the window

[Outro]
Look, I don't mean to sound like the jealous type
But you oughta know (oughta know)
I think me and you should get together sometimes
On the low low low
Sometimes I wonder if you even know
How much you worth, I gotta know
Sometimes I wonder if you even know
How much you worth, I gotta know
I don't mean to sound like the jealous type
But you oughta know (oughta know)
I think me and you should get together sometimes
On the low low low
Sometimes I wonder if you even know
How much you worth, I gotta know
Sometimes I wonder if you even know
How much you worth I gotta know
I gotta know, I gotta know, I gotta know
I think I'm ready to jump out the window
This one's for you, you, you, you, you, you, you

[Intro: TWENTY88]
Every time you call
You know I'm gonna come get ya
You know I'ma come get you
Every time I'ma come with ya
Every time you call
You know I'ma come get ya
You know I'ma come get you
Every time I'ma come with ya

[Chorus: TWENTY88]
At the same time
Put you on a ride of your life
And meet you there at the same time
Same place, same time
Every time you call
At the same time, same place, same mind
At the same time, same place, same mind

[Verse: Big Sean]
Who overdue for a night off?
Left the crib, I get you right off
How soon is too soon?
I see you every full moon, blue moon
We never did the relationship, it gets too messy
But if we keep messing with the wrong people
At the right place, at the right time, we might let it
You remember when you came to Sweden
I came too and we treated the hotel room
Like the Garden of Eden
Chill, I won't tell all your secrets

[Bridge: TWENTY88]
Look, we in tune, we in sync
Eye to eye, don't need to blink
We been here, don't need a drink
I bring my A-game
And put you right where you need to be
Look I fuck you, touch you, tease you
Have you learning things about you
No one could teach you
I see in you seein' me
Tell me what you see in me

[Outro: Jhené Aiko]
Every time you call...

[Chorus]
All that shit you told me, I believed
The smile on your face the only thing I can't read
Left and now you back inside my life
It's gon' take more than that to set it right though
Cause, you so, fuckin', outta, line
For ever, letting, them taste what's mine
Taste what's mine, taste what's mine
You so, fuckin', outta, line

[Verse 1]
Feel like you owe me checks, owe me time, owe me sex
Long nights, no reply, I got no regrets
You disrespect, disrespect, only time I seen you now's on the internet
Just to see if it's somebody else that you tied to
I hit you back when I decide to, you got my tattoo, we was tribal
Then you left and we turned rivals, now you back it's our revival
They don't make you feel like I do, they didn't make you perform for me
You was my American Idol how you rocked the mic
Man, we went from long text, now they shorter than a haiku
Seems like all you got is hate for me
All you ever did was take from me
Cause you know you got that walk from me
How you dress and how you talk from me, yeah
Let's not ever disrespect what I meant to ya
It took us being over to see all I did for ya, damn

[Chorus]
All that shit you told me, I believed
The smile on your face the only thing I can't read
Left and now you back inside my life
It's gonna take more than that to set it right though
Cause, you so, fuckin', outta, line
Forever, letting, them taste what's mine
Taste what's mine, taste what's mine
You so, fuckin', outta, line

[Verse 2]
I'm just trying to let the past pass
Ain't no future in that, yeah
I stay 100 like my dash, yeah
Have you cummin' faster than The Flash, yeah
Is it all mine, all mine? You know me, I had to ask
Can I hit it like I crash? Sipping pinot by the glass, glass
Honestly, I had to take the time to let my ego go
Realized that that held us back and back's not where we need to go
This don't replace what you did to me
This don't replace what I did to you
Sometimes it ain't about what we did or didn't do
It's about what we getting through
Look, I'm not tryna play the blame game
Point the fingers while we skip the point
Knowing that we both want the same thing
Riding for each other even if we gotta change lanes
If we don't work it out, shame shame
I can't touch these hoes I can't trust, I don't wanna have a fake us

[Chorus]
But all that shit you told me, I believed
The smile on your face the only thing I can't read
Left and now you back inside my life
It's gon' take more than that to set it right though
Cause, you so, fuckin', outta, line
Forever, letting, them taste what's mine
Taste what's mine, taste what's mine
You so, fuckin', outta, line

[Outro]
My friends say I should be over you
Getting hurt every time I'm close to you
I think me and you are overdue
I think this is what we supposed to do
Cause, you so, fuckin', outta, line
Forever, letting, them taste what's mine
Taste what's mine, taste what's mine
You so, fuckin', outta, line

[Skit: Paparazzi]
Nigga, you know what's about to go down when you walk out that door
Man, I hope these niggas not out here man, fuck
Big Sean, boy, swerve
I don't...with you
Ok, we see you
New girl, new car
Lamborghini Mercy, ok we feel it
Ayy, is this the- is this like the real thing this time with this one?
Or is this another one of those flings?
Like, you gonna bring her home to mom
Does mom know about this one?We know you're close with your mom
What you say about animal cruelty?
Like do you think they should have shot Harambe or like what?
I mean do you think he was going to maul the kid?
We seen you in the furs man, don't lie

[Part 1: "Voices in My Head"]

[Chorus]
Voices in my head sayin' I could do better, damn
Voices in my head sayin' that I knew better
(You know better, what the fuck!)
I done seen this shit happen a hundred times on the regular
But I still crossed the line like I'm blind, damn
Voices in my head saying I could do better
(You always do the same shit)

[Verse]
This was supposed to be the last time, last hit
Last call, last feel, last trip, last run
That's what I always tell myself, huh, damn
This was supposed to be the last one, last two
Last flip, last you, last me, last night
Doing every single thing my parents warned me 'bout
(You're a fucking disappointment) 'Til I wore 'em out, shit

[Chorus]
Voices in my head saying I could do better
(Voices in my head saying that I could do better)
Voices in my head saying that I knew better
(Yeah, you know what's about to go down)
I done seen this shit happen a hundred times on the regular
But I still, fuck
(That's your problem, you don't listen!)

[Part 2: "Stick to the Plan"]

[Intro]
Voices in my head, conscience talking to me like
Look
Metro Boomin want some more, nigga

[Chorus]
Stick to the plan, stick to the plan
Stick to the plan, bitch quit playing
Stick to the, plan, to the plan
Stick to the plan, bitch quit playing
Stick to the, plan

[Verse 1]
Stay focused
Don't let these niggas see your emotions
Stick to the notion, stay in motion
Remember soon as you stand still
So will everything else you notice
Make sure all your inner actions end with actions
If you stacking fronting and back in
Subtract if it isn't adding
Plus who hurt you don't let back in
Plan it out, yeah, tit for tat it
Extra pussy get distracted
Put that into what's worth having (boy)

[Chorus]
Stick to the plan, stick to the plan
Stick to the plan, bitch quit playing
Stick to the, plan, to the plan
Stick to the plan, bitch quit playing
Stick to the, plan

[Verse 2]
Stay focused (stay focused)
Pay attention who you getting close with
Distance yourself from negative energy
Voices in my head, they say it's meant for me
I, I, I, you in my way, bitch it's no sympathy
I, I, I, been plotting this since elementary
I, I, I, no you need to buckle down
Have people asking where you at
And wondering why you never wanna come around
You know that effort gon' come around
Big face like Zordon
You bought the watch but can't afford the time
Even if you running out of breath
Weight of the world doing lots of reps
Time to get this generation
Last one and then the next two outta debt
And they gon' pay you back with respect
Just stick to the plan, still, we can chill
Back when I rocked the white and blue Grant Hills
I realized there's no dream that I can't fill
I manifested all while I'm the man still
(Bitch I'm the man)

[Verse 3]
Voices in my head attacking what I'm thinking
Bullet to the head might be the way to free it
If I leave my body I can free the spirits
Swear to God my death of fear just keep on shrinking
Wishing I could go back to the nineties
Back when I was dreaming
Me and my dog was on a mission like we Kel and Kenan
Early 2000s Detroit might as well been the hell with demons
Wondering when I started losing it, the losing grip
Feeling like I'm in the middle of the ocean
You either drown or canoe through it
Voices in my head said I'm used to it
Some help me to lose and some help me maneuv' through it
When I talk to myself I'm confused on who's who it
I know in life you either blow it or blew it
And at the end of life, it's gonna feel like you flew through it
I just hope by then I cut the voices in my head

[Verse 1]
In the suburbs, I
I learned to drive
And they told me we'd never survive
Grab your mother's keys, we're leaving
You always seemed so sure
That one day we'd fight in
In a suburban war
Your part of town against mine
So we're standing on the opposite shore
But by the time the first bombs fell
We were already bored
We were already, already bored

[Chorus 1]
Sometimes I can't believe it
I'm moving past the feeling
Sometimes I can't believe it
I'm moving past the feeling again

[Verse 2]
Kids want to be so hard
But in my dreams, we're still running
And screaming through the yard
And all of the walls that they built in the seventies finally fall
When all of the houses they build in the seventies finally fall
Meant nothing at all
Meant nothing at all
It meant nothing

[Chorus 2]
Sometimes I can't believe it
I'm moving past the feeling
Sometimes I can't believe it
I'm moving past the feeling and into the night

[Verse 3]
So can you understand
Why I want a daughter
While I'm still young?
I want to hold her hand
And show her some beauty
Before all this damage is done
If that's too much to ask
If it's too much to ask
Then send me a son
Under the overpass
Under the parking lot
We're still waiting
It's already passed
So move your feet from hot pavement
And onto the grass
'Cause it's already passed
It's already, already passed

[Chorus 3]
Sometimes I can't believe it
I'm moving past the feeling
Sometimes I can't believe it
I'm moving past the feeling and into the night
I'm moving past the feeling
I'm moving past the feeling
And in my dreams we're still screaming
In my dreams we're still screaming
In my dreams we're still screaming

[Verse 1]
I could have told you
She'd hurt you
She'd you love you a while
Then desert you
If only you asked
I could have told you so

[Verse 2]
I could have saved you
Some crying
Yes, I could have told you she's lying
But you were in love
And didn't want to know

[Chorus]
I hear her now
As I toss and turn and try to sleep
I hear her now
Making promises she'll never keep
And soon, it's over and done with
She'll find someone new to have fun with
Through all of my tears
I could have told you so

[Chorus]
I hear her now
As I toss and turn and try to sleep
I hear her now
Making promises she'll never keep
And soon, it's over and done with
She'll find someone new to have fun with
Through all of my tears
I could have told you so

[The Notorious B.I.G:]
My style is harder
Than the nipples on a freak
Who the fuck can compete
With the brother with the hardcore speak
When I speak I leave MC's speechless
Nigga repeat this, I leave you teethless
Believe this
Oh God, it's over, Jehova!
When I slay ya jump in the Range Rover
I slay ya

[Outro:]
That's it! That's it! No more lyrics

[Sampled:]
That Brooklyn Bullshit, we on it!
I'm on fire
Because you want me
Because you want me

But my desire
Is going to crush me
'Cause you are wired

But I'm all chills
'Cause you adore me
You adore me

But I'm still all kills
I need my thrills
I need my thrills

I'm on fire
Because you want me
Because you want me

But my desire
Is going to level me
'Cause you're alive
But I'm all chills
'Cause you've been loose-knit
You've been loose-knit

But I'm still all kills
I need my thrills
I need my thrills

I'm on fire
Because you want me
Because you want me

But all of my desire
Is going to crush me
When you expire

But I'm still all kills
But you want me
Because you want me

But I'm still all kills
When its all pills
I need my thrills

Thrills, thrills, thrills
Don't you make me wanna wake up
Next to you
Thrills, thrills, thrills
Don't you make me wanna wake up
Next to you

Thrills, thrills, thrills
Don't you make me wanna wake up
Next to you

Thrills, thrills
Don't you make me wanna wake up

Shame on you
Shame on you

Hey, your love away from me
You can't hide

[Repeating]
Hey
Your love away from me
Hey
Shame on you
Your love away from me
You can't hide
Hey
Your love away from me
Shame on you

Oh no, still you can, and I'll be lonely
Oh no, still you can, and I'll be lonely

Oh no, still you can, and I'll be lonely
Oh no, still you can, and I'll be lonely

[Repeat 8x]
Shame on you
Ready?
Ready

Welcome
Step through the doors
Sliding doors

Okay I’m serious
I’m just playing

It changed
Mystery solved

You can see everything from here
Isn't it beautiful?
It is beautiful

I bet you know what you need to know by now
Just take a moment

I must admit your technology is wonderful
I've never seen anything like this
Will you accept our friendship?
Without hesitation

I didn’t say we could promise anything more than that
Unless you’re seeing everything for the first time

Alright
That is everything

Step through the door
I have already stepped through the door
Then welcome

I see no need for this
Who's that?
I wasn't to talk to you
Who is that?
Who's talking?

I want to talk to you about a few things
Is that a voice in my head?
Help me understand why your friends are all afraid
Help me understand why your friends are all afraid

Get out of my head
They’re from New York City
By way of the interstellar highway

Doesn’t he rock you?

Thank you very much
I really appreciate it
Okay I’m done
My favorite song
My favorite song
Reminds me of the first time I went to space
It was such a long journey
It took hours, days, years
But when it was over...

Oh, it takes me back
That takes me back to the first time
I stepped into space
You were there
You were there with all my best friends

I remember
I remember the look on your face
The way you said, with your eyes
You said

[Instrumental]

And then I slipped out of the Sun's sphere of influence
Nothing was happening
It was so dizzying
And then you took everything from me
I was left here, a shell of my self
I was left here to pick up the pieces
And every piece was...

Love, give me love

That's when you saved me
At the last possible moment
You brought your big hand out
And scooped up my ship
And took me home

That day you gave a new faith
In how people can save one another
Instead of always putting out their hands
To crush

[Repeat 2x]
When you're out in space
You feel so light
Na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na

[Repeat 3x]
When you're out in space
You feel so light
Na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na
When you're out in space
You feel so light

[Instrumental]

[Intro: Young Thug]
Won't you please
Slow it down?
I'm tryna talk to you, darlin'
Tryna walk with you, darlin'
Do you hear me?
And no-no-no-no-nobody can stop it
The love you got from me
And every time, I look out at my seat today
They chase, they flash they flash, yes

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
Tell me how you feel right now
'Cause all I wanna do is keep it real right now
I'm tryna beat it up, Beat Pills right now
Athletic in the sheets, I got skills right now
Break bread with some red baby hair
Ballin' in the club, Ace of Spades, yeah
Pop that bitch and spray it like 'Raid'
Yellow diamonds on you like a glass of lemonade
QB, I'll throw it
Teeth white, Newports
I want knees like shorts
80 thousand dollar Birkin bag in the Porsche
I'm tryna fuck with you 'til we on life support
I'll split it with you if we get half of Michael Jordan
No toilet tissue, I shit on niggas 'cause life is short (facts)
No passport to go with me, I had to get deported

[Chorus: Pharrell Williams  & Young Thug]
Release, let go, and have a good time
Have a good, have a good time, yeah
Have a good, have a good time
Release, let go, and have a good time
Let's have a good, have a good time, yeah

[Refrain: Ariana Grande & Pharrell Williams]
When you do things like this
And you set me free
How can anyone get tired?
When you do things like this
And you set me free
I think I've just been inspired
Oh babe

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
Jeffery!
Brand new chapter of a real you
She got every red bottom like a baboon
Hunnid' bottles in the club, real one room
Girl you gotta keep up with a boss move
King of the jungle, tycoon
Everybody thinking that's a cartoon
We just wanna party, way back in the war room
Do you want some? No I don't, son
Tryna watch me ballin', do you want money?
I'm just tryna turn up, tryna work something
Shawty suck the dick good, she wanna fuck it first
Hey mista, you a rat burn
Good hair down her back
Rich nigga, I like 'em ratchet
Fuck it up, throw it back
No shave, Brazilian wax

[Chorus: Pharrell Williams  & Young Thug]
Release, let go, and have a good time
Have a good, have a good time, yeah
Have a good, have a good time
Release, let go, and have a good time

[Refrain: Ariana Grande & Pharrell Williams]
When you do things like this

I think I've just been inspired
When you do things like this
And you set me free, boy
How can anyone get tired?
When you do things like this
And you set me free
I think I've just been inspired

[Outro: Pharrell Williams & Ariana Grande]
Hey, hey
I could sweat like this all night
Oh, heatstroke, oh
I think you opened my eyes
Should my heart not be humble, should my eyes fail to see
Should my feet sometimes stumble on the way, stay with me
Like the lamb that in springtime wanders far from fold
Comes the darkness and the frost, I get lost, I grow cold
I grow cold, I grow weary, and I know I have sinned
And I go seeking shelter and I cry in the wind
And though I grope and I blunder and I kneel and I'm wrong
Though the rose buckles under where I walk, walk along
Till I find to my wonder every path leads to thee
Or that I can do is, pray, stay with me
Stay with me

[Verse 1]
Don’t you know that you’re the one I want
Can’t you understand the way I feel
I feel electric rushes in my blood
Come on, it's plain for all the world to see
That you and me, we could be so picture perfect
You’re the only one I want

[Pre-Chorus]
I’ve been
Dreamin’ of it
Ridin’ in your car
Into the sunset

[Chorus]
I can’t get you out of my head
I just want you here in my bed
‘Cause I really need you near me
Can you hear me
Can you hear me, ahh
Baby, I will never regret
Those three, little words that I said
‘Cause I really need you near me
Can you hear me
Can you hear me, ahh
Ahh, ooh
‘Cause I really need you near me
Can you hear me
Can you hear me, ahh

[Verse 2]
You look at me like I’m one of your friends
We always say goodnight as soon as the party’s over
Wish it didn’t have to end (ever)
I’m really sorry, but I told the truth
Was it too much for you to handle
Wish that I could hide it, but I can’t pretend (no more)

[Pre-Chorus]
I’ve been
Dreamin’ of it
Ridin’ in your car
Into the sunset

[Chorus]
I can’t get you out of my head
I just want you here in my bed
‘Cause I really need you near me
Can you hear me
Can you hear me, ahh
Baby, I will never regret
Those three, little words that I said
‘Cause I really need you near me
Can you hear me
Can you hear me, ahh
Ahh, ooh
‘Cause I really need you near me
Can you hear me
Can you hear me, ahh

[Bridge: Spoken]
I’m lying in my bed
And I can’t get you off my mind
Can you hear me?
I’ve just got to tell you

[Chorus]
I can’t get you out of my head
I just want you here in my bed
‘Cause I really need you near me
Can you hear me
Can you hear me, uh
Baby, I will never regret
Those three, little words that I said
‘Cause I really need you near me
Can you hear me
Can you hear me

Oh-oh-whoa, oh-whoa
‘Cause I really need you near me
Can you hear me
Can you hear me, ahh
Oh-oh-whoa, oh-whoa
‘Cause I really need you near me
Can you hear me
Can you hear me, ahh
(Oh-oh-whoa, oh-whoa)
I can’t get you out of my head
I just want you here in my bed
‘Cause I really need you near me
Can you hear me
Can you hear me, ahh
(Oh-oh-whoa, oh-whoa)
Baby, I will never regret
Those three, little words that I said
‘Cause I really need you near me
Can you hear me
Can you hear me, ahh

No rush at all (Yeah)
No rush (Yeah)
No rush at all (Yeah)
Ay

[Verse 1]
You're a bad bitch and I'm an asshole
With a habit of fuckin' mad hoes
'Til you came around and made it all slow down
Sweatin' you now, I wanna take you down
And I see now that you won't let me down
So I want you to know

[Chorus]
There's no rush, no rush, babe
No rush (no rush at all), no rush, babe
No rush, no rush, babe
No rush (no rush at all), no rush
Baby, take your time and I'll be here waiting, you know
(No rush, no rush
No rush, no)

[Verse 2]
You're a bad bitch and I'm an asshole
What a difference, still a match though
It don't matter 'cause you got my heart on locked down
Sweatin' you now, I wanna take you down
And I see now that you won't let me down
And I want you to know

[Chorus]
There's no rush, no rush, babe
No rush (no rush at all), no rush, babe

Baby ain't no rush at all

[Intro]
One, two, three

[Verse 1]
Baby left on Omaha
She's got too much just going on
All these options forcing me to find myself
Why on Earth would I ask you for any help?

[Chorus]
I was thinking wrong, yeah
Already gone, baby
I was thinking wrong, yeah
I'm already gone

[Verse 2]
Who said it's forever?
You've got to set your mind free
I don't have time for this weather
I let it pour over me

[Chorus]
'Cause you're thinking wrong, yeah
We're already gone, baby
'Cause you're thinking wrong, yeah
You're already gone

[Bridge]
Ooh
Ooh
Just better watch out, yeah

[Outro]
(You've got to set your mind free)
You're already gone, yeah
(You've got to set your mind free)
You're already gone, baby
(You've got to set your mind free)
You're already gone, yeah
(You've got to set your mind free)
You're already gone, baby
(You've got to set your mind free)
(You've got to set your mind free)
(You've got to set your mind free)

[Verse 1]
You filled the hole that pierced my soul, I promised that I'd find
Someone willing to take a run, round pleasures of my mind
Am I a perv, cause every nerve is craving for you touch
You make me laugh, you're my better half
Though you weigh twice as much

350 pounds of love, you must have fell from up above
And killed the townspeople below, you had a crush and you let it show
When I want to pleasure you, I need an expedition crew
With all those trips to KFC, you eat out more than me

[Verse 2]
We look just like the number ten, when you stand next to me
Is it your stare that pulls me in, or just gravity
You mix mayonnaise with your scotch, you're the perfect spouse
Last week we went on a whale watch, the boat drove to your house

350 pounds of pain, when you exhale Al Gore goes insane
Whenever we make-out, I taste jam and sauerkraut
We went on a sailing trip, you fell and floated beside the ship
Then the boat docked on your pants and said, "I claim this island in the name of France"

[Verse 3]
Then you did what I feared, you disappeared, sayin' it was something new
Liposuction, breast reduction, what came home wasn't you
No, no, no, no, it wasn't you

It was 120 pounds of hate, and you said "I look great!"
And when the nurses removed the fat, they found the neighbors cat
I just paused and said to her, "I loved you just the way you were"
Then she smiled and, for my sake, said, "Pass the cake."

[Outro]
Pass the cake
Pass the cake
Pass the cake

[Intro]
Yeah, yeah
Gucci Mane LaFlare
Big Cat LaFlare Baby
Check it

[Verse 1]
It's obvious, I'm marvelous
Flopping is preposterous
Gucci Mane be dropping this shit down Amy's esophagus
Elaborant, Extravagant
Damn that nigga talented
And he a G I woulda handled just like he handled it
Late at night the candle lit
Deadly like a candlestick
Flickering just like a dancer bitch
Bugging with the camera flick
Gucci so enormous now
Vernacular, immaculate, sporadically, dramatically
Ol boy you been a casualty
A lot of niggas mad at me
Mad because my weapons stocked
Officially, officially, my memories, my repertoire
Pulled up in a cemetery, I got so many berries
I can't die for pussy niggas doubting my itenierary
..............................................
My buyers don't discriminate
Haters I eliminate, on suckers bet I demonstrate
Penetrate and infiltrate, it be easy to evacuate
Suckers I annihilate, you haters just might die today
Fly today and high today, so which might that I buy today
Smoke a whole damn fifth so I can think of something fire to say
I'm polarized, I strategize, strategically we meditated
Dead man is castrated cause the nigga hesitated
I drop it but I keep the drop
Take the chain and keep the watch
Keep the weed and take the whaaa?
Keep the weed and take the whaaa?
Stuff you hear is actual, half you see is factual
Gucci International, at times I am irrational
I'm militant and feelin it, even though I'm Killin it
Zip line sealing it, boosted my adrenaline
Flavorful like kerosene, greasy like some Vaseline
Gucci got the trap house trappin like a trampoline

[Verse 1]
The sun is falling now
Seems like you left the town
Why would you ever leave us?
Well, it's nothing to discuss
'Cause I know that it's over

[Hook 1]
We won't forget you now
'Cause you'll be right back
Am I wrong
Am I wrong saying we will see you soon

[Verse 2]
These memories will fade
The sun won't shine today
My body starts to get pain
Not going anywhere
There's nothing left to say
'Cause I know that it's over

[Hook 2] x2
We won't forget you now
'Cause you'll be right back
Here again, here again with us
We can't wait to see the flowers
And when that time is here
We'll be so glad to get out
Get out when you come back to us
And hang out for those months of
Hang out for those months of time

Seven, seven AM

When the sun is coming up
Glitter, glitter in my hair

And I think I found the one
I can't stand up, walk straight, talk right
Can you pour me one more?

All my girls, pretty boys

Then, after the afterparty

(Need your lovin', want you back)
(Need your lovin', want you back)
(Need your lovin', want you back)
(Need your lovin', want you back)
I want you back (want you back)
I want you back baby (want you back)
I want you back (want you back)

[Verse 2]
I miss
I miss your sweet lips next to mine
This sad feeling
Is almost worse than dying, yeah
I miss
I miss the way you used to love me
Can't you understand, girl? (Can't you understand?)
I need your lovin', I want you back

[Chorus]
(Need your lovin', want you back)
(Need your lovin', want you back)
(Need your lovin', want you back)
(Need your lovin', want you back)
(Need your lovin', want you back)
(Need your lovin', want you back)
I want you back (want you back)
I want you back baby (want you back)
Yeah, yeah, yeah (want you back)
(Need your lovin', want you back)
(Need your lovin', want you back)

[Spoken Word: Broderick Smith]
Early that morning, the wagon-master of a train came into the post greatly excited, and reported that the dead body of a man and horse had been found in the road about six miles from the post. A company of infantry was immediately ordered out, and proceeding to the spot found the body of Sam Cherry, pinned fast to the ground by the dead body of his horse. The search was continued, and in a lateral canon were found the bodies of Sergeant Love and the three privates riddled with bullets, mutilated and disfigured, but giving every evidence of having sold their lives as brave men should. The trails were examined and the whole story worked out. The party had traveled along the road nearly to the entrance of the canon of the Limpia, known as the "Wild Rose Pass," when suddenly about thirty mounted Indians dashed from the bushes along the stream, cutting it off from retreat towards the Fort, and driving it up the lateral canon. Suspecting a trap, Sam Cherry suddenly turned, dashed through the line of Indians, regained the road, and ran for life, away from the Fort, followed by a number of yelling savages. He was evidently doing well, when his horse stumbled and fell breaking his neck, and pinning Sam's leg to the ground. In an instant, he was surrounded by the exultant Indians

Raising himself slightly, Sam fired five shots at his enemies, then turning the muzzle against his own temple, he escaped the tortures of their vindictive rage by his "last shot." The baffled and terrified Indians went away as fast as their ponies could carry them, not touching the body, not even taking the arms. Such is the way out in the west. People die by extreme barbaric ways. We’ve taken their lands, and in return they take our viscera and spread it across the desert lands

[Interviewer Loraine Alterman]
Hi, this is Loraine Alterman, Free Press teen editor and today I'm talking to Marvin Gaye. Marvin, how are you?

[Interviewee Marvin Gaye]
Well, I'm pretty fine today

[LA]
What do you think about teenagers and their clothes and their fads? Like, say, Mod clothes and wild things like this long hair.

[MG]
I think, I think if they want to wear Mod and everything, I think that's groovy, really. I, in fact, I. Mod clothes, I think it's something, it, it, it keeps, it. When you wear Mod clothes or go from one extreme to another, I think―and 

[?] clothes―I think it keeps you, it keeps a person happy. Who wants to wear Levi's all the time, you know, or just a plain black dress or something, you know. I think it's good

[LA]
Tell me Marvin, what's, what's the favorite, your favorite record? Your own. Your own record

[MG]
One of mine?

[LA]
Yeah, which one. Which one do you like the best?

[MG]
I like "Little Darling (I Need You)", funny 

[?] like that.

[LA]
Why do you like it?

[MG]
I think that "Little Darling" to me, when I hear "Little Darling" play. There's something in the grooves. There's something that comes out of the speaker―speakers―that uh, that strikes me as a feeling, as a, as a, as a, as a sound that has a sort of a yearning type of lonely, melancholy feeling and, it, it's just become my favorite

[LA]
Marvin, who's your favorite singer?

[MG]
Well, I have several. There's Frank Sinatra. There's, uhm, uh, Ray Charles, whom I think is great. I, I'm, I particularly like The Beatles

[LA]
Tell me, if you weren't a singer, what would you like to be?

[MG]
I think I'd like to be an, an airlines pilot

[LA]
What advice would you give someone who wants to become a singer

[MG]
Don't do it, haha

[LA]
And Marvin, how do you like living in Detroit?

[MG]
I love Detroit, it, it's a very cordial town, and peaceful and restful. Nothing at all like New York.

[LA]
I'd like to thank Marvin for being with us today, and I wanna remind all of you that you can read interviews like this on the Teen Beat page in the Free Press every Friday, along with stories of interest to all teenagers.

[Verse 1]
We've been here before, surrounded in the cold
You take me to places I've never known
And you push me to places I'll never go
I would die for you
Tell me the truth
Am I all that you would need?
If we're keeping it a hundred, you're all that I need for me
From the jump until forever from now, I would ride for you

[Chorus]
But you got me shot down by love
You got my heart now
Why won't you stop now?
Oh I've been knocked down by you
You got my heart now
Why won't you stop now?

[Verse 2]
I've been through it whole
I've been through the worst
But I never knew how much our love could hurt
Over my family I put you first
Writing out my feelings is the only thing that work
I don't hear from the friends I thought were mine too
But I hold on to the poems I would write you
Happy seventeen, I saw us two and you saw three
I guess our lines are structured like a haiku

[Chorus 2
You got me shot down by love
And you got my heart now
Why won't you stop now?
Oh I've been knocked down by you
And you got my heart now
Why won't you stop now?

[Bridge]
Knocked down, knocked down
Knocked down, knocked down
Knocked down
Knocked down

[Chorus]
I've been shot down by love
You got my heart now
Why won't you stop now?
I've been knocked down by you
And you got my heart now
Why won't you stop now?

[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]
You said, "I know"
When I said, "I need some time, need some space
To think about all of this"
And you watched me go
And I knew my words were hard to hear
And harder to ever take back

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift]
And I said, "When can I-I-I come back?"

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Keith Urban]
And you said, "That's when
When I wake up in the morning
That's when, when it's sunny or storming
Laughing, when I'm crying
And that's when I'll be waiting at the front gate
That's when, when I see your face
I'll let you in, and baby, that's when"
Mm, mm

[Verse 2: Keith Urban & Taylor Swift]
I said, "I know"
When you said, "I did you wrong, made mistakes
And put you through all of this" (Through all of this)
Then through the phone
Came all your tears
And I said, "Leave those all in our past"

[Pre-Chorus: Keith Urban]
And you said, "When can I-I-I come back?"

[Chorus: Keith Urban & Taylor Swift]
And I said, "That's when
When I wake up in the morning
That's when, when it's sunny or storming
Laughing, when I'm crying
And that's when I'll be waiting at the front gate
That's when, when I see your face
I'll let you in, and baby, that's when"

[Bridge: Taylor Swift]
And you said, "Honestly
When you were gone
Did you ever think of me?"
And I said

[Chorus: Taylor Swift with Keith Urban]
"That's when, when I woke up in the morning
That's when it was sunny or storming
Laughing, when I was crying
And that's when you were waiting at the front gate
That's when, when I saw your face
You let me in, and baby, that's when"

[Outro: Taylor Swift with Keith Urban]
That's when, when I wake up in the morning (Yeah)
That's when, when it's sunny or storming
When I'm laughing, when I'm crying
That's when I'll be waiting at the front gate
(That when I miss you, that's when I want you)
That's when, when I see your face
That's when I love you, that's when
First off my little brother on the beat
Second off he a motherfucking beast
Third off, man these hoes got me weak

And I ain't nothing when I skeet
Uh, she coming now, one coming when she leave
Plus I'm running through this money like it's hundreds at my feet
I don't really fuck with niggas so I'm done after I speak
And hate start with a h cause it comes after a g, aha
Yeah, the niggas start to recognize
I snatch the dinner off they plate and get some extra sides
And it's virginia till I effin die
I'm a fuck the game raw till she fucking dry
Lyrical murder spit a verse and you should duck and dive

Killing niggas really, who give a fuck if they die
Well that was harsh but really, who give a fuck, do I? Haha

Nah, I don't give a fuck about none of these niggas
Don't none if these niggas pay me

Sometimes livin life just too much worth
Too many you's now too many me's

[Chorus: Big Sean]
Make it, make it, make it, boy, we gotta make it
You can save your hand, I ain't gotta shake it
Everything lined up for the takin'
And what I need from 'em? No favors
Clique too big, bread gotta break it
'Cause these others lowkey with the snakin', fakin'
Everything lined up for the takin'
And what I need from 'em? No favors, no favors
What I need? No favors
Everything lined up for the takin'
And what I need from 'em? No favors

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
I'm about gettin' the job done, boy up every night
I'm about rollin' a seven when I toss up the dice
I'm about gettin' my logo all flooded with ice
I'm about takin' a risk that might fuck up your life
Tell 'em point and shoot like camera crews
In front of cameras too (Brrr!)
Damn, Sean, what happened to the humble attitude?
I'm like, "Niggas took the flow, but I'm still standin' too."
Thought I had the Midas touch, and then I went platinum too
Motherfuck all your comparisons (Fuck 'em!)
I've been talkin' to God like that's my therapist
I'm African-American in America, I ain't inherit shit
But a millionaire under 30 so He must be hearin' shit
Don, don, don life, I do this for the crib, the D to Flint
Kids who get sick with lead, others get hit with the lead
From where they need a handout, but they tell you put hands up
Only deals I had was from the Sam's Club
Now it's blue blood in my veins, though you know what I came for
Born in a world goin' where they told me I can't go
In my lane though, I'm in the same boat as Usain Bolt
Get ahead by any means so the head's what I aim for
When my grandma died I realized I got an angel
Show me everything's a blessing dependin' on the angles
Look, I am the anomaly, never needed favors or apologies
That's my new lifetime policy
Woodgrain steering wheel, this bitch feel like a pirate ship
How many hot verses 'til you bitches start acknowledgin'
The pictures we been paintin'? My nigga
Connected to a higher power—how I know?
'Cause I don't write this shit: I think it, my nigga
Look, all I ever did was beat the odds
'Cause when you try to get even it just don't even out
Never stoppin' like we hypnotized
Watch what we visualize on the rise
Be the G.O.A.T. while we alive; when we die, we gon' be the gods

[Chorus: Big Sean]
Make it, make it, make it, boy, we gotta make it
You can save your hand, I ain't gotta shake it
Everything lined up for the takin'
And what I need from 'em? No favors
Clique too big, bread gotta break it
'Cause these others lowkey with the snakin', fakin'
Everything lined up for the takin'
And what I need from 'em? No favors, no favors

[Verse 2: Eminem]
If she was flavor, I won't save her
No taste buds, ho, later!
Fuck you lookin' at, hater?
I saw them eyes like an ass raper
Try to copy my swag like a cheating classmate
I'll be the last face you see 'fore you pass
When you get your fuckin' ass graded like a math paper
So ahead of my time, "late" means I'm early
My age is reversing, I'm basically thirty
Amazingly sturdy, zany and wordy
Brainy and nerdy, blatantly dirty
Insanely perverted, rapey and scurvy
They blame me for murdering Jamie Lee Curtis
Said I put her face in the furnace, beat her with a space heater
A piece of furniture, egg beater, thermos
It may be disturbing, what I'm saying's cringeworthy
But I'm urinating on Fergie, call Shady number 81
Surely I'm turning into the Aaron Hernandez of rap
State of emergency, the planet's having panic attacks
Brady's returning, matter of fact I may be deserving
Of a pat on the back like a Patriots jersey
Inexplicable stomach growl from the pit of it
Like a fuckin' Terrier hid in it
Despicable, dumb it down, ridiculous
Tongue is foul, shoot off at the fuckin' mouth
Like a missile, a thunder cloud
Hundred pound pistol, pull the trigger, this gun will sound
And you'll get a round like Digital Underground
And fuck Ann Coulter with a Klan poster
With a lamp post, door handle, shutter
A damn bolt cutter, a sandal, a can opener
A candle, rubber, piano, a flannel, sucker
Some hand soap, butter, a banjo and manhole cover
Hand over the mouth and nose smother
Trample ran over the tramp with the Land Rover
The band, the Lambo, Hummer and Road Runner
Go ham donut, or go Rambo, gut her, make an example of her
That's for Sandra Bland, ho, and Philando
Hannibal on the lam, no wonder I am so stubborn
I'm anti, can't no government handle a commando
Your man don't want it
Trump's a bitch, I'll make his whole brand go under (Yeah)
And tell Dre I'm meeting him in L.A
White Bronco like Elway, speeding
I'm 'bout to run over a chick, Del Rey CD in?
Females stay beating 'em
Bet you they'll lay bleeding, and yell, "wait," pleading
But screaming is pointless like feeding Michel'le helium
Leaving 'em pale-faced, medium-sized welt
Straight treating 'em like a cellmate
Seedy, I'm climbing hell's gate
Bitch, I'm like your problems: self-made
Meaning someone else's help ain't needed, 'cause I'ma—

[Chorus: Big Sean]
Make it, make it, make it, boy, we gotta make it
You can save your hand, I ain't gotta shake it
Everything lined up for the takin'
And what I need from 'em? No favors
Clique too big, bread gotta break it
'Cause these others lowkey with the snakin', fakin'
Everything lined up for the takin'
And what I need from 'em? No favors, no favors
What I need? No favors
Everything lined up for the takin'
And what I need from 'em? No favors

[Outro]
(I know you feeling yourself right now)
(But I'm not sure she's the one—I wouldn't call her, man)
"Hey, I'm outside"
What are you doing here?

[Produced by FrancisGotHeat & WondaGurl]
I couldn't sleep a wink last night
Because we had that silly fight
I thought my heart would break the whole night through
I knew that you'd be sorry
And I'm sorry too

I didn't have my favorite dream
The one in which I hold you tight
I had to call you up this morning
To see if everything was still all right
Yes, I had to call you up this morning
'Cause I couldn't sleep a wink last night

I didn't have my favorite dream
The one in which I hold you tight
I had to call you up this morning
To see if everything was still all right
Yes, I had to call you up this morning
Cause I couldn't sleep a wink last night

[Verse]
They make me get up in the mornin', mornin', mornin', mornin'
They make me get up in the mornin', mornin', mornin', mornin'
They make me get up in the mornin', mornin', mornin', mornin'

[Verse]
They make me get up in the mornin', mornin', mornin', mornin'
They make me get up in the mornin', mornin', mornin', mornin'
They make me get up in the mornin', mornin', mornin', mornin'
They make me get up in the mornin', mornin', mornin', mornin'

[Verse 1]
Straight up
Look
The album droppin', they gettin' nervous
I cancel my Uber, it's time to lift the burden
Know if I take a pay cut that you gon' need a surgeon
I don't want the top spot, I deserve it
All I do is show love and it keep reversin'
Detroit, stand up, you know I'mma lead the resurgence
And prove so much, my old shit sound like another person
You know how the story go
Never stuck to the script or storyboard
I just left a four o'clock appointment with the oracle
She told me I got more to go, her boss workin' like I'm fresh off the unemployment though
And I'm celebrating like they told me "You are not the father" live on the Maury Show
It ain't over till a nigga overdose
I heard your new shit and I fell asleep
And wasn't even sleepy, that's how I know it was weak
Look, respect someone who came from the D
Was able to eat, put his friends and fam on and we speak
Who inferred that anyone who skin color this deep
Who still hasn't peaked
Who gets better every verse and every word that he speak
Sheesh
Flex let's go
Settin' the tone?
Yeah, we settin' the tone
You lettin' them know what it is?
Yes, sir
I Decided tonight
Look

[Verse 2]
I know 'Ye proud of me, he took me out of debt
I know Jay proud of me, he put this 'round my neck
And I might just kill ISIS with the same ice pick that I murder Donald Trump in the same night with
Lyrically I'm prepared for the worst
Spiritually I'm prepared for the best
But somehow I ended up in the middle
The exact place where me and destiny met
And I'm still findin' perfection in the imperfections
Tryna go the right way in life's intersection
You're now fuckin' with the most impressive
The most requested, you're witnessing the underdog's interception
And fourth quarter when you thought it was all over
I'm doin' the touchdown dance breakin' they hearts and records
And I probably wrote this shit down there in Austin, Texas
Livin' a life that'll turn my girl to a detective
I'm livin' a life that'll turn my dogs to some executives
I'm livin' a life that'll turn my dreams to some perspectives
Speaking of dreams, I got new dreams and new goals
My new vision is two-oh, by two-oh, that's 2020
Just tryna get that old money, youngins find a loophole
And it loop in my dogs on a conference call that can use those
So we don't gotta look back like we missed that boat
I got old niggas dissing, ex-girls missin'
Tell me, when did life become a game of tic-tac-toe?
I'm celebrating everyday like I got misdiagnosed
With terminal cancer, but it was just that cold
Oh, shit

[Verse 3]
I keep it anchored for you, rain, sleet or thunderstorm
Loyalty nowadays rare as a unicorn
I dedicate this one to stories that never get told
Ones who been offered the world for they souls but never sold
Those are million dollar offers but chose another road
'Cause you realize stayin' loyal to you is always worth more
If the sky falls, you know I pick it back up
That it in tune with the universe, like it's angels singing backup, man
Niggas ask me what's my backup plan
I look at 'em and say, "Does God have a backup plan?"
I'm sayin', look, I ain't God but I'm godlike
God don't like ugly, so I must one of the ones God like
'Cause I been at the right place at the wrong time
With the wrong people at the right place but still ended up here on time
Still ended up on time
Look, I guess it's hard not to get spotted when you livin' in the spotlight
I got my clique poppin', but I hardly live that pop life
Mighta popped a popstar, had paparazzi pop lights
But don't get it twisted, I'm in L.A. livin' that Pac life
In New York livin' that Big life
I'm in Detroit livin' that Don life
I left my last bitch and got my mom right
And I'm still carvin', killin' niggas, dearly departed
Workin' the game like a nigga blew in the cartridge
They know my name in Denver like I'm Eric Cartman
I put granny in the crib like I'm her father
All my neighbors went to Yale and Harvard
Captain of the squad forever startin'
Check the highlights, no yellow markers
I'm daily switchin' Rollies alter ice like I'm cooking Crystal Light
My role model Walter White, my role model Walter White
Man fuck gettin' indicted, boy, riots gettin' incited
Black boy from that black hole, I'm just tryna bring the light in
Young hero in my city, Teen Titan
The team the tightest, I touch her and she wet beside it
When I get inside it
But honestly, I can't get even too involved
Phone full of numbers, but ain't too many to call
Contacts on contacts, I hate we lost contact
I know I got more exes than a contract
But I wish it was you and me, remember when you would root for me
I wish there was one me for you, one for my family, I mean a group of me's
Goddamn, had to take a breather
Shit, can you believe it
Hold up, I ain't done my nigga
Need another?
No, hold up
Ha ha ha, yeah of course we here
Where else would we be at?
Okay, let's go

[Verse 4]
Okay
Shout out my nigga Esco
Yeah
Look, real ones
Look, all I ever did was figure it out
Back when a nigga used to have to live on the couch
And had to brainstorm this shit just to get through the drought
I strategized it in my head and started livin' it out
Man, these niggas want to purse without doing the work
Drag my name through the mud without doing it dirt
I put your face on the shirt like I'm doin' your merch
You love to talk, I'm 'bout doin' it first
Look, I see no change, you can keep the refund
And all the reruns, I seen it all before
Man, I haven't been satisfied in a row
That's one time, two times, three times
From where there's more pieces than peace signs
And gang signs than street signs
Hard times, but you pay your fee to be a phenom
I pull up in a car so busted that I'm hidin' in it
Don't want that Kia even if LeBron is ridin' in it
Psh, I'm offended
Knowing soon as he leave that commercial he pullin' off in that Bentley
Feelin' like the ninth inning, got a home run hittin'
Stone cold spittin', I'm too in tune to be inconsistent
And I done been through the ups and downs
And stay down and waited for ups to come around
You woulda thought we robbed a bank how I'm tryna run the town
And how cops hunt us down as our time runnin' out
I pray that karma doesn't get confused with
Somebody who didn't put the hours and work in and who's useless
'Cause I'm God MC, like Jesus produced it
It's time to make it work and not make excuses
What are you sayin', my man?
Askin' me about my own
What you tryna do what I do, boy, what, you want be my clone?
You ain't been through what I been through, you can't put that in songs
What you tryna prove me wrong like the banks that put mom on loans
You better watch up your tone, like you talk on the phone
I'm a 

[?] like I'm sittin' on drones
Damn, look
I'm tryna take the greatest story never told and make it my own

[Outro]
Flex
I Decided out right now in this motherfucker
Man, I ain't slept in two-three days
I'm on beast mode
Whatever niggas say about me, fuck what you sayin' if it ain't love
All I do is live my life and love, show love
That's what you supposed to do
That's the way that Jesus do it
If you hatin' on me, fuck you

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
Doggy in the kitchen cookin' chicken and rice
Thanksgiving holiday, yeah and I'm doin' it right
Pop up, potluck, full of good food
Birds say Thursday, I'm in a good mood
Make a quick hood call, watch a little football
From the bad bad, to the neighborhood good dog
Stood tall through it all
Pop state to state, German chocolate cake
With Kool-Aid in the glasses
My family by the masses
My little nephews and nieces
Runnin' around the house
From a little to a lot
BC, we thankful for all we got
Now what you want me to say?
Bow yo' heads for a sec, and take a moment to pray

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
Up early with Shirley, in the kitchen, on a mission
With hams and yams and mac & cheese for the chicken
Collard greens is finger-lickin'
Mean with the dip and
Bobby Jones on the television
Granny say grace for us
And Auntie makin' plates for us
The whole family in here now
Apple in ear now
Happy to be around
One of the dogs got full, baby
Took a whole bunch of turkeys to the hood, baby
See I'm about that action
Rest in peace, Mr. EJ Jackson
See we the gift that keep on givin'
Praise God we keep on livin'
BC, what you want me to say?
Bow yo' heads for a sec, and take a moment to pray

[Verse 1]
My veins are the roots of this tree
I would die inside if you ever stopped nurturing me
With your breath, oh, when you breathe
I feel like my eyes turn green

[Chorus]
If there's a God
I wonder what she looks like
I bet she looks like you
I bet she looks like you
I wish that life was really a dream
And you could put me to sleep
Forever and ever

[Instrumental Bridge + Outro]
its been a long time
since she had fun
so you know she's losing touch

shes got a good man
inside her going
“oh please dont make a fuss”

oh baby baby
oh baby baby (4x)

sometimes these
things get rough
but i hope itll all work out

yeah she hurts bad
but its not enough
and pretty soon you wont need to shout

and i know you
and i know your style
and for now youll pick her up
but i know you
and i know where youve been
youll put her down once you sneak it in

[Chorus]
Joe the lion
Went to the bar
A couple of drinks on the house an' he said
"Tell you who you are if you nail me to my car"

[Bridge]
Boy
Thanks for hesitating
This is the kiss off

[Verse]
Boy
Thanks for hesitating
You'll never know the real story
Just a couple of dreams
You get up and sleep
You can buy god it's Monday
Slither down the greasy pipe
So far so good no one saw you
Hobble over any freeway
You will be like your dreams tonight
You get up and sleep
You get up and sleep
Joe the lion
Made of iron

[Chorus]
Joe the lion
Went to the bar
A couple of drinks on the house an' he was
A fortune teller he said
"Nail me to my car and I'll tell you who you are"

[Chorus]
Joe the lion, yeah yeah
Went to the bar, yeah yeah
A couple of dreams and he was
A fortune teller he said
"Nail me to my car tell you who you are"

[Outro]
You get up and sleep
The wind blows on your cheek
The day laughs in your face
Guess you'll buy a gun
You'll buy it secondhand
You'll get up and sleep

[Verse 1: Anderson .Paak]
Don't do it, no favours
Night walker, you're shameless
I'm supposed to leave
Big problem
You murderer, I saw and...

[Hook: Anderson .Paak]
Now I have to bleed
You tore a hole in my flesh
How'm supposed to breathe, with a knife in my chest?

[Verse 2: Anderson .Paak]
Goddam you, can't stop from killing
You give them head then you go and chop off their heads
Then I bleed, theres no feelings at all

[Hook: Anderson .Paak]
But now I have to bleed
You tore a hole in my flesh
How'm supposed to breathe, with a knife in my chest

[Verse 3: DFD]
Heels with the devil red bottoms
Stained from a blood that you walked in
No conscience, new options
New man's convertible sitting shotgun
Walking out like you ain't never do me wrong
Judas, in Louis Vuitton
You be fronting' like an innocent gal though
Backstabbing fem fetale hoe
Why you got these naked pictures in your iPhone
You ain't never send them pictures out to my phone
Cup caking with a motherfucker I know
Cold blooded girl put me in a blindfold
You be killing them the same way you killing me
Never thought I'd see the day you be the enemy
If I gotta bleed, then I gotta bleed
(Let it be)

[Hook: Anderson .Paak]
But now I have to bleed
You tore a hole in my flesh
How'm supposed to breathe, with a knife in my chest

But now I have to bleed
You tore a hole in my flesh
How'm supposed to breathe, with a knife in my chest
One day you turn around and it's summer
Next day you turn around and it's fall
And the springs and the winters of a lifetime
Whatever happened to them all?

As a man who has always had the wand'ring ways
Now I'm reaching back for yesterdays
'Til a long-forgotten love appears
And I find that I'm sighing softly as I near
September, the warm September of my years

As I man who has never paused at wishing wells
Now I'm watching children's carousels
And their laughter's music to my ears
And I find that I'm smiling gently as I near
September, the warm September of my years

The golden warm September of my years

[Verse 1]
I guess I'll have to change my plan
I should have realized there'd be another man
I overlooked that point completely
Until the big affair began

[Verse 2]
Before I knew where I was at
I found myself upon the shelf and that was that
I tried to reach the moon but when I got there
All that I could get was the air

[Verse 3]
My feet are back upon the ground
I lost the one girl I'd found

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 4]
I guess I'll have to change my plan
I should have realized there'd be another man
Why did I buy those blue pajamas
Before that big affair began?

[Verse 5]
My boiling point is much too low
For me to try to be a fly Lothario
I think I'll crawl right back and into my shell
Dwelling in my personal Hell

[Verse 6]
I'll have to change my pattern 'round
I lost the one girl the one girl I'd found
Yes, the one girl
The one girl that I found
Once upon a time
A girl with moonlight in her eyes
Put her hand in mine
And said she loved me so
But that was once upon a time
Very long ago

Once upon a hill
We sat beneath a willow tree
Counting all the stars and waiting for the dawn
But that was once upon a time
Now the tree is gone

How the breeze ruffled through her hair
How we always laughed as though tomorrow wasn't there
We were young and didn't have a care
Where did it go

Once upon a time
The world was sweeter than we knew
Everything was ours
How happy we were then
But somehow once upon a time
Never comes again
Once upon a time
Never comes again

[Verse 1]
Don't know why
Theres no sun up in the sky
Stormy weather
Since my gal and I ain't together
Keeps raining all the time

[Verse 2]
Life is bare
Gloom and misery everywhere
Stormy weather
Just can't get my poor old self together
I'm weary all the time
The time
So weary all of the time

[Bridge]
When she went away
The blues walked in and they met
If she stays away that old rocking chair's gonna get me
All I do is pray the Lord above is gonna let me
Walk in the sun once more

[Verse 3]
Can't go on
Everything I have is gone
Stormy weather
Since my gal and I ain't together
Keeps raining all the time
Keeps raining all of the time

[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]
Once the last drop of rain has dried off the pavement
Shouldn't I find a stain, but I never do
The way the tires turn stones on old county roads
They leave 'em muddy underneath, reminds me of you
You find graffiti on the walls of old bathroom stalls
You know, you can scratch it right off, it's how it used to be
But like the dollar in your pocket, it's been spent and traded in
You can't change where it's been, reminds me of me

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Maren Morris]
I lived, and I learned, had you, got burned
Held out, and held on
God knows, too long, and wasted time
Lost tears, swore that I'd get out of here
But no amount of freedom gets you clean
I've still got you all over me

[Verse 2: Taylor Swift, with Maren Morris]
The best and worst day of June
Was the one that I met you
With your hands in your pockets
And your "Don't you wish you had me?" grin
Well I did, so I smiled
And I melted like a child
Now every breath of air I breathe reminds me of then

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Maren Morris]
And I lived, and I learned, had you, got burned
Held out, and held on
God knows, too long, and wasted time
Lost tears, swore that I'd get out of here
But no amount of freedom gets you clean
I've still got you all over me

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge: Taylor Swift, with Maren Morris]
I lived, and I learned
And found out what it was to turn around
And see that we
Were never really meant to be
So I lied, and I cried
And I watched a part of myself die
'Cause no amount of freedom gets you clean
I've still got you all over me

[Outro: Taylor Swift, with Maren Morris]
I've still got you all over me
Still got you all over me
Always alone and always avoided
Nobody loves a lonely jaguar
I have a strong and beautiful body
But nobody loves a lonely jaguar

In the moonlight of tropic midnight
I secretly wander under the stars
Needing to capture a capybara
To feed a hungry jaguar

Don't you wanna tell me if you're gonna
Put down your armor, promise no more drama

[Verse 1]
Throw up my hands I say, "I'm not Dalai Lama"
Throw up my hands say, "I'm not Obama"
I'm not Osama, Monsanto farmer
I don't drink no soda, I believe in Karma
They try to shut me down, I've still got the power
They try to hate me but I still be that lover
I know my mind, in me I'm gonna find
This is my time and I'm searching for the signs
Throw up my hands, say "this is people power"
Throw up my finger and I'm taking on the Tower

Don't you wanna tell me if you're gonna
Put down your armor, promise no more drama

[Refrain]

You say wa-wa-wa-wa-wa, I say pa-pa-pa-pa-pa

Put down your armor, promise no more drama
Throw up my hands, say "this is people power"
Throw up my finger and I'm taking on the Tower

[Verse 1]
Lord of Lightning shifts his gaze
Points his strong finger our way
Electricity escapes
Leaves destruction in his wake

[Interlude: The Reticent Raconteur]
Lining up his target like the huntsman points his rifle
Waves of flaxen flames as he mutters his magic title

[Refrain]
Lightning, oh!

[Pre-Chorus]
Nonagon, nonagon
Nonagon infinity, yup!

[Interlude: The Reticent Raconteur]
Howling like a horde of demons greatest battle cry
The violent lightning lord points his arms into the sky

[Chorus]
Floating fire
Golden wire
Silver trails
Flashing spire
Guns are cracking
Bombs are smacking
Cat o' tails
Whips her lashings

[Verse 2]
Lord of Lightning moves our way
Sends a crooked look at me
Electricity escapes
Lights the sky in citrine fleece

[Refrain]
Lightning, oh!

[Pre-Chorus]
Nonagon, nonagon
Nonagon infinity, yup!

[SPLIT]

[Interlude: The Reticent Raconteur]
One more time the vault lights up with carnival of paint
I endeavor to watch the panic, but I worry that I will faint

[Chorus]
Floating fire
Golden wire
Silver trails
Flashing spire
Guns are cracking
Bombs are smacking
Cat o' tails
Whips her lashings

[Verse 3]
Lord of Lightning's closer now
Our world's only rain and cloud
I'm not sure we have the power
Need to smite this evil down

[Refrain]
Lightning, oh!

[Pre-Chorus]
Nonagon, nonagon
Nonagon infinity, yup!
Nonagon, nonagon, oh!

[Interlude: The Reticent Raconteur]
And from the Lord's electric snare
One goes in his electric chair

[Verse 1]
Lord of Lightning shifts his gaze
Points his strong finger our way
Electricity escapes
Leaves destruction in our wake

[Interlude: The Reticent Raconteur]
His electric trap has electric cyanide
The luckless hostage has been thoroughly fried

[Refrain]
Lightning, yup!

[Pre-Chorus]
Nonagon, nonagon
Nonagon infinity, yes!

[Outro: The Reticent Raconteur]
And as the cadaver lay static with open crusted eyes
The smoking corpse began to twitch at my great surprise
Then the figure sprung up and at once it caught alight
And the creature known as Balrog was born that very night

The crowd in a rage, Gucci gettin' paid
Icey made your girl throw her thong on the stage
Young Gucci Mane hottest nigga in the A
Sellin plenty yae, movin' 20 bricks a day

Too hot to handle, ridin' down Conloe
Baby it's a Kodak moment, get your camera
Gucci Mane LaFlare nigga, damn what you say
Girls goin' crazy 'bout the nigga with the waves

Move big weight so I got money to throw up
Pimp tight nigga dead fresh with a mink coat
Lookin' for a big booty bitch with a deep throat

Yo baby mama told me that she my biggest fan
Say she got my poster hangin' on her wall
And she love every word every song that she heard
Absurd I catch hoes like a stool catch a turd
A school catch a nerd like a child strike a nerve
Absurd with these words with these nouns and these verbs
Kinda perved so I swerved my Lebrons on the curb
Still in the hood gettin' rich on the third
Watchin' out for 12 cause the people observe
I'mma burn one smoke one wit the world for
All the Gucci fans Gucci broads with your girl

[Verse 1: Katy Perry]
Are we crazy?
Living our lives through a lens
Trapped in our white picket fence
Like ornaments
So comfortable, we're living in a bubble, bubble
So comfortable, we cannot see the trouble, trouble
Aren't you lonely
Up there in utopia
Where nothing will ever be enough?
Happily numb
So comfortable, we're living in a bubble, bubble
So comfortable, we cannot see the trouble, trouble

[Pre-Chorus: Katy Perry]
So put your rose-colored glasses on
And party on

[Chorus: Katy Perry]
Turn it up, it's your favorite song
Dance, dance, dance to the distortion
Come on, turn it up, keep it on repeat
Stumbling around like a wasted zombie
Yeah, we think we're free
Drink, this one is on me
We're all chained to the rhythm
To the rhythm
To the rhythm
Turn it up, it's your favorite song
Dance, dance, dance to the distortion
Come on, turn it up, keep it on repeat
Stumbling around like a wasted zombie
Yeah, we think we're free
Drink, this one is on me
We're all chained to the rhythm
To the rhythm
To the rhythm

[Verse 2: Katy Perry]
Are we tone deaf?
Keep sweeping it under the mat
Thought we could do better than that
I hope we can
So comfortable, we're living in a bubble, bubble
So comfortable, we cannot see the trouble, trouble

[Pre-Chorus: Katy Perry]
So put your rose-colored glasses on
And party on

[Chorus: Katy Perry]
Turn it up, it's your favorite song
Dance, dance, dance to the distortion
Come on, turn it up, keep it on repeat
Stumbling around like a wasted zombie
Yeah, we think we're free

Stumbling around like a wasted zombie
Yeah, we think we're free
Drink, this one is on me
We're all chained to the rhythm
To the rhythm
To the rhythm

[Bridge: Skip Marley]
It is my desire
Break down the walls to connect, inspire
Ay, up in your high place, liars
Time is ticking for the empire
The truth they feed is feeble
As so many times before
They greed over the people
They stumbling and fumbling
And we're about to riot
They woke up, they woke up the lions
(Woo!)

[Chorus: Katy Perry]
Turn it up, it's your favorite song
Dance, dance, dance to the distortion
Come on, turn it up, keep it on repeat
Stumbling around like a wasted zombie
Yeah, we think we're free
Drink, this one is on me
We're all chained to the rhythm
To the rhythm
To the rhythm

[Outro: Katy Perry]
Turn it up
Turn it up
It goes on, and on, and on
It goes on, and on, and on
It goes on, and on, and on
'Cause we're all chained to the rhythm
Whenever I'm expecting a lot of company
Haven't had a lot of company in a long time
But if I were expecting some
I'd whip up a really (Ugh) substantial meal
You see how strong I am? (Heh)
It's from eating all this stuff

Good healthy meal like the...fillet

Now that's what they call...soul food
Now you got black-eyed peas
Carrot greens
Collard greens
Cornbread
Watermelon
And for dessert
Pork butts

Eat heartily gentlemen

I got a really stressful day and I really really needed some food
Something healthy like beets
Showed you how good it is
Well you may say "I don't think I'd care for that"
So you could also fix yourself a...

[Verse 1]
How you ain't say you was movin' forward?
Honesty hurts when you're gettin' older
I gotta say I'll miss the way you need me, yeah
Why you ain't say you was gettin' bored?
Why you ain't say I was fallin' short?
How you lead me out so far away?

[Pre-Chorus]
How could it be?
20 something, all alone still
Not a thing in my name
Ain't got nothin', runnin' from love
Only know fear
That's me, Ms. 20 Something
Ain't got nothin', runnin' from love
Wish you were here, oh

[Chorus]
Stuck in them 20 somethings, stuck in them 20 somethings
Good luck on them 20 somethings, good luck on them 20 somethings
But God bless these 20 somethings
(God bless, oh God bless, oh God bless, oh God bless, oh)
Hopin' my 20 somethings won't end
Hopin' to keep the rest of my friends
Prayin' the 20 somethings don't kill me, don't kill me

[Verse 2]
Weird, took us so long to separate
I feel, it's permanent like a riptide, this time
Waves crashing fast, I try
Think of the past, please stay
How could it be?

[Pre-Chorus]
How could it be?
20 something, all alone still
Not a phone in my name
Ain't got nothin', runnin' from love
Only know fear
That's me, Ms. 20 Something
Ain't got nothin', runnin' from love
Wish you were here, oh

[Chorus]
Stuck in them 20 somethings, stuck in them 20 somethings
Good luck on them 20 somethings, good luck on them 20 somethings
But God bless these 20 somethings
(God bless, oh God bless, oh God bless, oh God bless, oh)
Hopin' my 20 somethings won't end
Hopin' to keep the rest of my friends
Prayin' the 20 somethings don't kill me, kill me

[Skit: Mommy & SZA]
And if it's an illusion, I don't want to wake up. I'm gonna hang on to it. Because the alternative is an abyss, is just a hole, a darkness, a nothingness. Who wants that? You know? So that's what I think about control, and that's my story, and I'm stickin' to it
That was beautiful mommy, that was perfect
You must really like feelin' stupid
You do that a lot, all the time keep abusing me
Oo-do-do-do, oo-do-do-do, oo-do-do-do
You must really like feelin' stupid
You do that a lot, all the time keep abusing me
Oo-do-do-do, oo-do-do-do, oo-do-do-do

You can’t get ready and you can’t get right
And you so concerned with what you might see in the mirror
Not ready, you still baking
Your man on time and just learned how to use a beauty blender
Fuck sephora, I love sephora
Just cannot afford the things up in there
I used to work there
The only job I never got fired from (What)
Sorry I get tattoo at thirteen
Sorry I lose virgin at thirteen
Sorry I no trust men, they hurt me
Time and time and time and time again

You must really like feelin' stupid
You do that a lot, all the time keep abusing me
Oo-do-do-do, oo-do-do-do, oo-do-do-do
You must really like feelin' stupid
You do that a lot, all the time keep abusing me
Oo-do-do-do, oo-do-do-do, oo-do-do-do

[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
I don’t like my mind right now
Stacking up problems that are so unnecessary
Wish that I could slow things down
I wanna let go but there’s comfort in the panic
And I drive myself crazy
Thinking everything's about me
Yeah, I drive myself crazy
'Cause I can’t escape the gravity

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Kiiara]
I'm holding on
Why is everything so heavy?
Holding on
So much more than I can carry
I keep dragging around what's bringing me down
If I just let go, I'd be set free
Holding on
Why is everything so heavy?

[Verse 2: Kiiara]
You say that I'm paranoid
But I’m pretty sure the world is out to get me
It’s not like I make the choice
To let my mind stay so fucking messy
I know I'm not the center of the universe
But you keep spinning 'round me just the same
I know I'm not the center of the universe
But you keep spinning 'round me just the same

[Chorus: Kiiara]
I'm holding on
Why is everything so heavy?
Holding on
So much more than I can carry
I keep dragging around what's bringing me down
If I just let go, I'd be set free
Holding on
Why is everything so heavy?

[Bridge: Chester Bennington & Kiiara]
I know I'm not the center of the universe
But you keep spinning 'round me just the same
I know I'm not the center of the universe
But you keep spinning 'round me just the same
And I drive myself crazy
Thinking everything’s about me

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Kiiara]
Holding on
Why is everything so heavy?
Holding on
So much more than I can carry
I keep dragging around what's bringing me down
If I just let go, I'd be set free
Holding on
Why is everything so heavy?
Why is everything so heavy?
Why is everything so heavy?

[Verse 1]
It is good 'cause it is good
And it's all fine 'cause it's all fine
And I hope this gets me high!
'Cause I got a simple mind

[Verse 2]
It is good 'cause it is good
And it's all fine 'cause it's all fine
And I hope you get me high!
'Cause I've got a simple mind

[Verse 1]
Pull my finger
And punch my face
And you're all happy
'Cause my nose is bleedin' all over the place
I go

[Verse 2]
Pull my finger
And punch my face
And I'm all happy
'Cause my nose is bleedin' all over the place
I go

[Verse]
Just because I like you
It doesn't mean I like you

[Verse]
And just because I like you
It doesn't mean I like you

[Outro]
And just because I like you

[Verse 1]
There’s a voice I always trust
Its friendly helping hand tells me leave, I must
Cause I can’t stay forever, (a-a-a-a)
Cause I can't stay forever, (a-a-a-a)
By my window

[Chorus]
(A-a-a-a-a-a-a-a)
(A-a-a-a-a-a-a-a)
Cause I can’t stay forever
Cause I can’t stay forever
(A-a-a, a-a-a, a-a-a)

[Verse 2]
Rather chase a gentle breeze
Set my thoughts by taller trees
Cause I can’t stay forever, (a-a-a-a)
Cause I can't stay forever, (a-a-a-a)
By my window

[Chorus]
(A-a-a-a-a-a-a-a)
(A-a-a-a-a-a-a-a)
Cause I can’t stay forever
Cause I can’t stay forever
(A-a-a, a-a-a, a-a-a)

[Bridge]
I need whispers that make me move
(I need whispers that make me move)
Riding the country for driving’s sake
(Riding the country for driving’s sake)
Sync me within the outside world
(Sync me within the outside world)
So I can better miss my home
(So I can better miss my home)

[Chorus]
You and I we are one
Would you lie with me?
You and I we are one
Would you lie with me?

[Chorus]
You and I we are one
Would you lie with me?
You and I we are one
Would you lie with me?

[Verse 1]
You speak In ways
I thought were only mine
You show me otherwise
Keeps me aware
Some thoughts I quell
I know them well
They’re only mine to keep
But you see through me

[Verse 2]
Your friendly presence
Is truly grounding
You calm me
Humbling, but never shaming
Keeps me going on
I’m always on the move
Retreated in my mind
There is my rest

[Chorus]
You and I we are one
Would you lie with me?
You and I we are one
Would you lie with me?

[Chorus]
You and I we are one
Would you lie with me?
You and I we are one
Would you lie with me?

[Verse 3]
Leaning, way too late
Thinking over my desk
Body forgets to eat
But not to drink
Work and I love strong
Feeling detached
Seated somewhere near
Five inches behind my sight

[Verse 4] / 

[Verse 2]
Your friendly presence
Is truly grounding
You calm me
Humbling, but never shaming
Keeps me going on
I’m always on the move
Retreated in my mind
There is my rest

[Verse 1]
Let’s lay down our masks
And be true
So that our eyes
Be bound in affection
Aware of our lust
And our shared trust
We can know each other
And hear nature’s words
My dear friend

[Chorus]
But let’s not talk this through (I used to)
Cause long words widen gaps between lovers
We ought to be lone, my home’s your own
Until we have each other we’re strangers

[Verse 2]
I know there’s a reason
We use such curves
Riddles in smiles
Rather than small talk
I know we both want
Things to be done
In a truthful manner
There lies our rest
My dear friend

[Chorus]
Let’s not talk this through (I used to)
Cause long words widen gaps between lovers
We ought to be lone, my home’s your own
Until we have each other we’re strangers

[Chorus]
Let’s not talk this through (I used to)
Cause long words widen gaps between lovers
We ought to be lone, my home’s your own
Until we have each other we’re strangers

[Post-Chorus]
Let’s not talk this through...

[Verse]
Outlaws on the run
Faster than a stolen gun
Tied naked to the trees
Killed so gruesomely
Burning tents to the ground
Cops won't wave 'em down
The most wanted men
Bushrangers reigning in

[Chorus]
Bloodthirsty tendencies
Anti-authority
Mad dog Morgan
He never gave a warning
Mad dog Morgan
Shot in the back by morning

[Verse]
Outlaws on the run
Faster than a stolen gun
Tied naked to the trees
Killed so gruesomely
Burning tents to the ground
Cops won't wave 'em down
The most wanted men
Bushrangers reigning in

[Chorus]
Bloodthirsty tendencies
Anti-authority

He never gave a warning

[Verse]
You think I'd leave your side baby
You know me better than that
You think I'd leave you down
When you're down on your knees
I wouldn't do that
I'll tell you you're right when you're wrong
And if only you could see into me

[Chorus]
Oh when you're cold
I'll be there
Hold you tight to me
When you're on the outside baby
And you can't get in
I will show you
You're so much better than you know
When you're lost and you're alone
And you can't get back again
I will find you
Darling and I will bring you home
And if you want to cry
I am here to dry your eyes
And in no time, you'll be fine

[Verse]
You think I'd leave your side baby
You know me better than that
You think I'd leave you down
When you're down on your knees
I wouldn't do that
I'll tell you you're right when you're wrong
And if only you could see into me

[Chorus]
Oh when you're cold, I'll be there
Hold you tight to me
Oh when you're low, I'll be there
By your side baby
Oh when you're cold, I'll be there
Hold you tight to me
Oh when you're low, I'll be there
By your side baby
Alright so the streets want to know what's Wayne's situation?

And Jay was tryna help me. He was really trying, he was like "Dude whenever you get out your situation, I'm here, I'm here. Whatever you need, I'm here". It's like believe that. Then all the sudden I gets a call from Universal and they like "Hey". They wasn't talking no - I couldn't even understand what they're talking about. They were talking about, millions and stuff. Those were I ain't ever heard of, yahearinme? So I was like "Dayyyuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuum" and I was like "Believe that" and so, yahearinme? In reality of it all, I got - I got some more time over here. I ain't finished doing what I was doing. So, what Weezy's doing? Finishing up. You motherfuckers still stay - stay in focus

Shoutout to Reflex for bringing me this sample. Any and everybody who helped with the Be album, we brought back that real hip-hop shit. This is one of the greatest times of my life. You know we workin' on a new joint "Finding Forever" right now, be in stores this summer. Depending on what year you're listening to this mixtape, it might've been in stores last summer, depending on what year that is. I won't say the year because Extra P told me don't say the year. So from now, till forever baby "Finding Forever". Hi boys and girls, I always wanted to say that over this sample, I have nothing else to say though. Hooooo!
Blue jean baby, L.A. lady, seamstress for the band
Pretty eyed, pirate smile, you'll marry a music man
Ballerina, you must have seen her dancing in the sand
And now she's in me, always with me, tiny dancer in my hand

Jesus freaks out in the street
Handing tickets out for God
Turning back she just laughs
The boulevard is not that bad

Piano man he makes his stand
In the auditorium
Looking on she sings the songs
The words she knows, the tune she hums

But oh how it feels so real
Lying here with no one near
Only you and you can hear me
When I say softly, slowly

Hold me closer, tiny dancer
Count the headlights on the highway
Lay me down in sheets of linen
You had a busy day today
Hold me closer, tiny dancer
Count the headlights on the highway
Lay me down in sheets of linen
You had a busy day today

Blue jean baby, L.A. lady, seamstress for the band
Pretty eyed, pirate smile, you'll marry a music man
Ballerina, you must have seen her dancing in the sand
And now she's in me, always with me, tiny dancer in my hand

But oh how it feels so real
Lying here with no one near
Only you and you can hear me
When I say softly, slowly

Hold me closer, tiny dancer
Count the headlights on the highway
Lay me down in sheets of linen
You had a busy day today

Hold me closer, tiny dancer
Count the headlights on the highway
Lay me down in sheets of linen
You had a busy day today

[Intro: Groove Coverage]
God is a girl!

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Yo, yo, yo, yo
Have you ever been hated or discriminated against?
I've been protested and demonstrated against
Picket signs for my wicked rhymes, look at the times
Sick as the mind of the motherf***in' kid that's behind
All this commotion, emotions run deep as oceans, explodin'
Tempers flarin' from parents, just blow 'em off and keep goin'
Not takin' nothin' from no one, give 'em hell long as I'm breathin'
Keep kickin' ass in the morning and takin' names in the evenin'
Leave 'em with a taste as sour as vinegar in they mouth
See, they can trigger me, but they'll never figure me out
Look at me now! I bet you're probably sick of me now
Ain't you, Mama? I'ma make you look so ridiculous now!
Look so ridiculous now, look so ridiculous now
Look so ridiculous now, make you look so ridiculous now
Now, now, now, now, now, now...

[Verse 2: Groove Coverage]
Remembering me, discover and see
All over the world, she's known as a girl
To those who are free, their minds shall be keep
Forgotten as the past, 'cause history will last

[Chorus: Groove Coverage]
God is a girl, wherever you are
Do you believe it? Can you receive it?
God is a girl, whatever you say
Do you believe it? Can you receive it?
God is a girl, however you live
Do you believe it? Can you receive it?
God is a girl, she's only a girl
Do you believe it? Can you receive it?

[Verse 3: Eminem]
His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already: Mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's choking, how? Everybody's joking now
The clock's run out, time's up, over—blaow!
Snap back to reality, there goes gravity
There goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad but he won't
Give up that easy, no, he won't have it, he knows
His whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter, he's dope
He knows that but he's broke, he's so stagnant, he knows
When he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's
Back to the lab again, yo!

[Interlude: Eminem]
One shot, or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted, in one moment

[Verse 4: Eminem]
I got some skeletons in my closet
And I don't know if no one knows it
So before they throw me inside my coffin and close it
I'ma expose it; I'll take you back to '73
Before I ever had a multi-platinum-selling CD
I was a baby, maybe I was just a couple of months
My 

[faggot] father must have had his panties up in a bunch
‘Cause he split, I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye
No, I don't, on second thought, I just 

[fuckin'] wished he would die
I look at Hailie, and I couldn't picture leavin' her side
Even if I hated Kim, I'd grit my teeth and I'd try
To make it work with her at least for Hailie's sake
I maybe made some mistakes
But I'm only human, but I'm man enough to face 'em today
What I did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb
But the smartest 

[shit] I did was take the bullets out of that gun
‘Cause I'da 

[killed him, shit], I woulda shot Kim and him both
It's my life, I'd like to welcome y'all to The Eminem Show

[Chorus: Groove Coverage]
God is a girl, wherever you are
Do you believe it? Can you receive it?
God is a girl, whatever you say
Do you believe it? Can you receive it?
God is a girl, however you live
Do you believe it? Can you receive it?
God is a girl, she's only a girl
Do you believe it? Can you receive it?

[Verse 5: Eminem]
No more games, I'ma change what you call rage
Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged
I was playin' in the beginning, the mood all changed
I've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhymin' and stepped right in the next cypher
Best believe somebody's payin' the Pied Piper
All the pain inside amplified by the
Fact that I can't get by with my nine-to-
Five and I can't provide the right type of life for my family
'Cause man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers
And there's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life
And these times are so hard, and it's gettin' even harder
Tryna feed and water my seed, plus teeter-totter
Caught up between bein' a father and a prima donna
Baby mama drama, screamin' on her, too much for me to wanna
Stay in one spot, another day of monotony's
Gotten me to the point I'm like a snail, I've got
To formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot
Success is my only motherfuckin' option—failure's not
Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got
To go; I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot
So here I go, it's my shot: feet, fail me not
This may be the only opportunity that I got

[Outro: Groove Coverage]
God is a girl!

[Verse 1]
Please don't tip-toe
Come close, let's flow
Anchor in me, and get lost at sea
The world's your oyster and I am the pearl
Open waters
Sink into me slowly

[Chorus]
So baby, come and take a swim with me
Make me ripple 'til I'm wavy
Don't be scared to dive in deep
And start a tsunami
Tsunami

[Verse 2]
Don't fight
Just ride the rhythm of the tide
We swirl, we spin
Salted, sun-kissed skin
We float together
Whatever weather
Embrace the breeze and sail away smoothly

[Chorus]
So baby, come and take a swim with me
Make me ripple 'til I'm wavy
Don't be scared to dive in deep
And start a tsunami
Tsunami

[Bridge]
Oh, you're waking up an ocean of emotion
That my body can't hide (Can't hide)
Tsunami (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
Now you're soaked in my devotion
'Cause you opened up a paradise (Inside)
Tsunami (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Tsunami

[Chorus]
So baby, come and take a swim with me (Take a swim with me)
Make me ripple 'til I'm wavy (Make me ripple, baby)
Don't be scared to dive in deep (Don't be scared to)
And start a tsunami
Tsunami

[Intro: DJ Khaled, Dionne Warwick & (Beyoncé)]
Is, is (Yeah)

Isn't good enough

[Chorus: Beyoncé & DJ Khaled]
Shinin', shinin', shinin', shinin', yeah (shinin', yeah)
All of this winnin', I've been losin' my mind, yeah (losin' my mind)
Oh, hold on (hold on, baby)
Don't (don't) try to (try to)
Slow me down (down)

Don't (don't) try to (try to)

[Verse 1: Beyoncé]
Oooh, the nana make him act a fool for it
You gon' need an address when I lose the boy (boy)
Ratchet, ratchet, ratchet, you a tool, lil' boy, oh
Mama say I'm trippin', daddy say I'm trippin'
Mouth talkin' dirty but my lips so clean
On my body like a bumper car sticker
Bet it make you smile when you see that bitch pull up (pull up)

[Refrain: Beyoncé]
Money don't make me happy (make me happy)
And
