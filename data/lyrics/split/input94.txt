er, ship of fools

[Outro]
It was later than I thought when I first believed you
Now I cannot share your laughter, ship of fools

[Verse 1]
I left my home in Norfolk, Virginia
California on my mind
Straddled that Greyhound, it rode me past Raleigh
And on across Carolin'
Stopped in Charlotte and bypassed Rock Hill
And we never was a minute late
We was ninety miles out of Atlanta by sundown
Rolling across the Georgia state
We had motor trouble, it turned into a struggle
Halfway across Alabam'
The Hound broke down
Left us all stranded in downtown Birmingham

[Verse 2]
Straight off bought me a through train ticket
Right across Mississippi clean
And I was on that midnight flyer out of Birmingham
Smoking into New Orleans
Somebody help me get out of Louisiana
Just help me get to Houston town
There's people there who care a thing about me
And they won't let the poor boy down
Sure as you're born, they bought me a silk suit
Put luggage in my hands
And I woke up high over Albuquerque
On a jet to the promised land

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Working on a T-bone steak a la carte
Flying over to the Golden State
When the pilot told us in thirteen minutes
We'd be heading in the terminal gate
Swing low sweet chariot, come down easy
Taxi to the terminal zone
Cut your engines, cool your wings
And let me make it to the telephone
Los Angeles, give me Norfolk, Virginia
Tidewater four ten oh nine
Tell the folks back home this is the promised land calling
And the poor boy's on the line

[Instrumental]

[Outro]
Thank you. We're gonna take a short break and we'll be right back

[Verse 1]
Saint Stephen with a rose
In and out of the garden he goes
Country garland in the wind and the rain
Wherever he goes, the people all complain

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Stephen prospered in his time
Well, he may and he may decline
Did it matter? Does it now?
Stephen would answer if he only knew how

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Wishing well with a golden bell
Bucket hanging clear to Hell
Hell halfway 'twixt now and then
Stеphen fill it up and lower down
And lower down again

[Bridge]
Ladyfingеr dipped in moonlight
Writing "What for?" across the morning sky
Sunlight splatters dawn with answers
Darkness shrugs and bids the day goodbye
Speeding arrow, sharp and narrow
What a lot of fleeting matters you have spurned
Several seasons with their treasons
Wrap the babe in scarlet covers, call it your own

[Verse 4]
Did he doubt or did he try?
Answers aplenty in the bye and bye
Talk about your plenty, talk about your ills
One man gathers what another man spills

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
Saint Stephen will remain
All he lost he shall regain
Seashore washed by the suds and foam
Been here so long, he's got to calling it home
Fortune comes a crawlin', calliope woman
Spinnin' that curious sense of your own
Can you answer? Yes, I can
But what would be the answer to the answer man?

[Verse 1]
Right outside this lazy summer home
You ain't got time to call your soul a critic, no
Right outside the lazy gate of winter's summer home
Wondering where the nut-thatch winters
Wings a mile long just carried the bird away

[Chorus]
Wake up to find out that you are the eyes of the world
The heart has its beaches, its homeland and thoughts of its own
Wake now, discover that you are the song that the morning brings
But the heart has its seasons, its evenings and songs of its own

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
There comes a rеdeemer, and he slowly too fades away
Follows his wagon bеhind him that's loaded with clay
The seeds that were silent all burst into bloom, and decay, hey, hey
And night comes so quiet, it's close on the heels of the day

[Chorus]
Wake up to find out that you are the eyes of the world
The heart has its beaches, its homeland and thoughts of its own
Wake now, discover that you are the song that the morning brings
The heart has its seasons, its evenings and songs of its own

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Sometimes we live no particular way but our own
Sometimes we visit your country and live in your home
Sometimes we ride on your horses, sometimes we walk alone
Sometimes the songs that we hear are just songs of our own

[Chorus]
Wake up to find out that you are the eyes of the world
The heart has its beaches, its homeland and thoughts of its own
Wake now, discover that you are the song that the morning brings
The heart has its seasons, its evenings and songs of its own

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Morning comes, she follows the path to the river shore
Lightly sung, her song is the latch on the morning's door
See the sun sparkle in the reeds, silver beads, pass into the sea

[Pre-Chorus]
She comes from the town where they call her the woodcutter's daughter
She's brown as the bank where she kneels down to gather her water
And she bears it away with a love the river has taught her

[Chorus]
Let it flow, let it flow, widе and clear

[Verse 2]
Round and round, the cut of the plow in thе furrowed field
Seasons round, the bushels of corn and the barley meal
Broken ground, open and beckoning to the spring
Black dirt live again

[Pre-Chorus]
The plowman is broad as the back of the land he's sowing
As he dances the circular track of the plow ever knowing
That the work of his days measures more than the planting and growing

[Chorus]
Let it grow, let it grow, greatly yield

[Bridge]
What shall we say, shall we call it by a name?
As well to count the angels dancing on a pin
Water bright as the sky from which it came
And the name is on the earth that takes it in
We will not speak but stand inside the rain
And listen to the thunder shout, "I am! I am! I am! I am!"

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
So it goes, we make what we make since the world began
Nothing more, the love of the women, the work of man
Seasons round, creatures great and small
Up and down as we rise and fall

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
What shall we say, shall we call it by a name?
As well to count the angels dancing on a pin
Water bright as the sky from which it came
And the name is on the earth that takes it in
We will not speak but stand inside the rain
And listen to the thunder shout, "I am! I am! I am! I am!"

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Gone are the days when the ox fall down
Take up the yoke and plow the fields around
Gone are the days when the ladies said "Please
Gentle Jack Jones, won't you come to me"

[Chorus]
Brown-eyed women and red grenadine
The bottle was dusty, but the liquor was clean
Sound of the thunder with the rain pourin' down
And it looks like the old man's gettin' on

[Verse 2]
1920 when he steppеd to the bar
Drank to the dregs of thе whiskey jar
1930 when the wall caved in
He made his way selling red-eyed gin

[Chorus]
Brown-eyed women and red grenadine
The bottle was dusty, but the liquor was clean
Sound of the thunder with the rain pourin' down
And it looks like the old man's gettin' on

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Delilah Jones was the mother of twins
Two times over, and the rest were sins
Raised eight boys, only I turned bad
Didn't get the lickin's that the other ones had

[Chorus]
Brown-eyed women and red grenadine
The bottle was dusty, but the liquor was clean
Sound of the thunder with the rain pourin' down
And it looks like the old man's gettin' on

[Bridge]
Tumble down shack in Big Foot county
Snowed so hard that the roof caved in
Delilah Jones went to meet her God
And the old man never was the same again

[Verse 4]
Daddy made whiskey and he made it well
Cost two dollars though it burned like hell
I cut hickory just to fire the still
Drink down a bottle and be ready to kill

[Chorus]
Brown-eyed women and red grenadine
The bottle was dusty, but the liquor was clean
Sound of the thunder with the rain pourin' down
And it looks like the old man's gettin' on

[Verse 1 repeated]
Gone are the days when the ox fall down
Take up the yoke and plow the fields around
Gone are the days when the ladies said "Please
Gentle Jack Jones, won't you come to me?"

[Outro]
Brown-eyed women and red grenadine
The bottle was dusty, but the liquor was clean
Sound of the thunder with the rain pourin' down
And it looks like the old man's gettin' on
And it looks like the old man's gettin' on

[Verse 1]
Lazy lightning
That sleepy fire in your eyes
Is that desire in disguise?
I keep on trying but I
I can't get through
Lazy lightning
I'd like to find the proper potion
To try to capture your emotion
You're right beside me but I
I can't get through

[Chorus]
You're a loop of lazy lightning
Loop of lazy lighting
Must admit you're kind of frightening
But you really get me high

[Verse 2]
So exciting
When I hear your velvet thunder
You seem so near I start to wonder
Would you come closer if I
If I asked you to
So inviting
The way you're messing with my reason
It's an obsession but it's pleasing
Tell me a lie and I will swear
I'll swear it's true

[Chorus]
You're a loop of lazy lightning
Loop of lazy lightning
Must admit you're kind of frightening
You're a loop of lazy lightning

[Bridge]
Rope of fire round my heart (Lightning)
Rope of fire ever tightening (Tightening)
Rope of fire round my heart (Lightning)
Come on, come on lazy lightning
You're a loop of lazy lightning, hoo

[Outro]
Lazy lightning
The way you always electrify me
Someday I know you'll satisfy me
And all that lightning will be
(My lightning too)
My lightning too
(My lightning too)
(My lightning too)
You're a loop of lazy lightning
(My lightning too)
My lightning too
(My lightning too)
Loop of, loop of crazy lightning
(My lightning too)
My lightning too
(My lightning too)
Come on, come on lazy lightning
(My lightning too)
My lightning too
(My lightning too)
Loop of lazy lightning
(My lightning too)
My lightning too
(My lightning too)
Woo

[Instrumental]

[Verse]
Dizzy ain't the word for the way that you're making me feel now
Well, I need some indication, good Lord, if this is real now
Well, I've heard it said there's something wrong with my head now
Could it be infatuation or am I just being misled now?

[Outro]
Little bolt of inspiration
Way you strike me now
It's sparking my imagination
Got to like me now
Cause me such excitation
Got to strike me now
There ain't no complication
Girl, don't fight me now
Little bolt of inspiration
Got to like me now
It's sparking my imagination
Got to strike me now

[Verse 1]
You told me goodbye, how was I to know
You didn't mean goodbye, you meant please don’t let me go

[Chorus]
I was having a high time, living the good life
Well, you know

[Verse 2]
The wheels are muddy, got a ton of hay
Now listen here, baby, 'cause I mean what I say

[Chorus]
I am having a hard time, living the good life
Well, you know

[Bridge]
I was losing time, I had nothing to do
No one to fight, I came to you
Wheels broke down, the leader won't draw
The line is busted, the last one I saw

[Verse 3]
Tomorrow come trouble, tomorrow come pain
Now don’t think too hard, baby, 'cause you know what I'm saying

[Chorus]
I could show you a high time, living the good life
Well, you know

[Verse 4]
Nothing's for certain, it could always go wrong
Come on in when it's raining, go on out when it's gone

[Chorus]
We could have us a high time, living the good life
Well, you know

[Intro]
If I had my way
I would tear this whole building down

[Verse 1]
Delilah was a woman, she was fine and fair
Yes, she had good looks, God knows, and coal black hair
Delilah she gained old Samson's mind
When first he saw this woman, it would be the last time
Delilah she climbed up on old Samson's knee
Said "Tell me where your strength lies, if you please"
She spoke so kind, God knows, she talked so fair
Samson said, "Delilah you cut off my hair
You can shave my head, clean as my hand
My strength become as natural as any old man"

[Chorus]
If I had my way
If I had my way
If I had my way
I would tear this whole building down

[Verse 2]
You read about Samson, all from his works
He was the strongеst man ever has lived on еarth
One day while Samson was walking along
Looked down on the ground he saw an old jaw bone
He stretched out his arm and his chains broke like threads
And when he got to move, ten thousand was dead

[Chorus]
If I had my way
If I had my way
If I had my way
I would tear this whole building down

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Samson and the lion, they got in attack
Samson he crawled up on the lion's back
You read about this lion, he killed a man with his paws
Samson got his hands up around the lion's jaws
And he ripped that beast, God knows, he killed him dead
And the bees made honey in the lion's head

[Chorus]
If I had my way
If I had my way
If I had my way
I would tear this whole building down

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
If I had my way
If I had my way
If I had my way
I would tear this whole building down
If I had my way
If I had my way
If I had my way
I would tear this whole building down
I would tear this whole building down

[Outro]
If I had my way
If I had my way
If I had my way
I would tear this whole building down

[Verse 1]
Annie laid her head down in the roses
She had ribbons, ribbons, ribbons in her long brown hair
I don't know, maybe it was the roses
All I know, I couldn't leave her there

[Chorus]
I don't know, it must have been the roses
The roses or the ribbons in her long brown hair
I don't know, maybe it was the roses
All I know, I couldn't leave her there

[Verse 2]
Ten years the waves rolled the ships home from the sea
Thinking well how it may blow in all good company
If I tell another what your own lips told to me
Let me lay 'neath the roses, let my eyes no longer see

[Chorus]
I don't know, it must have been the roses
The roses or the ribbons in her long brown hair
I don't know, maybe it was the roses
All I know, I could not leave her there

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
One pane of glass in the window
No one is complaining though
Come in and shut the door
Faded is the crimson from the ribbons that she wore
And it's strange how no one comes 'round anymore

[Chorus]
I don't know, it must have been the roses
The roses or the ribbons in her long brown hair
I don't know, maybe it was the roses
All I know, I could not leave her there

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
I don't know, it must have been the roses
The roses or the ribbons in her long brown hair
I don't know, maybe it was the roses
All I know, I couldn't leave her there

[Verse 1]
Old man down
Way down down, down by the docks of the city
Blind and dirty
Asked me for a dime, a dime for a cup of coffee
I got no dime but I got some time to hear his story

[Verse 2]
My name is August West, and I love my Pearly Baker best, more than my wine
More than my wine
More than my maker, though he's no friend of mine
Everyone said
I’d come to no good, I knew I would, Pearly, believe them
Half of my life
I spent doing time for some other fucker's crime
The other half found me stumbling around drunk on burgundy wine

[Bridge]
But I'll get back on my feet someday
The good Lord willing, if he says I may
I know that the life I’m living's no good
I'll get a new start, live the life I should

[Refrain]
I'll get up and fly away
I'll get up and fly away, fly away

[Verse 3]
"Pearly's been true
True to me, true to my dying day," he said
I said to him
I said to him, "I'm sure she's been"
I said to him, "I’m sure she’s been true to you"

[Verse 4]
Got up and wandered
I wandered downtown, nowhere to go but just to hang around
I've got a girl
Named Bonnie Lee, I know that girl’s been true to me
I know she's been, I'm sure she's been true to me

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
Well, the joint was jumping, going around and around
Hey, hey, reeling and a-rocking, what a crazy sound
And no, they never stopped rocking 'til the moon went down

[Verse 1]
Well, it sounds so sweet now, I had my chance
I rose out of my seat now, 'cause I had to dance
I started moving my feet now, oh yes, and clapping my hands

[Chorus]
You know they never stopped rocking, going around and around
Hey, reeling and a-rocking, what a crazy sound
You know they never stopped rocking 'til the moon went down
'Til the moon went down

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Well, at twelve o'clock now, although the place was packed
The front doors was locked now, I said the place was packed
But whеn the police knocked, wеll, them old doors flew back
They flew back

[Chorus]
You know they kept on rocking, going around and around
Yeah, reeling and rocking, what a crazy sound
You know they never stopped rocking 'til the moon went down
'Til the moon went down

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Oh, it sounded so sweet now, I had to take a chance
I rose out of my seat now, 'cause I had to dance
I started moving my feet, oh yes, and clapping my hands

[Chorus]
You know they never stopped rocking, going around and around
Hey, reeling and a-rocking, what a crazy sound
You know they never stopped rocking 'til the moon went down

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
They never stopped rocking, going around and around
Oh, reeling and rocking, what a crazy sound
You know they never stopped rocking 'til the moon went down
You know they never stopped rocking, going around and around
Oh, reeling and rocking, what a crazy sound
No, they never stopped rocking 'til the moon went down
Thank you

[Verse 1]
In another time's forgotten space
Your eyes looked through your mother's face
Wildflower seed in the sand and stone
May the four winds blow you safely home

[Chorus]
Roll away the dew
Roll away the dew
Roll away the dew
Roll away the dew

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Tell you where the four winds dwell
In Franklin's tower there hangs a bell
It can ring, turn night to day
Can ring like fire if you lose your way

[Chorus]
Roll away the dew
Roll away the dew
Roll away the dew
(You bettеr) Roll away the dew

[Verse 3]
God save thе child who rings that bell
Might have one good ring, baby, you can't tell
One watch by night, one watch by day
If you get confused, listen to the music play

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 4]
Some come to laugh their past away
Some come to make it just one more day
Whichever way your pleasure tends
If you plant ice you're gonna harvest wind

[Chorus]
Roll away the dew
Roll away the dew
Roll away the dew
Roll away the dew

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 5]
I'll tell you where the four winds sleep
Like four lean hounds the lighthouse keep
Wildflower seed in the sand and wind
May the four winds blow you home again

[Chorus]
Roll away the dew
Roll away the dew
Roll away the dew
Roll away the dew
(You better) Roll away the dew (Roll away)
(You better) Roll away the dew
Roll away the dew (Roll away) (You better roll away)
Roll away the dew
Roll away the dew
Roll away, roll away
Roll away the dew (Roll away)
Roll away the dew

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
Roll away the dew
Roll away the dew
You better roll away the dew
I want you to roll away, roll away the dew
Roll away the dew
Roll away the dew
Roll away the dew
Roll away the dew
Thank you, see y'all later on

[Verse 1]
I turn and walk away then I come 'round again
It looks as though tomorrow I'll do pretty much the same
I must turn down your offer, but I'd like to ask a break
You know I'm ready to give everything for anything I take
Someone called my name, you know I turned around to see
It was midnight in the Mission and the bells were not for me

[Chorus]
Come again, walking along in the Mission in the rain
Come again, walking along in the Mission in the rain

[Verse 2]
Ten years ago, I walked this street, my dreams were riding tall
Tonight I would be thankful, Lord, for any dream at all
Some folks would be happy just to have one drеam come true
But evеrything you gather is just more that you can lose

[Chorus]
Come again, walking along in the Mission in the rain
Come again, walking along in the Mission in the rain

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
All the things I planned to do I only did halfway
Tomorrow will be Sunday born of rainy Saturday
There's some satisfaction in the San Francisco rain
No matter what comes down, the Mission always looks the same

[Outro]
Come again, walking along in the Mission in the rain
Come again, walking along in the Mission in the rain
Come again, walking along in the Mission in the rain
Come again, walking along in the Mission in the rain
Come again

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
The wheel is turning and you can't slow down
You can't let go and you can't hold on
You can't go back and you can't stand still
If the thunder don't get you then the lightning will

[Refrain]
Won't you try just a little bit harder
Couldn't you try just a little bit more?
Won't you try just a little bit harder
Couldn't you try just a little bit more?

[Verse 1]
Round, round robin run around
Gotta get back to where you belong
Little bit harder, just a little bit more
A little bit further than you gone before

[Chorus]
The wheel is turning and you can't slow down
You can't let go and you can't hold on
You can't go back and you can't stand still
If the thunder don't get you then the lightning will

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Small wheel turn by the fire and rod
Big wheel turn by the grace of God
Every time that wheel turn around
Bound to cover just a littlе more ground
Bound to cover just a little morе ground

[Chorus]
The wheel is turning and you can't slow down
You can't let go and you can't hold on
You can't go back and you can't stand still
If the thunder don't get you then the lightning will

[Outro]
Won't you try just a little bit harder
Couldn't you try just a little bit more?
Won't you try just a little bit harder
Couldn't you try just a little bit more?

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
Comes a time when the blind man takes your hand, says "Don't you see?
Gotta make it somehow on the dreams you still believe."
Don't give it up, you got an empty cup only love can fill
Only love can fill

[Verse 1]
Walking all morning, been walking all night
I can't see much difference between the dark and light
And I feel the wind, and I taste the rain
Never in my mind to cause so much pain

[Chorus]
Comes a time when the blind man takes your hand, says "Don't you see?
Gotta make it somehow on the dreams you still believe."
Don't give it up, you got an empty cup only love can fill
Only love can fill

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Day to day just letting it ride
You get so far away from how it feels inside
You can't let go 'cause you're afraid to fall
But the day may come when you can't feel at all

[Chorus]
Comes a time when the blind man takes your hand, says "Don't you see?
Gotta make it somehow on the dreams you still believe."
Don't give it up, you got an empty cup only love can fill
Only love can fill

[Outro]
Only love can fill
Only love can fill

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Sugar magnolia, blossoms blooming
Heads all empty, and I don't care
Saw my baby down by the river
I knew she'd have to come up soon for air

Sweet blossom come on, under the willow
We can have high times if you'll abide
We can discover the wonders of nature
Rolling in the rushes down by the riverside

[Chorus]
She's got everything delightful
She's got everything I need
Takes the wheel when I'm seeing double
Pays my ticket when I speed

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
She comes skimmin' through rays of violet
Shе can wade in a drop of dew
She don't comе, and I don't follow
Waits backstage while I sing to you
She can dance a Cajun rhythm
And jump like a Willys in four-wheel drive
She's my summer love in the spring, fall, and winter
She can make happy any man alive

Sugar magnolia, oh, ringing that bluebell
All caught up in sunlight
Now, come on out singing, I'll walk you in the sunshine
Ooh, come on, honey, come along with me

[Chorus]
She's got everything delightful
She's got everything I need
A breeze in the pines and the sun and bright moonlight
Lazing in the sunshine? Yes, indeed

[Verse 3]
Sometimes when the cuckoo's crying
When the moon is halfway down
Sometimes when the night is dying
I take me out and I wander around
Walk around

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Red and white, blue suede shoes
I'm Uncle Sam, how do you do?
Give me five, I'm still alive
It ain't no luck, I learned to duck
Check my pulse, it don't change
Stay seventy-two come shine or rain
Wave the flag, pop the bag
Rock the boat, skin the goat

[Chorus]
Wave that flag, wave it wide and high
Summertime done, come and gone, my, oh, my

[Verse 2]
I'm Uncle Sam, that's who I am
Been hiding out in a rock and roll band
Shake the hand that shook the hand
Of P.T. Barnum, oh, and Charlie Chan
Light your fuse, shine your shoes
Can you use thеm old U.S. Blues
Drink your health, share your wеalth
Run your life, steal your wife

[Chorus]
Wave that flag, wave it wide and high
Summertime done, come and gone, my, oh, my

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Back to back, chicken shack
Son of a gun, better change your act
We're all confused, what's to lose?
You can call this song the United States Blues

[Chorus]
Wave that flag, wave it wide and high
Summertime done, come and gone, my, oh, my

[Outro]
Summertime done, come and gone, my, oh, my
(My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, oh, my, my, oh, my)
Summertime done, come and gone, my, oh, my

Sunshine daydream, walk you in the tall trees

Blooming, blooming like a red rose
Now come on over sweetly
Ride out singing, I'll walk you in the morning sunshine
Sunshine daydream, sunshine daydream
Come on, come on over, daydream
Sunshine daydream
Well, coming, coming from a sweet dream

[Chorus: Ant Clemons]
Seasons changing, summer starts to leave
Autumn falls on me, fall, winter, and spring
80 degrees, warmin' up for me
I fell deep, sun ain't have to leave
Open my eyes and see
We will float over water, leaning into shore
As we make our nirvana, sacred, so pure
Lift up the child, I know we will

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
I chose not to be a slave
Dropped the Wave Runners, now we run the wave
Like we ain't have all the hood rats and mud rats
Like you ain't had 'em, good stats and all that
Nobody gon' ruin mе
I just called my wife up, let's gеt Hoover free
I put all my ice up and my Louis V
I just copped my momma crib, I'm back over East
Let me get your ear like Holyfield
From the home of Soldier Field
Coming home, that's how a soldier feels
All that killing over, that's just overkill
Yeezy back in the Chi, this that Oprah field

[Chorus: Ant Clemons]
Seasons changing, summer starts to leave
Autumn falls on me, fall, winter, and spring
80 degrees, warmin' up for me
I fell deep, sun ain't have to leave
Open my eyes and see
We will float over water, leaning into shore
As we make our nirvana, sacred, so pure
Lift up the child, I know we will

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Woah, woah, yeah, yeah
Look, bottom line, I'm seeing through the mask of the fakes
Like we're at the Comic Con, I point 'em out from time to time
Speaking of time, me and my mom been gettin' closer
Either I took her for granted or didn't know her
Or is it, I'm getting older?
Or is it, Lucas finally turning into Yoda?
Only new beginnings, no such thing as over
We should have just stayed friends
That never opened up or needed closure (God)
Give me directions like Noah
I don't know some hopeless romantic shit
But I can't wait to see Ye get back with HOVA
Look bitch, this the new chain of command (Bitch)
Might bring the Pow chains back like me and Ye in Japan
Cudi back at it again, Push, yeah that's 'till the end, yeah
Just like it should have been
Nothing but that G.O.O.D. and the G around us
I knocked don the walls and my head free my mind up (Woah)
I didn't chase the game, ho, I helped redesign it, yeah
Goin' against us, you need logic, Muhammad
I'm so fuckin' conscious, that shit is my compass, yeah, yeah
Don

[Chorus: Ant Clemons]
Seasons changing, summer starts to leave
Autumn falls on me, fall, winter, and spring
80 degrees, warmin' up for me
I fell deep, sun ain't have to leave
Open my eyes and see
We will float over water, leaning into shore
As we make our nirvana, sacred, so pure
Lift up the child, I know we will

[Verse 3: Kanye West]

[Intro]
Thank you very much, we'll be right back

[Verse 1]
On the day when I was born, Daddy sat down and cried
I had the mark just as plain as day that could not be denied
They say that Cain caught Abel rolling loaded dice
Ace of Spades behind his ear and him not thinking twice

[Chorus]
Half-step, Mississippi uptown toodeloo
Hello, baby, I’m gone, goodbye
Half a cup of rock and rye
Farewell to you old Southern skies
I'm on my way, on my way

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
If all you got to live for is what you left behind
Get yourself a powder charge and seal that silver mine
Lost my boots in transit, baby, pile of smoking leather
I nailеd a retread to my feet and prayed for bеtter weather

[Chorus]
Half-step, Mississippi uptown toodeloo
Hello, baby, I'm gone, goodbye
Half a cup of rock and rye
Farewell to you old Southern skies
I’m on my way, on my way

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
When your big old ship comes in, the first man takes the sails
Second takes the afterdeck, the third, the planks and rails
What's the point of calling shots
This cue ain't straight in line
Cue balls made of Styrofoam and no one's got the time

[Chorus]
Half-step, Mississippi uptown toodeloo
Hello, baby, I'm gone, goodbye
Half a cup of rock and rye
Farewell to you old Southern skies
I'm on my way, on my way, on my way

[Instrumental Break]

Across the Rio Grande-o
Across the lazy river
Across the Rio Grande-o

Across the lazy river
Across the Rio Grande-o
Across the lazy river

[Verse 1: The Grateful Dead]
We can share the women, we can share the wine
We can share what we got of yours 'cause we done shared all of mine
Keep on rollin', just a mile to go
Keep on rollin' my old buddy, you're movin' much too slow

[Verse 2: Jerry Garcia, Bob Weir]
I just jumped the watchman, right outside the fence
Took his rings, four bucks in change, ain't that Heaven sent?
Hurts my ears to listen, and it burns my eyes to see
Cut down a man in cold blood, Shannon, it might as well've been me

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3: Bob Weir]
We used to play for silver, now we play for life
One's for sport and one's for blood at thе point of a knife
Now the die is shakеn, now the die must fall
Ain't no winner in the game, he don't go home with all
Not with all

[Verse 4: The Grateful Dead]
Leavin' Texas, fourth day of July
Sun so hot, the clouds so low, the eagles filled the sky
Catch the Detroit Lightning out of Santa Fe
The Great Northern out of Cheyenne, from sea to shining sea

[Verse 5: Jerry Garcia, Bob Weir]
Gotta go to Tulsa, first train we can ride
Gotta settle one old score, one small point of pride
Ain't a place a man can hide, Shannon, will keep him from the sun
Ain't a bed can give us rest now, you keep us on the run, run

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 6: The Grateful Dead]
Jack Straw from Wichita
Cut his buddy down
Dug for him a shallow grave
And laid his body down
Half a mile from Tucson
By the morning light
One man gone and another to go
My old buddy, you're moving much too slow

[Outro: The Grateful Dead]
We can share the women, we can share the wine

[Verse 1]
To lay me down, once more
To lay me down
With my head in sparkling clover
Let the world go by, all lost in dreaming
To lay me down, one last time, to lay me down

[Chorus]
To lay me down, oh oh, to lay me down
To lay me down, one last time, to lay me down

[Verse 2]
To be with you, once more, to be with you
With our bodies close together
Let the world go by, like the clouds a-streaming
To lay me down, one last time, to lay me down

[Chorus]
To lay me down, oh oh, to lay me down
To lay me down, one last time, to lay me down

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
To liе with you, once more, to lie with you
With our drеams entwined together
To wake beside you, my love still sleeping
To tell sweet lies, one last time, and say goodbye

[Chorus]
To lay me down, whoa-oh, to lay me down
To lay me down, one last time, to lay me down

[Outro]
To lay me down, one last time
To lay me down
To lay me down, one last time
To lay me down, one last time

[Verse 1]
You walk into the room
With your pencil in your hand
You see somebody naked
And you say, "Who is that man?"
You try so very hard
But you don't understand
Just what you'll say
When you get home

[Chorus]
When you something is happening
And don't know what it is
Do you, Mister Jones?

[Verse 2]
You raise up your head
And you ask, "Is this where it is?"
And somebody points to you and they say
"It's his"
And you say, "What's mine?"
And then somebody else says, "Well, what is?"
And you say, "Oh my God
Am I here all alone?"

[Chorus]
You know something is happening
But you don't know what it is
Do you, Mister Jones?

[Verse 3]
You pay for your ticket
And you go watch the geek
Who immediately walks up to you
When he, when he hears you spеak
He asks you how it feels
To be such a freak
And you say, "Impossiblе"
As he hands you a bone

[Chorus]
And you know something is happening
But you don't know what it is
Do you, Mister Jones?

[Bridge]
You have many contacts
Among the lumberjacks
Who keep you supplied with facts
When someone attacks your imagination
Anyway they already expect
You to give a check
To a tax-deductible charity organization

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 4]
You've been with the professors
And they, they all liked your looks
With great lawyers you've discussed
Lepers and crooks
You've been through all of F. Scott Fitzgerald's books
You're very well read
It's well known

[Chorus]
And you know something is happening
But you don't know what it is
Do you, Mister Jones?

[Verse 5]
The sword swallower comes up to you and
And then he kneels
He crosses himself
And then he clicks his high heels
Without further notice
He asks you how it feels
And he says, "Here's your throat back
Thanks for the loan"

[Chorus]
And you know something is happening
And you don't know what it is
Do you, Mister Jones?

[Verse 6]
You see this one-eyed midget
And he's shouting the word "NOW"
You say, "What's the matter?"
And he says, "How?"
And you say, "What does this mean?"
And he screams back, "You're a cow
Give me some milk
Or else go home"

[Chorus]
And you know something is happening
But you don't know what it is
Do you, Mister Jones?

[Verse 7]
You walk into the room
Like a camel and then you frown
Your eyes in your pockets
And your head on the ground
There oughta be a law
Against you comin' around
You should be made
To wear earphones

[Outro]
And you know something is happening
And you don't know what it is
Do you, Mister Jones?

[Verse 1]
Shaking in the forest, what have you to fear?
Here there may be tigers to punch you in the ear
With gloves of stainless steel, bats carved out of bricks
Knock you down and beat you up and give your ass a kick
When push comes to shove, you're afraid of love
Shaking in the desert, wherefore do you cry?
Here there may be rattlesnakes to punch you in the eye
With shotguns full of silver and bullets made of glass
String barbed wire at your feet, that will not let you pass
When push comes to shove, you're afraid of love

[Chorus]
When push comes to shove, when push comes to shove
You're afraid of love, when push comes to shove

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Shaking in the bedroom, covers on your head
Are you still in fear of the hand beneath the bed?
Grabbing at the handle, scratching at the door
Maybe it's mystery killer you saw on Channel Four
When push comes to shove, you're afraid of love
Shaking in the garden, the fear within you grows
Here there may be roses to punch you in the nose
Snap my arms around you, snap you until you cry
Wrap you in the sweet perfume and love you 'til you die
When push comes to shove, you're afraid of love

[Chorus]
When push comes to shove, when push comes to shove
You're afraid of love, when push comes to shove
When push comes to shove, when push comes to shove
You're afraid of love, when push comes to shove

[Chorus]
I was born in a desert, I was raised in a lion's den
Born in a desert, I was raised in a lion's den
Well, my number one occupation
Is stealing womens from their other men

[Verse 1]
Well, I'm a wanted man in Texas, busted jail and I'm gone for good
Wanted man in Texas, busted jail and I'm gone for good
Sheriff couldn't catch me
But his little girl sure wished she would
Sure she would

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Doctor call me crazy, some says I am, some says I ain't
Doctor call me crazy, some says I am, some says I ain't
Preacher man call me a sinner, but his little girl call me a saint

[Verse 3]
Couple shots of whiskey, women 'round here start looking
Couple shots of whiskey, those Jersey fillies start looking
Couple more shots of whiskey, I'm going down to Minglewood
Minglewood

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 4]
Well, it's T for Texas, yeah, and it's T for Timbuktu
T for Texas, yes, and it's T for Timbuktu
It's T right here in Jersey, where little girls know what to do
What to do

[Outro]
I was born in a desert, I was raised in a lion's den
Born in a desert, I was raised in a lion's den
Well, my number one occupation
Is stealing womens from their other men
Can I do it, do it again?
Well, my number one occupation
Is stealing womens from their other men

[Verse 1]
I can't stay much longer, Melinda, the sun is getting high
I can't help you with your troubles, if you won't help with mine
I gotta get down, I gotta get down, I gotta get down to, to the mine

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
You keep me up just one more night, I can't sleep here no more
Little Ben clock says quarter to eight; you kept me up 'til four
I gotta get down, I gotta get down, or I can't work there no more

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
A lot of poor man make a five dollar bill, keep him happy all the time
Some other fella's making nothing at all, and you can hear him cry
"Can I go, buddy, can I go down take your shift at the mine?"

[Chorus]
Gotta get down to thе Cumberland mine
Gotta get down to thе Cumberland mine
That's where I mainly spend my time
Make good money, five dollars a day
Made anymore, I might move away

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
Lotta poor man got the Cumberland blues, he can't win for losing
Lotta poor man got to walk the line just to pay his union dues
I don't know now, I just don't know if I'm going back again
I don't know now, I just don't know if I'm going back again
I don't know now, I just don't know if I'm going back again

[Verse 1]
Since it cost a lot to win
And even more to lose
You and me bound to spend some time
Wondering what to choose

[Pre-Chorus]
It goes to show you don't ever know
Watch each card you play
And play it slow

[Chorus]
Wait until that deal come round
Don't you let that deal go down, oh no

[Verse 2]
I been gambling hereabouts
For ten good solid years
If I told you about all that went down
It would burn off both your little ears

[Pre-Chorus]
It goes to show you don't ever know
Watch each card you play
And play it slow

[Chorus]
Wait until that deal come round
Don't you let that deal go down, oh no

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Since you poured the wine for me
Tightened up my shoes
I hate to leave you sitting there
Composing lonesome blues

[Pre-Chorus]
It goes to show that you don't ever know
Watch each card you play
And play it slow

[Chorus]
Wait until that deal come round
Don't you let that deal go down, oh no

[Verse 1 repeated]
Since it cost a lot to win
And even more to lose
You and me bound to spend some time
Just wondering what to choose

[Pre-Chorus]
It goes to show you don't ever know
Watch each card you play
And play it slow

[Chorus]
Wait until that deal come round
Don't you let that deal go down
Wait until that deal come round
Don't you let that deal go down
Wait until that deal come round
Don't you let that deal go down
Wait until that deal come round
Don't you let that deal go down

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
Wait until that deal come round
Don't you let that deal go down
Wait until that deal come round
Don't you let that deal go down
Wait until that deal come round
Don't you let that deal go down
Wait until that deal come round
Don't you let that deal go down, oh no
Back in just ever so little bit

[Verse 1]
Oh, the streets of Rome are filled with rubble
Ancient footprints are everywhere
You can almost think that you're seein' double
On a cold dark night on the Spanish Stairs

[Chorus]
Gotta hurry on back to my hotel room
Where I've got me a date with Botticelli's niece
She promised that she'd be there with me
When I paint my masterpiece

[Verse 2]
Oh, the hours I've spent inside the Colosseum
Dodging lions and wastin' time
Oh, those mighty kings of the jungle
I could hardly stand to see 'em
Well, it sure has been a long hard climb

[Chorus]
Train wheels rollin' through the back of my memory
When I ran on the hilltop following a pack of wild geese
Someday, life will be sweet like a rhapsody
When I paint my masterpiece

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
I left Rome, landed in Brussels
On a flight so bumpy that I almost cried
Clergymen in uniform, young girls pullin' muscles
They cheered, happy when I got right

[Chorus]
Newspapermen eating candy
Had to be held down by big police
Someday, everything gonna be different
When I paint my masterpiece

[Outro]
Someday, everything gonna be different
When I paint my masterpiece
When I paint my masterpiece

[Verse 1]
Morning comes, she follows the path to the river shore
Lightly sung, her song is the latch on the morning's door
See the sun sparkle in the reeds, silver beads, pass into the sea

[Pre-Chorus]
She comes from the town where they call her the woodcutter's daughter
She's brown as the bank where she kneels down to gather her water
And she bears it away with a love the river has taught her

[Chorus]
Let it flow, let it flow, wide and clear

[Verse 2]
Round and round, the cut of the plow in the furrowed field
Seasons round, the bushels of corn and the barley meal
Broken ground, open and beckoning to the spring
Black dirt live again

[Pre-Chorus]
The plowman is broad as the back of the land he's sowing
As he dances the circular track of the plow ever knowing
That the work of his days measures more than the planting and growing

[Chorus]
Let it grow, let it grow, greatly yield

[Bridge]
What shall we say, shall we call it by a name?
As well to count the angels dancing on a pin
Water bright as the sky from which it came
And the name is on the earth that takes it in
We will not speak but stand inside the rain
And listen to the thunder shout, "I am! I am! I am! I am!"

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
So it goes, we make what we make since the world began
Nothing more, the love of the women, the work of man
Seasons round, creatures great and small
Up and down as we rise and fall, rise and fall

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
What shall we say, shall we call it by a name?
As well to count the angels dancing on a pin
Water bright as the sky from which it came
And the name is on the earth that takes it in
We will not speak but stand inside the rain
And listen to the thunder shout, "I am! I am! I am! I am!"

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Fare you well, my honey
Fare you well, my only true one
All the birds that were singing
Have flown except you alone

I'm gonna leave this brokedown palace
On my hands and my knees, I will roll, roll, roll
Make myself a bed by the waterside
In my time - in my time - I will roll, roll roll

[Chorus]
In a bed, in a bed
By the waterside I will lay my head
Listen to the river sing sweet songs
To rock my soul

[Verse 2]
River gonna sing me
Sing me sweet and sleepy
Sing me sweet and sleepy
All the way back home
It's a far-gone lullaby
Sung many yеars ago
Mama, Mama, many worlds I've come
Since I first lеft home

[Chorus]
Going home, going home, by the riverside I will rest my bones
Listen to the river sing sweet songs, to rock my soul

[Verse 3]
I'm gonna plant a weeping willow
By the bank's green edge it will grow, grow, grow
Sing a lullaby beside the water
Lovers come and go - the river roll, roll, roll

[Chorus]
Fare you well, fare you well, I love you more than words can tell
Listen to the river sing sweet songs, to rock my soul

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Fare you well, fare you well, I love you more than words can tell
Listen to the river sing sweet songs, to rock my soul
I'm gonna listen to the river sing sweet songs, to rock my soul

[Verse 1]
As I was walking 'round Grosvenor Square
Not a chill to the winter but a nip to the air
From the other direction she was calling my eye
It could be an illusion but I might as well try
Might as well try

[Verse 2]
She had rings on her fingers and bells on her shoes
Knew without asking she was into the blues
She wore scarlet begonias tucked into her curls
I knew right away she was not like other girls
Other girls

[Verse 3]
In the heat of the evening when the dealing got rough
She was too pat to open and too cool to bluff
I picked up my matches and was closing the door
I had one of those flashes I'd been there before
Been there before

[Bridge]
I ain't often right but I've never been wrong
It seldom turns out the way it does in the song
Once in a while you get shown the light
In the strangest of places if you look at it right

[Verse 4]
Ain't nothing wrong with the way she moves
Or scarlet begonias or a touch of the blues
There's nothing wrong with the look that's in her eye
I had to learn the hard way to let her pass by
Let her pass by

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 5]
The wind in the willows played tea for two
The sky was yellow and the sun was blue
Strangers stopping strangers just to shake their hand
Everybody is playing in the Heart of Gold Band
Heart of Gold Band

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Long distance runner, what you standin' there for?
Caught in slow motion in a fall to the floor
Flame from your stage spread to the floor
Drowned in your laughter and dead to the core
There's a dragon with matches that's loose on the town
Takes a whole pail of water just to cool him down
Well

[Chorus]
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Almost ablaze but you don't feel the heat
It takes all you got just to stay on the beat
You say it's a living, we all gotta еat
You're here alonе, there's no one to compete
If mercy's in business, I give it for you
More than just ashes when your dreams come true
Whoa

[Chorus]
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire, fire! Fire on the mountain!

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Long distance runner, what you holding out for?
Go slow motion in a fall to the floor
The flame from your stage has spread to the door
You gave all you had, why you wanna give more?
The more that you give, the more it will take
To the thin line beyond which you really can't fake

[Chorus]
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! (Fire) Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! (Fire) Fire on the mountain!

[Verse 1]
Delilah was a woman, she was fine and fair
Ooh, she had good looks, God knows, and coal black hair
Delilah she gained old Samson's mind
When first he saw this woman, she looked so fine
Delilah she climbed up on old Samson's knee
Said "Tell me where your strength lies, if you please"
She spoke so kind, God knows, talked so fair
Samson said, "Delilah you cut off my hair
You can shave my head, clean as my hand
My strength become as natural as any old man"

[Chorus]
If I had my way
If I had my way
If I had my way
I would tear this whole building down

[Verse 2]
You read about Samson, all from his birth
He was the strongest man ever has lived on еarth
One day while Samson was walking along
Looked down on thе ground he saw an old jaw bone
Then he stretched out his arm and his chains broke like thread
And when he got to move, ten thousand was dead

[Chorus]
If I had my way
If I had my way
If I had my way
I would tear this whole building down
That's right

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Well, Samson and the lion, they got in attack
Samson he crawled up on the lion's back
You read about this lion, he killed a man with his paws
Samson got his hands up around the lion's jaws
He ripped that beast, God knows, killed him dead
And the bees made honey in the lion's head

[Chorus]
If I had my way
If I had my way
If I had my way
I would tear this whole building down
Great God Almighty, talk to me

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
If I had my way
If I had my way
If I had my way
I would tear this whole building down
If I had my way
If I had my way
If I had my way
I would tear this whole building down
I would tear this whole building down

[Outro]
If I had my way
If I had my way
If I had my way
I would tear this whole building down
That's right

[Lady with a Fan]

[Verse 1]
Let my inspiration flow
In token rhyme suggesting rhythm
That will not forsake me
'Til my tale is told and done

While the firelight's aglow
Strange shadows from the flames will grow
'Til things we've never seen
Will seem familiar

Shadows of a sailor forming
Winds both foul and fair all swarm
Down in Carlisle, he loved a lady
Many years ago

Here beside him stands a man
A soldier from the looks of him
Who came through many fights
But lost at love
While the storyteller speaks
A door within the fire creaks
Suddenly flies open
And a girl is standing there

Eyes alight with glowing hair
All that fancy paints as fair
She takes her fan and throws it
In the lion's den

"Which of you to gain me, tell
Will risk uncertain pains of hell?
I will not forgive you
If you will not take the chance"

The sailor gave at least a try
The soldier being much too wise
Strategy was his strength
Not disaster

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
The sailor coming out again
The lady fairly leapt at him
That's how it stands today
You decide if he was wise
The storyteller makes no choice
Soon you will not hear his voice
His job is to shed light
Not to master

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
Since the end is never told
We pay the teller off in gold
In hopes he will come back
But he cannot be bought or sold

[Terrapin Station]

[Verse 1]
Inspiration move me brightly
Light the song with sense and color
Hold away despair
More than this I will not ask
Faced with mysteries dark and vast
Statements just seem vain at last
Some rise, some fall, some climb
To get to Terrapin

[Bridge]
Counting stars by candlelight
All are dim but one is bright:
The spiral light of Venus
Rising first and shining best
Oh, from the northwest corner
Of a brand-new crescent moon
Crickets and cicadas sing
A rare and different tune

[Outro]
Terrapin Station
In the shadow of the moon
Terrapin Station
And I know we'll be there soon
Terrapin - I can't figure out
Terrapin - If it's the end or beginning
Terrapin - But the train's put its brakes on
Terrapin - And the whistle is screaming: Terrapin

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Must be some way out of here
Cried the joker to the thief
There's too much confusion here
I can't get no relief
Wait a minute, wait a minute
Businessmen, they drink my wine
Plow men dig my earth
None will level on the line
Nobody of it is worth

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
No reason to get excited
The thief he kindly spoke
There are many here among us
Who feel that life is but a joke
But you and I we've been through a lot
This is not our fate
Let us not talk falsely now
The hour's getting late

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
All along the watchtower
Princes kept the view
Barefoot servants came and went
Little children too
Outside in the distance
A wild cat did growl
Two riders were approaching
And the wind began to howl

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad, bad, bad
I don't want to be treated this a-way

[Verse 1]
Going where the water tastes like wine
Going where the water tastes like wine
Going where the water tastes like wine, yes, I am
I don't want to be treated this a-way

[Chorus]
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad, bad, bad
I don't want to be treated this a-way

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Going where the climate suits my clothes
Going whеre the climate suits my clothеs
Going where the climate suits my clothes, yes, I am
I don't want to be treated this a-way

[Chorus]
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad, bad, bad
I don't want to be treated this a-way

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad, bad, bad, bad, bad
I don't want to be treated this a-way
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad, bad, bad, bad, bad
I don't want to be treated this a-way
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad, bad, bad
I don't want to be treated this a-way
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad, bad, bad
I don't want to be treated this a-way

[Verse 1]
I need a woman about twice my age
A lady of gentility, nobility and rage
Splendor in the dark, lightning on the draw
We'll go right through the book and break each and every law

[Chorus]
Every day, believe what you do, yeah
Just one thing I got to say
I need a miracle every day

[Verse 2]
I need a woman about twice my height
Statuesque, raven-dressed, a goddess of the night
Her secret incantations, a candle burning blue
Raise up the spirits in a midnight rendezvous

[Chorus]
'Cause it's real, believe me when I say
Think you can run, and I can't run away
I need a miracle every day

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
I need a woman about twice my weight
A ton of fun who packs a gun with all her other freight
Find her in a sideshow, leave her in L.A
Ride her like a surfer riding on a tidal wave

[Chorus]
'Cause it's real, woo, hey, hey
One more thing I just got to say
I need a miracle every day
It takes dynamite to get me up
Too much of everything is just enough
One more thing that I just got to say
(I need a miracle every day)

[Outro]
I need a miracle every day (Every day)
I need a miracle every day (Must have a miracle)
I need a miracle every day (Some kind of miracle)
I need a miracle (A miracle), I need a miracle (Some kind of miracle)
I need a miracle every day (Must have a miracle)
I need a miracle every day (Some kind of miracle)
I need a miracle every day (Yeah, yeah, some kind of miracle)
I need a miracle, I need a miracle (Yeah)

[Verse 1]
Dear Mr. Fantasy, play us a tune
Something to make us all happy
Do anything to take us out of this gloom
Sing a song, play guitar, make it snappy
You are the one who makes us all glad
But doing that, you break, you break down in tears
Please don't be sad if it was a straight life you had
We wouldn't have known you all these years

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Dear Mr. Fantasy, play us a tune
Something to keep us all happy
Do anything to take us out of this gloom
Sing a song, play guitar, make it snappy
You are the one who cab ==n makes us all laugh
But doing that, you break down in tears
Please don't be sad if it was a straight life you had
We wouldn't have known you all these years

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Come take this badge off of me
I won't wear it anymore
It's getting dark to see
I feel like I'm knockin' on heaven's door

[Chorus]
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door

Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door
Just like so many times before

[Verse 1]
Look for a while at the china cat sunflower
Proud walking jingle in the midnight sun
Copperdome bodhi drip a silver kimono
Like a crazy quilt stargown through a dream night wind

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Krazy Kat peeking through a lace bandanna
Like a one-eyed cheshire, like a diamond-eye jack
A leaf of all colors plays a golden-string fiddle
To a double-e waterfall over my back

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Comic book colors on a violin river crying a lot of
Words from out a silk trombone
I rang a silent bell, beneath a shower of pearls
In the eagle-winged palace of the Queen Chinee

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
I know you, rider, gonna miss me when I'm gone
I know you, rider, gonna miss me when I'm gone
Gonna miss your baby, from rolling in your arms

[Verse 1]
Laid down last night, Lord, I could not take my rest
Laid down last night, Lord, I could not take my rest
My mind was wandering like the wild geese in the West

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
The sun will shine in my back door someday
The sun will shine in my back door someday
March winds will blow all my troubles away

[Verse 3]
I wish I was a headlight, on a northbound train
I wish I was a headlight, on a northbound train
I'd shine my light through the cool Colorado rain

[Chorus]
I know you, rider, gonna miss me when I'm gone
I know you, rider, gonna miss me when I'm gone
Gonna miss your baby, from rolling in your arms

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
I know you, rider, gonna miss me when I'm gone, gone, gonе
I know you, rider, gonna miss me when I'm gonе, gone, gone
Gonna miss your baby, from rolling in your arms

[Verse 1]
My time coming, any day
Don't worry about me, no
Been so long I felt this way
I ain't in no hurry, no
Rainbows end down that highway
Where ocean breezes blow
My time coming, voices say
And they tell me where I'll go

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't worry 'bout me
No, no, don't worry 'bout me, no
I ain't in no hurry
No, no, 'cause I know where to go

[Chorus]
California
Preaching on the burning shore
California
Knocking on the golden door
Like an angel
Standing in a shaft of light
Rising up to paradise
You know I'm gonna shine, shine

[Verse 2]
My time coming, any day
Don't worry about me, no
Been so long I felt this way
I ain't in no hurry, no
Been so long I felt this way
Now time sure passing slow
Still I know I lead the way, them voices tell me so

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't worry about me
No, no, don't worry about me, no
I ain't in no hurry
No, no, 'cause I know where to go

[Chorus]
California
A prophet on the burning shore
California
Knock, knocking on the golden door
Like an angel
Standing in a shaft of light
Rising up to paradise
You know I'm gonna shine, shine

[Bridge]
You've all been asleep, you would not believe me (Ooh, ooh)
Them voices telling me, telling me you will soon receive me (Ooh, ooh)
Shine on the beach, sea will part before me
(Fire wheel burning in the air)
You will follow me and we will rise up to glory
(Way up the middle of the air)
And I'll call down thunder and speak the same
My work fills the sky with flame
Might and glory gonna be my name
People will light my way, hey

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
My time coming, any day
Don't worry 'bout me, no
Been so long I felt this way
I ain't in no hurry, no
This afternoon, she's in red
I watched the car explode
Still I know I lead the way
Them voices tell me so

[Outro]
Don't worry about me
No, no, don't worry about me, no
I ain't in no hurry
No, no, 'cause I know where to go

They tell me where I'll go
They say I'll lead the way, hey, hey
'Cause I know where to go
Ooh, no, no
Ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Tell you no, no, don't worry about me, no, no

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Right outside this lazy summer home
Ain't got time to call your soul a critic, no
Right outside the lazy gate of winter's summer home
Wondering where the nut-thatch winters
Wings a mile long just carried the bird away

[Chorus]
Wake up to find out that you are the eyes of the world
The heart has its beaches, its homeland and thoughts of its own
Wake now, discover that you are the song that the morning brings
But the heart has its seasons, its evenings and songs of its own

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
There comes a rеdeemer, and he slowly too fades away
And thеre follows his wagon behind him that's loaded with clay
The seeds that were silent all burst into bloom, and decay
And night comes so quiet, it's close on the heels of the day

[Chorus]
Wake up to find out that you are the eyes of the world
The heart has its beaches, its homeland and thoughts of its own
Wake now, discover that you are the song that the morning brings
The heart has its seasons, its evenings and songs of its own

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Sometimes we live no particular way but our own
Sometimes we visit your country and live in your home
Sometimes we ride on your horses, sometimes we walk alone
Sometimes the songs that we hear are just songs of our own

[Outro]
Wake up to find out that you are the eyes of the world
The heart has its beaches, its homeland and thoughts of its own
Wake now, discover that you are the song that the morning brings
The heart has its seasons, its evenings and songs of its own

[Instrumental]

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Spanish lady come to me, she lays on me this rose
It rainbow spirals round and round, it trembles and explodes
It left a smoking crater of my mind I like to blow away
But the heat came 'round and busted me for smiling on a cloudy day

[Chorus]
Coming, coming, coming around (Coming around y'all)
Coming around (Coming around)
Coming (Coming), coming (Coming), coming around (Coming around y'all)
Coming around (Coming around)

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Escaping through the lily fields, I came across an empty space
It trembled and exploded, left a bus stop in its place
The bus came by and I got on, that's when it all began
There was Cowboy Neal at the wheel of the bus to never ever land

[Chorus]
Coming, coming, coming around (Coming around y'all now)
Coming around (Coming around)
Coming (Coming), coming (Coming), coming around (Coming around y'all now)
Coming around (Coming around y'all now)

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Old man down
Way down down, down by the docks of the city
Blind and dirty
Asked me for a dime, a dime for a cup of coffee
I got no dime but I got some time to hear his story

[Verse 2]
My name is August West, and I love my Pearly Baker best, more than my wine
More than my wine
More than my maker, though he's no friend of mine
Everyone said
I'd come to no good, I knew I would, Pearly, believe them
Half of my life
I spent doing time for some other fucker's crime
The other half found me stumbling around drunk on burgundy wine

[Bridge]
But I'll get back on my feet someday
The good Lord willing, if He says I may
I know that the life I'm living's no good
I'll get a new start, live the life I should

[Refrain]
I'll get up and fly away
I'll get up and fly away, fly away

[Verse 3]
"Pearly's been true
True to me, true to my dying day," he said
I said to him
I said to him, "I'm sure she's been"
I said to him, "I'm sure she's been true to you"

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Got up and wandered
I wandered downtown, nowhere to go but just hang around
I've got a girl
Named Bonnie Lee, I know that girl's been true to me
I know she's been, I'm sure she's been true to me

[Verse 1]
Picture a bright blue ball just spinning, spinning free
Dizzy with eternity
Paint it with a skin of sky
Brush in some clouds and sea
Call it home for you and me
A peaceful place, or so it looks from space
A closer look reveals the human race
Full of hope, full of grace
Is the human face
But afraid we may lay our home to waste

[Chorus]
There's a fear down here we can't forget
Hasn't got a name just yet
Always awake, always around
Singing ashes, ashes, all fall down
Ashes, ashes, all fall down

[Verse 2]
Now watch as the ball revolves
And the nighttimе falls
Again the hunt begins
Again the bloodwind calls
By and by agin, thе morning sun will rise
But the darkness never goes
From some men's eyes
No, it strolls the sidewalks and it rolls the streets
Staking turf, dividing up meat
Nightmare spook, piece of heat
It's you and me
You and me

[Refrain]
Flash blade in ghetto night
Rudy's looking for a fight
Rat cat alley, roll them bones
Need that cash to feed that jones
And the politicians throwin' stones
Singing ashes, ashes, all fall down
Ashes, ashes, all fall down

[Bridge]
Commissars and pin-stripe bosses roll the dice
Any way they fall
Guess who gets to pay the price
Money green or proletarian gray
Selling guns instead of food today

[Chorus]
So the kids they dance and shake their bones
And the politicians throwin' stones
Singing ashes, ashes, all fall down
Ashes, ashes, all fall down

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Heartless powers try to tell us what to think
If the spirit's sleeping
Then the flesh is ink
Yeah, history's page will be deeply carved in stone
The future's here, we are it, we are on our own
On our own
On our own
On our own
On our own
On our own

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 4]
If the game is lost
Then we're all the same
No one left to place or take the blame
We will leave this place an empty stone
Or that shiny ball of blue we can call our home

[Chorus]
So the kids they dance and shake their bones
And politicians throwin' stones
Singing ashes, ashes, all fall down
Ashes, ashes, all fall down

[Verse 5]
Shipping powders back and forth
Yes, and black goes south and white comes north
In a whole world full of petty wars
Yes, and I got mine and you got yours
And the current fashion sets the pace
Lose your step, fall out of grace
And the radical, he rant and rage
Singing someone's got to turn the page
And the rich man in his summer home
Singing just leave well enough alone
But his pants are down, his cover's blown

[Chorus]
And the politicians throwin' stones
So the kids they dance and shake their bones
It's all too clear we're on our own
Singing ashes, ashes, all fall down
Ashes, ashes, all fall down

[Outro]
Picture a bright blue ball
Just spinnin', spinnin' free
It's dizzy with possibilities
Ashes, ashes, all fall down (Ashes, ashes, all fall down)
Ashes, ashes, all fall down (Ashes, ashes, all fall down)
Ashes, ashes, all fall down (Ashes, ashes, all fall down)
Singing ashes, ashes, all fall down (Ashes, ashes, all fall down)
All fall down (Ashes, ashes, all fall down)
All fall down (Ashes, ashes, all fall down)
Hey, singing, ashes, ashes, all fall down
All fall down (Ashes, ashes, all fall down)
All fall down (Ashes, ashes, all fall down)
Singing ashes, ashes, all fall down
Singing ashes, ashes, all fall down (Ashes, ashes, all fall down)
Singing ashes, ashes, all fall down
Singing ashes, ashes, all fall down (Ashes, ashes, all fall down)

[Verse 1]
I wanna tell you how it's going to be
You're gonna give your love to me
I wanna love you night and day
You know our love will not fade away
You know our love will not fade away
Not fade away

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
My love is bigger than a Cadillac
I try to show you but you drive me back
Your love for me has got to be real
You're gonna know just how I feel
Our love is real, will not fade away
Will not fade away

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
I wanna tell you how it's going to be
You're gonna give your love to me
I wanna love you night and day
You know our love will not fade away
You know our love will not fade away
You know our love will not fade away
You know our love will not fade away
You know our love will not fade away

There's more important things than hearing you speak
You stayed because I made it so convenient (So convenient)
Don't explain yourself, you'll never see

[Refrain: Madonna]
I've heard it all before, I've heard it all before
I've heard it all before, I've heard it all before
I've heard it all before, I've heard it all before

Sorry
Please forgive me
I'm sorry
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry

[Verse 1]
The boys, the girls, they all like Carmen
She gives them butterflies, bats her cartoon eyes
She laughs like God, her mind's like a diamond
Audio tune lies but she's still shinin', shinin', shinin'

[Chorus]
Darlin', darlin', doesn't have a problem
Lyin' to herself, says her liquor's top shelf
It's alarmin', honestly, how charmin' she can be
She's fooling everyone, tellin' 'em she's havin' fun

[Verse 2]
The night descends and there goes Carmen
Only seventeen but she walks the streets so mean
The men, they stop when she walks by 'em
Whisper "Who is she?" La princesa de la silence
Her walk is art, her words are lightnin'
Strikin' everyone when she pass by them

[Chorus]
Carmen, darlin', doesn't have a problem
She's lyin' to herself 'cause her liquor's top shelf
It's alarmin', honestly, how charmin' she can be
She's foolin' everyone, tellin' 'em she's havin' fun

[Bridge]
She looks animated like a cartoon baby
With her tiara smile and her shortcake heart
Yo, she looks animated like a cartoon baby
With her champagne sex and her cocaine heart
She's like a light that you can't turn off
Gettin' too bright and you need to stop
But you can't turn off and you're gettin' hot
And your body keeps twistin', movin', twistin', movin', shakin', yeah
Twistin', movin', shakin', yeah
Dance 'til dawn, yeah, you dance 'til you drop

[Chorus]
Carmen, Carmen, doesn't have a problem
Lyin' to herself 'cause her liquor's top shelf
Oh, it's alarmin', honest, how disarmin' she can be
You're foolin' everyone when inside you know you're dyin'

[Outro]
Carmen, Carmen, doesn't have a problem
Lyin' to herself 'cause her liquor's top shelf

[verse]
So,so you think you can tell
Heaven from hell?, blue sky from pain?
Can you tell the green field from a cold steel rail?
A smile from a veil?, do you think you can tell?
Did they get you to trade your heroes for ghosts?
Hot ashes from trees?, hot air for a cool breeze?
Cold comfort for a change?, did you exchange a walk on part in the war for lead role in a cage?

[guitar solo]

[Chorus]
How i wish,how i wish were here
We're jut tow lost souls swimming in a fishbowl, year after year
Running over the same old ground, what have we found?, the same old fears, wish you where here

Do I have to change my name?
Will it get me far?
Should I lose some weight?
Am I gonna be a star?

[Verse 1]
I tried to be a boy
I tried to be a girl
I tried to be a mess
I tried to be the best
I guess I did it wrong
That's why I wrote this song
This type of modern life, is it for me?
This type of modern life, is it for free?

[Verse 2]
So, I went into a bar
Looking for sympathy
A little company
I tried to find a friend
It's more easily said
It's always been the same
This type of modern life, is not for me
This type of modern life, is not for free

[Chorus]
American Life (American Life)
I live the American Dream (American Dream)
You are the best thing I've seen
You are not just a dream (American Life)

[Verse 3]
I tried to stay ahead
I tried to stay on top
I tried to play the part
But somehow I forgot
Just what I did it for
And why I wanted more
This type of modern life, is it for me?
This type of modern life, is it for free?

[Refrain]
Do I have to change my name?
Will it get me far?
Should I lose some weight?

I'm drinking a soy latte
I get a double shoté
It goes right through my body, and you know I'm satisfied
I drive my Mini Cooper, and I'm feeling super-dooper
Yo, they tell I'm a trooper, and you know I'm satisfied
I do yoga and pilates, and the room is full of hotties
So I'm checking out the bodies, and you know I'm satisfied
I'm digging on the isotopes, this metaphysics shit is dope
And if all this can give me hope, you know I'm satisfied
I got a lawyer and a manager, an agent and a chef
Three nannies, an assistant, and a driver, and a jet
A trainer, and a butler, and a bodyguard, or five
A gardener and a stylist, do you think I'm satisfied?
I'd like to express my extreme point of view
I'm not a Christian and I'm not a Jew
I'm just living out the American dream
And I just realized that nothing is what it seems

I begin to see the picture, it becomes so clear

Uncomfortable silence can be so loud
Those three words are never enough
When it's long distance love

You looked right through me, you were miles away

I begin to see the picture, it becomes so clear

Uncomfortable silence can be so loud
Those three words are never enough
When it's long distance love

Wake up and smell the coffee
Is your cup half full or empty?
When we talk, you say it softly
But I love it when you're awfully quiet
Hmm-mm, quiet
Hmm-mm

[Pre-Chorus]
You see the piece of paper
Could be a little greater
Show me what you could make her
You'll never know until you try it
Hmm-mm
And you don't have to keep it quiet (Quiet, quiet, quiet)

[Chorus]
And I know it makes you nervous
But I promise you, it's worth it
To show 'em everything you kept inside
Don't hide, don't hide
Too shy to say, but I hope you stay
Don't hide away
Come out and play

[Verse 2]
Look up, out of your window
See snow, won't let it in though
Leave home, feel the wind blow
'Cause it's colder here inside in silence
And you don't have to keep it quiet

[Chorus]
Yeah, I know it makes you nervous
But I promise you, it's worth it
To show 'em everything you kept inside
Don't hide, don't hide
Too shy to say but I hope you stay
Don't hide away
Come out and play

I can go on, and on, and on

[Chorus]
Give it to me, yeah
No one's gonna show me how
Give it to me, yeah
No one's gonna stop me now
Give it to me

[Verse 2]
They say that a good thing never lasts, and then it has to fall
Thosе are the peoplе that did not amount to much at all
Gimme the baseline, and I'll shake it
Gimme a record, and I'll break it
There's no beginning and no ending
Give me a chance to go, and I'll take it

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't stop me now, don't need to catch my breath
I can go on, and on, and on
When the lights go down and there's no one left
I can go on, and on, and on

Give it to me, yeah

What are you waiting for? Nobody's gonna show you how

Got no boundaries and no limits
If there's excitement, put me in it
If it's against the law, arrest me
If you can handle it, undress me

[Pre-Chorus: Madonna & (Cherine Anderson)]

I've been watching you for some time
Can't stop staring at those ocean eyes
Burning cities and napalm skies
Fifteen flares inside those ocean eyes
Your ocean eyes

No fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Falling into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes

I've been walking through a world gonе blind
Can't stop thinking of your diamond mind
Careful creature madе friends with time
He left her lonely with a diamond mind
And those ocean eyes

[Verse 1]
I've been watchin' you for some time
Can't stop starin' at those ocean eyes
Burning cities and napalm skies
Fifteen flares inside those ocean eyes
Your ocean eyes

[Chorus]
No fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Fallin' into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes

[Verse 2]
I've been walkin' through a world gone blind
Can't stop thinkin' of your diamond mind
Careful creature made friends with time
He left her lonely with a diamond mind
And those ocean eyes

[Chorus]
No fair (No fair)
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes (Those ocean eyes)
I'm scared (I'm scared)
I've never fallen from quite this high
Fallin' into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes

[Chorus]
No fair (No fair)
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes (Those ocean eyes)
I'm scared (I'm scared)
I've never fallen from quite this high
Fallin' into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes

[Lyrics from Snippet]

[Hook: Merlyn Wood]
I don't sweat for nobody
Break my back for nobody
Shed my light for nobody
No It's all for me
I don't sweat for nobody
Shed my light for nobody
Break my back for nobody
No It's all for me

[Break: Merlyn Wood]
Yeah, what's up?
In the port of Amsterdam
There's a sailor who sings
Of the dreams that he brings
From the wide-open sea

And in the port of Amsterdam
There's a sailor who sleeps
While the river bank weeps
To the old willow tree

And in the port of Amsterdam
There's a sailor who dies
Full of beer, full of cries
In a drunken town fight

In the port of Amsterdam
There's a sailor who is born
On a hot muggy morn
By the dawn's early light

In the port of Amsterdam
Where the sailors all meet
There's a sailor who eats
Only fish heads and tails
And he'd show you his teeth
That have rotted too soon
That can haul up the sails
That can swallow the moon

And he yells to the cook
With his arms open wide
"Oh, bring me more fish
Throw it down by my side"

And he wants so to belch
But he's too full to try
So he stands up and laughs
And he zips up his fly

In the port of Amsterdam
You can see sailors dance
Paunches bursting their pants
Grinding women to porch

They've forgotten the tune
That their whiskey voice croaked
Splitting the night
With the roar of their jokes

And they turn and they dance
And they laugh and they lust
Till the rancid sound
Of the accordion bursts
And then out of the night
With their pride in their pants
And the sluts that they tow
Underneath the streetlamps

In the port of Amsterdam
There's a sailor who drinks
And he drinks and he drinks
And he drinks once again

He'll drink to the health
Of the whores of Amsterdam
Who've given their bodies
To a thousand other men

Yeah, they've bargained their virtue
Their goodness all gone
For a few dirty coins
Well, he just can't go on

Throws his nose to the sky
And he aims it up above
And he pisses like I cry
On the unfaithful love

In the port of Amsterdam
In the port of Amsterdam

Time goes by so slowly
Time goes by so slowly

[Chorus]
Every little thing that you say or do

The lights are on, but there's no one home
Tick tick tock, it's a quarter to two

Time goes by so slowly for those who wait
No time to hesitate
Those who run seem to have all the fun

Don't cry for me, 'cause I'll find my way
You'll wake up one day, but it'll be too late

[Verse 1]
First you love me and I let you in
Made me feel like I was born again
You empowered me, you made me strong
Built me up, and I could do no wrong
I let down my guard, I fell into your arms
Forgot who I was, I didn't hear the alarms
Now I'm down on my knees, alone in the dark
I was blind to your game, you fired a shot in my heart
Shot in my heart shot in my heart shot in my heart
Shot in my heart shot in my heart (Living for love)
Shot in my hеart shot in my heart shot in my heart (Living for love)
(Living for lovе)

[Verse 2]
I could get caught up in bitterness
But I'm not dwelling on this crazy mess
I found freedom in the ugly truth
I deserve the best, and it's not you
You've broken my heart, but you can't break me down
Not falling apart, once was lost, now I'm found
Picked up my crown, put it back on my head
I can forgive, but I will never forget

[Pre-Chorus]
Took me to Heaven, let me fall down
Now that it's over, I'm gonna carry on
Lifted me up and watched me stumble
After the heartache, I'm gonna carry on

[Chorus]
Living for love, I'm living for love
Not giving up, I'm gonna carry on
Living for love, I'm living for love
Not gonna stop, love's gonna lift me up
Love's give, love's give, love's give
I'm gonna carry on
Love's give, love's give, love's give, love's give
Living for love

[Post-Chorus]
Living, living, living, living, living, living, living

You've broken my heart, but you can't break me down
Not falling apart, once was lost, now I'm found
Picked up my crown, put it back on my head

Sugar they say and spice
What is a young girl made of
Everything that's nice

That's what you are
What you will always be
Made of my dreams
Close as my heart to me
Bright as a star
Of love's sweet mystery
Here in my arms
Where you should always be

What is a young girl made of
While she is in her teens
What is a young girl made of
Bright shirts and old blue jeans

That's what you are
What you will always be
Made of my dreams
Of love's sweet mystery
Bright as a star
Close as my heart to me
Here in my arms
Where you should always be

What is a young girl made of

Mostly a young mans dreams
Mostly a young mans drеams
Mostly a young mans dreams
Mostly a young mans dreams
Mostly a young mans dreams

Not falling apart, once was lost, now I'm found
Picked up my crown, put it back on my head
I can forgive, but I will never forget

[Pre-Chorus]
Took me to Heaven, let me fall down
Now that it's over, I'm gonna carry on
Lifted me up and watched me stumble
After the heartache, I'm gonna carry on

[Chorus]
Living for love, I'm living for love
Not giving up, I'm gonna carry on
Living for love, I'm living for love
Not gonna stop, love's gonna lift me up
'Cause love's gonna lift me up
'Cause love's gonna lift me up
'Cause love's gonna lift me up

[Outro]
'Cause love's gonna lift me up

[Verse 1]
First you love me and I let you in
Made me feel like I was born again
You empowered me, you made me strong
Built me up, and I could do no wrong
I let down my guard, I fell into your arms
Forgot who I was, I didn't hear the alarms
Now I'm down on my knees, alone in the dark
I was blind to your game, you fired a shot in my heart

[Pre-Chorus]
Took me to Heaven, let me fall down
Now that it's over, I'm gonna carry on
Lifted me up and watched me stumble
After the heartache, I'm gonna carry on

[Chorus]
Living for love, I'm living for love
Not giving up, I'm gonna carry on
Living for love, I'm living for love
Not gonna stop, love's gonna lift mе up
Love's gonna lift me up

[Drop]
(Love, lift mе up)
Love's gonna lift me up
(Love, lift me up)

[Verse 2]
I could get caught up in bitterness
But I'm not dwelling on this crazy mess (Ooh yeah)
I found freedom in the ugly truth
I deserve the best, and it's not you
You've broken my heart, but you can't break me down
Not falling apart, once was lost, now I'm found
Picked up my crown, put it back on my head
I can forgive, but I will never forget

[Pre-Chorus]
Took me to Heaven, let me fall down
Now that it's over, I'm gonna carry on
Lifted me up and watched me stumble
After the heartache, I'm gonna carry on

[Chorus]
Living for love, I'm living for love
Not giving up, I'm gonna carry on
Living for love, I'm living for love
Not gonna stop, love's gonna lift me up
Love's gonna lift me up

[Drop]
(Love, lift me up)
Love's gonna lift me up
(Love, lift me up)
Love, gonna lift me up
(Lift me up, lift me up, lift me up)

[Bridge]
'Cause love's gonna lift me up, up, up, up, up
Lord, lift me up, up, up, up
Love's gonna lift me up, up, up, up, up
Up, up, up, up, up
Lord, lift me up, up, up, up (Love's gonna lift me up)
Love's gonna lift me up (Love's gonna lift me up)
Lord, lift me up, up, up, up

[Chorus]
Living for love, I'm living for love
Not giving up, I'm gonna carry on (I'm not giving up)
Living for love, I'm living for love
Not gonna stop, love's gonna lift me up
Love's gonna lift me up

[Outro]
'Cause love's gonna lift me up, up, up, up, up
Lord, lift me up, up, up, up
Love's gonna lift me up, up, up, up, up
Up, up, up, up, up
Lord, lift me up, up, up, up
Love's gonna lift me up
Me up, up, up, up
Never can say goodbye
No, no, no, no, I
Never can say goodbye

Even though the pain and heartache
Seems to follow me wherever I go
Though I try and try to hide my feelings
They always seem to show

Then you try to say you're leaving me
And I always have to say no
Tell me why is it so?

That I never can say goodbye
No, no, no, no
Never can say goodbye

Every time I think I've had enough
I start heading for the door
There's a very strange vibration
That's pressing me right through the core
It says turn around, you fool
You know you'll love her more and more
Tell me why is it so? (Get it Mike)
Don't wanna let you go

I never can say goodbye, girl
Ooh, ooh, baby
I never can say goodbye
No, no, no, no, no, no, ooh

Oh, I never can say goodbye, girl
Ooh, ooh, I never can say goodbye
No, no, no, no, no, no, ooh

Never can say goodbye
No, no, no, no
Never can say goodbye

I keep thinkin' that our problems
Soon are all gonna work out
But there's that same unhappy feeling
And there's that anguish, there's that doubt

It's that same old, did you hang up?
Can't do with you all the time
Tell me why is it so? (Get it Mike)
Don't wanna let you go
I never can say goodbye, girl
Ooh, ooh, baby, I never can say goodbye
No, no, no, no, no, no, ooh

Oh, I never can say goodbye, girl
Ooh, I never can say goodbye
No, no, no, no, no, no, ooh

Oh, I never can say goodbye, girl
Ooh, ooh, baby, I never can say goodbye
No, no, no, no, no, no, ooh, ooh

I never can say goodbye, girl
Ooh, ooh, oh, no, I never can say goodbye
No, no, no, no, no, no, ooh
Can it be I stayed away too long?
Did I leave your mind when I was gone?
It's not my thing trying to get back
But this time let me tell you where I’m at

You don't have to worry 'cause I’m coming
Back to where I should have always stayed
And now I've heard the meaning to your story
And it's enough love for me to stay

Can it be I stayed away too long?
Did I leave your mind when I was gone?
Well, it's not my thing trying to get back
But this time let me tell you where I'm at

I wanna, wanna be where you are, oh, oh
Anywhere you are, oh, oh
I wanna, wanna be where you are, oh, oh
Everywhere you are, oh, oh

Please don't close the door to our future
There's so many things we haven't tried
I could love you better than I used to
And give you all the love I have inside
I wanna, wanna be where you are, oh, oh
Any, anywhere you are, oh, oh
I wanna, wanna be where you are, oh, oh
I gotta, gotta be where you are, oh, oh

It's so hypnotic
The way he pulls on me
It's like the force of gravity
Right up under my feet
It's so erotic
This feeling can't be beat
It's coursing through my whole body
Feel the heat

[Pre-Chorus]
I got that burnin' hot desi-i-i-i-ire
And no one can put out my fi-i-i-i-ire

The room is spinning
It must be the Tanqueray
I'm about to go astray
My inhibition's gone away
I feel like sinning
You got me in the zone
DJ, play my favorite song
Turn me on

[Verse 1: Akon]
Come on, baby, and drop it
Scrub the floor and just mop it
Show these gangsters how you pop lock it
Don't care what you got in your pocket

[Verse 2: Akon]
I get the way that you rocking
Flip that thang thang don't stop it
When I just bang bang and pop it
While the club crowded just watch you (Work it out)

[Pre-Chorus: Akon]
Got a gang of cash and it's going all on the bar (Now work it out)
And it's going fast cause I feel like a superstar (Now work it out)

(Now work it out)

[Chorus: Ne-Yo]
Hey, said a hustler's work is never through

If they asking you, I'm not guilty
Only thing that I'm guilty of is making you rock with me

[Verse 1]
Crossed twelve-thousand lines looking for your face
Only to find not a trace
Even the memory of your mouth tries to disappear
Little lights turn into spheres
Blue mountain in the rearview

[Chorus]
Some nights, barely breathing at all
Waiting for my woman to call

[Verse 2]
Cross twelve letters down, found the longest word
This morning, I'd heard
Somebody said they saw you 'round 1st and 23rd
Blue feathers in your hairdo

[Chorus]
Some nights, barely breathing at all
Waiting for my woman to call
Maple cherry leaves start to fall
Waiting for my woman to call

[Verse 3]
Sweet honey, stirring in my tea
You'rе stirring me
Forgiveness, all thе money in the world
Won't buy it

[Chorus]
Some nights, barely breathing at all
Waiting for my woman to call
Leave the bed unmade
Draw the light green shade
Start the microwave
Dried roses

Cradle, yeah, she does
Lights the fire because
Window frost
Heat loss
Dried roses

Steep the black coffee
Set the plates, pour the tea
Three for her, three for me
Dried roses

Sleepily, she walks
Gradually, she talks
With the geese, she flocks
Dried roses
Afternoon, midnight
Morning's what she likes
Fly thе broom, see the moon
Dried roses

Hеre I go, there I am
All alone in the pan
In the silence again
Dried roses

Half-dead, half-awake
Make a pie, bake a cake
Which road will you take?
Dried roses

Goodness her, goodness me
Goodness eternity
Out you go, in you be
Dried roses

So leave the bed unmade
Draw the light green shade
Start the microwave
Dried roses
Dried roses

[Verse 1]
What does it say about me
That I'd rather die in your arms than
Watch you move on without me
Being the one in your heart?

[Chorus]
And what would you think
If I wanted to be yours
Like no one else before?
I need you to see
That you make me crazy
Like no one else could be
Baby, I'm yours
If you're crazy for me

[Verse 2]
What does it say about me
That I'd rip out my heart for you just
To show you a piece of the real me
If it meant that you will, too?

[Chorus]
And what would you think
If I wanted to be yours
Like no one else before?
I need you to see
That you make me crazy
Like no one else could be
Baby, I'm yours
If you're crazy for me
(If you're crazy for me)

[Outro]
So just let me be yours
Like no one else before
And, baby, you'll see
That you make me crazy
Like no one else could be
Baby, I'm yours
If you're crazy for me

It's like the force of gravity
Right up under my feet
It's so erotic
This feeling can't be beat
It's coursing through my whole body
Feel the heat

I got that burnin' hot desi-i-i-i-ire

My inhibition's gone away
I feel like sinning
You got me in the zone
DJ, play my favorite song
Turn me on

I got that burnin' hot desi-i-i-i-ire

[Verse: Sunday Service Choir]
For thy is the kingdom
And the power
And the glory
Forever and ever
Our Father, forever
Our Father
For healing, for saving
We need you Lord, take me
For strength and for hope
We need you for everything
Father, we need you for everything
Father
We need you now more than ever
We need you now
Save your power down
Save your healing now
This world's crying out
“Lord, we need you more than ever, now”
And your Holy Spirt fall on us
The whole wide world is crying out
“Holy Spirt, oh, now”
Lord, we need you more than ever, now
Lord, we need you more than ever, now
All over the world
Prayers of Earth
Jesus is here
To speak the word
In heaven, on Earth
Prayers of Earth
Jesus, we need you
To speak the word
So much coming in
I do not know where to begin
I just follow the lead you're pulling
And I get lost in your trail
So much more to tell
You just ask me if I'm doing well
But I do not know what the hell
I just swallow hard

In your eyes
Black diamonds
I could die
Black diamonds
In your eyes
Black diamonds
I could die
Black diamonds
And I wake up in a cold sweat on your ceiling
Terrified of what your love's revealing

So much you can see
Should I let you make a woman of me?
Should I let you take the mystery from me?
See the inside of my room at night?
Sometimes you will find
Things I do not know how to leave behind
I've been grappling with my mind
I've been stuck inside a jail
In your eyes
Black diamonds
I could die
Black diamonds
In your eyes
Black diamonds
I could die
Black diamonds
And I wake up in a cold sweat on your ceiling
Terrified of what your love's revealing

The cold of winter warms my blood and he's hot
Like a bed of steel
He finds his peace of mind
In the rivers and the whip-poor-wills
I could follow close behind
And slowly disappear
But I could never leave him
I could never leave him
I could never leave him
I could never leave him
I could never leave him
I could never leave him
*Screams* (I could never leave him)

In his eyes
Black diamonds
I could die
Black diamonds
And I wake up in a cold sweat on your ceiling
Terrified of what his love's revealing
So much more to do
Come on, let me make a man outta you
I could gather you and you tell the truth
You could cry inside my arms
You could cry (inside my arms)
You could cry
You could cry inside my arms like a baby
You could cry inside my arms like a child
You could cry
You could cry
You can cry
Like a baby
You can cry
You can cry
You can cry
You can cry
You can cry
(Cry)
(Cry)
(Cry)

You can cry
You can cry
You can cry
You can cry
Cry
You!
White diamonds
White diamonds
White diamonds
White diamonds
Black diamonds
Like a baby
Like a child
Like a tiny little fragile thing
Like a tiny little decadent fragile thing in my arms
Like a child in my arms
Like a baby in my arms
In my arms
In my arms

Woo!
(Morsica

[?])
(Grant what's next?)

[Verse 1]
I tried to tell you
I didn't know how to stay
You believe she can see through
Cutting at the silent clay
A relief, beckon deep blue
Fettered in the magnet sun
Eat the gun as it feeds you
Spitting up the oxygen
Once again
Once again

[Verse 2]
Once again, empty horses
Gallop through the violet door
Follow red, crooked courses
Shadows on the moonlit floor
Oh, my stars, winged creatures
Gathering in silken height
Like the last human teachers

[Verse 3]
Once again, wе must bleed new
Even as the hours shakе
Crystal blood like a dream true
A ripple in the wound and wake
You believe, I believe too
That you are the river of light
Who I love, that I cling to
In the belly of the empty night

[Chorus]
From the thirty-first floor of the simulation swarm
With the drone of fluorescence
Flicker, fever, fill the form
With a warm gush, now I wanna touch
Like we never could before
I'd fly to you tomorrow, I'm not fighting in this war
I wanna drop my arms and take your arms
And walk you to the shore

[Verse 4]
I remember building an energy shield
In your room, like a temple
Swallows in the windless field
Very thin, with your mother
Tall as a pale green tree
Very wild, bright as winter
Rising with a prism key
And a child to deliver
Taken with the blood and vine
The first little angel

[Verse 5]
Little Andy, soft in your newborn skin
Only one, little Andy, will you return again?
I believe we can renew
And you could be my brother
Once again, fall asleep with our backs against each other
You believe, I believe too
That you are the river of light who I love
That I sing to in the belly of the empty night

[Chorus]
From the thirty-first floor of the simulation swarm
With the drone of fluorescence
Flicker, fever, fill the form
With a warm gush, now I wanna touch
Like we never could before
I'd fly to you tomorrow, I'm not fighting in this war
I wanna drop my arms and take your arms
And walk you to the shore
I'd fly to you tomorrow, I'm not fighting in this war
I wanna drop my arms and take your arms

[Verse 1]
What if all the worlds in space
Would melt into one single place
And intertwine the human race
With other kinds?
The atom is an empty vase
A vehicle to know embrace
The way you feel, the way you taste
It multiplies

[Pre-Chorus]
So much to share
So much to share

[Chorus]
When all material scatters
And ashes amplify
The only place that matters
Is by your side

[Verse 2]
What if all the time between
The words we say and what we mean
Would roll as softly as a stream
That we could ride?
We'd ride the bend from source to mouth
I want a friend from north to south
To build that question as a house
Where we'd reside

[Pre-Chorus]
So much to share
So much to share

[Chorus]
When all material scatters
And ashes amplify
The only place that matters
Is by your side

[Break]

[Chorus]
When all material scatters
And ashes amplify
The only place that matters
Is by your side

[Verse 1]
Maybe it was all too much
Too much for a man to take
Everything's bound to break
Sooner or later, sooner or later
You're all that I can trust
Facing the darkest days
Everyone ran away
But we're gonna stay here, we're gonna stay here

[Pre-Chorus]
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah
I know you're scared tonight
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah
I'll never leave your side

[Chorus]
When it all falls, when it all falls down
I'll be your fire when the lights go out
When it all falls, when it all falls down
I'll be your fire when the lights go out
When it all falls, when it all falls down
I'll bе your fire when the lights go out
Firе when, fire when, fire when, fire when
Fire when, fire when, fire when the lights go out, lights go out
When it all falls
When it all falls
When it all falls, when it all falls
When it all falls, when it all falls
I'll be your fire when the lights go out, out

[Verse 2]
Tell me how we got this far
Every man for himself
Everything's gone to hell
We gotta stay strong, we're gonna hold on
This world has turned to dust
All we've got left is love
Might as well start with us
Singing a new song, something to build on

[Pre-Chorus]
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah
I know you're scared tonight
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah
I'll never leave your side

[Chorus]
When it, when it, when it, when it
When it all falls, when it all falls down
I'll be your fire when the lights go out
When it all falls, when it all falls down
I'll be your fire when the lights go out
When the world gets cold, I'll be your cover
Let's just hold onto each other

[Bridge]
I know we're alright, I know we're alright
I know we're alright, 'cause we'll never be alone
In this mad, mad, in this mad, mad world

[Breakdown]
When it all falls, when it all falls down
I'll be your fire when the lights go out
When there's no one, no one else around
We'll be two souls in a ghost town

[Chorus]
When it all falls, when it all falls down
I'll be your fire when the lights go out
When it all falls, when it all falls down
I'll be your fire when the lights go out
When the world gets cold, I'll be your cover
Let's just hold onto each other

[Chorus 1]
'Round, 'round, 'round', round...
'Round, 'round, we'll be ghost town, onto each other
'Round, 'round, we'll be ghost town, I'll be your cover
'Round, 'round, we'll be ghost town, onto each other

'Round, 'round, we'll be ghost town, I'll be your cover
'Round, 'round, we'll be ghost town, onto each other
'Round, 'round, we'll be ghost town, I'll be your cover

[Chorus 2]
Fire when the lights go out, fire when the lights go out
Fire when the lights go out, fire when the lights go out
Fire when the lights go out, fire when the lights go out
Fire when the lights go out
Onto each other
Onto each other

Even with no light, we're gonna shine like gold
Even with no light, we're gonna shine like gold
Even with no light, we're gonna shine like gold
Even with no light, we're gonna shine like gold
We're gonna shine like gold

Be alone, be alone, be alone, be alone
Be alone, be alone, be alone, be alone

[Chorus 1]
'Round, 'round, we'll be ghost town, onto each other
'Round, 'round, we'll be ghost town, I'll be your cover
'Round, 'round, we'll be ghost town, onto each other
'Round, 'round, we'll be ghost town, I'll be your cover
Onto each other

Maybe it was all too much
Too much for a man to take
Everything's bound to break
Sooner or later, sooner or later
You're all that I can trust
Facing the darkest days
Everyone ran away
But we're gonna stay here, we're gonna stay here

You're all that I can trust
Facing the darkest days
Everyone ran away
But we're gonna stay here, we're gonna stay here

We'll be two souls in a ghost town

[Verse 2]
Tell me how we got this far
Every man for himself
Everything's gone to hell
We gotta stay strong, we're gonna hold on
This world has turned to dust
All we've got left is love
Might as well start with us
Singing a new song, something to build on

[Verse 1]
We jumped straight into
The iris of the lake
You threw your arms around my neck, you knew
My heart was yours
My heart was yours

[Verse 2]
Stay up late into
The iris of the day
You said just one more cigarette, you knew
My heart was yours
My heart was yours

[Verse 3]
Man you change, you grew
You grew another face
You chewed my flesh and spit the taste, you knew
My heart was yours
My heart was yours

[Verse 1]
Lotus flower bloom
Suck the poison from my eye
The point is so heavy
It always takes a while
To set in

[Chorus]
Wall fly
Apple of the oldest eye
I try to believe you
Try to remember

[Verse 2]
Milky spore
I can hear her swinging door
The rain pours so heavy
The car is packed and warm
To get in

[Chorus]
Wall fly
Apple of the oldest eye
I try to receive you
Try to remember

[Verse 1]
Pull over
Look at mercury
Just believing
In silence
With your mother
Like a true beginner

[Refrain]
Happiness

[Verse 2]
The silver
The gradual decay
Disillusion
Of yourself
Such a lonely winner

[Refrain]
Happiness
Happiness

[Verse 3]
Look over
Fluorescent snow
The gasoline
Coffee
Look at you, big enough

[Refrain]
For happiness
Happiness
Happiness

[Verse 4]
The paint chips
The frame rusts
The wind slips
The clutch burns
Grapes
Mississippi river

[Refrain]
Happiness
Happiness
Happiness

[Verse 1]
I am the bruiser wearing a guise
See the confusion deep in my eyes
Learn to separate, annotate, celebrate
To alleviate the child that cries

[Chorus]
Lie, angel lie
Part of us needs to die
Why am I leaving you now? Goodbye
Why do you I love you?

[Verse 2]
Gone is everyone, everything everything is gone
Wrong is everyone, everyone is wrong
I like wrestling with thе thing I am
Also, outside the ring, jeering as a fan

[Chorus]
Lie, angеl lie
Part of us needs to die
Why am I leaving you now? Goodbye
Why do I love you?

[Verse 3]
Afternoon is out and the high is out and you shut me out
I don't want to think about the part of you that is me too
House of memory 

[?] my mind
Give back the rest of me, let me be blind

[Chorus]
Lie, angel lie
Part of us needs to die
Why am I leaving you now? Goodbye
Why do I love you?

[Intro]
Cool
One, two, one, two, three, four

[Verse 1]
Electric waves, a rush of energy
Silent river pouring backward eternally
Through the phase and touch of entropy
Old age in the beginner
To hit the stage and blush wild, laughingly
Crush the rage and rush time tappingly
Call the name so much so vapidly
Dissolving into thin air
Turning the two-fork taped-up television
Into tunnel vision
Taking the new fork tactile as revision
Working the revision

[Chorus]
Time escaping
Time escaping

[Verse 2]
There is no reason to go down alonе
Through distortion's secret telеphone
Separate contact separate
Poison in the ether
Swinging still incessant pendulum
Lavender, nettle, calendula
Separate, contact, concentrate
Drawing out the fever

[Chorus]
Time escaping
Time escaping

[Break]
Ether
Time
It's music
It's music, Oso

[Verse 3]
Only the winter wind survives
After the heat rush feeds and thrives
After the bushfire burns and dies
Frozen and bitter
Desert ground so cold and clean
Spreading out like a magazine
Reading the dirt like gossip
What do the weeds say? They say
"Everything, everything, everything falls through
Each dimension breaks in two
Like the two hands clapping
Like the two wings flapping
Everything, everything, everything for free
As it all eventually
Turns to dust and petal
Molten rock and meadow"

[Chorus]
Time escaping
Time escaping

[Verse]
Oh, take your time, don't live too fast
Troubles will come and they will pass
You'll find a woman, yeah, and you'll find love
And don't forget, son, there is someone up above

[Chorus]
And be a simple kind of man
Oh, be something you love and understand
Baby, be a simple, simple kind of man
Oh, won't you do this for me, son, if you can?

[Verse 1: Jeezy & Lil' Will]
Hey, ladies, my Mercedes (What?)
It's four in the back if you know how to act (Yeah)
Got the bought up coupe with the wheels that match (Wheels that match)
Got the money, green ones with the bills that match (Yeah)
You don't get it twisted, got a pimp inside (Why?)
'Cause these ho-ass niggas wanna pimp my ride (Pimp my ride)
These rap niggas don't want it with the dude (Yeah)
My neck is disrеspect and my watch is just rude (Ayy, so icy)

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
I-I see why all the girls lovе Gucci Mane and I see why
Love the guts, same color as Big Cat pie
You can smell the purple tracks when a G pass by
Gucci Mane, you the trap like a simply, see?
Yellow diamonds make my chain look like Martin 

[?]
From the chain, earring, pinky ring, to the watch
Got a He-Man bracelet with so many rocks, uh

[Chorus: Lil' Will]
All these girls excited
Ooh, you know they like it
I’m so icy, so icy (I’m so icy, baby)
Girl, don't try to fight it (Don’t try to fight it)

[Verse 3: Gucci Mane]
Two juggers on my wrist, two different kinds
Spend a hundred thou’ just to tell the time
Drop five hundred just to jump the line
'Cause a real trap nigga, man, it's hard to find
Eighty on the bracelet, forty in my ear
Gucci Mane La Flare, new artist of the year
Still indepent, what are y'all thinkin'?
Came to the club with my chain just swangin'
Gucci in the club, you can smell the tracks
Girls keep askin', "Who the hell is that?"
Gucci get brain, no strings attached
Got the alligator ones with the vest that match
Boys don't know what shine it is
When your whip same color as diamonds is
Girls keep screamin', "How fine he is?"
He spent a hundred just to tell what time it is

[Chorus: Lil' Will & Gucci Mane]
All these girls excited
Ooh, you know they like it (Ooh, you know they like it)
I'm so icy, so icy (I'm so icy, baby, I'm so icy)

All your friends invited (Come on, your friends in)
I'm so icy, so icy (I'm so icy, girl, you so icy)

[Verse 4: Boo & Lil' Will]
When your neck and your wrist glow ocean blue
Girls already know what they 'posed to do
Baby Boo look at my disc, at my prostitute
Say she psych, but she dance and stroke it too
Say she only doin' this 'til she finish school
Get hard degree and business cool
Only two thousand, new Mister T
Color stove like the lights, so you grow some trees
Iced out, big GOAT with initial B
Most iced out player of century
Multi-million dollar bale where a fiend'll be?
Billion dollars in my life is what I plan to see
I say icy and I just can't quit
Jewels get the rule glue, so you might get zipped
Just a hood rich dro with a lotta ice on
Bitch, black dog, all my jewels cut the lights off
Yup, I'm so icy, shorty
Yup, so icy, baby
Yup, so icy, shorty (I'm so icy)
Yup, yup, I'm too icy, icy

[Chorus: Lil' Will]
Girl, don't try to fight it (Hang on me, believe, don't try to fight it)
All your friends invited
I'm so icy, so icy (I'm so icy, baby, I'm so icy)

[Outro: Lil' Will]
Look at my charm
My chain hang down to my—
Hahaha

[Refrain]
I came in like a
I came in like a

I came in like a
I came in like a
I came in like a

[Verse 1]
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
We jumped, never asking why
We kissed, I fell under your spell
A love no one could deny

Don't you ever say I just walked away
I will always want you
I can't live a lie, running for my life
I will always want you

[Verse 2]
I put you high up in the sky
And now, you're not coming down
It slowly turned, you let me burn
And now, we're ashes on the ground
Don't you ever say I just walked away
I will always want you
I can't live a lie, running for my life
I will always want you

[Chorus]
I came in like a wrecking ball
I never hit so hard in love
All I wanted was to break your walls
All you ever did was wreck me
Yeah, you, you wreck me

[Refrain]
I came in like a
I came in like a
(It's gone live)
(One)

[Verse 1]
It's not the energy reeling
Nor the lines in your face
Nor the clouds on the ceiling
Nor the clouds in space
It's not the phone on the table
Nor the bed in the earth
Nor the bed in the stable
Nor your stable words
It's not the formless being
Nor the cry in the air
Nor the girl I'm seeing
With her long black hair
It's not the open weaving
Nor the furnace glow
Nor the blood of you bleeding
As you try to let go

[Chorus]
It's not the room
Not beginning
Not the crowd
Not winning
Not the planet
Not spinning
Not a ruse
Not heat
Not the fire lapping up the creek
Not food
Not to eat

[Verse 2]
Not the meat of your thigh
Nor your spine tattoo
Nor your shimmery eye
Nor the wet of the dew
It's not the warm illusion
Nor the crack in the plate
Nor the breath of confusion
Nor the starkness of slate

[Chorus]
It's not the room
Not beginning
Not the crowd
Not winning
Not the planet
Not spinning
Not a ruse
Not heat
Not the fire lapping up the creek
Not food
Not to eat

[Verse 3]
Not what you really wanted
Nor the mess in your purse
Nor the bed that is haunted
With the blanket of thirst
It's not the hunger revealing
Nor the ricochet in the cave
Nor the hand that is healing
Nor the nameless grave

[Chorus]
It's not the room
Not beginning
Not the crowd
Not winning
Not the planet
Not spinning
Not a ruse
Not heat
Not the fire lapping up the creek
Not food
Not to eat
Not to die
Not dying
Not to laugh
Not lying
Not the vacant wilderness vying
Not the room
Not beginning
Not the crowd
Not winning
Not the planet
Not spinning

[Outro]
(Woo)
Wow, that was fun, I had a wild headphone mix for that track
(Yeah, it was so loud)
Very 

[?]
And then I just turned the drums up, and then all I had was like, just piercing drums
(Yeah me too)
Would you mind sticking it know where it was?
Oh shall we do it one more time?
Oh
Or are we good?

[Verse 1]
Moonshine time, thoughts of you
Spinning 'round as thoughts do
I just wondered if your eyes still shine
As they did when you were mine
I can see in a dream
Thoughts so clear and jewels that gleam
Would your eyes still sparkle then?
If we were, once again

[Chorus]
Jewel eyed Judy, please come home
Jewel eyed Judy, don't leave me alone
Jewеl eyed Judy, pleasе come home
Jewel eyed Judy, don't leave me alone

[Verse 2]
Lovely Judy, can you see?
Where it is you're meant to be
Where you lay your head tonight
May the stars find your light
So am I, sitting here
Moonlight glistens on my tears
Is this all that we could find?
Chains of memories left behind

[Chorus]
Jewel eyed Judy, please come home
Jewel eyed Judy, don't leave me alone
Jewel eyed Judy, please come home
Jewel eyed Judy, don't leave me alone

[Chorus]
Station Man, I've been waiting
Can you tell me when we're leaving?

[Verse]
Midnight train now is leaving
Engines screaming
Uh-huh, uh-huh
Uh-huh, uh-huh
Where I'm going, I don't know
But you tell me I must go
When we're leaving, I don't know
But you tell me now
I see it's coming and bringing something
This train of loving
I see it's coming, I hear it's running
This train of loving from ages past

[Chorus]
Station Man, I've been waiting
Can you tell me when we're leaving?

[Verse 1]
Forgotten eyes are the ones which we lose
Forgotten hands are the ones which we choose
To let go of, but it is no less a bruise
On the collective arm keeping us high and gone
Forgotten dance is the one left at birth
Forgotten plants in the fossils of earth
And they've long passed but they are no less the dirt
Of the common soil keeping us dry and warm

[Chorus]
The wound has no direction
Everybody needs a home and desеrves protection, mm-hmm

[Verse 2]
Hollow-eyеd on Eddie Street, no sirens to hear
Just trash and soiled needles clawing the veneer
And no crying but it is no less a tear
On the common cheek with which we smile
Hollow-eyed on Eddie, is it they or is it I?
Is it me who is more hollow as I'm quickly passing by?
And the poison is killing them, but then so am I
As I turn away

[Chorus]
The wound has no direction
Everybody needs a home and deserves protection, mm-hmm

[Outro]
Forgotten tongue is the language of love
Forgotten tongue is the language of love
Forgotten tongue is the language of love
Forgotten tongue

[Studio chatter]
Wow
One hundred percent
That was just so eh?
Yeah, I loved it
It was a ballad

[Verse 1]
Warm
So warm
Screaming in the field
As I was born
Worm
Will you return me
To the robin's beak?
I'll be a bird

[Chorus]
Terminal
We both know
Let me rest
Let me go
See my death become a trail
And the trail leads to a flower
I will blossom in your sail
Every dream and waking hour

[Verse 2]
Woman
Woman
Hold me in your heat
'Til I re--- don't let me
'Til I re--- don't let me
I remember

[Chorus]
Terminal
We both know
Let me rest, let me go
See my death bеcome a trail
And the trail leads to a flowеr
I will blossom in your sail
Every dream and waking hour

[Studio chatter]
Swagger
Alright
That's a wrap!

[Studio Chatter]
Maybe I should make it more dead like
I kinda like it
I liked it before, like, how clear it is
Maybe a little more dead
Yeah, that's nice

[Verse 1]
Caroline, Caroline
I never could leave you to struggle
Hold the line, hold the line
I’ll be there on the double
In time, in time
Everyone does see trouble

[Chorus]
And you don’t need to know why when you cry
You don’t need to know why
You don’t need to know why when you cry

[Verse 2]
Violet’s eyes, Violet plays
Going back home to the Great Lakes
Where the cattail sways
With a lonesome loon
You'll riding that train in late June

[Chorus]
With the windows wide by your side
With the windows wide
With the windows wide by your side

[Verse 3]
And the clusters fell like an empty bell
Meteor shower at the motel
Where the empty space is a saving grace
Making good time and doing well
But still the question sings like Saturn’s rings
Maybe she knows and she won’t tell

[Chorus]
But you don’t need to know why when you cry
You don’t need to know why
You don’t need to know why when you cry

[Verse 4]
And I find you there in your country flair
Middle of the river in a lawn chair
With your wrinkled hands and your silver hair
Leaving me soon and you know where
To where the cattail sways with the lonesome loon
You’ll be riding that train in late June

[Chorus]
With the windows wide by your side
With the windows wide
With the windows wide by your side
And you don’t need to know why
You don’t need to know why when you cry

[Studio Chatter]
Cool
I liked it- I wish it stayed dry at the end
That yeah
I felt like that would have been the
Like the show yesterday, you told me you liked that one, so I threw it onto the

[Verse 1]
Please wake up
Please wake up
Touch my skin and tell me where you've been
You brought me in
You brought me in
So touch my skin and tell me where you've been
You showed me how
To keep myself from burning out

[Chorus]
They found you in the morning
The blood was on your shoulders
They found you at the corner
Your head was doubled over
And the blood of the man
Who killed my mother with his hands
Is in me, it's in me, in my veins

[Verse 2]
Please wake up
Please wake up
Touch my skin and tell me where you've been
You brought me in
My best friend
So touch my skin and tell me where you've been
You showed me how
To hold my sin
And kiss the bad ways I have been

[Chorus]
They found you in the morning
The blood was on your shoulders
They found you at the corner
Your head was doubled over
And the blood of the man
Who's killing our mother with his hands
Is in me, it's in me, in my veins
It's in me, it's in me, in my veins

[Studio Chatter]
One hundred percent I think I liked that one better
I liked that one better
Yeah, it's a better take
Take two was better
Take two was shortest
Take t---
Yeah
That take?
Take that take

It ain't really hard to find, check the sign on the switch
I was broke back then, but, baby, now I'm rich
Thirty years old and I ain't go no little kids
All that I know, I wake up and go pay the bills
Call my business manager, I'm 'bout to pop a—

[Interlude]
Pill, pill
Pew, pew
Pill, pill

[Verse 2]
Ill, I do this shit for real
Knocking all these beats down like I'm Holyfield
Take your bitch, she need a makeover
This is not no comeback anymore, this is a takeover
CC every rapper on email and tell 'em, "Break's over"
His watch still ain't frozen yet, I still ain't got my roses yet
Why Kanye run for president? I should be the president
Six million dollar residents
I pop my collar like I am a fuckin' pimp
Get rich or die tryin' like 50 Cent
My chain, it cost fifty bricks, Drake?
Drizzy ridin' 'round through the city and my watch cost two fifty
I pity the fool, I still keep a tool
I told you that I had the biggest comeback in the interview

[Outro]
Dre

[Verse 1]
I traded fame for love
Without a second thought
It all became a silly game
Some things cannot be bought
I got exactly what I asked for
Wanted it so badly
Running, rushing back for more
I suffered fools so gladly
And now, I find
I've changed my mind

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
Mmm, ooh, mmm
Famous faces, far off places
Trinkets I can buy
No handsome stranger, heady danger
Drug that I can try
No Ferris wheel, no heart to steal
No laughter in the dark
No one-night stand, no far-off land
No fire that I can spark

[Chorus]
The face of you
My substitute for love
My substitute for love
Mmmm
Should I wait for you?
My substitute for love
My substitute for love
Mmmm

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
The facе of you
My substitute for love
My substitute for lovе
Mmmm
Should I wait for you?
My substitute for love
My substitute for love
Mmmm

I said-I said-I said-I said my name is Biz Markie
And all the people only know me for comedy
I make you laugh, I make you giggle ha-ha, he-he-he
I graduated from Hip-Hop University
I got-I got-I got a license from the DMV
And sometimes you see me rolling in a Cherokee
Whether I'm from Connecticut or DC
I make-I make a party cook like Chef Boyardee
I be-I be catching wreck on the M-I-C
And you can go with the flow or you can disagree
You know-you know-you know I got a degree
Or you get can a DT to check my my pedigree
Now you can write the NAACP
Or ask Al Sharpton how I be

That nobody beats the B-I-Z

And let you listen to the Grand Groove of funky sound

That's guaranteed to rock and give the party a lift
I rock-I rock the house with the greatest of ease

[?] wreck your body and knock you to your knees
Eh-eh-eh-eh, that is my talk
You can tell I'm from LI, NJ or New York
I got-I got smarts like Doctor Zhivago
I talk more bull than the team in Chicago
I try-I try-I try to spit it all out
That I'm the super-duper-party-pooper without no doubt
Check-I check-I check where I'm coming from
I'm long-lasting like chewing gum

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
No studda, no step, just straight up me
To my dance every chance that you give me
Party rock, show shocker, a rap technique
For all the homeboys and all of you freaks

And to all of my people smoking them leaves
On the streets, on the mic, I keep it real
And you know I 

[?] wheels of steel
I got 45 stacked up to the ceiling
From Boogie Nights to Sexual Healing
And the person I'm diversing without no cursing
I may not be the best but I'm far from the worst

As I do my own dance, that I came bringin'
To all the hip-hoppers in 1986
With Marley Marl and TJ Swan, Cool V on the mix
And Big Daddy Kane and as we entertainin'
Makin' the records so that we can be-a rainin'
On top, finger-rockin', from Mike's 

[? 0:57]
Makin' people party on down as I create a
Harmony, charmin'-e, old body incent
Just say like they groomin' and broomin' her like a Vincent
All the competition that tried to compete
Believe, the Biz Markie can't be beat
That's why I rock for house and you don't st-

Yo, I-I, yo

[Verse 1]
I've had so many lives
Since I was a child
And I realize
How many times I've died
I'm not that kind of guy
Sometimes I feel shy
I think I can fly
Closer to the sky

[Chorus]
No one's telling you how to live your life
But it's a setup until you're fed up

[Verse 2]
This world is not so kind
People trap your mind
It's so hard to find
Someone to admire
I sleep much better at night
I feel closer to the light
Now I'm gonna try
To improve my life

[Chorus]
No one's telling you how to live your life
But it's a setup until you're fed up
It's no good when you're misunderstood
But why should I care
What the world thinks of mе?
Won't let a stranger
Give mе a social disease

[Refrain]
Nobody, nobody knows me
Nobody knows me
Nobody knows me
Like you know me
Nobody knows me
Nobody knows me

Like, like you know me

I feel closer to the light

To improve my life

I can return to this place
'Cause, you're the one

[Chorus 1]
Nothing fails, no more fears

You could take all this, take it away
I'd still have it all
'Cause I've climbed the tree of life
And that is why, no longer scared if I fall

[Chorus 2]
I'm not religious
But I feel so moved, mmm (Pray)
I'm not religious (Not religious)

[Verse 1]
Ever since the day you walked into my life
You flipped me upside down, took me for a ride
I didn't know how to take it or I never seen it coming
Shouldve just stayed
But I took off running

[Chorus]
So now I
Lie awake in the middle of the night tryin to figure out what to do
And I know now that I need you in my life just like you always knew
I was a fool and I cut you like a knife so Ive got no right to judge ya
All I know is im more scared to live without ya
Than I am to love ya

[Verse 2]
Ever since the day you walked out of my life
You flipped me upside down, took me for a ride
Thought this was what I wanted but I never could have imagined
That this is how it'd be
When it actually happened

[Chorus]
So now I
Lie awake in the middle of the night tryin to figure out what to do
And I know now that I need you in my life just like you always knew
I was a fool and I cut you like a knife so Ive got no right to judge ya
All I know is im more scared to live without ya
Than I am to love ya

[Bridge]
I fell so fast
I fell so hard
And all you asked was for me to stay
But I walked away from your heart

[Chorus]
Now I
Lie awake in the middle of the night tryin to figure out what to do
And I know now that I need you in my life just like you always knew
I was a fool and I cut you like a knife so Ive got no right to judge ya
All I know is im more scared to live without ya
All I know is Im more scared to live without ya
Than I am to love ya

[Verse 1]
We got our pearl snaps all rolled up, got a pre-game in a red cup
Gonna turn this party upside down about to get real around here
We put our time in on that red dirt
We got the paycheck and now it's our turn
We got a game plan about to put to work
They're gonna hear us when we get there

[Pre-Chorus]
35's on the blacktop
Super hits from the truck stop
Rollin' up in that gravel parking lot

[Chorus]
We're putting boots on the ground
It's country coming to town
We're spinnin' ladies around
Up and down that dance floor
Puttin' smiles on their faces
And I'll teasе them with kisses
Gonna turn this party upside down
Putting boots on thе ground

[Verse 2]
Smoke rings in the black lights
I see a little pair of blue eyes
She just threw a little kiss with a peace sign
Smilin' like "Hey, what's up"
We're all kicked back on a bar stool
Hey, but the dj just took it old school
Everybody better back up
We gonna get a round of shots for my crew

[Chorus]
We're putting boots on the ground
It's country coming to town
We're spinnin' ladies around
Up and down that dance floor
Puttin' smiles on their faces
And I'll tease them with kisses
Gonna turn this party upside down
Putting boots on the ground

[Bridge]
Puttin' boots on the ground
They might be buffed up, scuffed up
But they still ain't worn out
Gonna kick em' off when the time is right
But baby that ain't right now
But baby that ain't right now

[Chorus]
We're putting boots on the ground
It's country coming to town
We're spinnin' ladies around
Up and down that dance floor
Puttin' smiles on their faces
And I'll tease them with kisses
Gonna turn this party upside down
Putting boots on the ground
Putting boots on the ground
Putting boots on the ground
Burn a few down on the back porch
A lot of shift gears in my dashboard
Can’t get it on my own, won’t ask for it
Make it happen with my own two hands
Yeah, I like my boots a little swampy
Yeah, I like my bass a little funky
Yeah, I like my girls a little country
Yeah it’s just the way I am
I ain’t ashamed of how I was raised
And I don’t see no need to change
You can take the boy out of the country
Take the beer out of his hand
You can spend all kind of money to sophisticated man
You can take him out his blue jeans, throw away his camo hat
But you know you can’t teach an old dog new tricks, it’s just as simple as that
You can take the boy out of the country
You can take the boy out of the country
You can take the boy out of thе country but that country’s still in your boy
Still in your boy

[Verse 1]
Lying alone
Touching my skin
I'm falling under
A girl like me
And I can't hold it in
It makes me wonder

Is this for real?
It's not what it seems
You're like an angel
I'm running now
My feet off the ground

[Pre-Chorus]
Take me
Touch me
Won't you hold me close?

[Chorus]
And then we kiss
Your love comes alive on my lips
I feel a rush
Coming over me, over me
And when we touch
This moment when everything's still
I close my eyes
And then we kiss

[Verse 2]
The feel of your hand
As it touches my hair
It makes me tremble
Don't wanna let go
Of the feelings we share
So baby, go slow

Our hearts beating fast
And my body cries
I want it to last
It's burning inside
We're getting deeper

[Pre-Chorus]
Take me
Touch me
Won't you hold me close?

[Chorus]
And then we kiss
Your love comes alive on my lips
I feel a rush
Coming over me, over me
And when we touch
This moment when everything's still
I close my eyes
And then we kiss

[Outro]
You're drifting
The sun comes up
You're fading
You seem so far
I don't know
If I'm awake
Open my eyes
And then we kiss...

[Chorus]
And then we kiss
Your love comes alive on my lips
I feel a rush
Coming over me, over me
And when we touch
This moment when everything's still
I close my eyes
And then we kiss
Hello?

It feels good to be home
And to all of you, I thank you so much for your support
For your support of me for so many years
And more importantly, for the work you continue to do
What do you want me to talk about?
Well, he said something that was a little bit dangerous
He told me I could talk about anything I wanted to
And you know, I am my son's mother
The man I describe in the introduction as being so decidedly different
My son (When you're runnin' outta timе and you're not outta time)
And what made thе project extra special to me is
I got a chance to share not only what he has meant to me
But what he has meant to a generation (Change the time)
As one writer said, we came from somewhere
Not just from the wombs of our mothers and the seeds of our fathers
But from a long line of generations who came before us

[Chorus: The World Famous Tony Williams & Sunday Service Choir]
It's the kingdom (It's the kingdom)

[Intro]
My soul cries out Hallelujah and I thank God for saving me
I thank God for...

[Chorus]
Here go all your problems again (I thank God)
Three, two, one, you're pinned (I thank God)
Uncle now he back in the pen' (Hallelujah)
Auntie shut down again
Did she finally come to life? (Thank you, Jesus)
Ever wish you had another life?
Ever wish you had another life?
Ever wish you had another life?

[Verse 1]
Don't you wish the night would go numb?
I've been feelin' low for so long
I ain't had a high in so long
I been in the dark for so long
Night is always darkest 'fore the dawn
Gotta make my mark 'fore I'm gone
I don't wanna die alone
I don't wanna die alone
I get mad when she gone
Mad when she home
Sad when she gone
Mad when she home
Sad when she gone (Loosen right now, the spirit that wants to run)
Floatin' on a silver lining (In the name of Jesus)
Yeah, you know where to find me, ridin' on a silver lining
And my God won't deny me, tell the Devil, "Get behind me"
And all the stars are aligned, lift me up every time
You know exactly where to find me

[Interlude]
Hallelujah (Thank you, Jesus)
Hallelujah (Yes)
Hallelujah...

[Pre-Chorus]
Did those ideas ever really come to life?
Make it all come to life
Make it all come to life
Prayin' for a change in your life
Well, maybe it's gon' come tonight

[Chorus]
Sadness settin' in again
Three, two, one, you're pinned
Uncle right back in the pen'
Tell me how auntie been
Took your thoughts and penciled 'em in
Should've wrote 'em down in pen
And maybe they'll come to life
And maybe they'll come to life
Sadness settin' in again
Three, two, one, you're pinned
Uncle right back to the pen'
Tell me how auntie been
Thoughts, you had penciled 'em in
Probably should've wrote 'em in pen
And maybe they'll come to life
They could finally come to life
They could finally come to life

[Verse 2]
You know where to find me, they cannot define me
So they crucify me, how so fazed when I leave?
Come and purify me, come and sanctify me
You the air that I breathe, the ultra-ultralight beam
Brought a gift to Northie, all she want was Nikes
This is not about me, God is still alive, so I'm free
Floatin' on a silver lining, floatin' on a silver lining
So when I'm free, I'm free

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)
Now we've been through a lot of things
Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)
He lives in a lot of things
Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)
Been through a lot of things
Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Sittin' by myself, I'm just thinkin'
About all I've been through, I wish I was dreamin'
Man, it's hard to be an angel when you surrounded by demons (Jesus)
I watched so many people leave (Lord)
I see 'em change by the season, that's mama's sеasonin'
God got you, the devil's watchin', he just peekin' in
I know I madе a promise that I'd never let the reaper in (Jesus)
But lately, I've been losin' all my deepest friends (Lord)
And lately, I've been swimmin' on the deepest end
It's just drugs, it ain't no hugs, it ain't no love there
You been down so much you don't even know what's upstairs (Jesus)
Suicidal thoughts got you wonderin' what's up there (Lord)
And while I introduce the party, you say it's up there
Too many pills, so much potions, so much pain, too many emotions
And everything that you do good, it just go unnoticed (Jesus)
Did He tell you that you good and just stay focused? (Lord)
Mama, you was the life of the party
I swear you brought life to the party
When you lost your life, it took the life out the party (Jesus)
That woman rode with me like a Harley (Lord)
Visions of my cousins in a cell really scarred me
Movin' to the hood was like signin' up for the army
'Cause they been killin' **** since **** was watchin' Barney (Jesus)
You want dreams to come true? But I have nightmares (Lord)
'Cause if that come to life, then I might not be right here
Been in the dark so long, don't know if the light here
But I'm just reaching for the stars like Buzz Lightyear (Jesus)
And now I'm lightyears ahead of those nightmares (Lord)
I deaded those night terrors when the night clears
And if I talk to Christ, can I bring my mother back to life?
And if I die tonight, will I see her in the afterlife? (Jesus)
But back to reality, where everything's a tragedy (Lord)
You better have a strategy or you could be a statistic
Little boy dies, he's just one of the mystic
And mama steady crying 'cause she really the victim (Jesus)
And she's getting high and she's getting addicted (Lord)
And her older boy just stuck with the picture, painted vivid
That's a family portrait, and her daughter just absorbed it
Sixteen, pregnant, baby daddy say she should abort it (Jesus)
But we can't afford it, so she decides to move forward (Lord)
Baby shower time, father didn't show up
Now she just feeling nauseous like she finna throw up
The water flows down her legs, yeah, it's finna go up (Jesus)
A year done went by, her daughter just turned one (Lord)
And she's still dependent on her mom
Big brother in the streets, he went and bought him a gun
He want revenge 'cause the pain, feelin' numb (Jesus)
And her mom still doing drugs 'cause that's the only time she feel loved (Lord)
Is it real love? Do the scars really heal up?
From all the pain that done built up, but they don't feel us (Jesus)
A week done flew by, big bro ridin' then he see the guys (Lord)
Left his little brother on the side, bleeding from the side
He seein' red, it's like he's bleeding through his eyes
To see him dead, the only thing that'll help the grieving up inside (Jesus)
Even let him get the last meal
He done with the streets after this, this his last kill (Lord)
He gotta show him that it's that real
He ran up on him with the pipe like, "****, stand still" (Jesus)
"You took my brother life, you made my mother cry" (Lord)
"Tell me one reason I shouldn't send you up to Christ"
He said, "Go 'head, take my life, I've seen everything but Christ"
Then big bro just blacked out and all you seen was the light (Jesus, Lord)

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)

[Verse 2: Jay Electronica]
Uh-huh, in the name of the true and living God, the beneficent, the merciful (Hallelujah)
Thank you for bringing me up the rough side of the mountain like Ertuğrul (Jesus)
Every knee bowed and every tongue confessed and paid homage (Lord)
To the monk who visited Rothschilds like Thelonious did Pannonica (Shoo)
It's Jay Elec-entendre-nica comin' through your monitor
Back from the great beyond like the Son of Man or the Son of Donda? (Jesus)
I never rolled the GSXR or the R6 or the Honda (Lord)
But I flew my Ducati through North America like Wakanda
Earthquakes will strike this nation for what Bush did to Rwanda (Facts)
What the Clintons did to Haiti and Downing Street did to Ghana (Jesus)
In Tepoztlán, they call me Terremoto, El Negro Loco (Lord)
I shake the tectonic plates of the game if I lay one vocal
The God is interstellar while you fellas remain local
My bars is like the pyramid temples of Pacal Votan (Jesus)
As sure as the DOJ confirmed Ezekiel's Wheel (Lord)
I could change the world like Yacub with two pieces of steel
My sword and my microphone, I swore to the Christ's throne
But when you great, they wanna say you took a L, José Castillo (Jesus)
I'm in the fight here, fight here for what seemed like lightyears (Lord)
My rugged cross and thorny crowns squeeze out Christ tears
Thirty pieces of silver clout, my Pierre price tier
It's a war outside, it's a war outside (Jesus)
It's like the last days of Sodom and Gomorrah outside (Lord)

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)
Now we've been through a lot of things
Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)
He lives in a lot of things
Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)
Been through a lot of things
Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)

[Outro: Larry Hoover Jr. & Kanye West]
What up, Ye? This Larry Hoover Jr
First and foremost, I wanna thank you for taking the fight for my father to the Oval Office
You might not have been the only one that could've did that
But you were the one that did do that
And with your assistance, we can continue to let the world take part in this fight
You know, to me, it kinda feels like
Me, my mother, my brothers, and my kids
Have all been incarcerated through this journey
And we haven't even been to jail
We have been looked at and treated as criminals
For being a part of this family
My father's truth and the reality that he raised me in
Is that he wanted to make a change in this community (Tell me if you know someone that needs)
'Cause the conditions in this capitalist society is what made him
And it is what made the children of today
After twenty-five years of bein' locked down, twenty-three and one
My father has not called any shots from one of the most secure and segregated prisons in the world
And will not, once released, call any shots for the Gangster Disciples
If my father's intentions were to lead us to death, destruction
Into the Hell that he has had to live in for the past twenty-six years
Man, he would be dead to me
I didn't sign up for that
I didn't stay on this journey this long for that
All my life, man
I've been waitin' for my father to come home
They told me when I graduate eighth grade, he would be home
Then they told me when I graduate from high school, he would be home
I went away to Morris Brown, I graduated and he still ain't home
Now I'm a adult, and my daughter went away to college and graduated
He still not home
Now even more than that, my son, he graduated eighth grade and we still waitin'
Matter of fact, he hasn't hugged, kissed, or touched any of his grandchildren
And they haven't been able to touch they grandfather
Even though it is not seen that way for some of us
But for many of us, Larry Hoover is a beacon of hope for his community
Who deserves to breathe free air
Free my father (Jesus), Mr. Larry Hoover Sr. (Lord)

[Intro: Kanye West]
If I hit you with a "W-Y-D?"
You better not hit me with a "H-E-Y"
It better be like "Hiii" with a bunch of I's
Or "Heyyy" with a bunch of Y's
I, I lived a hundred lives, uh
So that mean I had a hundred wives
And I am just simply high off life for the hundredth time

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Never let nobody curve me that don't deserve me
Should I really have bought the Burberry last Thursday?
Wear a different color jersey every Thursday
'Posed to meet in Malibu, you postin' pics in Jersey
Is to lay me or play me a bigger flex though?
'Cause you know you'd never live up to my ex though
If we dive, it's the deep end, baby, let's go
I'll be gone by the weekend, baby, XO

[Pre-Chorus: Kanye West]
Most insane out-of-body experience
And I repent for everything I'ma do again (I accept Him)
And I repent for everything I'ma do again

[Chorus: Sunday Service Choir & Kanye West]
Thank You, thank You, thank You for Your mercy, make me new
Make me new again, make me new again
Make me new again, make me new again
I repent for everything that I'ma do again
Make me new again, make me new again
Make me new again
Last night don't count
This morning don't count

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
If you take the ride, please don't close your eyes, uh
In a den of thieves, every man disguise, uh
Keep your mask on, keep it henne-tized, uh
It's a rollercoaster, keep your hands inside, uh
Wanna bring your pain, 'member this advice, uh
What they vandalize, He'll evangelize, uh
He gon' part the tides, He gon' part the skies, uh
Did it for the fame, 'member this advice, uh
What they vandalize, He'll evangelize, uh
What they vandalize, He'll evangelize, uh
He gon' part the tides, He gon' part the skies, uh
When they start to lie, 'member this advice, uh
What they vandalize, He'll evangelize, uh
When they start to lie, 'member this advice, uh
What they vandalize, He'll evangelize, uh

[Chorus: Sunday Service Choir]
Make me new again, make me new again
Make me new again, make me new again
Make me new again, make me new again
Make me new again, make me new again
Make me new again, make me new again
Make me new again, make me new again
Make me new again, make me new again
Make me new again, make me new again
Make me new again, make me new again
Make me new again, make me new again

[Spoken Intro: Jimi Hendrix]
You see this picture called "Ezy Ryder?"
It was bad as hell, I appreciate that
I don't know for what, but there was something goin' on
So we got this thing called, uh
We're gonna call this The Ezy Ryder
We're gonna make up the words as we go along
'Cause we got about twenty verses for it
It goes something like this

[Verse 1]
Oh, Ezy
Ezy Ryder
Riding down the highways of desire
Trying
To find higher
Tryna reach the heavens above
But he's dying to be loved

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2]
He's got a living
In magic
Today is no happily day
He's dying
So tragic
But don't you worry about today
We got freedom coming our way
Freedom coming

[Verse 3]
Tryna get all the brothers to fight to be free
Lookin' at all the lovers, sayin' "Do what you please"
In a cloud of angel dust
I think I see me a freak
Hey, motorcycle mama
Will you marry me?
And I'll be stone crazy
Stone crazy
Stone crazy
Stone crazy
Stone crazy

[Verse 4]
Oh, Ezy
Ezy Ryder
He's known to be guilty, insane
'Cause he's trying
To find higher
He's gonna go out in the rain

[?] this to say
Ride on
Ride on
I don't care

[Guitar Solo]

[Interlude]
Run on right, Ezy Ryder
Run right on

[Outro]
Blown away

[Spoken Outro: Jimi Hendrix]
We'll wait until they get onstage together

[?] here and there
Not might be right
But we're going in the studio together, anyway

[Verse 1]
When I was very young
Nothing really mattered to me
But making myself happy
I was the only one
Now that I am grown
Everything's changed
I'll never be the same
Because of you

[Verse 2]
Looking at my life
It's very clear to me
I lived so selfishly
I was the only one
I realize
That nobody wins
Something is ending
And something begins

[Chorus]
Nothing really matters
Love is all we need
Everything I give you
All comes back to
Nothing really matters
Love is all wе need
Everything I give you
All comes back to mе
(Nothing really matters
Love is all we need
Everything I give you)

[Bridge]
Nothing takes the past away
Like the future
Nothing makes the darkness go
Like the light
You're shelter from the storm
Give me comfort in your arms

Love is all we need
Everything I give you
All comes back to

We all slowly move
“Just like a river’s flow… never ends”

How long (Go slow on me)
No longer young (Hold on to thee)
I’m where I belong (Go slow on me)
Hold that we’re bond

I’m not someone
You take away and leave alone
I’m not the one
To shy away and moan
And though I am
A deeply flawed human
I feel the shame

[Verse 2]
When you lay your eyes on me with pain
It’s not hard to see you’re getting cold
Oh, bring me home
Where I’m proud
Where the scales are plane
And It’s sane

[Chorus]
We can play your game
Such a cruel way
To keep you entertained
It’s hard to see who gains
And who plays

[Post-Chorus]
I’d rather be the one who got fooled
Than to have my heart cooled

[Refrain]
I always care
Always lone

Staring high

Lost in time
I'm fine

"I'm not so sure about it..."
"So many things we don't have..."
"If you think about it..."
"Come in here..."
"No way! Say no more!"
"I'm not so sure anymore!"

“Same”

Near my bed

[Intro: Ant Clemons]
Turned to a Mothra, bro, this that Godzilla
Turned to a monster, more like Othello
Phantom of the opera, it goes where it goes
My nightmares still haunt me (Dream)
When I sleep, they haunt me
When I sleep, they haunt me (Ooh)
And my nightmares, they haunt me (Ooh ooh)
But I won't let 'em get the best of me (Yeah)
In the sunken place-

[Hook: Kanye West & Ant Clemons]
Alien, first city flying cars
What we in? Whippin’ at NASA
Beam me up, I'm about to sign off
Fuck a watch, need to take time off
Dunna nah, I don't believе in time
Constructs, I don't believе in lies
Gemini, do you believe in signs?
Pick a side, I'd rather multiply

[Verse 1: Kanye West & Ant Clemons]
Alien, double to sign off
Better time, 'bout to take time off
I don't believe in time, I just believe in signs
Hu a bleeding nine, tell her, "Don't leave tonight"

[Hook: Kanye West & Ant Clemons]
Alien, first city flying cars
What we in? Whippin’ at NASA
Beam me up, I'm about to sign off

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Alien, took the time off, I just took time off
Fly up, pyramid, dunked on, serious
No bro, serious, I'm dead, serious
I'm dead serious, I'm dead serious
Alien, period, she on her period
She gonna come here yet, something, then we get
Closer, better yet, na-na, duh-na-na
Alien, takeoff, I took time off
I don't believe in time, I just believe in signs
I've just been feeling nine
We gon' just leave at nine
Christian calendar, some-some calendar
Airplane, challenge us, happen to challenge her
Said, "It blow up," Michael Moore said, "Know what? Ain't nobody die!"
Alex Jones said the same shit and fried, oh shit!
Alien, pyramid, fly off, take off
Break off, Kit Kat, take off, wake up
Make off, they go, say go, get makeov'
You let go in Waco, Texas
Pull up, err-err, 'Lexus
Flex this, bless this, genesis, precious
Message, message, bless it
Don't stress it, don't stress shit
Don't test it, don't test this
Don't touch this, man they Hammer time
On the dotted line, on the camera time
When it's out of line and they meant it right
Done it down to nine, on the dotted line
Want a better line and I'm feeling right
Kill the feeling, right, oh and I made it rhyme
'Cause I met a time and you're out of time
And you wear the line and he out of line
But he set it off, on the Adderall
When they got it all, set it off y'all
Alien, takeoff, monster

You got to take me with you (And you want me)
Don't you know I love you baby? (So why don't we)
Ah, get it together after the dance (Get together after the dance)

Oh, why don't we
Get together after the dance

Oh, I want you

[Chorus]
After the dance, we will do something instrumental
After the dance, we are going to have some fun
After the dance, I will kiss all your secret places
After the dance, we will come as one

[Verse 1]
You've taken me to your favourite place to eat
Baby, after the dance, won't that be real sweet
And then you're takin' me with the warmest place you know
Whеre we can lay down and let oursеlves go

[Chorus 2]
We're gonna kiss each other after the dance
And we're gonna hold that further after the dance
You said you'd be my lover after the dance
We're gonna gives ourselves a chance, oh baby

[Verse 2]
You look just like candy dancin'
And all kinds of tasty sweets
And I can hardly wait to get your

[?] to see
I had no way of knowing
I'd feel this way
And now I've got to have some
Every day

[Chorus 3]
Oh, after the dance, after the dance
Oh, get you after the dance, after the dance
Oh, after the dance, gonna make romance
After the dance, after the dance

[Bridge]
I'm gonna tease you, baby
After the dance

After the dance
Yeah, we're gonna give ourselves
A chance

[Chorus]
Oh, after the dance, we will do something instrumental
After the dance, we are going to have some fun
After the dance, I'll kiss your secret places
After the dance, we will come undone

[Outro]
After the dance, after the dance
After the dance, baby, we're gonna give ourselves a chance
After the dance, sugar, after the dance
After the dance, gonna get ourselves together
After the dance, oh baby, after the dance
Yes, after the dance, sugar
We're gonna get ourselves together
After the dance, after the dance
After the dance, baby, ooh, after the dance
After the dance, oh, after the dance
After the dance, sugar

[Spoken]
You know, I hear this is going out
Of the album, all over the side to the b-side, to the outer side, you know?
This is a strange thing, let's see what happens

[Verse]
Making light
Yo mum said, if you didn't understand it
You could take your time and try gettin' it right
Now baby, dance, step a little closer
You've got to feel it, so baby, let it move
You take a little time, you get out, now
Now, don't you know you sure won't be no fool?
Can't help it
The reason is because, you see, we're nice
But are on the road to life, you longing
You'll find a better time, take advice
Now work it out, friends understand
The groove is 'cause you want to make it right
You shakers huff or puffin' all your troubles
Get in the move and, and start tonight
I see myself and though you must believe
And take a little hint from 

[?]
Just let your hips-a loose and start to move

[Verse 1]
You are here and warm
But I could look away and you'd be gone
'Cause we live in a time
When meaning falls in splinters from our lives
And that's why I've traveled far
'Cause I come so together where you are

[Pre-Chorus]
And all of the things that I said that I wanted
Come rushin' by in my head when I'm with you
Fourteen joys and a will to be merry
All of the things that we say are very

[Chorus]
Sentimental gentle wind
Blowin' through my life again
Sentimental lady, gentle one
Sentimental gentle wind
Blowin' through my life again
Sentimental lady, gentle one

[Verse 2]
Now you are here today
But easily you might just go away
'Cause we live in a time
When paintings have no color, words don't rhyme
And that's why I've traveled far
'Cause I come so together where you are

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, and all of the things that I said that I wanted
Come rushin' by in my head when I'm with you
Fourteen joys and a will to be merry
All of the things that we say are very

[Chorus]
Sentimental gentle wind
Blowin' through my life again
Sentimental lady, gentle one
Sentimental gentle wind
Blowin' through my life again
Sentimental lady, gentle one

[Verse 3]
You are here and warm
But I could look away and you'd be gone
'Cause we live in a time
When meaning falls in splinters from our lives
And that's why I've traveled far
'Cause I come so together where you are

[Pre-Chorus]
Yes, and all of the things that I said that I wanted
Come rushin' by in my head when I'm with you
Fourteen joys and a will to be merry
All of the things that we say are very

[Chorus]
Sentimental gentle wind
Blowin' through my life again
Sentimental lady, gentle one
Sentimental gentle wind
Blowin' through my life again
Sentimental lady, gentle one
Sentimental gentle wind
Blowin' through my life again
Sentimental lady, gentle one
Sentimental gentle wind
Blowin' through my life again
Sentimental lady, gentle one

[Verse 1]
I wanna sit at home in my rocking chair
I don't wanna travel the world
As far as I'm concerned I've had my share
But time's more precious than gold
I don't wanna see another aeroplane seat
Or another hotel room
The home life to me seems really neat
I just wanna unpack for good

[Chorus]
Buy me a ticket homeward bound, homeward bound
Buy me a ticket homeward bound
Oh, homeward bound

[Verse 2]
Well, it all seems the same when you've done it before
There's no differencе in the style
Therе's no end in sight or my own front door
I'll be a stay-at-home for awhile
So I'll have another drink and a cigarette
Just to console myself somehow
It's not too bad if you can forget
I've just gotta find a way somehow

[Chorus]
Buy me a ticket homeward bound, homeward bound
Buy me a ticket homeward bound, homeward bound
Buy me a ticket homeward bound, homeward bound

[Intro]
Get up, get up, get up...
(Tell the rain not to drop...)

[Verse 1]
Don't tell me to stop
Tell the rain not to drop
Tell the wind not to blow
'Cause you said so, mmm
Tell the sun not to shine
Not to get up this time, no, no
Let it fall by the way
But don't leave me where I lay down

[Chorus]
Tell me love isn't true
It's just something that we do
Tell me everything I'm not
But please don't tell me to stop

[Verse 2]
Tell the leaves not to turn
But don't еver tell me I'll lеarn, no, no
Take the black off a crow
But don't tell me I have to go
Tell the bed not to lay
Like the open mouth of a grave, yeah
Not to stare up at me
Like a calf down on its knees (Down on its)

[Chorus]
Tell me love isn't true
It's just something that we do
Tell me everything I'm not
But don't ever tell me to stop
(Don't you ever) Tell me love isn't true
It's just something that we do
(Don't you ever) Tell me everything I'm not
But don't ever tell me to stop

[Outro]
(Don't you ever)
Don't, don't, don't...
Please don't
Please don't
Please don't tell me to stop
(Don't you ever tell me) Don't you ever
Don't ever tell me to stop
(Don't you ever)
Don't ever tell me to stop
(Don't you ever)
Don't ever tell me to stop
(Tell the rain not to drop)
(Don't you ever)
Don't ever tell me to stop (Don't, don't, don't...)
Tell me to stop, tell me to stop... (Tell the rain not to drop)
Get up, get up, get up...
Turn me up
Come feel the joy all around
Each generation has found they've got their own kind of
Sound
Got to let it out
You've got your own kind of groove
Baby you can't see it
It's your move
Gotta take that leap you can't lose
Time to shout it out
Ba ba ba ba
Ba ba ba ba ba
Live that joy of Pepsi Cola
Pepsi
For those who think young

[Instrumental]

[Verse]
Woo, dizzy ain't the word for the way that you're making me feel now
Well, I need some indication, good Lord, if all of this is real now
You got to tell me, girl, now
Well, I've heard the thought there may be something wrong with my head now
You got to help me, girl, now
Could it be infatuation or am I just being misled now?

[Outro]
Little bolt of inspiration
Way you strike me now
It's sparking my imagination
Girl, don't fight me now
It's causing me such excitation
You got to like me now
Little bolt of inspiration
Don't fight me now
My lightning too
My lightning too
Hey, my lightning too
My lightning too
My lightning, my lightning, my lightning too
Hey, my lightning too

[Instrumental Break]

Woo

[Intro]
Y'all have to move back. Everybody up front, move back. Just a few inches would make a big difference up here, so people up here could breathe. So, at the count of three, everybody take a step back, okay? One, two, three, step back. One, two, three, take another step back, and another step back, and another step back, a little tiny one

[Verse 1]
Look for a while at the china cat sunflower
Proud walking jingle in the midnight sun
Copperdome bodhi drip a silvеr kimono
Like a crazy quilt stargown through a dream night wind

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Krazy Kat peeking through a lace bandanna
Likе a one-eyed cheshire, like a diamond-eye jack
A leaf of all colors plays a golden-string fiddle
To a double-e waterfall over my back

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Comic book colors on a violin river crying a lot of
Words from out a silk trombone
I rang a silent bell, beneath a shower of pearls
In the eagle-winged palace of the Queen Chinee

[Instrumental]
He said he wants to leave
Leave me all lonely
I said "That's alright Mr. Man
I didn't wanna be apart of your plan."

[Verse 1]
Lazy lightning
That sleepy fire in your eyes
Is that desire in disguise?
I keep on trying but I
I can't get through
Lazy lightning
I'd like to find the proper potion
To try to capture your emotion
You're right beside me but I
I can't get through

[Chorus]
You're a loop of lazy lightning
Loop of lazy lighting
Must admit you're kind of frightening
But you really get me high

[Verse 2]
Lazy lightning
When I hear your velvet thunder
You seem so near I start to wonder
Would you come closer if I
If I asked you to
Lazy lightning
The way you're messing with my reason
It's an obsession but it's pleasing
Tell me a lie and I will swear
I'll swear it's true

[Chorus]
You're a loop of lazy lightning
Loop of lazy lightning
Must admit you're kind of frightening
You're a loop of lazy lightning

[Bridge]
Rope of fire 'round my heart (Lightning)
Rope of fire ever tightening (Tightening)
Rope of fire 'round my heart (Lightning)
Come on, let me see your lightning
And it's frightening now
You're a loop of lazy lightning, woo

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Lazy lightning
They say you'll never strike the same place
I want a double dose in my case
I'd fly a kite if I thought
Thought that would do
Lazy lightning
The way you always electrify me
Someday I know you'll satisfy me
And all that lightning will be my lightning
My lightning too

[Outro]
(My lightning too)
You're a loop of lazy lightning
(My lightning too)
Loop of lazy lightning
(My lightning too)
My lightning too
(My lightning too)
Possibilities are frightening
(My lightning too)
My lightning too
(My lightning too)
Come on, come on, lazy lightning
(My lightning too)
My lightning too
(My lightning too)
My lightning too
(My lightning too)
My lightning too
(My lightning too)
My lightning too
(My lightning too)
My lightning too
(My lightning too)
Hey, my lightning too
(My lightning too)
My lightning too
(My lightning too)
My lightning too
(My lightning too)
My lightning too
(My lightning too)
Hey

[Verse 1: The Grateful Dead]
We can share the women, we can share the wine
We can share what we got of yours 'cause we done shared all of mine
Keep on rollin', just a mile to go
Keep on rollin' my old buddy, you're movin' much too slow

[Verse 2: Jerry Garcia, Bob Weir]
I just jumped the watchman, right outside the fence
Took his rings, four bucks in change, ain't that Heaven sent?
Hurts my ears to listen, and it burns my eyes to see
Cut down a man in cold blood, Shannon, it might as well've been me

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3: Bob Weir]
We used to play for silver, now we play for life
One's for sport and one's for blood at the point of a knife
Now the die is shaken, now the die must fall
There ain't no winner in the game, he don't go home with all
Not with all

[Verse 4: The Grateful Dead]
Leavin' Texas, fourth day of July
Sun so hot, the clouds so low, the eagles filled the sky
Catch the Detroit Lightning out of Santa Fe
The Great Northern out of Cheyenne, from sea to shining sea

[Verse 5: Jerry Garcia, Bob Weir]
Gotta go to Tulsa, first train we can ride
Gotta settle one old score, one small point of pride
Ain't a place a man can hide, Shannon, will keep him from the sun
Ain't a bed can give us rest now, you keep us on the run

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 6: The Grateful Dead]
Jack Straw from Wichita
Cut his buddy down
Dug for him a shallow grave
And laid his body down
Half a mile from Tucson
By the morning light
One man gone and another to go
My old buddy, you're moving much too slow

[Outro: The Grateful Dead]
We can share the women, we can share the wine
Okay, now everybody's gotta take a step back. So right now we're gonna play America's favorite fun game "Take a Step Back." Now, when I tell you the word, you take a step back, right? Right. So on the count of three, everybody take just a little step back, and then we're gonna do it a few times, okay? One, two, three, take a step back. One, two, three, another step back. One, two, three, step back. One, two, three, another step back. One, two, three, step back, right. Now everybody can breathe, right?

[Verse 1]
As we rowed out to Fennario
As we rowed out to Fennario
Our captain fell in love
With a lady like a dove
And he called her by name, pretty Peggy-O

[Verse 2]
Will you marry me, pretty Peggy-O?
Will you marry me, pretty Peggy-O?
If you will marry me, I'll set your cities free
And free all the ladies in the area-O

[Verse 3]
I would marry you, sweet William-O
I would marry you, sweet William-O
I would marry you but your guineas are too few
And I fear my mama would be angry-O

[Verse 4]
What would your mama think, pretty Peggy-O?
What would your mama think, pretty Peggy-O?
What would your mama think if she heard my guineas clink?
Saw me marching at thе head of my soldiers-O

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 5]
If evеr I return, pretty Peggy-O
If ever I return, pretty Peggy-O
If ever I return, those cities I will burn
Destroy all the ladies in the area-O

[Verse 6]
Come steppin' down the stairs, pretty Peggy-O
Come steppin' down the stairs, pretty Peggy-O
Come steppin' down the stairs, combing back your yellow hair
Bid a last farewell to your William-O

[Verse 8]
Sweet William, he is dead, pretty Peggy-O
Sweet William, he is dead, pretty Peggy-O
Sweet William, he is dead and he died for a maid
And he's buried in the Louisiana country-O

[Outro]
As we rowed out to Fennario
As we rowed out to Fennario
Our captain fell in love
With a lady like a dove
And he called her by name, pretty Peggy-O

[Verse 1]
Me and my uncle went riding down
South Colorado, west Texas bound
We stopped over in Santa Fe
That being the point just about halfway
And you know it was the hottest part of the day

[Verse 2]
I took the horses up to the stall
Went to the barroom, ordered drinks for all
Three days in the saddle, you know my body hurt
It being summer, I took off my shirt
And I tried to wash off some of that dusty dirt

[Verse 3]
West Texas cowboys, they's all around
With liquor and money, they's loaded down
So soon after payday, know it seemed a shame
You know my uncle, he starts a friendly game
Hey, high-low jack and the winner take the hand

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 4]
My uncle started winning; cowboys got sore
One of them called him, and then two more
Accused him of cheating; well, oh no, it couldn't be
I know my uncle, he's as honest as me
Hey, I'm as honest as a Denver man can be
One of them cowboys, he starts to draw
Well, I shot him down, Lord, he never saw
Shot me another, well, hot damn, he won't grow old, no
In the confusion, my uncle grabbed the gold
Hey, we high-tailed it down to Mexico

[Outro]
I love those cowboys, I love their gold
I love my uncle, God rest his soul
He taught me good, Lord, he taught me all I know
Taught me so well, well, I grabbed that gold
But I left him lying there by the side of the road

[Chorus]
Well, I taught that weeping willow how to cry, cry, cry
Taught the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky
Tears I cried for that woman, they're gonna flood you, big river
And I'ma gonna sit right here until I die

[Verse 1]
Well, I met her accidentally in St. Paul, Minnesota
She tore me up every time I heard her drawl, that Southern drawl
Well, I heard my dream went back downstream, cavorting in Davenport
Well, I follow you big river when you called

[Chorus]
I taught that weeping willow how to cry, cry, cry
Taught the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky
Tears I criеd for that woman, they're gonna flood you, big river
And I'ma gonna sit right hеre until I die

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Well, I followed her down to St. Louie, later on down the river
Trader said she's been here, but she's gone, boy, she's gone
Then I followed her down to Memphis
But she just walked off the bus
She raised a few eyebrows when she went on down alone

[Chorus]
I taught that weeping willow how to cry, cry, cry
Taught the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky
Tears I cried for that woman are gonna flood you, big river
And I'ma gonna sit right here until I die

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Well, I've gotten on down to Baton Rouge, River Queen roll on
Take that woman down to New Orleans, New Orleans
I give up, 'cause I've had enough
Followed my blues on down to the gulf
She loves you big river more than me

[Chorus]
I taught that weeping willow how to cry, cry, cry
Taught the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky
Tears I cried for that woman, they're gonna flood you, big river
And I'ma gonna sit right here until I die

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
I taught that weeping willow how to cry, cry, cry
Taught the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky
Tears I cried for that woman, they're gonna flood you, big river
And I'ma gonna sit right here until I die

[Outro]
And I'ma gonna sit right here until I die
And I'ma gonna sit right here until I die

[Verse 1]
If I had a gun for every ace I have drawn
I could arm a town the size of Abilene
Don't you push me, baby, 'cause I'm moaning low
And you know I'm only in it for the gold

All that I am asking for is ten gold dollars
And I could pay you back with one good hand
You can look around about the wide world over
And you'll never find another honest man

[Chorus]
Last fair deal in the country
Last fair deal in the town
Put your gold money where your love is, baby
Before you let my deal go down, go down

[Verse 2]
Don't you push me, baby, because I'm moaning low
But I know a little something you won't ever know
Don't you touch hard liquor, just a cup of cold coffee
Gonna wake up in the morning and go
Everybody's bragging and drinking that wine
I can tell the Queen of Diamonds by the way she shines
Come to daddy on an inside straight
Well, I've got no chance of losing this time
I've got no chance of losing this time
Well, I've got no chance of losing this time

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Last fair deal in the country
Last fair deal in the town
Put your gold money where your love is, baby
Before you let my deal go down, go down

[Outro]
Everybody's bragging and drinking that wine
I can tell the Queen of Diamonds by the way she shines
Come to daddy on an inside straight
Well, I've got no chance of losing this time
Well, I've got no chance of losing this time
Well, I've got no chance of losing this time

[Verse 1]
I have seen where the wolf has slept by the silver stream
I can tell by the mark he left you were in his dream
Ah, child of countless trees
Ah, child of boundless seas
What you are and what you're meant to be
Speaks his name, though you were born to me
Born to me, Cassidy

[Verse 2]
Lost now on the country miles in his Cadillac
I can tell by the way you smile he's rolling back
Come wash the nighttime clean
Come grow this scorched ground green
Blow the horn and tap the tambourinе
Close the gap of the dark yеars in between
You and me, Cassidy

[Bridge]
Quick beats in an icy heart
Catch-colt draws a coffin cart
There he goes and now here she starts
Hear her cry
Flight of the seabirds, scattered like lost words
Wheel to the storm and fly

[Instrumental Break]

[Refrain]
Faring thee well now
Let your life proceed by its own design
Nothing to tell now
Let the words be yours, I'm done with mine
Faring thee well now
Let your life proceed by its own design
Nothing to tell now
Let your words be yours, I'm done with mine

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
Flight of the seabirds, scattered like lost words
Wheel to the storm and fly

[Verse 1]
Julie catch a rabbit by his hair
Come back stepping, like to walk on air
Get back home where you belong
And don't you come 'round no more

Don't hang your head, let the two time roll
Grass shack nailed on a pine wood floor
Ask the time, baby, I don't know
Come back later, gonna let it show

[Chorus]
And I say row, Jimmy, row
Gonna get there? I don't know
Seems a common way to go
Get down, row
Row, row, row, row

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Here's a half dollar if you dare
Double twist when you hit the air
Look at Julie, down below
The levee doing the do-pas-o

[Chorus]
And I say row, Jimmy, row
Gonna get there? I don't know
Seems a common way to go
Get down, row
Row, row, row, row

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Broken hеart don't feel so bad
You ain't got half of what you thought you had
Rock your baby to and fro
Not too fast and not too slow

[Chorus]
And I say row, Jimmy, row
Gonna get there? I don't know
Seems a common way to go
Gеt down, row
Row, row, row, row

[Bridge]
That's the way it's been in town
Ever since they tore the jukebox down
Two-bit piece don't buy no more
Not so much as it done before

[Chorus]
And I say row, Jimmy, row
Gonna get there? I don't know
Seems a common way to go
Get down, row
Row, row, row, row
I say row, Jimmy, row
Gonna get there? I don't know
Seems a common way to go
Get down, row
Row, row, row, row
I say row, Jimmy, row (Well)
Gonna get there? I don't know
Seems a common way to go
Get down, row
Row, row, row, row
I said row, Jimmy, row
Gonna get there? I don't know
Seems a common way to go
Get down and row
Row, row, row, row

[Outro]
Get down, row
Row, row, row, row
Get down, row
Row, row, row, row

[Verse 1]
I told Althea I was feeling lost
Lacking in some direction
Althea told me upon scrutiny
That my back might need protection
I told Althea that treachery
Was tearing me limb from limb
Althea told me, "Now, cool down, boy
Settle down easy, Jim"

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
You may be Saturday's child all grown
Moving with a pinch of grace
You may be a clown in the burying ground
Or just another pretty face
You may be the fate of Ophelia
Sleeping and perchance to dream
Honest to the point of recklessness
Self centered to the extremе

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Ain't nobody messing with you but you
You know that your friends are gеtting most concerned
Loose with the truth, maybe it's your fire
Baby, I hope you don't get burned
When the smoke has cleared, she said
That's what she said to me
You're gonna want a bed to lay your head
And a little sympathy

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 4]
There are things you can replace
And others you cannot
The time has come to weigh those things
This space is getting hot
You know this space is getting hot

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 5]
I told Althea I'm a roving sign
I was born to be a bachelor
Althea told me: "Okay, that's fine"
You know now I'm trying to catch her
Can't talk to you without talking to me
We're guilty of the same old thing
Thinking a lot about less and less
And forgetting the love we bring

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Compass card is spinning
Your elm is swinging to and fro
Ooh, where's the dog star?
Ooh, where's the moon?

[Chorus]
You're a lost sailor
You've been way too long at sea

[Verse 2]
Some days the gales are howling
Some days the sea is still as glass
Ooh, reef the main sail
Ooh, lash the mast

[Chorus]
You're a lost sailor
You've been way too long at sea
Now the shore lights beckon
Yeah, there's a price for being free

[Bridge]
Hear the sea birds cryin'
There's a ghost wind blowin'
And it's calling you, to that misty swirling sea
'Til the chains of your dreams are broken
No place in this world you can be

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
You're a lost sailor
You've been way too long at sea
Now the shore lights beckon
Oh yeah, there's a price for being free

[Outro]
Yeah, for being free
Drifting, you're drifting
Drifting and dreaming
Drifting and dreaming
Yes, and going on a dream now
Maybe going on a feeling
'Cause there's a place you've never been
Maybe a place you've never seen now
You can hear them calling on the wind
Drifting and dreaming
Go on and drift your life away now
Drifting and dreaming
Yes, and going on a dream now
Yes, and going on a feeling, going on a feeling
And going on a dream now
Going on a feeling
Maybe going on a feeling, maybe going on a feeling
Maybe going on a feeling

[Verse 1]
Well, this must be heaven
Tonight I cross the line
You must be the angel
I thought I might never find
Was it you I heard singing
While I was chasing dreams?
Driven by the wind
Like the dust that blows around

[Chorus]
The rain fallin' down now
But I never know now
No, I never know, no, no

[Verse 2]
Yes, this is heaven
'Cause here's where the rainbow ends
At last it's the real thing
Well, close enough to pretend
But when that wind blows
When the night's about to fall
I can hear the sirens call
It's a certain sort of sound

[Chorus]
When the rain fallin' down now
Rain fallin' down
Rain fallin' down

[Bridge]
Holes in what's left of my reason
Holes in the knees of my blues
Odds against me been increasin'
But I'll pull through

I never could read no road map
No, I don't know what the weather might do
But hear that witch wind whinin'
See that dog star shinin'
I've got a feelin' there's no time to lose
No time to lose

I never know now
Just don't ever know, no, no

[Verse 3]
Well, it's been heaven
But even rainbows will end
Now my sails are fillin'
And the wind is willin'
That I'm as good as gone again
I'm still walkin', so I'm sure that I can dance
Just a Saint of Circumstance
Just a tiger in a trance
In the rain fallin' down now

[Chorus]
Rain fallin' down
The rain fallin' down
Rain fallin' down now
Rain fallin' down
Rain fallin' down

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
And never know now
No, I never, never know, no, no
Well, I sure don't know what I'm going for
(No, I never know)
But I'm gonna go for it for sure
(It's for sure now)
I sure don't know what I'm going for
(Never know, I never, never know, no)
But I'm gonna go for it for sure
(That's for sure now)
I sure don't know what I'm going for
(Well, I never, never know, no)
But I'm gonna go for it for sure
(That's for sure now)
I sure don't know what I'm going for
(Don't ever, never, never know, no, no)
But I'm going to go for it for sure
(Hey, for sure now)
Hey, I sure don't know what I'm going for
(Maybe going on a dream now, yeah)
But I'm gonna go for it for sure
(Maybe going on a feeling)
I sure don't know what I'm going for
(Never, never know, no, no, no)
But I'm gonna go for it for sure
(Maybe going on a feeling, maybe going on a feeling)
We're gonna take a short break. We'll be back in just a few minutes, so everybody hang loose

[Chorus]
I know you, rider, gonna miss me when I'm gone
I know you, rider, gonna miss me when I'm gone
Gonna miss your baby, from rolling in your arms

[Verse 1]
Laid down last night, Lord, I could not take my rest
Laid down last night, Lord, I could not take my rest
My mind was wandering like the wild geese in the West

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Know the sun gonna shine in my back door someday
Well, the sun gonna shine in my back door someday, someday, someday
March winds gonna blow all my troubles away

[Verse 3]
I wish I was a headlight, on a northbound train
I wish I was a headlight, on a northbound train
I'd shine my light through the cool Colorado rain

[Chorus]
I know you, rider, gonna miss me when I'm gone
I know you, rider, gonna miss me when I'm gone
Gonna miss your baby, from rolling in your arms

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
I know you, rider, gonna miss me when I'm gone, gone, gone
I know you, rider, gonna miss me when I'm gone, gone, gone
Gonna miss your baby, from rolling in your arms

[Verse 1]
Inside you're burning
I can see clear through
Your eyes tell more than you mean them to
Lit up and flashing
Like the reds and blues
Shining out on the neon avenue
But I

[Chorus]
(Feel like a stranger)
Feel like a stranger, like a stranger

[Verse 2]
Well, the music's thundering
We're reckless and hot
You keep firing glances across the room
Well, I can't stop wondering
Just what you got
I get the feeling I'm gonna find out real soon
But I

[Chorus]
(Feel like a stranger)
Feel like a stranger, feel like a strangеr, stranger

[Refrain]
You know it's gonna get stranger
So lеt's get on with the show
Let's go, hey

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
And the wheel
Gets smoking 'round midnight
You shoot me a look that says "Let's go"
Yes and it feels 'bout like we're running a red light
There ain't no point in looking behind us, no
But I

[Chorus]
(Feel like a stranger)
Feel like, feel like a stranger

[Outro]
You know it's gonna get stranger
If it's love, now how would I know?
Would I know? How would I know?
If this were love now how would I know?
How would I know? How would I know?
If this were love now how would I know?
(Feel like a stranger)
Feel like a stranger
(Feel like a stranger)
Feel like a stranger, like a stranger
(Feel like a stranger) (Hey, gonna be a long, long, crazy, crazy night)
Feel like, feel like a stranger (Crazy night, crazy night)
(It's gonna be a long, long, crazy, crazy night)
Hey, crazy, crazy night
Feel like a stranger
(Gonna be a long, long, crazy, crazy night)
Like a stranger (Crazy night)
Like a stranger, like a stranger (Crazy night)
Long, long, crazy, crazy night
Silky, silky, crazy, crazy night (Crazy night)
Silky, silky, crazy, crazy night (Crazy night)
Silky, silky, crazy, crazy night (Crazy night, oh, crazy night)
Silky, silky, crazy, crazy night (Silky, silky, crazy, crazy night)
Long, long, crazy, crazy night (Silky, silky, crazy, crazy night)
Long, long, crazy, crazy night (Long, long, crazy, crazy night)
Crazy night, crazy night (Feel like a stranger)
Long, long, crazy, crazy night (Crazy night, crazy night)

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Rat in a drain ditch, caught on a limb
You know better but I know him
Like I told you, what I said
Steal your face right off your head

[Chorus]
Now he's gone
Now he's gone, Lord, he's gone
Like a steam locomotive rolling down the track
He's gone, gone
And nothing's gonna bring him back
He's gone

[Verse 2]
Nine mile skid on a ten mile ride
Hot as a pistol but cool inside
Cat on a tin roof, dogs in a pile
Nothing left to do but smile, smile, smile

[Chorus]
Now he's gone
Now he's gone, Lord, he's gone
He's gone
Like a steam locomotivе rolling down the track
He's gone, gonе
And nothing's gonna bring him back
He's gone

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
Going where the wind don't blow so strange
Maybe off on some high cold mountain chain
I lost one round but the price wasn't anything
A knife in the back and more of the same

[Verse 3]
Rat in a drain ditch, caught on a limb
You know better but I know him
Like I told you, what I said
Steal your face right off your head

[Chorus]
Now he's gone
Now he's gone, Lord, he's gone
He's gone
Like a steam locomotive rolling down the track
He's gone, gone
And nothing's gonna bring him back
He's gone

[Outro]
Like a steam locomotive rolling down the track
He's gone, gone
And nothing's gonna bring him back
He's gone
Ooh, nothing's gonna bring him back
Ooh, nothing's gonna bring him back
Ooh, nothing's gonna bring him back
(Yeah, well, he's gone)
Ooh, nothing's gonna bring him back
(He's gone for good)
Ooh, nothing's gonna bring him back
Ooh, nothing's gonna bring him back
(Nothing's gonna bring him back, no)
Ooh, nothing's gonna bring him back
(Gone, gone, well, he's gone)
Ooh, nothing's gonna bring him back
(Well, he's gone)
Ooh, nothing's gonna bring him back
(Gone, gone, well, he's gone, gone, well, he's gone)
Ooh, nothing's gonna bring him back
(He's gone, gone, well, he's gone, gone, well, he's gone)
Ooh, nothing's gonna bring him back
(He's gone, gone, well, he's gone, gone, well, he's gone)
Ooh, nothing's gonna bring him back
(He's gone for good, he's gone, he's gone)
Ooh, nothing's gonna bring him back
Ooh, nothing's gonna bring him back
Ooh, nothing's gonna bring him back
Ooh, nothing's gonna bring him back

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Spanish lady come to me, she lays on me this rose
It rainbow spirals round and round, it trembles and explodes
It left a smoking crater of my mind I like to blow away
But the heat came around and busted me for smiling on a cloudy day

[Chorus]
Coming, coming, coming around (Coming around now)
Coming around (Coming around)
Coming (Coming), coming (Coming), coming around (Coming around now)
Coming around (Coming around)

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Escaping through the lily fields, I came across an empty space
It trembled and exploded, left a bus stop in its place
The bus come by and I got on, that's when it all began
There was Cowboy Neal at the wheel of the bus to Never Ever Land

[Chorus]
Coming, coming, coming around (Coming around, y'all)
Coming around (Coming around)
Coming (Coming a—), coming (Coming a—), coming around (Coming around now)
Coming around

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Old man down
Way down down, down by the docks of the city
Blind and dirty
Asked me for a dime, a dime for a cup of coffee
I got no dime but I got some time to hear his story

[Verse 2]
My name is August West, and I love my Pearly Baker best, more than my wine
More than my wine
More than my maker, though he's no friend of mine

[Verse 3]
Everyone said
I'd come to no good, I knew I would, Pearly, believe them
Half of my life
I spent doing time for some other fucker's crime
The othеr half found me stumbling around drunk on burgundy wine

[Bridge]
But I'll get back on my feet somеday
The good Lord willing, if He says I may
I know that the life I'm living's no good
I'll get a new start, and live the life I should

[Refrain]
I'll get up and fly away
I'll get up and fly away, fly away

[Verse 4]
"Pearly's been true
True to me, true to my dying day," he said
I said to him
I said to him, "I'm sure she's been"
I said to him, "I'm sure she's been true to you"

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 5]
Got up and wandered
I wandered downtown, nowhere to go but just to hang around
I've got a girl
Named Bonnie Lee, I know that girl's been true to me
I know she's been, I'm sure she's been true to me

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
Well, the joint was jumping, going around and around
Hey, hey now, reeling and rocking, what a crazy sound
I know they never stopped rocking 'til the moon went down

[Verse 1]
Well, it sounded so sweet now, I had to take a chance
Rose out of my seat, y'all, 'cause I had to dance
I started moving my feet, oh yes, clapping my hands

[Chorus]
You know they never stopped rocking, going around and around
Hey, hey now, reeling and rocking, what a crazy sound
No, they never stopped rocking 'til the moon went down

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Around twelve o'clock, although the place was packed
The front doors, they was locked, said that old place was packed
But whеn the police knocked, wеll, them old doors flew back

[Chorus]
But no, they never stopped rocking, going around and around
Hey, hey now, reeling and rocking now, what a crazy sound
No, they never stopped rocking 'til that old moon came, it went, it went, it went down

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Well, it sounded so sweet, y'all, I had to take a chance
Rose out of my seat, y'all, 'cause I had to dance
I started moving my feet, y'all, yes, and clapping my hands

[Outro]
No, they never stopped rocking, going around and around
Hey, hey, hey, crazy, crazy sound
No, they never stopped rocking, 'til that old moon went down

[Verse 1]
Deep down in Louisiana close to New Orleans
Way back up in the woods among the evergreens
There in an old cabin made of earth and wood
There lived a country boy named Johnny B. Goode
He never learned to read or write so well
But he could play a guitar like ringing a bell

[Chorus]
Go go, go Johnny go, go; go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go; go Johnny go, go
Go on now Johnny B. Goode

[Verse 2]
He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack
Go sit up in the trees by the railroad track
The engineers seen him sitting in the shade
Strumming to the rhythm that the drivers made
The peoplе passing by all would stop and say
"My, my, that little country boy can play!"

[Chorus]
Go go, go Johnny go, go; go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go; go Johnny go, go
Go, go Johnny B. Goode

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
His papa told him "Someday you will bе a man
You will be the leader of a big old band
Many people coming from all miles around
To hear you play your music when the sun goes down
Maybe someday your name will be in lights
Saying Johnny B. Goode tonight"

[Chorus]
Go go, go Johnny go, go; go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go; go Johnny go, go
Go, go on Johnny B. Goode

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
Go, go Johnny go, go; go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go; go Johnny go, go
Go, go on Johnny B. Goode
Thank you

[Verse 1]
You tell me this town ain't got no heart
(Well, well, well, you can never tell)
The sunny side of the street is dark
(Well, well, well, you can never tell)
Maybe it's 'cause it's midnight
In the dark of the moon besides

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Maybe the dark is from your eyes
(Maybe the dark is from your eyes)
Maybe the dark is from your eyes
(Maybe the dark is from your eyes)
Maybe the dark is from your eyes
(Maybe the dark is from your eyes)
You know you got such dark eyes (Woo)

[Chorus]
Nothing shaking on Shakedown Street
Used to be the heart of town
Don't tell me this town ain't got no heart
You just gotta poke around

[Verse 2]
You think you've seen this town clear through
(Well, well, well, you can never tell)
Nothing here that could interest you
(Well, well, well, you can never tell)
It's not because you missed out
On the thing that we had to start

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Maybe you had too much too fast
(Maybe you had too much too fast)
Maybe you had too much too fast
(Maybe you had too much too fast)
Maybe you had too much too fast
(Maybe you had too much too fast)
Or just over-played your part (Woo)

[Chorus]
Nothing shaking on Shakedown Street
Used to be the heart of town
Don't tell me this town ain't got no heart
You just gotta poke around

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Since I'm passing your way today
(Well, well, well, you can never tell)
I just stopped in 'cause I wanna say
(Well, well, well, you can never tell)
I recall your darkness when it crackled like a thundercloud

[Pre-Chorus 3]
Don't tell me this town ain't got no heart
(Don't tell me this town ain't got no heart)
Don't tell me this town ain't got no heart
(Don't tell me this town ain't got no heart)
Don't tell me this town ain't got no heart
(Don't tell me this town ain't got no heart)
When I can hear it beat out loud (Woo)

[Chorus]
Nothing shaking on Shakedown Street
Used to be the heart of town
Don't tell me this town ain't got no heart
You just gotta poke around
Nothing shaking on Shakedown Street
Used to be the heart of town
Don't tell me this town ain't got no heart
You just gotta poke around
Nothing shaking on Shakedown Street
Used to be the heart of town
Don't tell me this town ain't got no heart
(Ain't got no heart, ain't got no heart)
You just gotta poke around
Don't tell me this town ain't got no heart
(Don't tell me this town ain't got no heart)
(Don't tell me this town ain't got no heart)
You just gotta poke around

[Bridge]
Don't tell me this town ain't got no heart
You just gotta poke around
Don't tell me this town ain't got no heart
(Don't tell me this town ain't got no heart)
(Don't tell me this town ain't got no heart)
You just gotta poke around
(Just gotta poke around, just gotta poke around)
Don't tell me this town ain't got no heart
(Don't tell me this town ain't got no heart)
(Don't tell me this town ain't got no heart)
You just gotta poke around
(Just gotta poke around, just gotta poke around)
(Just gotta poke around, just gotta poke around)
(Just gotta poke around, just gotta poke around)
(Gotta, gotta poke around, just gotta poke around)
(Just gotta poke around)
(Don't tell me this town ain't got no heart)
(Just gotta poke around) (Ooh)
(Just gotta poke around)

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
I had a hard run
Running from your window
I was all night running
Lord, I wonder if you care
I had a run-in
Run around and run down
Run around a corner
Lord, I run smack into a tree

[Chorus]
I had to move
Really had to move
That's why if you please
I am on my bended knees
Bertha, don’t you come around here anymore

[Verse 2]
Dressed myself in green
I went down under the sea
Try to see what's going down
And read between the lines
I heard a voice calling
I turned around to see
The voice calling
Is running back to me

[Chorus]
I had to move
Really had to move
That's why if you please
I am on my bended knees
Bertha, don’t you come around here anymore

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
I had to move
Really had to move
That's why if you please
I am on my bended knees
Bertha, don't you come around here anymore

[Verse 3]
Ran into a rainstorm
I ducked back into a bar door
It was all night pouring
Lord, but not a drop on me
Test me, test me, test me, test me
Why don't you arrest me?
Throw me in the jailhouse
Until the sun goes down

[Chorus]
I had to move
Really had to move
That's why if you please
I am on my bended knees
Bertha, don't you come around here anymore
I had to move
Really had to move
That's why if you please
I am on my bended knees
Bertha, don't you come around here anymore

[Outro]
I had to move
Really had to move
That’s why if you please
I am on my bended knees
Bertha, don’t you come around here anymore
Anymore, anymore, anymore, anymore
Anymore, anymore, anymore, anymore
Anymore, anymore, anymore
Anymore

[Verse 1]
Some folks trust to reason
Others trust to might
I don't trust nothing
But I know it come out right
Say it once again now
Oh, I hope you understand
When it's done and over
Lord, a man is just a man

[Chorus]
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on the land

[Verse 2]
Some folks look for answers
Others look for fights
Some folks up in treetops
Just looking for their kites
Well, I can tell your future
Oh, look what's in your hand
But I can't stop for nothing
I'm just playing in the band

[Chorus]
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on the land

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Standing on a tower
World at my command
You just keep turning
While I'm playing in the band
And if a man among you
Got no sin upon his hand
Let him cast a stone at me
For playing in the band

[Chorus]
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on the land

[Instrumental]

[Lady with a Fan]

[Verse 1]
Let my inspiration flow
In token rhyme suggesting rhythm
That will not forsake me
'Til my tale is told and done

While the firelight's aglow
Strange shadows from the flames will grow
'Til things we've never seen
Will seem familiar

Shadows of a sailor forming
Winds both foul and fair all swarm
Down in Carlisle, he loved a lady
Many years ago

Here beside him stands a man
A soldier from the looks of him
Who came through many fights
But lost at love
While the storyteller speaks
A door within the fire creaks
Suddenly flies open
And a girl is standing therе

Eyes alight with glowing hair
All that fancy paints as fair
She takes hеr fan and throws it
In the lion's den

"Which of you to gain me, tell
Will risk uncertain pains of hell?
I will not forgive you
If you will not take the chance"

The sailor gave at least a try
The soldier being much too wise
Strategy was his strength
Not disaster

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
The sailor coming out again
The lady fairly leapt at him
That's how it stands today
You decide if he was wise
The storyteller makes no choice
Soon you will not hear his voice
His job is to shed light
Not to master

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
Since the end is never told
We pay the teller off in gold
In hopes he will come back
But he cannot be bought or sold

[Terrapin Station]

[Verse]
Inspiration move me brightly
Light the song with sense and color
Hold away despair
More than this I will not ask
Faced with mysteries dark and vast
Statements just seem vain at last
Some rise, some fall, some climb
To get to Terrapin

Counting stars by candlelight
All are dim but one is bright:
The spiral light of Venus
Rising first and shining best
Oh, from the northwest corner
Of a brand new crescent moon
Crickets and cicadas sing
A rare and different tune

[Outro]
Terrapin Station
In the shadow of the moon
Terrapin Station
And I know we'll be there soon
Terrapin - I can't figure out
Terrapin - If it's the end or beginning
Terrapin - But the train's put its brakes on
Terrapin - And the whistle is screaming: Terrapin

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Hey, this must be heaven
Tonight I cross the line
You must be the angel
I thought I might never find
Was it you I heard singing
Oh, while I was chasing dreams?
Driven by the wind
Like the dust that blows around

[Chorus]
The rain fallin' down now
But I never know now
Just don't know, don't know

[Verse 2]
Yes, this is heaven
'Cause here's where the rainbow ends
At last it's the real thing
Well, close enough to pretend
But when that wind blows
When the night's about to fall
I can hear thе sirens call
It's a certain sort of sound

[Chorus]
When thе rain fallin' down now
Rain fallin' down
The rain fallin' down now

[Bridge]
Holes in what's left of my reason
Holes in the knees of my blues
Odds against me been increasin'
But I'll pull through

Never could read no road map
No, I don't know what the weather might do
Hear that witch wind whinin'
See that dog star shinin'
I've got a feelin' there's no time to lose
No time to lose

Well, I never know now
Just don't ever know, no, no

[Verse 3]
Well, it's been heaven
But even rainbows will end
Now my sails are fillin'
And the wind is willin'
And I'm as good as gone again
I'm still walkin', so I'm sure that I can dance
Just a Saint of Circumstance
Just a tiger in a trance
In the rain fallin' down now

[Chorus]
Rain fallin' down
Rain fallin' down
Rain fallin' down
Rain fallin' down
Rain fallin' down

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
Never know, just don't ever know, no, no
Never know, well
I sure don't know what I'm going for
(I never know)
But I'm gonna go for it for sure
I sure don't know what I'm going for
(Never know, never, never know)
But I'm gonna go for it for sure
(For, for sure now)
I sure don't know what I'm going for
(Never know, never, never know, no, no)
But I'm gonna go for it for sure
(For sure now)
I sure don't know what I'm going for
(Yes, maybe going on a dream now)
But I'm going to go for it for sure
(Maybe going on a feeling)
I sure don't know what I'm going for
(I never, never know, no, no, no, no)
But I'm gonna go for it for sure
(For sure now, that's for sure now)
I sure don't know what I'm going for
(Maybe going on a dream, going on a dream now)
But I'm gonna go for it for sure
(Maybe going on a feeling, maybe going on a feeling)

[Verse 1]
All of my friends come to see me last night
I was laying in my bed and dying
Annie Beauneau from Saint Angel
Say "The weather down here so fine"

[Verse 2]
Just then the wind
Came squalling through the door
But who can the weather command?
Just wanna have a little peace to die
And a friend or two I love at hand

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Fever rolled up to a hundred and five
Roll on up
Gonna roll back down
One more day
I find myself alive
Tomorrow
Maybe go
Beneath the ground

[Bridge]
See herе how everything
Lead up to this day
And it's just likе any other day
That's ever been
Sun going up and then
The sun, it going down
Shine through my window
And my friends they come around
Come around
Come around

[Outro]
The people might know
But the people don't care
That a man could be as poor as me
Take a look at poor Peter
He's lying in pain
Now let's go run and see
Run and see
Run and see

[Instrumental]

[Instrumental Intro]

[Intro]
Yeah

[Verse 1]
People, people, people
Do you know what it means to be left alone?
Oh, people, people, people
Do you know what it means to be left alone?
No letter today
Lord, not even a call on my telephone
So sad

[Verse 2]
Understandin' and a little lovin'
A little lovin' all in the world I need
Understandin' and a little lovin', baby
Lord, that's all in the world I need
A misunderstandin' and a no good woman
They both have caused my heart to bleed

[Interlude]
Yeah

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Every morning
Lord, thе willow's weeping moan for me
Lord, every morning
Lord, thе willow's weeping moan for me
My baby loved me
Now my heart's in misery

[Instrumental Outro]

[Verse 1: Jimi Hendrix]
I see hands, and I see tear-stained faces
Reaching up but not quite touching on promised land
I see 

[?] and a whole lotta tears wasted
Saying, "Please, send us a helping hand, oh Lord"

[Chorus: Jimi Hendrix, (Background Singers)]
(Lord, Lord, Lord)
Just happy to hear some changes
(Lord, Lord, Lord)
Know it's about that time to find it
(Lord, Lord, Lord)
Lord, freedom's ever marching to me
(Lord, Lord, Lord)
Keep everybody alright

[Verse 2: Jimi Hendrix]
I hear the sound of freedom's marching drum
You and I be there, young and old
You better love me now like it's gonna be the last time, darling
And tell our child you'll sell daddy's broken clothes

[Chorus: Jimi Hendrix, (Background Singers)]
(Lord, Lord, Lord)
Up there stands a woman, baby
(Lord, Lord, Lord)
And I feel her burning light on mе
(Lord, Lord, Lord)
Could this be God's answer?
(Lord, Lord, Lord)
It'd sure hеlp me

[Bridge: Jimi Hendrix, (Background Singers)]
(Everybody)
Everybody
(Everybody)
Keep the light
(Everybody)
Everything's alright
(Everybody)
Everybody
(Everybody)
Time for suppertime
(Everybody)
I see the sky red
(Everybody)
Like a wine

[Guitar Solo]

(Everybody)
Help me, baby
(Everybody)
Help me, Father

Help me, Mother

Thank you everyone for showing up, man
Get all together and come back and redo it
Right, right
Happy new year to everybody in happy new year land

[Verse 1]
Burning desire sets my mind on fire
Burning desire sets my mind on fire
I feel my body
But in the meantime there's nothing to dream
In my window of arms

So between Hell and Heaven, you just may see me chase my heart everywhere
And screaming:
Burning desire, hotter than an electric chair

[Intro]
One, two, one, two, three, four

[Chorus 1]
Truckin', got my chips cashed in
Keep truckin', like the do-dah man
Together, more or less in line
Just keep truckin' on

[Verse 1]
Arrows of neon and flashing marquees out on Main Street
Chicago, New York, Detroit and it's all on the same street
Your typical city involved in a typical daydream
Hang it up and see what tomorrow brings

[Chorus 2]
Dallas, got a soft machine
Houston, too close to New Orleans
New York got the ways and means
But just won't let you be, no

[Verse 2]
Most of the cats you meet on the streets speak of true love
Most of the time they're sittin' and cryin' at home
One of these days they know they bettеr get goin'
Out of the door and down on the street all alonе

[Chorus 3]
Truckin', like the do-dah man
Once told me "You've got to play your hand"
Sometimes your cards ain't worth a dime
If you don't lay 'em down

[Bridge]
Sometimes the light's all shinin' on me
Other times I can barely see
Lately it occurs to me
What a long, strange trip it's been

[Verse 3]
What in the world ever became of sweet Jane?
She's lost her sparkle, you know she isn't the same
Livin' on reds, and vitamin C, and cocaine
All her friend can say is "Ain't it a shame"

[Chorus 4]
Truckin', up to Buffalo
I've been thinkin', you got to mellow slow
It takes time to pick a place to go
And just keep truckin' on

[Verse 4]
Sittin' and starin' out of the hotel window
Got a tip they're gonna kick the door in again
I'd like to get some sleep before I travel
But if you got a warrant, I guess you're gonna come in

[Chorus 5]
Busted, down on Bourbon Street
Set up, like a bowling pin
Knocked down, it gets to wearin' thin
They just won't let you be

[Verse 5]
You're sick of hangin' around and you'd like to travel
Get tired of travelin' and you want to settle down
I guess they can't revoke your soul for tryin'
Get out of the door and light out and look all around

[Bridge]
Sometimes the light's all shinin' on me
Other times I can barely see
Lately it occurs to me
What a long, strange trip it's been

[Outro]
Truckin', I'ma goin' home
Whoa whoa, baby, back where I belong
Back home, sit down and patch my bones
And get back truckin' on
Hey now, get back truckin' on
Hey now, get back truckin' on
Hey now, get back truckin' on
Hey now, get back truckin' on
Ah, get back truckin' on
Ah

[Instrumental]

Truckin', I'ma goin' home
Whoa whoa baby, back where I belong
Back home, sit down and patch my bones
And get back truckin' on
Hey now, get back truckin' on
Hey now, get back truckin' on
Hey now, get back truckin' on
Ah, get back truckin' on
Ah, get back truckin' on
Ah, get back truckin' on
Ah, get back truckin' on

Thank you

[Verse 1]
I had a hard run
Running from your window
I was all night running
Lord, I wonder if you care
I had a run-in
Run around and run down
Run around a corner
Lord, I run smack into a tree

[Chorus]
I had to move
Really had to move
That's why if you please
I am on my bended knees
Bertha, don't you come around here anymore

[Verse 2]
Dressed myself in green
I went down under the sea
Try to see what's going down, down, down
And read between the lines
I had a feeling I was falling, falling
I turned around to see
Heard a voice calling
It was running back to me, back to me

[Chorus]
I had to move
Really had to move
That's why if you please
I am on my bended knees
Bertha, don't you come around here anymorе

[Verse 3]
Ran into a rainstorm
I ducked back into a bar door
It was all night pouring, pouring
But not a drop on me
Test mе, test me
Why don't you arrest me?
Throw me in the jailhouse
Until the sun goes down

[Chorus]
I had to move
Really had to move
That's why if you please
I am on my bended knees
Bertha, don't you come around here anymore

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
I had to move
Really had to move
That's why if you please
I am on my bended knees
Bertha, don't you come around here anymore
I had to move
Really had to move
That's why if you please
I am on my bended knees
Bertha, don't you come around here anymore
I had to move
Really had to move
That's why if you please
I am on my bended knees
Bertha, don't you come around here anymore
Anymore, anymore, anymore, anymore
Anymore, anymore, anymore
Anymore

[Verse 1]
Some folks trust to reason
Others trust to might
I don't trust nothing
But I know it come out right
Say it once again now
Oh, I hope you understand
When it's done and over
Lord, a man is just a man

[Chorus]
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on the land

[Verse 2]
Some folks look for answers
Others look for fights
Some folks up in treetops
Just looking for their kites
I can tell your future
Oh, just look what's in your hand
But I can't stop for nothing
I'm just playing in the band

[Chorus]
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on the land

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Standing on a tower
World at my command
You just keep turning
While I'm playing in the band
If a man among you
Got no sin upon his hand
Let him cast a stone at me
For playing in the band

[Chorus]
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on the land

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on the land
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on the land
Playing
Like a wave upon the sand
Daybreak
While I'm playing in the band

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Since it cost a lot to win
And even more to lose
You and me bound to spend some time
Wondering what to choose

[Pre-Chorus]
It goes to show you don't ever know
Watch each card you play
And play it slow

[Chorus]
Wait until that deal come 'round
Don't you let that deal go down, no, no

[Verse 2]
I've been gambling hereabouts
For ten good solid years
If I told you about all that went down
It would burn off both your ears

[Pre-Chorus]
It goes to show you don't ever know
Watch each card you play
And play it slow

[Chorus]
Wait until that deal come 'round
Don't you let that deal go down, no, no

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Since you poured the wine for me
Tightened up my shoes
I hate to leave you sitting there
Composing lonesome blues

[Pre-Chorus]
It goes to show you don't ever know
Watch each card you play
And play it slow

[Chorus]
Wait until that deal come 'round
Don't you let that deal go down
Wait until that deal come 'round
Don't you let that deal go down
Wait until that deal come 'round
Don't you let that deal go down

[Verse 1: The Grateful Dead]
We can share the women, we can share the wine
We can share what we got of yours 'cause we done shared all of mine
Keep on rollin', just a mile to go
Keep on rollin' my old buddy, you're movin' much too slow

[Verse 2: Bob Weir]
I just jumped the watchman, right outside the fence
Took his rings, four bucks in change, ain't that Heaven sent?
Hurts my ears to listen, Shannon, it burns my eyes to see
Cut down a man in cold blood, Shannon, it might as well've been me

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3: Bob Weir]
We used to play for silver, now we play for life
One's for sport and one's for blood at thе point of a knife
Now the die is shakеn, now the die must fall
There ain't no winner in this game, he don't go home with all
With all

[Verse 4: The Grateful Dead]
Leavin' Texas, fourth day of July
Sun so hot, the clouds so low, the eagles filled the sky
Catch the Detroit Lightning out of Santa Fe
The Great Northern out of Cheyenne, from sea to shining sea

[Verse 5: Bob Weir]
Gotta go to Tulsa, first train we can ride
Gotta settle one old score, one small point of pride
Ain't a place a man can hide, will keep him from the sun
Ain't a bed can give us rest now, you keep us on the run

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 6: The Grateful Dead]
Jack Straw from Wichita
Cut his buddy down
Dug for him a shallow grave
And laid his body down
Half a mile from Tucson
By the morning light
One man gone and another to go
My old buddy, you're moving much too slow

[Outro: The Grateful Dead]
We can share the women, we can share the wine
I feel constrained to explain to you that what's happening is all of a sudden we just hit a whole bunch of humidity with our instruments and they're reacting to it and going out of tune with regularity

[Verse 1]
If I had a gun for every ace I have drawn
I could arm a town the size of Abilene
Don't you push me, baby, 'cause I'm moaning low
And you know I'm only in it for the gold

All that I am asking for is ten gold dollars
And I could pay you back with one good hand
You can look around about the wide world over
And you'll never find another honest man

[Chorus]
Last fair deal in the country (Sweet Suzie)
Last fair deal in the town
Put your gold money where your love is, baby
Before you let my deal go down, down, go down

[Verse 2]
Everybody's bragging, because I'm moaning low
But I know a little something you won't ever know
Don't you touch hard liquor, just a cup of cold coffee
Gonna get up in the morning and go
Don't you push me, baby, drinking that wine
I can tell the Queen of Diamonds by the way she shines
Come to daddy on an inside straight
Well, I've got no chance of losing this time
Well, I've got no chance of losing this time
I've got no chance of losing this time

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Last fair deal in the country (Sweet Suzie)
Last fair deal in the town
Put your gold money where your love is, baby
Before you let my deal go down, go down

[Outro]
Everybody's bragging and drinking that wine
I can tell the Queen of Diamonds by the way she shines
Come to daddy on an inside straight
Well, I've got no chance of losing this time
I've got no chance of losing this time
I've got no chance of losing this time

[Verse 1]
Baby, here I am and I'm a man upon the scene
And I can give you what you want but you got to come home with me
And I've got a whole lot of good ol' lovin' and I got some in store
When I get through throwin' it on you, you got to come back for more

[Chorus]
Boys and things will come by the dozen
Ain't nothin' but drugstore lovin'
Pretty little thing let me light your candle
'Cause mama I'm sure hard to handle now, yes, I am

[Verse 2]
An action speaks louder than words and I'm a man with great experience
I know you got you another man, but I can love you better than him
Take my hand and don't be afraid, I'm gonna prove every word I say
I'm advertising love for free so won't you place your ad with me

[Chorus]
Boys and things will come by the dozen
Ain't nothin' but drugstore lovin'
Pretty little thing let me light your candle
'Cause mama I'm sure hard to handle now, yes, I am

[Bridge]
Give it to me, I got to have some
Some of your love, and it's all I need
All I got to have, mama, some of your love
Early in the morning, I get kinda hard to handle, baby
Late in the evening, I get kinda hard to handle too
And it's all I need, all I got to have
Some of your sweet love
I got to get it, I go on and get it
Ain't no way I could do without it
Alright, alright

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Baby, here I am and I'm a man upon the scene
And I can give you what you want but you got to come home with me
And I've got a whole lot of good ol' lovin' and I got some in store
When I get through throwin' it on you, you got to come back for more

[Chorus]
Boys and things will come by the dozen
Ain't nothin' but drugstore lovin'
Pretty little thing let me light your candle
'Cause mama I'm sure hard to handle now, yes, I am

[Outro]
Thanks a lot. Bobby just broke a string. We have to hassle a little bit 'cause another, the broken string disease has spread to this set

[Verse 1]
Well, this job I've got is a little too hard
I'm running out of money, Lord, I need more pay
Gonna wake up in the morning, Lord, I'm gonna pack my bags
Gonna beat it on down the line

[Chorus 1]
Going down the line (Going down the line)
Going down the line (Going down the line)
Going down the line (Going down the line)
Going down the line (Going down the line)
Hey, I'm going down the line (Going down the line)
Going down the line (Going down the line)
Hey, well, now, I'm gonna beat it on down the line

[Verse 2]
Yes, and I'll be waiting at the station, Lord, when that train pulls on by
I, I'm going back where I belong
Hey, I'm going home to my same old used-to-be
Hey, down in Joe Brown's coal mine

[Chorus 2]
I said coal mine (Coal mine)
Whoa, coal mine (Coal mine)
I said coal mine (Coal mine)
Hey, hey, coal mine (Coal mine)
Hey, hey, coal mine (Coal mine)
Hey, hey, hey, hey (Coal mine)
Coal mine, down in Joe Brown's coal mine

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Yes, I'm going back to that shack way across the railroad track
Uh-huh, that's where I think I belong
Yes, I got a sweet woman, Lord, she's waiting there for me
Hey, that's where I'm gonna make my happy home

[Outro]
I said happy home (Happy home)
Whoa, happy home (Happy home)
I said happy home (Happy home)
Hey, a happy, a happy (Happy home)
Happy, happy home (Happy home)
Hey, hey, yeah (Happy home)
Happy home, well, now, that's where I'm gonna make my happy home

[Instrumental]

[Verse]
Dark star crashes
Pouring its light into ashes
Reason tatters
The forces tear loose from the axis
Searchlight casting
For faults in the clouds of delusion

[Outro]
Shall we go
You and I while we can
Through
The transitive nightfall of diamonds

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Out in the West Texas town of El Paso
I fell in love with a Mexican girl
Night time would find me in Rosa's Cantina
Music would play and Felina would whirl

Black as the night were the eyes of Felina
Wicked and evil while casting a spell
My love was strong for this Mexican maiden
I was in love, but in vain I could tell

[Bridge]
One night a wild young cowboy came in
Wild as the West Texas wind
Dashing and daring, a drink he was sharing
With wicked Felina, the girl that I love
So in anger

[Verse 2]
I challenged his right for the love of this maiden
Down went his hand for the gun that he wore
My challenge was answered in less than a heartbeat
The handsome young stranger lay dead on the floor
Just for a moment I stood there in silence
Shocked by the foul evil deed I had done
Many thoughts raced through my mind as I stood there
I had but one chance and that was to run

[Bridge]
Out through the back door of Rosa's I ran
Out where the horses were tied
I picked a good one, he looked like he could run
Up on his back and away I did ride
Just as fast as I

[Verse 3]
Could from the West Texas town of El Paso
Out through the badlands of New Mexico
Back in El Paso my life would be worthless
Everything's gone in life, nothing is left
But it's been so long since I've seen the young maiden
My love is stronger than my fear of death

[Bridge]
I saddled up and away I did go, riding alone in the dark
Maybe tomorrow a bullet may find me
Tonight nothing's worse than this pain in my heart
And at last here I

[Verse 4]
Am on the hill overlooking El Paso
I can see Rosa's Cantina below
My love is strong and it pushes me onward
Down off the hill to Felina I go

Off to my right I see five mounted cowboys
Off to my left ride a dozen or more
Shouting and shooting, I can't let them catch me
I've got to make it to Rosa's back door

[Bridge]
Something is dreadfully wrong, for I feel
A deep burning pain in my side
It's getting harder to stay in the saddle
I'm getting weary, unable to ride
But my love for

[Verse 5]
Felina is strong
And I writhe where I've fallen
Though I am weary, I can't stop to rest
I see the white puff of smoke from the rifle
I feel the bullet go deep in my chest

From out of nowhere, Felina has found me
Kisses my cheek as she kneels by my side
Cradled by two loving arms that I'll die for
One little kiss and Felina goodbye

[Chorus]
Driving that train, high on cocaine
Casey Jones you better, watch your speed
Trouble ahead, trouble behind
And you know that notion just crossed my mind

[Verse 1]
This old engine
Makes it on time
Leaves Central Station
At a quarter to nine
Hits river junction
At seventeen to
At a quarter to ten
You know it's traveling again

[Chorus]
Driving that train, high on cocaine
Casey Jones you better, watch your speed
Trouble ahead, trouble behind
And you know that notion just crossed my mind

[Verse 2]
Trouble ahead
A lady in red
Take my advice
You'd be bettеr off dead
Switch-man sleeping
Train hundred and two
Is on the wrong track
And hеaded for you

[Chorus]
Driving that train, high on cocaine
Casey Jones you better, watch your speed
Trouble ahead, trouble behind
And you know that notion just crossed my mind

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Trouble with you is
The trouble with me
Got two good eyes
But they still don't see
Come 'round the bend
You know it's the end
The fireman screams
And the engine just gleams

[Chorus]
Driving that train, high on cocaine
Casey Jones you better, watch your speed
Trouble ahead, trouble behind
And you know that notion just crossed my mind
Driving that train, high on cocaine
Casey Jones you better, watch your speed
Trouble ahead, trouble behind
And you know that notion just crossed my mind
Driving that train, high on cocaine
Casey Jones you better, watch your speed
Trouble ahead, trouble behind
And you know that notion just crossed my mind
Driving that train, high on cocaine
Casey Jones you better, watch your speed
Trouble ahead, trouble behind
And you know that notion just crossed my mind
Driving that train, high on cocaine
Casey Jones you better, watch your speed
Trouble ahead, trouble behind
And you know that notion just crossed my mind
Driving that train, high on cocaine
Casey Jones you better, watch your speed
Trouble ahead, trouble behind
And you know that notion just crossed my mind

[Outro]
And you know that notion just crossed my mind

[Verse 1]
Went down to the mountain, I was drinking some wine
Looked up into heaven, Lord, I saw a mighty sign
Writ in fire across the heaven, plain as black and white
Get prepared 'cause there's gonna be a party tonight

[Chorus]
Uh-huh, hey, Saturday night
Hey, uh-huh, one more Saturday night
Hey, Saturday night

[Verse 2]
Everybody's dancing down the local armory
With a basement full of dynamite and live artillery
The temperature keeps rising, everybody getting high
Come the rocking stroke of midnight, the placе is gonna fly

[Chorus]
Uh-huh, hey, Saturday night
Hey, uh-huh, one morе Saturday night
Hey, Saturday night, woo

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Turn on Channel Six, the President comes on the news
Says, "I get no satisfaction, that's why I sing the blues"
His wife say, "Don't get crazy, Lord, you know just what to do
Crank up that old Victrola and break out your rocking shoes"

[Chorus]
Uh-huh, hey, Saturday night
Hey, uh-huh, one more Saturday night
Hey, Saturday night, ow

[Verse 4]
Then God way up in heaven, for whatever it was worth
Thought He'd have a big old party, thought He'd call it Planet Earth
Lord, we're young and crazy but I don't see reason why
Why we need to wait, Lord, we should be having fun

[Chorus]
Uh-huh, hey, Saturday night
Hey, uh-huh, one more Saturday night
Ah, ah-ha

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
Hanging on a Saturday night
Hanging on a Saturday night
Everybody get right
Hanging on a Saturday night
One more Saturday, one more Saturday night
Ow, hanging on a Saturday night
Hanging on a Saturday night
Ow
Hanging on a Saturday night
One more Saturday, one more Saturday night
Ow, hanging on a Saturday night
Hanging on a Saturday night
Woo-hoo, hey, Saturday, hey, Saturday night
One more Saturday, one more Saturday night
Ooh

We're gonna take a break now, and we'll back in about, oh, you know, a few minutes

[Verse 1]
Me and my uncle went riding down
South Colorado, west Texas bound
We stopped over in Santa Fe
That being the point just about halfway
And you know it was the hottest part of the day

[Verse 2]
I took the horses up to the stall
Went to the barroom, ordered drinks for all
Three days in the saddle, you know my body hurt
It being summer, I took off my shirt
And I tried to wash off some of that dusty dirt

[Verse 3]
West Texas cowboys, they's all around
With liquor and money, they loaded down
So soon after payday, know it seemed a shame
You know my uncle, he starts a friendly game
Hey now, high-low jack and the winnеr take the hand

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 4]
My uncle startеd winning; cowboys got sore
One of them called him, and then two more
Accused him of cheating; well, oh no, it couldn't be
I know my uncle, he's as honest as me
Hey now, I'm as honest as a Denver man can be, that's me
One of them cowboys, he starts to draw
And I shot him down, Lord, he never saw
Shot me another, well, hot damn, he won't grow old
In the confusion, my uncle grabbed the gold
Then we high-tailed it down to Mexico

[Outro]
I love those cowboys, I love their gold
I love my uncle, God rest his soul
He taught me good, Lord, he taught me all I know
Taught me so well, well, I grabbed that gold
And I left his dead ass there by the side of the road

[Verse 1]
Just like Jack the Ripper
Just like Mojo Hand
Just like Billy Sunday
In a shotgun ragtime band
Just like New York City
Just like Jericho
Pace the halls and climb the walls
And get out when they blow

[Chorus]
Did you say your name was
Ramblin' Rose?
Ramble on, baby
Settle down easy
Ramble on, Rose

[Verse 2]
Just like Jack and Jill
Mama told the jailer
One go up and one go down
Nothing for the sailor
Just like Jack and Jill
Papa told the jailer
One heat up and one cool down
Do yourself a favor

[Chorus]
Did you say your name was
Ramblin' Rose?
Ramble on, baby
Settle down easy
Ramble on, Rose

[Bridge]
I'm gonna sing you a hundred verses in ragtime
I know this song it ain't never gonna end
I'm gonna march you up and down the local county line
Take you to the leader of the band

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Just like Crazy Otto
Just like Wolfman Jack
Sittin' plush with a royal flush
Aces back to back
Just like Mary Shelley
Just like Frankenstein
Clank your chains, and count your change
And try to walk the line

[Chorus]
Did you say your name was
Ramblin' Rose?
Ramble on, baby
Settle down easy
Ramble on, Rose

[Bridge]
I'm gonna sing you a hundred verses in ragtime
I know this song it ain't never gonna end
I'm gonna march you up and down the local county line
Take you to the leader of the band

[Verse 4]
Goodbye, Mama and Papa
Goodbye, Jack and Jill
The grass ain't greener, the wine ain't sweeter
Either side of the hill

[Chorus]
Did you say your name was
Ramblin' Rose?
Ramble on, baby
Settle down easy
Ramble on, Rose

[Outro]
Ramble on, Rose

[Verse 1]
Laid back in an old saloon with a peso in my hand
Watching flies and children on the street
And I catch a glimpse of black-eyed girls who giggle when I smile
There's a little boy who wants to shine my feet
And it's three days ride from Bakersfield and I don't know why I came
I guess I came to keep from paying dues
So instead I've got a bottle and a girl who's just fourteen
And a damn good case of the Mexicali Blues, yeah

[Chorus]
Is there anything a man don't stand to lose
When the devil wants to take it all away?
Cherish well your thoughts, and keep a tight grip on your booze
'Cause thinkin' and drinkin' are all I have today

[Verse 2]
Shе said her name was Billie Jеan and she was fresh in town
I didn't know a stage line ran from Hell
She had raven hair, a ruffled dress, a necklace made of gold
All the French perfume you'd care to smell
She took me up into her room and whispered in my ear
"Go on, my friend, do anything you choose"
Now I'm payin' for those happy hours I spent there in her arms
With a lifetime's worth of the Mexicali Blues, yeah

[Chorus]
Is there anything a man don't stand to lose
When the devil wants to take it all away?
Cherish well your thoughts, and keep a tight grip on your booze
'Cause thinkin' and drinkin' are all I have today

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
And then a man rode into town, some thought he was the law
Billie Jean was waiting when he came
She told me he would take her, if I didn't use my gun
But I'd have no one but myself to blame
I went down to those dusty streets, blood was on my mind
I guess that stranger hadn't heard the news
'Cause I shot first and killed him, Lord, he didn't even draw
And it made me trade the gallows for the Mexicali Blues, yeah

[Outro]
Is there anything a man don't stand to lose
When he lets a woman hold him in her hands?
You just might find yourself out there on horseback in the dark
Just riding and running across those desert sands, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Fare you well, my honey
Fare you well, my only true one
All the birds that were singing
Have flown except you alone

Going to leave this brokedown palace
On my hands and my knees, I will roll, roll, roll
Make myself a bed by the waterside
In my time - in my time - I will roll, roll roll

[Chorus]
In a bed, in a bed
By the waterside I will lay my head
Listen to the river sing sweet songs
To rock my soul

[Verse 2]
River gonna sing me
Sing me sweet and sleepy
Sing me sweet and sleepy
All the way back home (Doo-doo-doo)
It's a far gone lullaby sung many yеars ago
Mama, Mama, many worlds I've come
Since I first lеft home

[Chorus]
Going home, going home
By the waterside I will lay my bones
Listen to the river sing sweet songs
To rock my soul

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Going to plant a weeping willow
On the bank's green edge it will grow, grow, grow
Sing a lullaby beside the water
Lovers come and go - the river roll, roll, roll

[Chorus]
Fare you well, fare you well
I love you more than words can tell
Listen to the river sing sweet songs
To rock my soul

[Harmonizing]

[Verse 1]
Busted flat in Baton Rouge and waiting for a train
Feeling nearly faded as my jeans
Bobby flagged a diesel down and just before it rained
Took us all the way to New Orleans
I took my harpoon out of my dirty red bandanna
I was blowing sad while Bobby sang the blues
With them windshield wipers slapping time and Bobby clapping hands
We pined to sing near every song that driver knew

[Chorus]
Freedom's just another word for nothing left to do
Nothing ain't worth nothing, but it's free
Feeling good was easy, Lord, when Bobby sang the blues
Feeling good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
From the coal mines of Kentucky to thе California sun
Bobby shared the secrеts of my soul
Standing right beside me, Lord, through everything I've done
Bobby's body kept me from the cold
Then somewhere near Salinas, Lord, I let her slip away
Looking for that home I hope she finds
And I'd trade all my tomorrows for a single yesterday
Holding Bobby's body close to mine

[Chorus]
Freedom's just another word for nothing left to lose
Nothing was all she left for me
Feeling good was easy, Lord, when Bobby sang the blues
Feeling good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee

[Bridge]
Lelela, lelelala, lelela, lelela, laleleha, laleleha, lalala
Leleleheee, lalala, leleleheee, lalala, leleleha, leleleha
Lalala, lalala

[Outro]
Freedom's just another word for nothing left to lose
Nothing ain't worth nothing, but it's free
Feeling good was easy, Lord, when Bobby sang the blues
Feeling good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee
Hey, hey, ha, ha

[Verse 1]
I can't stay much longer, Melinda, the sun is getting high
I can’t help you with your troubles, if you won't help with mine
I gotta get down, I gotta get down, I gotta get down to the mine

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
You keep me up just one more night, I can't sleep here no more
Little Ben clock says quarter to eight; you kept me up ’til four
I gotta get down, I gotta get down, or I can't work there no more

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
A lot of poor man make a five dollar bill, keep him happy all the time
Some other fella's making nothing at all, and you can hear him cry
"Can I go, buddy, can I go down take your shift at the mine?"

[Chorus]
Gotta get down to the Cumberland mine
Gotta get down to the Cumberland mine
That's where I mainly spend my time
Make good money, five dollars a day
Made anymore, I might move away

[Outro]
Lotta poor man got the Cumberland blues, he can't win for losing
Lotta poor man got to walk the line just to pay his union dues
I don't know now, I just don't know if I'm going back again
I don’t know now, I just don’t know if I'm going back again
I don’t know now, I just don't know if I'm going back again

[Verse 1]
Sugar magnolia, blossoms blooming
Heads all empty, and I don't care
Saw my baby down by the river
Knew she’d have to come up soon for air

Sweet blossom come on, under the willow
We can have high times if you'll abide
We can discover the wonders of nature
Rolling in the rushes down by the riverside

[Chorus]
She's got everything delightful
She’s got everything I need
Takes the wheel when I'm seeing double
Pays my ticket when I speed

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
She comes skimmin' through rays of violet
She can wade in a drop of dew
She don't come, and I don't follow
Waits backstage while I sing to you
She can dance a Cajun rhythm
Jump like a Willys in four-wheel drive
She's my summer love in the spring, fall, and winter
She can make happy any man alive

Sugar magnolia, ringing that bluebell
While caught up in sunlight
Come on out singing, I'll walk you in the sunshine
Ooh, come on, honey, come along with me

[Chorus]
She's got everything delightful
She’s got everything I need
A breeze in the pines and the sun and bright moonlight
Lazing in the sunshine? Yes, indeed

[Verse 3]
Sometimes when the cuckoo’s crying
When the moon is halfway down
Sometimes when the night is dying
I take me out and I wander 'round
Walk around

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
Sunshine daydream, meet you in the tall trees
We’re going where the wind goes
Blooming like a red rose
Roll on over sweetly
Then ride out singin'; I'll walk you in the morning sunshine
Sunshine daydream, sunshine daydream
Walk you in the tall trees
Going where the wind goes
Hey, blooming like a red rose
Roll on over sweetly
And ride out singin'; I’ll walk you in the morning sunshine
Sunshine daydream, sunshine daydream
Sweet lovin' daydream
Sunshine daydream
Come on over daydream
Come on over daydream
Sweet lovin' daydream
Sunshine daydream, hey, sweet lovin' daydream
Hey, ah, hey, ah, sweet lovin' daydream
Sweet lovin' daydream
Yeah, yeah, sweet lovin' daydream

[Verse]
The news is out, all over town
That you've been seen out running 'round
Just trustin' you was my great sin
What do I do, oh Lord? You win again

[Chorus]
This heart of mine could never see
What everybody knows but me
Just trustin' you was my great sin
What can I do, Lord? You win again

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
This heart of mine could never see
What everybody knows but me
Just trustin' you was my great sin
What can I do, Lord? You win again

[Verse 1]
I wanna tell you how it's gonna be
You're gonna give your love to me
I wanna love you night and day
You know our love will not fade away
You know our love will not fade away
Not fade away

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
My love is bigger than a Cadillac
I try to show you but you drive me back
Your love for me has got to be real
You're gonna know just how I feel
Our love is real, not fade away
Not fade away

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad, bad
I don't wanna be treated this a-way

[Verse 1]
Going where the water tastes like wine
Going where the water tastes like wine
Going where the water tastes like wine
I don't wanna be treated this a-way

[Chorus]
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad, bad, bad
I don't wanna be treated this a-way

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Going where the climate suits my clothes
Going where the climate suits my clothes
Going where the climate suits my clothes
I don't wanna be treated this a-way

[Chorus]
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad, bad, bad
I don't wanna be treated this a-way

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad, bad, bad
I don't wanna be treated this a-way
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad, bad, bad
I don't wanna be treated this a-way
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad, bad, bad
I don't wanna be treated this a-way

[Instrumental]

[Verse]
I wanna tell you how it's gonna be
You're gonna give your love to me
I wanna love you night and day
You know our love will not fade away

[Outro]
You know our love will not fade away
You know our love will not fade away
You know our love will not fade away
Love is love, will not fade away
You know our love will not fade away
Love is love, will not fade away
Love is love, will not fade away
Not fade away, not fade away
Not fade away, not fade away
Will not fade away, will not fade away
Will not fade away, will not fade away
Will not fade away, will not fade away
Will not fade away, not, not fade away
Ow
Thank you all, good night

[Verse 1]
Deep down in Louisiana close to New Orleans
Way back up in the woods among the evergreens
There is an old cabin made of earth and wood
There lived a country boy named Johnny B. Goode
He never learned to read or write so well
But he could play the guitar like ringing a bell

[Chorus]
Go go, go Johnny go, go; go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go; go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny B. Goode

[Verse 2]
He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack
Go sit up in the trees by the railroad track
The engineers seen him sitting in the shade
Strumming to the rhythm that the drivers made
The pеople passing by would stop and say
"Whoa, my that little country boy can play!"

[Chorus]
Go go, go Johnny go, go; go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go; go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny B. Goode

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
His mama told him "Somеday you will be a man
You will be the leader of a big old band
Many people coming from miles around
To hear you play your music when the sun goes down
Maybe someday your name will be in lights
Saying Johnny B. Goode tonight"

[Chorus]
Go go, go Johnny go, go; go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go; go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny B. Goode

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
Go, go Johnny go, go; go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go; go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny B. Goode

[Chorus]
Don't ease, don't ease, don't ease me in
I've been all night long coming home, don't ease me in

[Verse 1]
I was standing on the corner
With a dollar in my hand
I was looking for a woman
Sweet mama didn't have no man

[Chorus]
Don't ease, don't ease, don't ease me in
I've been all night long coming home, don't ease me in

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
The girl I love, she's sweet and true
And the dress she wears, sweet mama, it's pink and blue
She brings me coffee, she brings me tea
She brings me about every darn thing but the jailhouse key

[Chorus]
Don't ease, don't ease, don't ease me in
I've been all night long coming home, don't ease me in

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]

[Outro]
Don't ease, don't ease, don't ease me in
I've been all night long coming home, don't ease me in

Ah, you're too kind, too kind. Can you hear this stuff alright out there? Can't hear the guitars, you gotta turn the guitars up. Turn them up, turn them up, turn them, turn them up. What was that? Stop it, man. Eat it. Woo. We don't have to dignify your miserable heckling, do we?

[Chorus]
I know you, rider, gonna miss me when I'm gone
I know you, rider, gonna miss me when I'm gone
Gonna miss your baby, from rolling in your arms

[Verse 1]
Laid down last night, Lord, I could not take my rest
Laid down last night, Lord, I could not take my rest
My mind was wandering like the wild geese in the West

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
I know you, rider, gonna miss me when I'm gone
I know you, rider, gonna miss me when I'm gone
Gonna miss your baby, from rolling in your arms

[Verse 2]
I wish I was a headlight, on a northbound train
I wish I was a headlight, on a northbound train
I'd shine my light through the cool Colorado rain

[Verse 3]
The sun will shine in my back door someday
The sun will shine in my back door someday
March winds will blow all my troubles away

[Verse 4]
I'd rather drink muddy water, sleep in a hollow log
I'd rather drink muddy water, sleep in a hollow log
Than to stay here in Frisco, be treated like a dog

[Chorus]
I know you, rider, gonna miss me when I'm gone
I know you, rider, gonna miss me when I'm gone
Gonna miss your baby, from rolling in your arms

[Outro]
Thank you

[Verse 1]
Well, mama got the rub board, sister got the tub
They're going around doing the rub-de-rub

[Chorus]
Ain't it crazy? Ain't it crazy?
Ain't it crazy one day, to keep on rubbin' that thang

[Verse 2]
Two old maids, they was layin' in a bed
One turned over and this is what she said

[Chorus]
Ain't it crazy? Ain't it crazy?
Ain't it crazy one day, to keep on rubbin' that

[Harmonica solo]

[Verse 3]
Now, two old maids, they was sittin' in the sand
Each one thinking the other was a man

[Chorus]
Ain't it crazy? Ain't it crazy?
Ain't it crazy one day, to keep on rubbin' at that thang

[Verse 4]
You know, mama killed a chicken and thought it was a duck
Put him on the table with his feet sticking up

Ain't it crazy? Ain't it crazy?
Ain't it crazy one day, to keep on rubbin' that thang

[Harmonica solo]

[Verse 5]
Now, two old maids, they was sittin' in the sand
Each one thinking the other one's a man

[Outro]
Thank you

Yeah, we're, uh, we're kinda rearranging things, and while we're rearranging things, we're up here gonna relax and smoke a cigarette and have a good time. And you guys down there can casually talk amongst yourselves, and uh, generally have a good time also. (That is if you brought your lunch) (Cut your beard, Jerry) Shut up. No shit. The unkindest cut of all. I didn't ask you about your beard

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Dark star crashes
Pouring its light into ashes
Reason tatters
The forces tear loose from the axis
Searchlight casting
For faults in the clouds of delusion

[Refrain]
Shall we go
You and I while we can
Through
The transitive nightfall of diamonds

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Mirror shatters
In formless reflections of matter
Glass hand dissolving
In ice, petal flowers revolving
Lady in velvet recedes in the nights of goodbye

[Outro]
Shall we go
You and I while we can
Through
The transitive nightfall of diamonds

[Verse 1]
There's a long line of mourners winding down through our city
Their fancy cars are such a sight to see
They must be your rich friends that knew you in the city
And now they finally brought you back home to me

[Chorus]
The papers told of how you lost your life
Of the party and the fatal crash that night
The race out on the highway, the turn nobody seen
Now you're riding in that long black limousine

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
You said the day you left me that you would be returning
In a fancy car for all the town to see
Well now, you've finally come back
Yes, you've finally got your dream
Now you're riding in that long black limousine

[Chorus]
The papers told of how you lost your life
Of thе party and the fatal crash that night
The race out on thе highway, the turn nobody seen
Now you're riding in that long black limousine

[Outro]
Now you're riding in that long black limousine

Thank you

[Verse 1]
Please don't dominate the rap, Jack
If you've got nothing new to say
If you please, don't back up the track
This train has got to run today
I spent a little time on the mountain
I spent a little time on the hill
Heard some say: Better run away
Others say: You better stand still
Now I don't know but I was told
It's a hill to run with a plate of gold
Other hand I have heard it said
It's just as hard with the weight of lead

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
You can't overlook the lack, Jack
Of any other highway to ride
It's got no signs or dividing lines
And very few rules to guide
I spent a little time on the mountain
Spent a little time on the hill
I saw things getting out of hand
I guess they always will
I don't know but I was told
In the heat of the sun, a man died of cold
On the run and don't stand and wait
With the sun so dark and the hour so late

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Who can deny? Who can deny?
It's not just a change in style
One step done and another begun
And I wonder how many miles?
I spent a little time on the mountain
Spent a little time on the hill
Some things we don't understand
I guess they always will
I don't know but I was told
If the horse don't pull you got to carry the load
Don't know whose back's that strong
Maybe find out before too long

[Outro]
Ooh, one way or another
One way or another
One way or another
This darkness got to give
One way or another
One way or another
One way or another
This darkness got to give
One way or another
One way or another
One way or another
This darkness got to give
One way or another
One way or another
One way or another
This darkness got to give
One way or another
One way or another
One way or another
This darkness got to give

[Intro]
From San Francisco, The Dead
One, two, three, four

[Chorus]
Driving that train, high on cocaine
Casey Jones you better, watch your speed
Trouble ahead, trouble behind
And you know that notion just crossed my mind

[Verse 1]
This old engine
Makes it on time
Leaves Central Station
About a quarter to nine
Hits river junction
At seventeen to
At a quarter to ten
You know it's traveling again

[Chorus]
Driving that train, high on cocaine
Casey Jones you better, watch your speed
Trouble ahead, trouble behind
And you know that notion just crossed my mind

[Verse 2]
Trouble ahead
A lady in red
Take my advice
You'd be better off dead
Switch-man sleeping
Train hundred and two
Is on the wrong track
And headed for you

[Chorus]
Driving that train, high on cocaine
Casey Jones you better, watch your speed
Trouble ahead, trouble behind
And you know that notion just crossed my mind

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Trouble with you is
The trouble with me
Got two good eyes
Though we still don't see
Come 'round the bend
You know it's the end
The fireman screams
And the engine just gleams

[Chorus]
Driving that train, high on cocaine
Casey Jones you better, watch your speed
Trouble ahead, trouble behind
And you know that notion just crossed my mind
Driving that train, high on cocaine
Casey Jones you better, watch your speed
Trouble ahead, trouble behind
And you know that notion just crossed my mind
Driving that train, high on cocaine
Casey Jones you better, watch your speed
Trouble ahead, trouble behind
And you know that notion just crossed my mind
Driving that train, high on cocaine
Casey Jones you better, watch your speed
Trouble ahead, trouble behind
And you know that notion just crossed my mind

[Outro]
And you know that notion just crossed my mind

Alright, you people, you know who we are

[Verse 1]
Saint Stephen with a rose
In and out of the garden he goes
Country garland in the wind and the rain
Wherever he goes, the people all complain

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Stephen prospered in his time
Well, he may and he may decline
Did it matter? Does it now?
Stephen would answer if he only knew how

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Wishing well with a golden bell
Bucket hanging clear to Hell
Hell halfway 'twixt now and then
Stеphen fill it up and lower down
And lower down again

[Bridge]
Ladyfingеr dipped in moonlight
Writing "What for?" across the morning sky
Sunlight splatters dawn with answers
Darkness shrugs and bids the day goodbye
Speeding arrow, sharp and narrow
What a lot of fleeting matters you have spurned
Several seasons with their treasons
Wrap the babe in scarlet covers, call it your own

[Verse 4]
Did he doubt or did he try?
Answers aplenty in the bye and bye
Talk about your plenty, talk about your ills
One man gathers what another man spills

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
Saint Stephen will remain
All he lost he shall regain
Seashore washed by the suds and foam
Been here so long, he's got to calling it home
Fortune comes a crawlin', calliope woman
Spinnin' that curious sense of your own
Can you answer? Yes, I can
But what would be the answer to the answer man?

[Cryptical Envelopment/Quodlibet For Tender Feet]

[Verse]
The other day they waited, the sky was dark and faded
Solemnly they stated, "He has to die"
And all the children learnin', from books that they were burnin’
Every leaf was turnin'; to watch him die

The summer sun looked down on him, his mother could but frown on him
And all the others sound on him, but it doesn't seem to matter

And when the day had ended, with rainbow colors blended
His mind remained unbended, he had to die

[Drums]

[Instrumental Break]

[The Other One]

[Verse 1]
Spanish lady comes to me, she lays on me this rose
It rainbow spirals round and round it trembles and explodes
It left a smoking crater of my mind I like to blow away
But the heat came ’round and busted me for smiling on a cloudy day

[Chorus]
Comin', comin', comin' around (Comin' around)
Comin' around (Comin' around)
Comin' (Comin’), comin’ (Comin'), comin’ around (Comin' around)
Comin' around (Comin' around)

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Skippin’ through the lily fields I came across an empty space
It trembled and exploded, left a bus stop in its place
The bus come by and I got on, that's when it all began
There was Cowboy Neal at the wheel of the bus to Never Ever Land

[Chorus]
Comin', comin', comin' around (Comin' around)
Comin' around (Comin' around)
Comin' (Comin'), comin' (Comin'), comin' around (Comin' around)
Comin' around (Comin' around)

[Cryptical Envelopment Reprise]

[Outro]
And when the day had ended, with rainbow colors blended
Their minds remained unbended
He had to die

[Instrumental Break]

You know he had to die, he had to die
You know he had to die, you know he had to die
You know he had to die, you know he had to die

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Cosmic Charlie, how do you do?
Trucking in style along the avenue
Dum de dum de doodley do
Go on home, your mama's calling you

Kalico, Kahlia, come tell me the news
Calamity's waiting for a way to get to her
Rosy red and electric blue
I bought you a paddle for your paper canoe

[Bridge]
Say you'll come back when you can
Whenever your airplane happens to land
Maybe I'll be back here, too
It all depends on what's with you

[Verse 2]
Hung up waiting on a windy day
Kite on ice since the first of February
Mama keeps saying that the wind might blow
But standing hеre I say I just don't know
New ones coming as thе old ones go
Everything's moving here but much too slowly
A little bit quicker and we might have time
To say "how do you do" before we're left behind
Calliope wail like a seaside zoo
The very last lately inquired about you
It's really very one or two
The first you wanted, the last I knew

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
I just wonder if you shouldn't feel
Less concerned about the people unreal
The very first word is, "How do you do?"
The last, "Go home, your mama's calling you"

[Outro]
Calling you, calling you
Calling you, calling you
Calling you, calling you

[Instrumental Break]

(Calling you)
Go on home, your mama's calling you (Calling you)
Go home, your mama's calling you (Calling you)
Go on home, your mama's calling you (Calling you)
Go on home (Calling you)
Go on home, your mama's calling you

[Chorus]
I was born in a desert, raised in a lion's den
I was born in a desert, raised in a lion's den
My number one occupation
Is stealing women from their men

[Verse 1]
If you're ever in Memphis
Yeah, take a walk by Minglewood
If you're ever in Memphis
Yeah, take a walk by Minglewood
Hey now, take a walk downtown there
Where all the women sure look good
Wow

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Well, if you can't believe me
Wеll, it make it hard to believе in you
Well, if you can't believe me
Make it hard to believe in you
Hey, 'cause we all need each other
Why? Oh, you know it's true

[Chorus]
Ah, I was born in a desert, raised in a lion's den
And I was born in a desert, raised in a lion's den
And my number one occupation
Is stealing women from their men
Wow

Wow, I was born in a desert, raised in a lion's den
Yeah, I was born in a desert, wow, raised in a lion's den
Yeah, my number one occupation

Can't hear the guitars, man

If you go down to Deep Elem to have a little fun
Have your ten dollars when the policemen come

[Chorus]
Whoa, sweet mama, your daddy's got them Deep Elem blues
Whoa, whoa, sweet mama, your daddy's got them Deep Elem blues

[Verse 2]
Once I had a girlfriend, she meant the world to me
Went down to Deep Elem, now she ain't what she used to be

[Chorus]
Whoa, sweet mama, your daddy's got them Deep Elem blues
Whoa, sweet mama, your daddy's got them Deep Elem blues

[Verse 3]
If you go down to Deep Elem with your money in your shoes
The women in Deep Elem got thеm Deep Elem blues

Well, once I knew a preacher, preached the Bible through-and-through
He went down to Deep Elem, now his preachin' days are through

[Chorus]
Whoa, sweet mama, your daddy's got them Deep Elem blues
Whoa, sweet mama, your daddy's got them Deep Elem blues

[Verse 5]
Go down to Deep Elem to have a little fun
Have your ten dollars ready when the old policemen come

Casey Jones was a great engineer
Call for his family tonight, they will fear
All I need is my water and coal
Look out the windows, see my drag wheel roll
One Sunday morning in a driving rain
Around the curve come a passenger train
In the cabin stood Casey Jones
Bold engineer but he's dead and gone

[Verse 2]
Mrs. Casey when she heard the news
Sitting by her bedside she was lacing up her shoes
Children, children now hold your breath
You will draw a pension in your daddy's dead
Children, children, now can you hear?
Tell me Mama what do you mean by that?
Get your hat, put it on your head
Go down in town, see your daddy is dead

[Verse 3]
Casey said just before he died
Fix the blinds so that the bums can ride
If they ride, let them ride the rung
Put their trust in the hand of God
Casey said just before he died
Two more roads that I want to ride
People said, what roads can they be?
Gold Colorado and the Santa Fe

[Outro]
(Shut up) Now, now, kids, don't fight

[Verse 1]
I grew up in faded gingham
Where love is a sacred thing
You grew up in silk and satin
Where love's a passing game
I know now you never loved me
Oh, I know I was just a fool
To think your pride would let you
Play love by the Golden Rule

[Chorus]
Silver threads and golden needles cannot mend this heart of mine
And I dare drown my sorrow in the warm glow of your wine
You can't buy my love with money 'cause I ain't never been that kind
Silver threads and golden needles cannot mend this heart of mine

[Verse 2]
I don't want your lonely mansion with a tear in every room
All I want's the love you've promised once beneath that haloed moon
But you think I should be happy with your money and your name
Sit alone and hide my sorrows while you play love's cheatin' game

[Chorus]
Silver threads and golden needles cannot mend this heart of mine
And I dare drown my sorrow in the warm glow of your wine
You can't buy my love with money 'cause I ain't never been that kind
Silver threads and golden needles cannot mend this heart of mine
Silver threads and golden needles cannot mend this heart of mine
And I dare drown my sorrow in the warm glow of your wine
You can't buy my love with money 'cause I ain't never been that kind
Silver threads and golden needles cannot mend this heart of mine

[Outro]
Ah, thank you

[Verse 1]
All of my friends come to see me last night
I was laying in my bed and dying
Annie Beauneau from Saint Angel
Say "The weather down here so fine"

[Verse 2]
Just then the wind
Came squalling through the door
But who can the weather command?
Just wanna have a little peace to die
And a friend or two I love at hand

[Verse 3]
Fever rolled up to a hundred and five
Roll on up
Gonna roll back down
One more day
I find myself alive
Tomorrow
Maybe go
Beneath the ground

[Bridge]
See herе how everything
Lead up to this day
And it's just likе any other day
That's ever been
Sun going up and then
The sun, it going down
Shine through my window
And my friends they come around
Come around
Come around

[Outro]
The people may know
But the people don't care
That a man could be as poor as me
Take a look at poor Peter
He's lying in pain
Now let's go run and see
Run and see
Run and see
Yeah, run and see

Thank you

Got a request to do this here, we did this in the first show and we're gonna do it again now. Thus breaking a longstanding tradition; we love breaking traditions

[Verse 1]
I lit out from Reno, I was trailed by twenty hounds
Didn't get to sleep last night 'til the morning came around

[Chorus]
I set out runnin' but I take my time
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine
If I get home before daylight
I just might get some sleep tonight

[Verse 2]
I ran into the devil, he loaned me twenty bills
I spent the night in Utah in a cave up in the hills

[Chorus]
I set out runnin' but I take my time
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine
If I get home before daylight
I just might gеt some sleep tonight

[Verse 3]
Ran down to the levee but thе devil caught me there
He took my twenty dollar bill and vanished in the air

[Chorus]
I set out runnin' but I take my time
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine
If I get home before daylight
I just might get some sleep tonight

[Bridge]
Got two reasons why I cry away each lonely night:
The first one's named sweet Anne Marie, and she's my heart's delight
The second one is prison, baby, the sheriff's on my trail
And if he catches up with me, I'll spend my life in jail

[Verse 4]
Got a wife in Chino, babe, and one in Cherokee
First one say she's got my child, but it don't look like me

[Chorus]
Set out runnin' but I take my time
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine
If I get home before daylight
I just might get some sleep tonight

'Cause when life looks like Easy Street
There is danger at your door
Think this through with me
Let me know your mind
Whoa-oh, what I want to know
Is are you kind?

[Verse 2]
It's a buck dancer's choice, my friends
Better take my advice
You know all the rules by now
And the fire from the ice
Will you come with me?
Won't you come with me?
Whoa-oh, what I want to know
Will you come with me?

[Bridge]
Goddamn, well, I declare
Have you seen the like?
Thеir walls are built of cannon balls
Their motto is don't tread on mе

Come hear Uncle John's Band
Playing to the tide
Come with me or go alone
He's come to take his children home

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
It's the same story the crow told me
It's the only one he know
Like the morning sun you come
And like the wind you go
Ain't no time to hate
Barely time to wait
Whoa-oh, what I want to know
Where does the time go?

[Verse 4]
I live in a silver mine
And I call it "Beggar's Tomb"
I got me a violin
And I beg you call the tune
Anybody's choice
I can hear your voice
Whoa-oh, what I want to know
How does the song go?

[Chorus]
Come hear Uncle John's Band

But she's mine
She's mine
She's mine
She's mine and she's little and low, crippled, and she's blind

[Verse 2]

Yeah, she mine if she's little and low, crippled, if she blind

Well, you know Katie Mae is a good girl
Folks say she don't run around at night
Yes, you know Katie Mae is a good girl
Folks say she don't run around at night

Katie Mae will treat you right

[Verse 2]
Yes, you know, some folks say she must be a Cadillac
But I know she's got to be a T-model ford
Yes, you know some folks say she must be a Cadillac
But I say she must be a T-model ford
'Cause you know she got the shape alright
But she can't truck no heavy load

[Verse 3]
I tried to give that woman everything in the world shе needs
That's why she don't do nothin' but lay up in the bed and rеad
And know when she walks through life
She got oil wells in her backyard
Sometime I think she do when you run
Yeah, but you never had a woman hootin', hollerin', and cryin'
Talking about these times being hard

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
So I say goodbye, goodbye poor Katie, all I got to say
I say goodbye, goodbye poor Katie, last words I got to say
Yes, you know if I don't get next to you tomorrow
I'm gon' ride that freight train early next day

Thank you

Soon as everything is perfectly cool in New York City

[Chorus]
I hear a voice callin'
It must be our Lord (It must be, it must be our Lord)
It's coming from heaven on high
I hear a voice callin'
I've gained a reward (I've gained, I've gained a reward)
For the land where we never shall die

[Verse 1]
Jesus who died on cruel Calvary
He shed His life blood that the world might be free
So follow His footsteps, up the narrow way
And be ready to meet Him when He calls on that day

[Chorus]
I hear a voice callin'
It must be our Lord (It must be, it must bе our Lord)
It's coming from heaven on high
I hear a voicе callin'
I've gained a reward (I've gained, I've gained a reward)
For the land where we never shall die

[Verse 2]
The savior has paid a great price for me
He shed His life blood that the world might be free
So follow His footsteps, up the narrow way
And be ready to meet Him when He calls on that day

[Chorus]
I hear a voice callin'
It must be our Lord (It must be, it must be our Lord)
It's coming from heaven on high
I hear a voice callin'
I've gained a reward (I've gained, I've gained a reward)
For the land where we never shall die

Set two, group three, take one, The Grateful Dead

[Verse 1]
Look for a while at the china cat sunflower
Proud walking jingle in the midnight sun
Copperdome bodhi drip a silver kimono
Like a crazy quilt stargown through a dream night wind

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Krazy Kat peeking through a lace bandanna
Like a one-eyed cheshire, like a diamond-eye jack
A leaf of all colors plays a golden-string fiddle
To a double-e waterfall all over my back

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Comic book colors on a violin river crying a lot of
Words from out a silk trombone
I rang a silent bell, beneath a shower of pearls
In the eagle-winged palace of the Queen Chinee

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
I know you, rider, gonna miss me when I'm gone
I know you, rider, gonna miss me when I'm gone
Gonna miss your baby, from rolling in your arms

[Verse 1]
Laid down last night, Lord, I could not take my rest
Laid down last night, Lord, I could not take my rest
My mind was wandering like the wild geese in the West

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
The sun will shine in my back door someday
The sun will shine in my back door someday
March winds will blow all my troubles away

[Verse 3]
I wish I was a headlight, on a northbound train
I wish I was a headlight, on a northbound train
I'd shine my light through the cool Colorado rain

[Chorus]
I know you, rider, gonna miss me when I'm gone
I know you, rider, gonna miss me when I'm gone
Gonna miss your baby, from rolling in your arms

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
I know you, rider, gonna miss me when I'm gone
I know you, rider, gonna miss me when I'm gone
Gonna miss your baby, from rolling in your arms
Yeah

[Verse 1]
I can't stay much longer, Melinda, the sun is getting high
I can't help you with your troubles, if you won't help with mine
I gotta get down, I gotta get down, I gotta get down to, to the mine

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
You keep me up just one more night, I can't sleep here no more
Little Ben clock says quarter to eight; you kept me up 'til four
I gotta get down, I gotta get down, or I can't work there no more

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
A lot of poor man make a five dollar bill, keep him happy all the time
Some other fella's making nothing at all, and you can hear him cry
"Can I go, buddy, can I go down take your shift at the mine?"

[Chorus]
Gotta get down to thе Cumberland mine
Gotta get down to thе Cumberland mine
That's where I mainly spend my time
Make good money, five dollars a day
Made anymore, I might move away

[Outro]
Lotta poor man got the Cumberland blues, he can't win for losing
Lotta poor man got to walk the line just to pay his union dues
I don't know now, I just don't know if I'm going back again
I don't know now, I just don't know if I'm going back again
I don't know now, I just don't know if I'm going back again
Ah-hoo

[Verse 1]
Walk me out in the morning dew, my honey
Walk me out in the morning dew today
I can't walk you out in the morning dew, my honey
I can't walk you out in the morning dew today

[Verse 2]
I thought I heard a baby cry this morning
I thought I heard a baby cry today
You didn't hear no baby cry this morning
You didn't hear no baby cry today

[Verse 3]
Where have all the people gone, my honey?
Where have all the people gone today?
There's no need for you to be worrying about all those people
You never see those people anyway

[Verse 4]
I thought I hеard a young man mourn this morning
I thought I heard a young man mourn today
Didn't hear no young man mourn this morning
I can't walk you out in the morning dеw today

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 5]
Walk me out in the morning dew, my honey
Walk me out in the morning dew today
I'll walk you out in the morning dew, my honey

I guess it doesn't matter anyway

[Verse 1]
In the timbers of Fennario
The wolves are running 'round
The winter was so hard and cold
Froze ten feet 'neath the ground

[Chorus]
Don't murder me
I beg of you, don't murder me
Please don't murder me

[Verse 2]
I sat down to my supper
It was a bottle of red whiskey
I said my prayers and went to bed
That's the last they saw of me

[Chorus]
Don't murder me
I beg of you, don't murder me
Please don't murder me

[Verse 3]
When I awoke, the dire wolf
Six hundred pounds of sin
Was grinning at my window
All I said was, "Come on in"

[Chorus]
But don't murder me
I beg of you, don't murder me
Please don't murder me

[Verse 4]
The wolf came in, I got my cards
We sat down for a game
I cut my deck to the Queen of Spades
But the cards were all the same

[Chorus]
Don't murder me
I beg of you, don't murder me
Please don't murder me

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 5]
In the backwash of Fennario
The black and bloody mire
The dire wolf collects his due
While the boys sing around the fire

[Chorus]
Don't murder me
I beg of you, don't murder me
Please don't murder me

[Outro]
Don't murder me
I beg of you, don't murder me
Please don't murder me
Don't murder me
I beg of you, don't murder me
Please don't murder me
No, no, no
Don't murder me
I beg of you, don't murder me
Please don't murder me
Please don't murder me

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Well, I was feeling so bad
Asked my family doctor about what I had
Say, "Doctor (Doctor), Mister M.D. (Doctor)
Can you tell me (Doctor), what's ailing me?" (Doctor)

[Chorus]
And he said, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah"
All I need, all I need (Good lovin’)
And all I need is lovin' (Good lovin')
Early in the morning, baby (Good lovin’)
Late in the evening now now (Good lovin')

[Verse 2]
Come on, baby, squeeze me tight
Don't you want your daddy just to be alright?
I say baby (Baby), that's for sure (Baby)
I've got the fever (Baby), you got the cure (Baby)

[Chorus]
And she said, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah"
All I need, all I need (Good lovin')

Early in the morning, baby (Good lovin’)
Late in the evening now now (Good lovin’)

[Instrumental Break]

OW!

[Verse 1]
Saint Stephen with a rose
In and out of the garden he goes
Country garland in the wind and the rain
Wherever he goes, the people all complain

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Stephen prospered in his time
Well, he may and he may decline
Did it matter? Does it now?
Stephen would answer if he only knew how

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Wishing well with a golden bell
Bucket hanging clear to Hell
Hell halfway 'twixt now and then
Stеphen fill it up and lower down
And lower down again

[Bridge]
Ladyfingеr dipped in moonlight
Writing "What for?" across the morning sky
Sunlight splatters dawn with answers
Darkness shrugs and bids the day goodbye
Speeding arrow, sharp and narrow
What a lot of fleeting matters you have spurned
Several seasons with their treasons
Wrap the babe in scarlet covers, call it your own

[Verse 4]
Did he doubt or did he try?
Answers aplenty in the bye and bye
Talk about your plenty, talk about your ills
One man gathers what another man spills

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
Saint Stephen will remain
All he lost he shall regain
Seashore washed by the suds and foam
Been here so long, he's got to calling it home
Fortune comes a crawlin', calliope woman
Spinnin' that curious sense of your own
Can you answer? Yes, I can
But what would be the answer to the answer man?

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
I wanna tell you how it's gonna be
You're gonna give your love to me
I wanna love you night and day
You know our love will not fade away
You know our love will not fade away
Not fade away

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
My love is bigger than a Cadillac
I try to show you but you drive me back
Your love for me has got to be real
You're gonna know just how I feel
Our love is real, not fade away
Not fade away

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Oh, sinning is a gentilized journey, take Jesus as your daily guide
Though you may feel pure and saintly without Him walking by your side
But when you come to make your crossing at the end of the pilgrim's way
If you ever will meet your savior, you will surely meet him on that day

[Chorus]
Now look at that cold Jordan, look at its deep water
Look at that wide river, oh heavy mighty billows roll
You better take Jesus with you, He's a true companion
Oh, I'm sure without him that you never will make it home

[Verse 2]
That awful day of judgment is coming in the by and by
We'll see our Lord descending in the glory from on high
Oh, let us get in touch with Jesus and in the prеcious love of God
And maybe evеr get ready when He comes on Jordan's tide

[Chorus]
Now look at that cold Jordan, look at its deep water
Look at that wide river, oh heavy mighty billows roll
You better take Jesus with you, He's a true companion
Oh, I'm sure without him that you never will make it home

[Outro]
Now what you gonna do
Oh, what you gonna say
Oh, how you gonna feel when you come to the end of the way?

Good night

[Verse 1]
When they come to take you down
When they bring that wagon 'round
When they come to call on you
And drag your poor body down

[Pre-Chorus]
Just one thing I ask of you, just one thing for me
Please forget you knew my name, my darling Sugaree

[Chorus]
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell 'em you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell 'em you know me

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
You thought you was the cool fool
Never could do no wrong
You had everything sewn up tight
How come you lay awake all night long?

[Pre-Chorus]
Just one thing I ask of you, just one thing for me
Please forget you knew my name, my darling Sugaree

[Chorus]
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell 'em you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell 'em you know me

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
You know in spite of all you gained
You still had to stand out in the pouring rain
One last voice is calling you
And I guess it's time to go

[Pre-Chorus]
Just one thing I ask of you, just one thing for me
Please forget you knew my name, my darling Sugaree

[Chorus]
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell 'em you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell 'em you know me

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
Shake it up now, Sugaree
I'll meet you at the Jubilee
And if that Jubilee don't come
Maybe I'll meet you on the run

[Pre-Chorus]
Just one thing I ask of you, just one thing for me
Please forget you knew my name, my darling Sugaree

[Chorus]
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell 'em you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell 'em you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell 'em you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell 'em you know me

[Verse 1]
The first thing I remember knowing
Was a lonesome whistle blowing
And a youngin's dream of growing up to ride
On a freight train leaving town
Not knowing where I'm bound
No one could steer me right but Mama tried
One and only rebel child
From a family meek and mild
Mama seemed to know what lay in store
In spite of all my Sunday learning
Towards the bad I kept on turning
'Til Mama couldn't hold me anymore

[Chorus]
And I turned twenty-one in prison doing life without parole
No one could steer me right, but Mama tried, Mama tried
Mama tried to raise me better, but her pleading I denied
That leaves no one but me to blame 'cause Mama tried

[Verse 2]
Dear old Daddy, rest his soul
Left my mom a heavy load
She tried so very hard to fill his shoes
Working hours without rest
She wanted me to have the best
She tried to raise me right but I refused

[Chorus]
And I turned twenty-one in prison doing life without parole
No one could steer me right, but Mama tried, Mama tried
Mama tried to raise me better, but her pleading I denied
That leaves no one but me to blame 'cause Mama tried

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
And I turned twenty-one in prison doing life without parole
No one could steer me right, but Mama tried, Mama tried
Mama tried to raise me better, but her pleading I denied
That leaves no one but me to blame 'cause Mama tried

[Outro]
That leaves no one but me to blame 'cause Mama tried

[Verse 1]
Laid back in an old saloon with a peso in my hand
Watching flies and children on the street
And I catch a glimpse of black-eyed girls who giggle when I smile
There's a little boy that wants to shine my feet
And it's a three days ride from Bakersfield and I don't know why I came
I guess I came to keep from paying dues
So instead I've got a bottle and a girl that's just fourteen
And a damn good case of the Mexicali Blues, yeah

[Chorus]
Is there anything a man don't stand to lose
When the devil wants to take it all away?
Cherish well your thoughts, and keep a tight grip on your booze
'Cause thinkin' and drinkin' are all I have today

[Verse 2]
Wеll, she said her name was Billiе Jean and she was fresh in town
I didn't know a stage line ran from Hell
She had raven hair, a ruffled dress, a necklace made of gold
All the French perfume you'd care to smell
She took me up into her room and whispered in my ear
"Go on, my friend, do anything you choose"
Now I'm payin' for those happy hours I spent there in her arms
With a lifetime's worth of the Mexicali Blues, yeah

[Chorus]
Is there anything a man don't stand to lose
When the devil wants to take it all away?
Cherish well your thoughts, and keep a tight grip on your booze
'Cause thinkin' and drinkin' are all I have today

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Well, then a man rode into town, some thought he was the law
Billie Jean was waiting when he came
She told me he would take her, if I didn't use my gun
But I'd have no one but myself to blame
I went down to those dusty streets, blood was on my mind
I guess that stranger hadn't heard the news
'Cause I shot first and killed him, Lord, he didn't even draw
Now I'll spend my lifetime running with the Mexicali Blues, yeah

[Outro]
Is there anything a man don't stand to lose
When he lets a woman hold him in her hands?
You just might find yourself out there on horseback in the dark
Just riding and running across those desert sands, yeah

[Verse 1]
Julie catch a rabbit by his hair
Come back stepping, like to walk on air
Get back home where you belong
And don't you come 'round no more

Don't hang your head, let the two time roll
Grass shack nailed to a pine wood floor
Ask the time, baby, I don't know
Come back later, gonna let it show

[Chorus]
And I say row, Jimmy, row
Gonna get there? I don't know
Seems a common way to go
Get down and row
Row, row, row, row

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Here's a half dollar if you dare
Double twist when you hit the air
Look at Julie, down below
The levee doing the do-pas-o

[Chorus]
And I say row, Jimmy, row
Gonna get there? I don't know
Seems a common way to go
Get down and row
Row, row, row, row

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Broken hеart don't feel so bad
You ain't got half of what you thought you had
Rock your baby to and fro
Not too fast, and not too slow

[Chorus]
I say row, Jimmy, row
Gonna get there? I don't know
Seems a common way to go
Gеt down and row
Row, row, row, row

[Bridge]
That's the way it's been in town
Ever since they tore the jukebox down
Two-bit piece don't buy no more
Not so much as it done before

[Chorus]
And I say row, Jimmy, row
Gonna get there? I don't know
Seems a common way to go
Get down and row
Row, row, row, row
And I say row, Jimmy, row
Gonna get there? I don't know
Seems a common way to go
Get down and row
Row, row, row, row
And I say row, Jimmy, row
Gonna get there? I don't know
Seems a common way to go
Get down and row
Row, row, row, row

[Outro]
Get down and row
Row, row, row, row
Oh, get down, row
Row, row, row, row

One of Jerry's speakers just gave its all for rock and roll so we're gonna change it

Well now baby used to stay out all night long
Made me cry, Lord, she done me wrong
Hurt my eyes open, baby, that's no lie
Tables turnin', now it's her turn to cry

[Chorus]
'Cause I used to love her, but it's all over now (Said it's over)
You see, I used to love her, but it's all over now (Over now)

[Verse 2]
Lord, I used to wake up in the morning, get my breakfast in bed
When I got worried, you know she eased my achin' head
But now she's here and therе with every man in town
Still tryin' to take mе for that same old clown

[Chorus]
'Cause I used to love her, but it's all over now (Said it's over)
You see, I used to love her, but it's all over now

[Instrumental Break]

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
You told me goodbye, how was I to know
You didn't mean goodbye, you meant please don't let me go

[Chorus]
I was having a high time, livin' the good life, aaah
Well, you know

[Verse 2]
The wheels are muddy, got a ton of hay
Now don't think too hard, baby, 'cause I mean what I say

[Chorus]
I'm having a hard time, livin' the good life, aaah
Don't be that way

[Bridge]
I was losing time, I had nothing to do
No one to fight, I came to you
Wheels broke down, the leader won't draw
The line is busted, the last one I saw

[Verse 3]
Tomorrow come trouble, tomorrow come pain
Now don't think too hard, baby, 'cause you know what I'm saying

[Chorus]
I could show you a high time, livin' the good life, aaah
Well, you know

[Verse 4]
Nothing's for certain, it could always go wrong
Comе on in when it's raining, go on out when it's gone

[Chorus]
Wе could have us a high time, livin' the good life, aaah
Don't be that way

[Verse 1]
There's mosquitoes on the river
Fish are rising up like birds
It's been hot for seven weeks now
Too hot to even speak now
Did you hear what I just heard?
It might have been a fiddle
Or it could have been the wind (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
But there seems to be a beat now (Ooh)
I can feel it my feet now (Ooh)
Here it comes again

[Pre-Chorus]
There's a band out on the highway
They're high-stepping into town
It's a rainbow full of sound
It's fireworks, calliopes and clowns
Everybody's dancing

[Chorus]
Come on children, come on children
Come on and clap your hands

[Verse 2]
Well, the sun went down in honеy
And the moon came up in wine
Wеll, the stars were spinning dizzy
Lord, the band kept us so busy
We forgot about the time
They're a band beyond description
Like Jehovah's favorite choir
People joining hand in hand
While the music played the band
Lord, they're setting us on fire
Crazy rooster crowing midnight (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Balls of lighting roll along (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Old men sing about their dreams (Ooh)
Women laugh and children scream (Ooh)
And the band keeps playing on

[Pre-Chorus]
Keep on dancing through the daylight
Greet the morning air with song
No one's noticed, but the band's all packed and gone
Were they ever here at all?
But they kept on dancing

[Chorus]
Come on children, come on children
Come on and clap your hands

[Outro]
Well, the cool breeze came on Tuesday
And the corn's a bumper crop
And the fields are full of dancing
Full of singing and romancing
The music never stopped

[Instrumental]

Thank y'all. We're gonna take a short break. We'll be back in a few minutes so everybody hang loose

[Verse 1]
Thirty-two teeth in a jawbone
Alabama's tryin' for none
Before I have to hit him
I hope he's got the sense to run
Reason the poor girls love him
Promise them everything
Why they all believe him?
He wears a big diamond ring

[Chorus]
Alabama getaway, getaway
Alabama getaway, getaway
Only way to please me
Just get down and leave and walk away

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Majordomo Billy Bojangles
Sat down and had a drink with me
Said what about Alabama
That keeps a-coming back to me?
I heard your plea in the courthouse
Witness box began to rock and risе
Forty-nine sister states
Had Alabama in thеir eyes

[Chorus]
Alabama getaway, getaway
Alabama getaway, getaway
Only way to please me
Just get down and leave and walk away

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Major said why don't we give him
Rope enough to hang himself
No need to worry the jury
They'll probably take care of themselves
Twenty-third Psalm Majordomo
Reserve me a table for three
Down in the Valley of the Shadow
Just you, Alabama and me

[Chorus]
Alabama getaway, getaway
Alabama getaway, getaway
Only way to please me
Just get down and leave and walk away
Alabama getaway, getaway
Alabama getaway, getaway
Only way to please me
Just get down and leave and walk away

Only way to please me
Just get down and leave and walk away
Alabama getaway, getaway
Alabama getaway, getaway
Only way to please me
Just get down and leave and walk away

[Verse 1]
Moses come riding up on a quasar
His spurs were jingling, the door was ajar
His buckle was silver, his manner was bold
I asked him to come on in out of the cold

[Pre-Chorus]
His brain was boiling, his reason was spent
If nothing is borrowed, nothing is lent
I asked him for mercy, he gave me a gun
Now and again, these things just got to be done

[Chorus]
Abraham and Isaac sitting on a fence
You'd get right to work if you had any sense
You know the one thing we need is a left-hand monkey wrench

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Gideon come in with his eyes on the floor
Said, "You ain't got a hinge, you can't close thе door"
Moses stood up, a full six-foot-ten
Said, "You can't close thе door when the wall's caved in"

[Pre-Chorus]
Asked him for water, he poured me some wine
We finished the bottle and broke into mine
You get what you come for, you're ready to go
And it's more than ten thousand that come for the show

[Chorus]
Abraham and Isaac diggin' on a well
Mama come quick with the water witch spell
Cool clear water well, you can't ever tell

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
Abraham and Isaac sitting on a fence
You'd get right to work if you had any sense
You know the one thing we need is a left-hand monkey wrench

[Verse 1]
Some folks trust to reason
Others trust to might
I don't trust nothing
But I know it come out right
Say it once again now
Oh, I hope you understand
When it's done and over
Lord, a man is just a man

[Chorus]
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on the land

[Verse 2]
Now some folks look for answers
Others look for fights
Some folks up in treetops
Just looking for their kites
Well, I can tell your future
Oh, look what's in your hand
But I can't stop for nothing
I'm just playing in the band

[Chorus]
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on the land

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Standing on a tower
World at my command
You just keep turning
While I'm playing in the band
And if a man among you
Got no sin upon his hand
Let him cast a stone at me
For playing in the band

[Chorus]
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on the land

[Instrumental]

[Lady with a Fan]

[Verse 1]
Let my inspiration flow
In token rhyme suggesting rhythm
That will not forsake me
'Til my tale is told and done

While the firelight's aglow
Strange shadows from the flames will grow
'Til things we've never seen
Will seem familiar

Shadows of a sailor forming
Winds both foul and fair all swarm
Down in Carlisle, he loved a lady
Many years ago

Here beside him stands a man
A soldier from the looks of him
Who came through many fights
But lost at love
While the storyteller speaks
A door within the fire creaks
Suddenly flies open
And a girl is standing therе

Eyes alight with glowing hair
All that fancy paints as fair
She takes hеr fan and throws it
In the lion's den

"Which of you to gain me, tell
Will risk uncertain pains of hell?
I will not forgive you
If you will not take the chance"

The sailor gave at least a try
The soldier being much too wise
Strategy was his strength
Not disaster

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
The sailor coming out again
The lady fairly leapt at him
That's how it stands today
You decide if he was wise
The storyteller makes no choice
Soon you will not hear his voice
His job is to shed light
Not to master

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
Since the end is never told
We pay the teller off in gold
In hopes he will come back
But he cannot be bought or sold

[Terrapin Station]

[Verse]
Inspiration move me brightly
Light the song with sense and color
Hold away despair
More than this I will not ask
Faced with mysteries dark and vast
Statements just seem vain at last
Some rise, some fall, some climb
To get to Terrapin

Counting stars by candlelight
All are dim but one is bright:
The spiral light of Venus
Rising first and shining best
Oh, from the northwest corner
Of a brand new crescent moon
Crickets and cicadas sing
A rare and different tune

[Outro]
Terrapin Station
In the shadow of the moon
Terrapin Station
And I know we'll be there soon
Terrapin - I can't figure out
Terrapin - If it's the end or beginning
Terrapin - But the train's put its brakes on
Terrapin - And the whistle is screaming: Terrapin

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
The first days are the hardest days
Don't you worry anymore
’Cause when life looks like Easy Street
There is danger at your door
Think this through with me
Let me know your mind
Whoa-oh, what I want to know
Is are you kind?

[Verse 2]
It's a buck dancer's choice, my friends
Better take my advice
You know all the rules by now
And the fire from the ice
Will you come with me?
Won’t you come with me?
Whoa-oh, what I want to know
Will you come with me?

[Bridge]
Goddamn, well, I declare
Have you seen the like?
Their walls arе built of cannon balls
Their motto is don't tread on me

[Chorus]
Comе hear Uncle John's Band
Playing to the tide
Come with me or go alone
He's come to take his children home

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
It's the same story the crow told me
It's the only one he know
Like the morning sun you come
And like the wind you go
Ain't no time to hate
Barely time to wait
Whoa-oh, what I want to know
Where does the time go?

[Verse 4]
I live in a silver mine
And I call it "Beggar's Tomb"
I got me a violin
And I beg you call the tune
Anybody’s choice
I can hear your voice
Whoa-oh, what I want to know
How does the song go?

[Chorus]
Come hear Uncle John’s Band
By the riverside
Got some things to talk about
Here beside the rising tide
Come hear Uncle John's Band
Playing to the tide
Come on along or go alone
He’s come to take his children home

[Instrumental Break]

[Refrain]
Whoa-oh, what I want to know
How does the song go?

[Chorus]
Come hear Uncle John's Band
By the riverside
Got some things to talk about
Here beside the rising tide
Come hear Uncle John's Band
Playing to the tide
Come on along or go alone
He's come to take his children home

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
I need a woman about twice my age
A lady of nobility, gentility and rage
Splendor in the dark, lightning on the draw
We'll go right through the book and break each and every law

[Chorus]
I got a feeling, feeling today, yeah
Just one thing that I got to say
I need a miracle every day

[Verse 2]
I need a woman about twice my height
Statuesque, raven-dressed, a goddess of the night
Her secret incantations, a candle burning blue
Raise up the spirits, maybe they'll know what to do

[Chorus]
And it's real, believe what I say, oh yeah
Can't run around, and I can't run away
I need a miracle every day

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
I need a woman about twice my weight
A ton of fun who packs a gun with all her other freight
Find her in a sideshow, leave her in L.A
Ride her like a surfer riding on a tidal wave

[Chorus]
And it's real, believe what I say, oh yeah
Just one thing that I got to say
I need a miracle every day
... to get me up
Too much of everything just ain't enough
One more thing that I got to say
I need a miracle every day

[Outro]
I need a miracle every day (Every day)
I need a miracle every day (Ooh, every day)
I need a miracle every day (Yeah, yeah)
I need a miracle (Some kind of miracle), I need a miracle (Some kind of miracle)
I need a miracle every day (Hey, hey, I need a miracle)
I need a miracle every day (Lord know just what I'm talking about, yeah)
I need a miracle every day (Hey, yeah, hey, yeah)
I need a miracle (Yeah), I need a miracle

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
I had a hard run
Running from your window
I was all night running
Lord, I wonder if you care
I had a run-in
Run around and run down
Run around a corner
Lord, I run smack into a tree

[Chorus]
I had to move
Really had to move
That's why if you please
I am on my bended knees
Bertha, don't you come around here anymore

[Verse 2]
Dressed myself in green
I went down under the sea
Try to see what's going down
And try to read between the lines
I had a feeling I was falling, falling
I turned around to see
Heard a voice calling
But it's running back to me

[Chorus]
I had to move
Really had to move
That's why if you please
I am on my bended knees
Bertha, don't you come around here anymore

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Ran into a rainstorm
I ducked back into a bar door
It was all night pouring
Lord, but not a drop on me
Test me, test me
Why don't you arrest me?
Throw me in the jailhouse
Until the sun goes down
'Til it go down

[Chorus]
I had to move
Really had to move
That's why if you please
I am on my bended knees
Bertha, don't you come around here anymore
I had to move
Really had to move
That's why if you please
I am on my bended knees
Bertha, don't you come around here anymore

[Outro]
I had to move
Really had to move
That's why if you please
I am on my bended knees
Bertha, don't you come around here anymore
Anymore, anymore, anymore, anymore
Anymore, anymore, anymore, anymore
Anymore, anymore, anymore, anymore
Anymore

[Verse 1]
Well, I was feeling oh so bad, y'all

So come on, turn on your light
Ooh, got to have lovin'
Ooh, got to have lovin'

Thank you

[Verse 1]
Dreaming your whole life away
You never know what's comin'
You live from day to day
Spend all your time making sure you look just right
Someone asked you a question, but you don't even have the time

[Chorus]
Oh-oh, you're society's boy
You make some little rich girl a toy
My mistake, didn't think that you'd be
Another victim of a high society

[Verse 2]
All dressed up, and nowhere to go
You spend all of your money and you've got nothing to show
You've got so much to offer, oh, it's just a crying shame
You can't find love with your money, it's not the same, oh

[Chorus]
Oh-oh, you're society's boy
You make some little rich girl a toy
My mistake, didn't think that you'd be
Another victim of a high society

[Post-Chorus]
You're high society
You can't give your love to me
You're high society
You can't give your love to me

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus]
Oh, oh-oh, you're society's boy
You make some little rich girl a toy
My mistake, didn't think that you'd be
Another victim of a high society

You're high society
You can't give your love to me
You're high society
You can't give your love to me

[Outro]
You're high society
You're high society
You're high society
You're high society
You're high society
You're high society
You're high society
You're high society

[Chorus]
Driving that train, high on cocaine
Casey Jones you better, watch your speed
Trouble ahead, trouble behind
And you know that notion just crossed my mind

[Verse 1]
This old engine
Makes it on time
Leaves Central Station
At a quarter to nine
Hits river junction
At seventeen to
At a quarter to ten
You know it's traveling again

[Chorus]
Driving that train, high on cocaine
Casey Jones you better, watch your speed
Trouble ahead, trouble behind
And you know that notion just crossed my mind

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Trouble with you is
The trouble with me
Got two good eyes
But they still don't see
Comе 'round the bend
You know it's the еnd
The fireman screams
And the engine just gleams

[Chorus]
Driving that train, high on cocaine
Casey Jones you better, watch your speed
Trouble ahead, trouble behind
And you know that notion just crossed my mind
Driving that train, high on cocaine
Casey Jones you better, watch that speed
Trouble ahead, trouble behind
And you know that notion just crossed my mind
Driving that train, high on cocaine
Casey Jones you better, watch your speed
Trouble ahead, trouble behind
And you know that notion just crossed my mind
Driving that train, high on cocaine
Casey Jones you better, watch your speed
Trouble ahead, trouble behind
And you know that notion just crossed my mind
Driving that train, high on cocaine
Casey Jones you better, watch your speed
Trouble ahead, trouble behind
And you know that notion just crossed my mind
Driving that train, high on cocaine
Casey Jones you better, watch your speed
Trouble ahead, trouble behind
And you know that notion just crossed my mind
Driving that train, high on cocaine
Casey Jones you better, watch your speed
Trouble ahead, trouble behind
And you know that notion just crossed my mind

And you know that notion just crossed my mind

Thank you all, good night

[Verse 1]
Went down to the mountain, I was drinking some wine
Looked up into heaven, Lord, I saw a mighty sign
Writ in fire across the heaven, plain as black and white
Get prepared, there's gonna be a party tonight

[Chorus]
Well, uh-huh, one more Saturday night
Well, uh-huh, one more Saturday night now
Saturday night

[Verse 2]
Everybody's dancing down the local armory
With a basement full of dynamite and live artillery
The temperature keeps rising, everybody getting high
Come the rocking stroke of midnight, the place is gonna fly

[Chorus]
Uh-huh, woo, Saturday night
Uh-huh, one more Saturday night now, and it's right now
Saturday night

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Hey, turn on my TV, the President comes on the news
Says, "I get no satisfaction, that's why I sing the blues"
His wife say, "Don't get crazy, Lord, you know just what to do
Crank up that old Victrola, break out your rocking shoes"

[Chorus]
Uh-huh, hey now, Saturday night
Hey, uh-huh, one more Saturday night now
Get ready, Saturday night

[Verse 4]
Then God way up in heaven, for whatever it was worth
Thought He'd have a big old party, thought he'd call it Planet Earth
Don't worry about tomorrow, Lord, you'll know it when it come
Rock and roll the music meets the rising, shining sun

[Chorus]
Uh-huh, hey, Saturday night, yes, sir
Hey, uh-huh, one more Saturday night now
Hey, Saturday night

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
Hanging on a Saturday night
Hanging on a Saturday night (One more Saturday night)
Everybody get right (One more Saturday night)
Hanging on a Saturday night now (One more Saturday night)
One more Saturday, one more Saturday night
Hanging on a Saturday night (One more Saturday night)
Hanging on a Saturday night
Ow (One more Saturday night)
On a Saturday night (One more Saturday night)
One more Saturday, one more Saturday night
Hanging on a Saturday night now
Hanging on a Saturday night
Hey, hey
Hanging on a Saturday night now
One more Saturday, one more Saturday night

Thank you all, bye-bye

[Intro]
One, two, one, two, three

[Verse 1]
It feels so nice to say your name
You've captured me; you're not the same
And when you're standing near it makes no sense
I lose all my self confidence
And I know about your reputation, baby, I don't care
Your such a sweet sensation

[Chorus]
Won't you take me for your lover?
I don't want to have another
Won't you take me for your lover?
I don't want to have another
I want you
I want you
I want you
I want you

[Verse 2]
You don't know what you've done to me
I'm growing weaker at the knees
I know I took my chance when I tossed thе dice
I didn't think it would be this nice
I nеver fall in love; I'm much to clever
But you stole my heart
And I'm yours to keep forever

[Chorus]
Won't you take me for your lover?
I don't want to have another
Won't you take me for your lover?
I don't want to have another
I want you
I want you
I want you
I want you

[Bridge]
Someone like you just won't do, no
I don't want them anyway
I want you
I want you
I want you
I want you

[Chorus]
Won't you take me for your lover?
I don't want to have another
Won't you take me for your lover?
I don't want to have another
Someone like you just won't do, no
I don't want them anyway
I want you
I want you
I want you
I want you

[Verse 1]
Without a warning you broke my heart
Taking it baby, tore it apart
You left me standing in the dark cryin'
You said your love for me was dyin’
Come on, baby, baby please
I'm begging, baby, I'm on my knees

[Chorus]
Turn on your light, let it shine on me
Turn on your lovelight, let it shine on me
Let it shine, let it shine, let it

[Verse 2]
Well, I get a little lonely in the middle of the night
And I need you baby to make things alright
Come on baby, baby please
I’m begging you baby, and I'm on my knees

Turn on your light, let it shine on me
Turn on your lovelight, let it shine on mе
Let it shine, let it shinе, let it

Without a warning, you broke my heart

[Chorus]
Turn on your light, let it shine on me

It’s all I need (Shine on me)
All I got to get to my, my, my, my, my, my
And it feels so good, yes, it does
'Cause I don’t want it all, I just want a little bit
I don't want it all, no, no, I just want a little bit
A little of your lovin'
A little of your kissin'
A little of your rollin’
Some of your ridin' slow
Shucks, uh, alright
I need her some time, early in the morning
Just before, the day is dawning
I just might get lonesome, for some little thang
Lonesome for that thang you got, mama
I know what I got to do
Say everything is alright
Got to

[Instrumental Break]

Woo, woo, woo
I wanna tell y'all somethin' about my baby
I'm gonna tell y'all, but I'ma tell you a little bit
About one of them things make me feel so good
Them things that make me feel so nice
My, my, my, it's alright
One of them things, one of them things
I wanna tell you all about it
Alright
So sweet, it's so nice
Just can't help myself, no way
You can't get over it
You can't get around it
You can't get under it, you can't get through it
You got to get in it
Makes you feel pretty good, my, my, yes it do
Ain't no beatin' around the bush
Ain't no paddlin' upstream and no way down, huh
But I'm gonna tell you one thing
One thing that my baby got that make me feel so nice
Some thing make me feel so good, huh
Sometime, you know, in the morning
Just before the day is dawning
I just might get a little bit lonesome
I just might get a little bit hungry
But I know all I got to do is clap my hands a taste
And turn on over my left shoulder, ask my baby to roll on over
Ow, it feels so nice
I just can't begin to explain to ya the way it feels
Get ready now
And one of them things that make me feel so good about that kind of situation
Just one of them little things that make me feel so good
Get ready, folks
'Cause she got box-back nitties, great big enormous thighs
Working undercover with a boar hog eye
Gotta get my rider to feed my soul
Gotta get my rider, like it with my soul
Ooh, feel so good, yes, I do

[Instrumental Break]

Woo, ooh
Wait a minute
I know some, I know some of you fellas out in the audience this evening
May feel just like you'd like some little company this evening, huh
But I'll tell you you ain't gonna get no place standing around not doing a hell of a lot of nothin'
Now the first thing you gotta do is get your hands out of your pockets
And quit playing that pocket pool and do something that's worthwhile
I mean, you could clap your hands if you wanna
And if you don't wanna clap your hands, you can fake it and feel a girl up
But it's alright too
Because if you got your hands in your pockets, ain't no other thing to do
And you know, my mama told me one time, all that kinda business makes you kinda crazy
Hey, I can't hardly hear you
Come on, I can't hear nothin' yet
A little louder, everybody
Take it down
Hey, you clap loud enough, you know you gonna blow this whole place up
Might even tear down the whole damn city, pegs with it
So all I need is to hear you clap for me just a little while, huh
I kinda lost the beat there, just keep it up
Alright
I love when them things begin to get good
And them things begin to get better
There's one thing that I asked my baby
I said, "Please, do a favor for me"
She got a special little thing
Special little light she keep on the side just for me
I asked her, "Please, let it shine, let it shine, let it shine"
Ah, hey, what she do, feels so nice
Make me feel like I can, my rider can go on

[Instrumental Break]

And after everything gets so good, I ask my baby that last thing
And I just know she got it stashed away
That sweet little thing she got waiting for me
And I ask her "Please, turn on your light"
It's all I need, that's all I got to have
Because I know you got it somewhere stashed away
I tasted it before, and I got a thang for it now
Just got to get it, that special little thing, oh my
I asked my baby, I said, "Please"
I said, "Please, let it shine"
It's all I need, just got to get it
Just gotta have it, just got to get some
Make me feel so nice, make me feel so good
I just got to get some
Ain't no way, ain't no way I get around it now
I know you got it, I got to have it
And I'm gonna get it, yes, I will
You know I will, make me feel, make me feel so good
My, my, feels so nice
Baby, feels so good
So I said let it shine (Shine on me)
Shine on me (Shine on me)

Sayin' things they like to hear

[Verse 1]
Three times the echoes of my name
How could someone not turn insane
What made you leave, what made you go
Long road, long time ago

[Chorus]
Whistling your lifelong song
Solace is your lifelong song
Whistling your lifelong song
Solace is your lifelong song

[Verse 2]
You fenced yourself from the crowd
Black water, far as eyes can see
Clear metal taste in your mouth
Nights howl
Are you invited or not, ‘till dawn?

[Bridge]
Three times the echoes of my name
Can one man be an island
I want to leave, I want to go
A long way, like you taught me so

[Chorus]

Solacе is your lifelong song

Time, won’t you ease my shoulders?
They got here unsafe
Winter’s monsters...
...adopted my place

[Verse 2]
I don’t know how you’ve been
I don’t know who she is but I can tell
She’s ‘got delicate hands
That must dance around you with the grace

[Chorus]
Of a free bird
Of a song

[Bridge]
Time won’t you ease me?
I wonder if you’re still waiting with
Pride for the sun, for the one
To tell you to go to sleep

[Chorus]
Of a bird
Of a song
Of a bird

[Chorus]
Of a bird
Of a song

J.R., Sean Kingston

[Chorus: Sean Kingston]
You're way too beautiful, girl
That's why it'll never work
You got me in denial, in denial
When you say it's over
Man, all these beautiful girls
They only wanna do you dirt
They'll have you in denial, in denial
When they say it's over

[Verse 1: Sean Kingston]
See, it started at the park
Used to chill after dark
Oh, when you took my heart
That's when we fell apart
'Cause we both thought
That love last forever (Last forever)
They say we're too young
To get ourselves sprung
Oh, we didn't care
We made it very clear
And they also said
That we couldn't last together (Last together)

[Pre-Chorus: Sean Kingston]
See, it's very defined
You're one of a kind
But you mash up my mind
You haffi get declined
Oh girl, my baby is drivin' me crazy

[Chorus: Sean Kingston]
You're way too beautiful, girl
That's why it'll never work
You got me in denial, in denial
When you say it's over
Man, all these beautiful girls
They only wanna do you dirt
They'll have you in denial, in denial
When they say it's over

[Verse 2: Sean Kingston]
It was back in '99
Watchin' movies all the time
Oh, when I rush back, just to see you in time
And I never thought
That we was gonna see each other (See each other)
And then I came out
Mami moved me down south
Oh, I'm with my girl who I thought was my world
It came out to be
That she wasn't the girl for me (Girl for me)

[Pre-Chorus: Sean Kingston]
See, it's very defined
You're one of a kind
But you mash up my mind
You haffi get declined
Oh girl, my baby is drivin' me crazy

[Chorus: Sean Kingston]
You're way too beautiful, girl
That's why it'll never work
You got me in denial, in denial
When you say it's over
Man, all these beautiful girls
They only wanna do you dirt
They'll have you in denial, in denial
When they say it's over

[Verse 3: Sean Kingston]
Now we're fussin'
And now we're fightin'
Please tell me why
I'm feelin' slighted
And I don't know
How to make it better (Make it better)
You're datin' other guys
You're tellin' me lies
Oh, I can't believe
What I'm seein' with my eyes
I'm losin' my mind
And I don't think it's clever (Think it's clever)

[Outro: Sean Kingston]
You're way too beautiful, girl
That's why it'll never work
You got me in denial, in denial, in denial

[Verse 1]
I like the way you fight
You use all your cuss words right
Wake me up in the middle of the night one more time around
You keep me coming back
You don't cut me any slack
You confuse me, can't leep track
Im going down

[Chorus]
If you love me, don't let go
If you're leavin', just say so
If you're thinkin' I'm just one more domino
Watch me fall and here I go

[Verse 2]
Give me everything
Cause there ain't no in between
Say thew ords will make you king and be your throne

[Chorus]
If you love me, don't let go
If you're leavin', just say so
If you're thinkin' I'm just one more domino
Watch me fall and here I go

[Bridge]
Touch me, kiss me
Let me know
Hear me calling, watch me falling
Here I go
Here I go

[Chorus]
If you love me, don't let go
If you're leavin', just say so
If you're thinkin' I'm just one more domino
If you love me, don't let go
If you're leavin', just say so
If you're thinkin' I'm just one more domino

[Outro]
Watch me fall, and here I go

Nicki Minaj (Damn), Gucci Mane (Uh-uh), Rocko, let’s go

[Verse 1]
(For your love)
I'd give you everything and more and that's for sure
(For your love)
I'd bring you diamond rings and things right to your door

To thrill you with delight, I'd bring you diamonds bright
(For your love)
Everything that will excite
Make you dream of me at night

[Chorus]
For your love
For your love
For your love
For your love

[Verse 2]
For your love, for your love
I would give you stars above
For your love, for your love
I'd give the stars if they were mine to give
(For your love)

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
I'd give the stars if they were mine to give
(For your love)
I'd give the moon every day that I live
(For your love)
To thrill you with delight, I'd bring you diamonds bright
(For your love)
Everything that will excite
Make you dream of me at night

[Chorus]
For your love
For your love
For your love
For your love
For your love
For your love
For your love
For your love
For your love
For your love
For your love
For your love
For your love

[Chorus]
I’m one
My blood
I owe
I bear
The past
My heirs
I owe
I bear

[Chorus]
I’m one
My blood
I owe
I bear
The past
My heirs
I owe
I bear

[Verse 1]
When I smell sweet hay
Peace of mind comes
Distant land I’m from
Honey & sun

[Verse 2]
Oh, I relieve it
Where I was born
Oh, I can feel it
In the storm

[Chorus]
...I bear
The past
My heirs
I owe
I bear

[Chorus]
I’m one
My blood
I owe
I bear
The past
My heirs
I owe
I bear

[Verse 1]
You’re not done
You just broke a bone
Oh dove
You’re not the one that’s gone

[Verse 2]
To be ours
Like the trees on our shores
All tweezed
The cliffs eat away at our knees
On my knees

[Bridge]
I’ll be the one to tell your story, don’t say you’re sorry, you rest and heal
You used to be my spear without fear, you had the will
I want to give you time, give you mine, until you heal
You used to speed your way through the fields, but now you’re still

[Verse 3]
Soon we’ll roam
There’ll be shade oncе more
We’ll stray
Oblivious of boats sailing home
Sailing homе

[Verse 1]
I ran out of made-up consolations
I’ve been waiting forever
How can you call me with such conviction?
“Sugar cane, sugar “

[Verse 2]
You get yourself out of situations
Won’t you leave me, won’t you?
‘Cause I don’t have the time for indignations
“Sugar cane, sugar”

[Chorus]
It goes on and on and on
And it goes on and on and on again
It goes on and on and on
And it goes on and on and on again

[Verse 3]
Can you find just one thing you cherish?
Would you hold me just like you mean it?
Am I the one with much imagination?
Give me one reason

[Bridge]
As it gets older
You keep pulling and pushing away
But you never promised me
To be wiser or better

[Chorus]
It goes on and on and on
And it goes on and on and on again
It goes on and on and on
And it goes on and on and on again

[Chorus]
It goes on and on and on
And it goes on and on and on again
It goes on and on and on
And it goes on and on and on again

[Outro]
Sugar
My sugar cane
Sugar

Sugar

[Verse 1]
Took a Flintstone pill
Pantry uphill
Curtain child within
My teens, our dreams
Ride through Hyrule fields
Roaming scuffing
Mileage on my bike breezing

[Chorus]
The freedom
I enjoyed through flames
I owe it
Mother and bygones
Remember
Days that gave me aim
So I can feel the same

[Post-Chorus]
I don’t know about your love
I don’t know about your past
Things I did have brought me shame, and pride
Alas, I don’t know about your past

[Verse 1]
You make no sound
As folks gather ‘round
Like shadow hounds
Eyes seem unsound
As folks gather ‘round
And please you aloud

[Chorus 1]
And I now believe that no one asked
About your secret past
The pain to match your strength
And I now believe that no one thought
You had a lonely past
The pain and strengths so vast

[Verse 2]
From mellow seas
To houses on wheels
To slabs in West lands
Hand in hand
From yellow bills
To slabs in West lands
Like bones in your hands

[Bridge]
But I see a tree that's standing high among the shrubs
So only one hand may rest its palm upon my cheeks

[Pre-Chorus]
The only one that I'll need

[Chorus 2]
To know why no one asked
About your secret past
The pain to match your strength
And I now believe that no one thought
You had a lonely past
And pain to match your vein

[Post-Chorus]
When it rains

[Verse 1]
…Still love you
Still love you
He’s got you
Do you miss me too?
Yeah

[Verse 2]
I’m not through
Are you?
“Almost blue”
You feel it too?

[Verse 3]
She’s not you…
Still love you
I miss you
Do you miss me too?
Yeah

[Intro]
All I know
Is I love you so

[Verse 1]
I hope that you get everything you want in this beautiful life
Change for your pocket, someone for the night
I hope they name you a rocket and take you for a ride for free
And if they tell you you're nothin', maybe you'd explain
To me, you're the summer sun after the rain
And you were there when I needed
Somethin' for the pain, you see

[Pre-Chorus]
When you love me, love me, lovе me
When you love mе, love me, love me
When you love me, love me, love me
When you love me, love me, love me
I'm nowhere else
I'm on top of the world, man
On top of the world

[Chorus]
And it's so beautiful
And you're so beautiful
And it's so beautiful

[Verse 2]
I hope that you get everything you want in this beautiful life
Watermelon moon, so happy you're alive
And I feel like a river, finally arrived at sea

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause when you love me, love me, love me
When you love me, love me, love me
When you love me, love me, love me
When you love me, love me, love me
I know I'll be
On top of the world, man
On top of the world

[Chorus]
And it's so beautiful
And you're so beautiful
And it's so beautiful

[Bridge]
'Cause when you love me, love me, love me
When you love me, love me, love me
When you love me, love me, love me
When you love me, love me, love me
I know I'll be
On top of the world, man
On top of the world

[Chorus]
And it's so beautiful
And you're so beautiful
And it's so beautiful
And you're so beautiful
And it's so beautiful

[Verse 1]
Coloratura
We fell in through the clouds
And everyone before us is there welcoming us now
It's the end of death and doubt
And loneliness is out
Coloratura
The place we dreamed about
The melodies inside yourself and love come pouring out
And everyone's allowed
We're feathered by the crowd

[Chorus 1]
And up there in the heavеns
Galileo and those pining for the moon
Know it's a slow burn
Through Pioneer and Hеlix
Oumuamua, Heliopause and Neptune
We're a slow-burning tune
But we'll get there, so for now
In this crazy world, I do
I just want you

[Verse 2]
In the end, it's all about
The love you're sending out

[Chorus 2]
And up there in the heavens
The explorers who've all gathered by balloon
Saw the world turn
Through Voyager, Callisto
Calliope, Betelgeuse, the Neon Moons
We're a slow-burning tune
But we'll touch down soon, so will you
And in this crazy world, I do
I just want you

[Instrumental  Bridge]

[Chorus 3]
And up there in the heavens
Galileo saw reflections of us too
Pluribus unum, unus mundus
All the satellites imbue
The purple, yellow, green, red, orange and the blue
Oh, it's a crazy world, it's true
Sing it out
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh

[Refrain]
And in this crazy world, I do
I just want
In this crazy world, it's true
I just want you

[Outro]
Poets prophesy up in the blue
Together, that's how we'll make it through

[Verse 1]
If only fame had an IV, baby, could I bear
Being away from you? I found the vein, put it in here

[Pre-Chorus]
I live for the applause, applause, applause
I live for the applause-plause, live for the applause-plause
Live for the way that you cheer and scream for me
The applause, applause, applause

[Chorus]
Give me that thing that I love (I'll turn the lights out)
Put your hands up, make 'em touch, touch (Make it real loud)
Give me that thing that I love (I'll turn the lights out)
Put your hands up, make 'em touch, touch (Make it real loud)

[Post-Chorus]
Make it real loud
Put your hands up, make 'em touch, touch
Make it real loud
Put your hands up, make 'em touch, touch
I live for the ap—

[Verse 2]
One second I'm a Koons, then suddenly the Koons is me
Pop culture was in art, now art's in pop culture, in me

[Pre-Chorus]
I live for the applause, applause, applause
I live for the applause-plause, live for the applause-plause
Live for the way that you cheer and scream for me
The applause, applause, applause

[Chorus]
Give me that thing that I love (I'll turn the lights out)
Put your hands up, make 'em touch, touch (Make it real loud)
Give me that thing that I love (I'll turn the lights out)
Put your hands up, make 'em touch, touch (Make it real loud)

[Post-Chorus]
Make it real loud
Put your hands up, make 'em touch, touch
Make it real loud
Put your hands up, make 'em touch, touch
I live for the ap—

Yeah, yeah, I like how I sound though
Yeah the whole umbrella in here we here you know what's up

Bro, I'm finna...
Look, uh

[Verse]
I give my runners S5s with the Benzymes
I'm big time and still will get mines' off the quick dimes
My chicks fine, wash the whip and suck dick fine
And when she do 'em both it's like we all gettin' spit-shined
Label advance, I flick mine in my sick time
Oh, you gettin' signed? I just did your deal 6 times
18.7 what I just signed
I'm 2 armed sliding in these women like a zipline
This shit weird, flickin' the Yuris into 5th gear
Gotta keep an extra chick here 'cause my chick queer
In the rear, if I see robin nigga stare he gon' hear the heat
Chk like his teeth when it split the beer
The shit severe, I'm the realest nigga here
Chick with me, ass so fat could fill up any chair
It's like a barber, clippers coming with me 'errywhere
The shit was tucked so the piff get puffed like Diddy there
Chuck True enough y'all shooters don't do enough
I fuck coochie like a porno movie I'm queuin' up
Hoes say I'm cute as fuck, my jewels recruit a slut
Coupe guts like the inside color of noodle cups
You a tough guy? Me? Never
But the orangutans that I hang with
They bang bang like Chief Keef sent 'em
But only we sent 'em
We threw slugs to that thug that ran'd off on the plug
Had to re-send em
I go get it hustling jewels gon' get encrusted
I drove weight state to state like go 'head and touch it
I chiropractic, the stacks had to get adjusted
Busting 2 packs out the van like Poetic Justice
Fuck it, hatin' me last year was last year
On Twitter, "Oh, he cancelled," now I'm back here
Double stacked, the Rolls Royce smothered in cashmere
A mean rookie, I'm seeing pussy like it's a pat smear
My last chick damn new nigga a dweeb
He couldn't see me like a magician with tricks in his sleeve
But see me, my pet peeve more bricks or a key
Your block dead like I put your street pic on a tee
In memory of, all y'all pretend to be thugs
The love that I spit slugs like the center-view bug
Remember me, Cuz? Wilder than my enemies was
I blow like it's GoldenEye with proximity plugs
Yo gimme some love, I know y'all niggas secretly hate me
I got hoes eager to date me to eat and then rate me
Tuckin' green paper deep in Versace
How you schemin' to play me?
Know you sweeter than a peach or a pastry
Pull the heater faster than a wild cheetah can race me
The weed smell like velveeta cheese, squeezin' the bakery
Same seemer but I prolly need the keys to the 'Cedes
Got the beamer but the AMG 63 is my baby
I'm sayin', J on the side, bae I'ma slide
She ate the beef and waited for the hot mayo inside
My cock get dry she stop by, can't go inside
'Cause my other chick in the crib and y'all may coincide
I spit facts and I give it up
Erry chick I fuck know my dick big enough to pick Lizzo up
Me send a dick pic for what? Bitch, give it up
My money knots got doctors to stitch it up
And my chick thick as fuck, look at her ass
I discount it if you bookin' with cash
I spend nights front that pot with that white like I'm cookin' the mash
My rookie passed past when I past, cookin' a half
I'm ballin' like a yuro step with no look in the past
My chick ass heavy as some textbooks in the bag
I'm so crook, you so shook, but hoes lookin' to smash
I dress good, my checkbook is what it took her to smash
But I ain't trickin', she aware of that
But I still hit 'cause the chick thick as Kylie Jenner's lips 6 years back
When Kellz keep the burner and you know can clap
Feelin' like a dyke with all this height around the leg strap
They hate that I'm lurkin', they say that I'm workin'
I sold bags of white tighter than Arabian turbans
Y'all clowns like them niggas that parade in your circus
The pack get scratched like scraping off the paint on the surface
I'm sayin', Canadian born, America thanks
We nothin' there if we comparing the banks
We can shoot the fade and recoup but the loser gotta stare at the ranks
'Cause all my shooters do is bust it like they Erika Banks
I'm saying may I ask you why you gave this nigga 2 straps?
We got steppers like the living room mats
Niggas try to play me shit was too cap
So brrat, bitch, I'm back
Shout go out to "SKAT," shout out to DaBaby
Roddy Ricch, and Lil Baby, huh
What I'm 'bout to say is gon' sound a little crazy
But it's true so don't flame me
Y'all all would've got y'all awards if they never framed me
I'm waist deep like Game in that seed plant crazy
Can't sleep the pain in my dreams goin' crazy
Wolf the wall in the street I'm more Scor XXX
Sese
Put my balls in her cheek, that's how you play face
I'm fresh in assurance, but that's not to mention appearance
I keep a Flo like Progressive insurance
And my Leprechaun bundles is gettin' em dummy high
I sold 5 in 25s from 25
My blocks sell from age 12 into 25
Nigga, fuck the Gram, it's the grams I'm already live
I watch shenanigans
Louis jacket on me like I snatched it off a mannequin

SOD, skrrt
Come on!
Ooooh
Come on!

Looking back on when I
Was a little nappy headed boy
Then my only worry
Was for Christmas what would be my toy
Even though we sometimes
Would not get a thing
We were happy with the
Joy the day would bring
Sneaking out the back door
To hang out with those hoodlum friends of mine
Greeted at the back door
With, "Boy, thought I told you not to go outside"
Trying your best to bring the water to your eyes
Thinking it might stop her from whooping your behind

[Chorus]
I wish those days could come back once more
Why did those days ever have to go?
I wish those days could come back once more
Why did those days ever have to go?
'Cause I love them so

[Verse 2]
Brother says he's telling
About you playing doctor with that girl
Just don't tell and I'll give you
Anything you want in this whole wide world
Mama gives you money for Sunday school
You trade yours for candy after church is through
Smoking cigarettes and writing something nasty on the wall
(You nasty boy)
Teacher sends you to the principal's office down the hall
You grow up and learn that kind of thing isn't right
But while you were doing it, it sure felt outta sight

[Chorus]
I wish those days could come back once more
Why did those days ever have to go?
I wish those days could come back once more
Why did those days ever have to go?

One, two, one, two, three, Stevie!
Stevie I would love to get me back to these days

[Verse 1]
Maybe it was all too much
Too much for a man to take
Everything's bound to break
Sooner or later, sooner or later
You're all that I can trust
Facing the darkest days
Everyone ran away
But we're gonna stay here, we're gonna stay here

[Pre-Chorus]
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah
I know you're scared tonight
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah
I'll never leave your side

[Chorus]
When it all falls, when it all falls down
I'll be your fire when the lights go out
When there's no one, no one else around
We'll be two souls in a ghost town
When the world gets cold, I'll be your cover
Let's just hold onto each other
When it all falls, when it all falls down
We'll be two souls in a ghost town

[Verse 2]
Tell me how we got this far
Every man for himself
Everything's gone to hell
We gotta stay strong, we're gonna hold on
This world has turned to dust
All we've got left is love
Might as well start with us
Singing a new song, something to build on

[Pre-Chorus]
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah
I know you're scared tonight
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah
I'll never leave your side

[Chorus]

In this mad, mad, in this mad, mad world
Even with no light, we're gonna shine like gold
In this mad, mad, in this mad, mad world

When it all falls, when it all falls down
I'll be your fire when the lights go out
When there's no one, no one else around
We'll be two souls in a ghost town

Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one

[Verse 1]
Today I heard the strangest
I heard the strangest song
(Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh)
(Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh)
A DJ a star away is
Playing it to turn us on
(Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh)
(Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh)

[Pre-Chorus]
My heart started glowin'
I feel it inside, it's flowin'

[Chorus]
I say, I know, I know, I know
We're only human
I know, I know, I know
How we're designed, yeah
Oh, I know, I know, I know
We're only human
But from another planet
Still they call us humankind

[Verse 2]
Today I had the strangest
Feelin' that I belong
(Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh)
(Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh)

[Pre-Chorus]
Before I was dyin'
I feel it inside, now I'm flyin'

[Chorus]
I say, I know, I know, I know
We're only human
I know, I know, I know
How we're designed, yeah
Oh, I know, I know, I know

But from another planet
Still they call us humankind

[Interlude]
Oh

Bеfore I was dyin'
I feel it inside, now I'm flyin'

I know, I know, I know
We're only human
I know, I know, I know
How we're designed
Oh, I know, I know, I know
We're only human
But we're capable of kindness
So they call us humankind

[Intro]
People on the left
People on the right
Got a lion inside
People of the pride
Let's go

[Verse 1]
There's a man who swears he's God
Unbelievers will be shot
There's a man who walks around
Like he owns the fucking lot
There's a man who takes his time
From his homemade cuckoo clock
And he makes us march around it
Tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock

[Verse 2]
There's a crocodile cross-eyed
There's a turning of the tide
We're no longer gonna fight for
Some old crook and all his crimes
There's a sewing up of rags
Into revolution flags
Got to stand up to be counted
Be an anthem for your times
It's just work

[Bridge]
It's just work, it's not easy
And we could all be blown apart
And heaven is the fire escape
You try to cling to in the dark
It's just work, believe me
Still my beating heart
We'll all be free to fall in love
With who we want and say
Yeah, yeah, yeah
People of the pride
Go

[Instrumental Outro]

[Spoken Intro]
Alright people of the world, are you ready? Are you ready to get into the groove? I thought so. And you can dance, for inspiration
I know you want to. Come on!

[Chorus]
Get into the groove
Boy, you've got to prove
Your love to me, yeah
Get up on your feet
Yeah, step to the beat
Boy, what will it be?

[Verse 1]
Music can be such a revelation
Dancing around, you feel the sweet sensation
We might be lovers if the rhythm's right
I hope this feeling never ends tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
Only when I'm dancing can I feel this free
At night, I lock the doors, wherе no one else can see
I'm tirеd of dancing here all by myself
Tonight, I wanna dance with someone else

[Chorus]
Get into the groove
Boy, you've got to prove
Your love to me, yeah
Get up on your feet
Yeah, step to the beat
Boy, what will it be?

Gonna get to know you in a special way
This doesn't happen to me every day
Don't try to hide it, love wears no disguise
I see the fire burning in your eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
Only when I'm dancing can I feel this free
At night I lock the doors, where no one else can see
I'm tired of dancing here all by myself
Tonight I wanna dance with someone else

[Chorus]
Get into the groove
Boy, you've got to prove
Your love to me, yeah
Get up on your feet
Yeah, step to the beat

Live out your fantasy here with me
Just let the music set you free
Touch my body, and move in time

Boy, what will it be?

[Spoken]
People say I'm too ambitious with a lot of my songs, uh... So this is a song from the perspective of God

[Verse 1]
I've never written a book in my life
'Cause your tiny brains would never get it
Me compared to Shakespeare's like Shakespeare compared to Shakespeare's wife
I gave you everything but
I gave you simple minds
So you made simple things
I gave you healthy birds
And you made chicken wings
I gave you nipples
And you madе nipple rings

[Chorus]
You're not going to heavеn
Why would you ever think I'd ever hang out with you?
You're all dicks, I don't need you
I know a million aliens cooler than you

[Verse 2]
People give me money and I don't know why
'Cause my real collection plate is an empty cup
Held by a homeless guy
I made every girl different
They're all perfect just the way they are
People tell them different
And people are smart
I just made the stars
You think you know beauty
But trust me, you don't
I'm the one who created them
You're overpopulated so I slaved for days making gays
And you ended up hating them
How do you get out of a song you haven't finished?

[Spoken]
I haven't figured it out, segues are weird

[Intro]
Life is a mystery
Everyone must stand alone
I hear you call my name
And it feels like home

[Chorus]
When you call my name
It's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees
I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour
I can feel your power
Just like a prayer
You know I'll take you there

[Verse 1]
I hear your voice
It's like an angel sighing
I have no choice
I hear your voice
Feels like flying
I close my eyes
Oh God, I think I'm falling
Out of the sky
I close my eyes
Heaven, help me

[Chorus]
When you call my name
It's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees
I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour
I can feel your power
Just like a prayer
You know I'll take you there

[Verse 2]
Like a child
You whisper softly to me
You're in control
Just like a child
Now I'm dancing
It's like a dream
No end and no beginning
You're here with me
It's like a dream
Let the choir sing

[Chorus]
When you call my name
It's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees
I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour
I can feel your power
Just like a prayer
You know I'll take you there

[Reprise]
Come on, put your hands together
Life is a mystery
Everyone must stand alone
I hear you call my name
And it feels like home

[Chorus]
Just like a prayer
Your voice can take me there
Just like a muse to me
You are a mystery
Just like a dream
You are not what you seem
Just like a prayer, no choice
Your voice can take me there

[Bridge]
Just like a prayer, I'll take you there
It's like a dream to me (Oh yeah)
Just like a prayer, I'll take you there (I'll take you there)
It's like a dream to me (I said put your hands together) (Oh, oh-oh-oh yeah)
Just like a prayer, I'll take you there (I'll take you there)
It's like a dream to me (Oh yeah, oh yeah yeah yeah, yeah)
Just like a prayer, I'll take you there (Oh, yeah, I'll take you there)
It's like a dream to me (Oh, oh)

[Chorus]
Just like a prayer (Just like)
Your voice can take me there (Your prayer)
Just like a muse to me (Your voice can take me there)
You are a mystery
Just like a dream (Just like)
You are not what you seem (A prayer)
Just like a prayer, no choice
Your voice can take me there
Just like a prayer (Just like)
Your voice can take me there (Your prayer)
Just like a muse to me (Your voice can take me there)
You are a mystery
Just like a dream (Just like)
You are not what you seem (A prayer)
Just like a prayer, no choice
Your voice can take me there

[Outro]
Like a prayer, your voice can take me there
Like a prayer, take me there
Like a prayer
Thank you!

[Intro: Vory]
No child left behind
No child left behind
No child left behind
No child left behind
No child left behind

[Verse: Vory]
Back again, I used my back against the wall
Never called on y'all, never count on y'all
I'll always count on God
Back again, I used my back against the wall
Never called on y'all, never count on y'all
I'll always count on God

[Chorus: Kanye West]

Let's Go (yeah)

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
Uh
Tell 'em welcome to the rarefied
Heir of "I can't be up and terrified"
Pterodactyl-sharing, Red Baron meets the Tuskegee Airmen vibes
Barrel rolling, daring dives
Come back to base like he Derrick Hodge
Sing my prayers like I'm scared of God
In my backyard doing samurai moves, wearing pods
He's kinda square and odd
From an era where we called sharing cops
Been on Ohio we once sharing cars
Mind of Aristotle, larynx of a professor of Meritas
You might be your city's, but I'm America's
Fill in the blanks, kill 'em with thanks

[Chorus: Kali Uchis]
You know I'm just a flight away
If you want it you could take a private plane
A kilómetros estamos conectando
Y me prendes aunque no me estés tocando
You know I got a lot to say
All these voices in the background of my brain
Y me dicen todo lo que estás pensando
Me imagino lo que ya estás maquinando

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
Yeah
Kill 'em with thanks, that's that Jean Grey
I walk a lonely road, that's that Green Day
Far from weak, a young black history month heralding good news
Mild sauce jumping out my wing tray
House on vinyl, money kinda vital, and when it turn rival
You go against the Bucks like Phoenix in the finals
Don't lose your congregation by preaching to the Bible
I'm in the zone
My friends are still alive and I'm rhyming like a diamond in my dome, wordplay
Tell Huggy I want a Uzi for my birthday
All these push-ups and curls got me filling out like surveys
I'm just studying religion
Chil interrupt my sessions with phone calls from prison
Been out the game, Hall of Fame reported me missing
When I gold this album, oh I'll be back to get my position
Eyahhh

[Chorus: Kali Uchis and Lupe Fiasco]
You know I'm just a flight away
If you want it you could take a private plane (woo)
A kilómetros estamos conectando (yeah)
Y me prendes aunque no me estés tocando (yeah, yeah)
You know I got a lot to say
All these voices in the background of my brain (yeah)
Y me dicen todo lo que estás pensando (ahh)
Me imagino lo que ya estás maquinando

Zephyr in the sky at night, I wonder
Do my tears of mourning sink beneath the sun?
She's got herself a universe gone quickly
For the call of thunder threatеns everyone

[Chorus]
And I feel likе I just got home
And I feel
And I feel like I just got home
And I feel

[Verse 2]
Faster than the speeding light she's flying
Trying to remember where it all began
She's got herself a little piece of heaven
Waiting for the time when Earth shall be as one

[Chorus]
And I feel like I just got home
And I feel
And I feel like I just got home
And I feel

[Post-Chorus]
Quicker than a ray of light
Quicker than a ray of light
Quicker than a ray of light

[Verse 3]
Zephyr in the sky at night, I wonder
Do my tears of mourning sink beneath the sun?
She's got herself a universe gone quickly
For the call of thunder threatens everyone

[Middle 8]
And I feel
Quicker than a ray of light, then gone for
Waiting for the time when Earth shall be as one

[Outro]
She's got herself a universe
She's got herself a universe
She's got herself a universe
And I feel
And I feel
And I feel like I just got home
And I feel
Quicker than a ray of light, she's flying
Quicker than a ray of light, I'm flying
Green plastic watering can
For her fake Chinese rubber plant
In fake plastic earth
She bought from a rubber man
In a town full of rubber plans
To get rid of itself

It wears her out
It wears her out
It wears her out
It wears her out

She lives with a broken man
A cracked polystyrene man
Who just crumbles and burns
He used to do surgery
For girls in the eighties
But gravity always wins

It wears him out
It wears him out
It wears him out
It wears
She looks like the real thing
Shе tastes like the rеal thing
My fake plastic love
And I can't help the feeling
I could blow through the ceiling
If I just turn and run

It wears me out
It wears me out
It wears me out
It wears me out

And if I could be who you wanted
If I could be who you wanted
All the time
All the time

[Verse 1]
We took it all apart, but I'm wishing I'd stayed
In the back room, something I heard you say
We didn't want to call it too early
Now it seems a world away, but I miss that day
Are we ever gonna feel the same?

[Chorus]
Standing in the light 'til it's over, out of our minds
Someone had to draw a line
We'll be coming back for you one day
We'll be coming back for you one day
I don't even care if I know ya, out of our minds
Sad to leave it all behind
We'll be coming back
We'll be coming back for you one day

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
We took it all apart, but I'm wishing I'd stayed
In the back room, something I heard you say
We didn't want to call it too early
Now it seems a world away, but I miss that day
Arе we ever gonna feel thе same?

[Chorus]
Standing in the light 'til it's over, out of our minds
Someone had to draw a line
We'll be coming back for you one day
We'll be coming back for you one day
I don't even care if I know ya, out of our minds
Sad to leave it all behind
We'll be coming back
We'll be coming back for you one day

[Verse 3]
You could see it from afar, we were riding that wave
Blinded by the lights, and it's something I crave
We didn't want to call it too early
Now it seems a world away, but I miss that day
Are we ever gonna feel the same?

[Chorus]
Standing in the light 'til it's over, out of our minds
Someone had to draw a line
We'll be coming back for you one day
We'll be coming back for you one day
I don't even care if I know ya, out of our minds
Sad to leave it all behind
We'll be coming back
We'll be coming back for you one

[Chorus]
Station Man, I've been waiting
Can you tell me when we're leaving?

[Verse]
Midnight train now is leaving
Engines screaming
Uh-huh, uh-huh
Uh-huh, uh-huh
Where I'm going, I don't know
But you tell me I must go
When we're leaving, I don't know
But you tell me now
I see it's coming and bringing something
This train of loving
I see it's coming, I hear it's running
This train of loving from ages past

[Chorus]
Station Man, I've been waiting
Can you tell me when we're leaving?

[Verse 1]
How can my heart be filled with doubts of you
When you can fill me with a love that's true?
But I can't help but sigh
And sometimes wonder why
What can I do?
I want to see you more and more each day
I really need you, you're my only way
You say it's alright now
But still I wonder how, what can I say?

[Pre-Chorus]
I've dreamed a thousand dreams
And cried so many tears
'Cause when you're not in my heart it seems
Like I've wasted all my years

[Chorus]
Someday, together we will fly to the sun
And then we'll think of all the things we've done
Evеryone will smile, happy all the whilе
Now that we're one

[Pre-Chorus]
I've dreamed a thousand dreams
And cried so many tears
When you're not in my heart
It seems like I'm wasting all my years

[Chorus]
Someday, together we will fly to the sun
And then we'll think of all the things we've done
Everyone will smile, happy all the while
Now that we're one

[Chorus]
Tell me, tell me all the things you do
I'll tell you, tell you all the things I do

[Chorus]
Tell me, tell me all the things you do
I'll tell you, tell you all the things I do

[Verse 1]
Moonshine time, thoughts of you
Spinning 'round as thoughts do
I just wondered if your eyes still shine
As they did when you were mine
I can see in a dream
Thoughts so clear and jewels that gleam
Would your eyes still sparkle then?
If we were, once again

[Chorus]
Jewel eyed Judy, please come home
Jewel eyed Judy, don't leave me alone
Jewel eyed Judy, please come home
Jewel eyed Judy, don't leave me alone

[Verse 2]
Lovely Judy, can you see?
Where it is you're meant to be
Where you lay your head tonight
May the stars find your light
So am I, sitting here
Moonlight glistens on my tears
Is this all that we could find?
Chains of memories left behind

[Chorus]
Jewel eyed Judy, please come home
Jewel eyed Judy, don't leave me alone
Jewel eyed Judy, please come home
Jewel eyed Judy, don't leave me alone

[Verse 1]
You babes talk about your Madison shoes
We've got a thing we call the Madison blues
We do the Madison blues

We do the Madison blues, baby
Rock away your blues

[Verse 2]

She told me she loved me but I know it ain't true

Love, open the door

[Chorus]
Can’t you hear me cryin’?
I’m losing my mind
Can’t you hear me pleading?
Please hear me this time

[Verse 2]
Let yourself be mine
Let me see your little light shine
You know I want you to welcome me home
Love, open the door

[Chorus]
Can’t you hear me cryin’?
I’m losing my mind
Can’t you hear me plеading?
Please hear mе this time

[Outro]
Each and every night, I wonder about you
Love, open the door
Love, open the door
Love, open the door

[Verse 1]
I was up this mornin', ah, blues walkin' like a man
I was up this mornin', ah, blues walkin' like a man
Worried blues, give me your right hand

[Verse 2]
And the blues fell mama's child, tore me all upside down
Blues fell mama's child, and it tore me all upside down
Travel on, poor Bob, just can't turn you 'round

[Verse 3]
The blues, is a low-down shakin' chill, yes, preach 'em now
Is a low-down shakin' chill
You ain't never had 'em I, hope you never will

[Verse 4]
Well, the blues is a achin' old heart disease
Do it now, you gon' do it? Tell me all about it
The blues, is a low-down achin' heart disease
Like consumption, killing me by degrees

[Verse 5]
I can study rain, oh, oh, drive, oh, oh, drive my blues

Goin' to the 'stil'ry, stay out there all day

[Verse 1]
I'm getting up soon in the morning

Telephone every town I know

Telephone every town I know
If I don't find her in Mississippi

But you just think the same way

You're loving too many women, every one you see
We never get much time together
Get like you used to be

Love me, baby, but don't you grieve me
Oh, baby, you used to mean so much to me
I wanna get my arms around you, baby
So get like you used to be

[Verse 1]
I was a fool when I left you
I should have known
To find a good man was a hard thing to do
But temptation got the best of me

[Chorus]
So there's nothing I can say
Except if you let me come home to stay
I'm on my way, I'm on my way

[Verse 2]
I must have been blind to go away
And leave you behind
But can you find it in your heart to forgive me
And try one more time?
I want a chance to do things your way

[Chorus]
So there's nothing I can say
Except if you let me come home to stay
I'm on my way, I'm on my way

[Verse 2]
I've had my little run out
And I know you I can't do without
But give me a chance and I'll be more to you
Than just a pair of hands
I'll do whatever, whatevеr
Whatever you want me to
Bеcause I feel, yes, I feel
I owe that much to you

[Chorus]
But there's nothing I can say
Except if you let me come home to stay
I'm on my way

[Outro]
If you let me come home, I'm on my way
If you let me come home, I'm on my way
If you let me come home, I'm on my way

Now and forever, until the end of time

Teenage darling, you're my queen
Teenage darling, you're just sweet sixteen
Teenage darling, you're the answеr to all my dreams

[Chorus: Don Toliver]
I wanna go to the moon, don't leave so soon (Don't leave so soon)
How could I get through? (How could I get through?)
I wanna go to the moon, don't leave so soon (Don't leave so soon)
How could I get through? (How could I get through?)
I wanna go to the moon, don't leave so soon (Don't leave so soon)
How could I get through? (How could I get through?)

[Verse: Kid Cudi]
Mhm, here we go strappin', we up
Never forget all the memories
Sittin', I sip out my cup
Thinkin' I should be a better me
Truly I'm blessed from the start
So much to say in these melodies, oh
Stare at the sky, the moon singin' sweet
Oh, my God, such a sweet moment
Angels, they say I'm not ever weak, such a lonely moment
Heaven knows I might never sleep, trouble in my soul
Hey, I've been prayin', life can be drainin', oh
Hey, we were late, tryna keep haulin' on
I'm ashamed and yet, what I will see, ain't nobody knows, so I go

[Chorus: Don Toliver, Kanye West & Kid Cudi]
How can I get through? (Don't leave so soon)
How can I get through? (To the moon)
How can I get through? (To the moon)
Early afternoon, I wanna go to the moon (Take you to the moon)
Don't leave so soon (Woah)
Don't leave so soon
How could I get through? (Yeah)
How can I get through? (Ooh)
Early afternoon, I wanna go to the moon (Ooh, take you to the moon)
Don't leave so soon (Ooh)
Don't leave so soon (Don't leave so soon)
How could I get through? (How could I get through?)

[Outro: Kid Cudi, Don Toliver]
Yeah-yeah
Woah-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Woah-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

[Intro: Pop Smoke]
****, we made it
****, we made it
****, we made it

[Chorus: Pop Smoke]
****, we made it (Grr, woo, bah)
****, we made it, we made it (Woo)
****, we made it (Woo)
Thank God that I made it (Grrt, bah)
****, we made it, we made it (Woo)
Look, mama, I made it (Grrt)

[Verse: Pop Smoke]
Look, I remember the days, same 'fit for a week straight
I used to eat fifty-cent cake, now it's Philippe's
It's Philippe's for the steak
Buy it, I don't care what it cost
And I always keep a pole
I did a hundred on a pro
If you droppin' a woo, we come where you live
Glock 9, infrared
Pull up and еmpty the clip
Dread had the strap all summеr
In the Floss movin' reckless
Do not play with me, ****, I keep a K with me

[Chorus: Pop Smoke]
****, we made it (Grr, woo)
****, we made it, we made it (Woo)
****, we made it (Woo)
Thank God that I made it
Lyrics from Drink Champs Snippet

[Chorus: Kanye West]
If I let go
I gotta let go
I gotta let it go
I got it, let's go

[Verse: Kanye West]
Flying to the Mondrian-drian-drian

[Intro: Roddy Ricch & Kanye West]
Life change when you famous
I remember, back before the chains, we was nameless
Went through stages just to hop on new stages
Open up your eyes, man, they only entertainers
And I cannot sell my soul (Soul)
And I cannot sell my soul (Soul)
And I cannot sell my soul (Yeah, soul)
And I cannot sell my soul (Jesus saved my soul)
And I cannot sell my soul

[Verse 1: Roddy Ricch, Kanye West & both]
I've been at the top shinin' like a light pole
And I'm just a product of whatever I was raised in
This money sanctified, so I gotta say it again
They said I was mad at the Grammys
But I'm lookin' at my Grammy right now
Pulled up on Ye, and I said, "They don't understand me"
I just want my dawg to pipe down
'Cause when you really came from the trenches
You was raised in the trenches (Mm)
You feel like you trailblazed for the trenches (Mm)
I hope God can forgive me for the days that I was sinnin' (Mhm)

[Chorus: Roddy Ricch & Kanye West]
The truth is only what you get away with, huh?
(Man, all these lyin' ****)
I said the truth is only what you get away with, huh?
Ayy, that's why a lot of these **** be fakin', huh
Made it through the trials and tribulations, huh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Uh, uh, well, well, here goes
Well, here goes, but here goes
I was one of them weirdos of the pure soul
That would go to the flea market to buy fake clothes
Every color Girbauds, every Cutlass is cold
Every cousin that stole, every summer was cold
Out of all of the Moes, out of all of the Folks
After all of the jokes, I'm the one that was chose
All of my friends love to gangbang
How we in my car and you say we ain't in the same lane?
When we both had Pelles on
And we was scammin' for the prom before Chief Keef was "Bang, Bang"
Always had mob ties
Stood on my six points, how could I not rise?
Love, truth, peace, freedom, justice, but I'm not five
This Southside, and we outside
This Southside, and we outside
This Southside, and we outside
This Southside, and we outside
This Southside, and we outside
And for all the guys that went to the White House and said, "Free the old man"
Every day I put my life on the line to feed the whole clan
Personal worth is not what a person is worth
I can give a dollar to every person on Earth
Man, it's gotta be God's plan
Man, I swear these boys keep playin'
We gon' have to square up then
We gon' have to send it up then
We gon' have to send it up then
We gon' have to send it up then, uh
We gon' have to send it up then
We gon' have to send it up then
My favorite place to send it

[Bridge: Kanye West]
It ain't how it used to be
This the new me, so get used to me
It ain't how it used to be
This the new me, so get used to me
Lookin' in the mirror, it's the truth of me
Lookin' at my kids, it's the proof of me
Devil get behind me, I'm loose, I'm free
Father, Holy Spirit, let loose on me
Father, I'm Yours exclusively
Devil get behind me, I'm loose, I'm free
Father, Holy Spirit, let loose on me
Father, I'm Yours exclusively
Devil get behind me, I'm loose, I'm free
Devil get behind me, I'm loose, I'm free

[Chorus: Roddy Ricch]
The truth is only what you get away with, huh
I said the truth is only what you get away with, huh?
Ayy, that's why a lot of these **** be fakin', huh
Made it through the trials and tribulations, huh

[Outro: Shenseea]
Woah, oh, yeah-yeah
The truth the only thing you get away with (Can't get away)
Oh, no (No)
The truth the only thing you get away with (Woah-woah, oh)
The truth (I did it), the truth
The truth the only thing you get away with
Oh-oh (Altogether, trust again)
The truth the only thing you get away with
(I can trust again, I can only trust in Him, woah)
The truth (Oh, yeah)
The truth the only thing you get away with (Can't get away)
Oh, oh
The truth the only thing you get away with
The truth (The truth), the truth (Woah)
He know every side of, every side of you (Oh)
Don't shine through
They could never hide from you (The truth)
He can see it, birdseye view
The truth the only thing you get away with
Won't get away
Oh, oh
They can never hide from you
They can never hide, hide from you (No, no)
The truth
The truth the only thing you get away with
Get away, get away, oh-woah
The truth the only thing you get away with
The truth, the truth
The truth the only thing you get away with

All the ladies look at me and act coy
I just like to put my hands up in the air
I want that girl dancing over there

Look at her go on the dance floor
She's amazing on the dance floor
When she moves, girl, I want more
Keep it going, girl, like I got an encore
You got me sayin'

Go, little bad girl, little bad girl
Go, little bad girl, little bad girl
Go, little bad girl, little bad girl
Go, little bad girl, go, little bad girl

Let's go
Oh yeah, they tell me I'm a bad boy
All the ladiеs look at me and act coy
I just like to put my hands up in the air
I want that girl dancing ovеr there

Look at her go on the dance floor
She's amazing on the dance floor
When she moves, girl, I want more
Keep it going, girl, like I got an encore

Shaking her ass from the left to the right
Moving it 'round just the way that I like
I wanna see it move like a movie on flight
She got it how I want it and I want it all night

Look at her go on the dance floor
She's amazing on the dance floor
When she moves, girl, I want more

[Intro]
Say yeah, 'Trakk!
I apologize man, it was last minute
So me ask for this in advance
SLR, yeah
Said they lean on me
Niggas tried to dream on me
Told that nigga he can lean on me
Fall asleep and have a dream on me
Nigga, yeah yeah yeah yeah

[Verse]
You see, it takes niggas weeks
They need a comfort zone and some beats
Lollygaggers to poly matters that go over responses
Get all layered and technical in they content
Press record, then I bring the receipts
Lambda lambda lambda, I think that shit was sweet
I wish I could just kiss you on the cheek
Nerds have they hands in everything
Gangsters won't even touch the police
Won't you tell your niggas get that
Take some of those cool fullies and go and get some of our shit back
Your problem is you ain't never have no impact
Kit-Kats and chit-chat and syntax won't make up for how much you sit back
I think that nigga scared
He never leave Heaven 'cause he already dead
Damn, nigga are you insane?
What's the point in knowing how to point and aim
If the niggas you gon' bang look exactly the same?
That ain't motherfucking cool, that's a motherfucking shame
This ain't no motherfucking game
That's why I think you are a motherfucking lame
We both wear glasses, the difference is
I was in school thinking it was cool, you was thinking of skipping classes
Listening to your track record, I could see you were skipping classics
I did it on my first one and delivered to the masses
Your songs are immemorable, your verses are impenetrable
I ain't even listen to that diss record
I only fuck with you 'cause your interviews
I ain't even trip when you called me a bitch
I was like, "Look at Salem, calling me a witch"
Look at how they made him, look how much they gave him
Look at all the assists, nigga, if it wasn't for Premier
You wouldn't be, if it wasn't for, if it wasn't for
If it wasn't for, if it wasn't for, nigga, I got a dozen more
Hov think I'm Hov, Nas think I'm Nas
That's the trick, you ain't gotta think when niggas already think you are
Muah!
Your story crooked and your book too, pass the dumb shit
But you would shoot somebody's son holding Sun Chips
I wish they would've left Biz here, and fucking took you
And all your hyper-technical hypotheticals
In life, I've never met with you, from a distance, I accepted you
From the podcast, I been kind of skeptical
This ain't our first clash, this is just one of the several
I ain't trying to bash, but it was like you was off your schedule
You was throwing more than jabs, I was like, "This nigga's incredible"
We had to fucking edit you
I don't know what vegan Detroit vegetable Dr. Sebi diet infected you
To think that we share the same metrics or somehow I was less than you
And I was the type of nigga that you could get really disrespectful to
I ain't never lectured you, I get energetic and joke
But in real talk, nigga, I ain't never disrespected you
I'ma punch you in your fucking face and we all think it's silly
I'm thinking like "Won't this bitch nigga clean up his fucking city?"
I mean you got all of the clout, know how to bring all them niggas out
You can walk the walk, I mean, we seen you walk all over your house
But me and Mickey is geeks because you got some heat
Like I didn't go to the closet and put guns all over the couch
Your mental health hotline, I think that shit is grown up
But you're the very last nigga that should be picking that phone up
I spit your verse to get immersed inside my enemy
And to remind you nigga, I got to go through you just to get to me
Subtle subordination
Perpetual sidekick, nigga sort of a station that you used to
So you ain't got to get all extremely too personal on your albums
When you not surrounded by bigger artists to fucking boost you
Nigga, you called me, I didn't recruit you
But no regrets, I take it as a test
You said, "Lupe, you gotta have some grace
Not be so haphazardly to put the truth all in they face"
Now that I think about it, that's kind of half-and-half
If a nigga asked you for the strap, why would you keep it in the stash?
If you ran the world, we'd get defeated in a flash
You really gonna be the boss, can't keep secrets from the staff
I learned that in the streets, nigga sweeping trash
Keeping my city clean while you was talking 'bout beating a nigga's ass
That shit is wack, long live backpack rap
Fuck these Monster-drinking, new-age conscious thinking
Farrakhan today, gangster tomorrow, one foot in they sorrow
Another foot in the trap
Killers who easily triggered by a little niggas attacks
Who have the audacity to ask rappers to rap
Facts!

[Bridge]
Mickey!
Ayy, ayy, listen, I ain't done, nigga
Check this shit out, look, ayy

[Verse 2]
In seven minutes he did it, if he knew how to freestyle
He could've rented Heaven for seven minutes
And been done what needed to be done by the second sentence
All these extra innings may come across as master
But my impression's apprentice
Your penmanship has the fingerprints of a gimmick
And affection and the intimacy of impressions of that nigga you friends with
I ain't gotta say it to say it
I can't even blame you, the nigga's one of my favorites
Fuck that, back to my status
All icy, talk spicy like the House of Atreides
Inwardly successful, and outwardly I've made it
Clearly, if I was a regular rapper, you wouldn't even come near me
This nigga think he Siri, the answer to your queries
What's Siri to Steve Jobs? A Budden to Tahiry?
I'm excessively cheery, promote my niggas' theories
What's an alien to a pentagon report? I see your brother tryna cheerlead
That's what he's supposed to do
And everybody that's fucking close to you
'Posed support, push you forth
And calm your black ass down 'cause they ain't put you in The Source
You chose violence
I just wanna know when you gon' respond to Osyris
And go to E.O.Dub, battle in front a judge
Instead of hitting Smack and tryna entertain the thugs
Come and fuck with us, nerds!

[spoken]
Uh, the next one's by Bruce Springsteen

Woah, woah
Woah, woah

Hey little girl, is your daddy home?
Did he go and leave you all alone?
Oh no, I got a bad desire
Oh oh oh, I'm on fire

Tell me baby, is he good to you?
Can he do to you the things that I do?
Oh no, I can take you higher
Oh oh oh, I'm on fire
Oh oh oh, I'm on fire

Woah, woah
Woah, woah

Sometimes it's like someone took a knife, baby
Edgy and dull and cut a six-inch valley
Through the middle of my soul
Woah
At night I wake up with the sheets soaking wet
And a freight train running through the middle of my head
Only you can cool my desire
Oh oh oh, I'm on fire
Woah, I'm on fire

Woah, woah
Woah, woah

Woah, I'm on fire
Woah, I'm on fire

[spoken]
Thank you!
When the soul of the city was laid to rest
And the nights forgotten and left for dead
Ooooh
Ooooh

I happened on a house built of living light
Where everything evil disappears and dies
Ooooh
Ooooh

When they love you, and they will
Tell 'em all they're loving my shadow
And if they try to slow you down
Tell 'em all to go to hell

When they love you, and they will
Tell 'em all they're loving my shadow
And if they try to slow you down
Tell 'em all to go to hell

I settled in slowly to this house that you call home
To blood and breath, fear, flesh and bone
Ooooh
Ooooh
Blush of our bodies in the heat of the night
All day the day after, reddened the skies
Ooooh
Ooooh

When they love you, and they will
Tell 'em all they're loving my shadow
And if they try to slow you down
Tell 'em all to go to hell

When they love you, and they will
Tell 'em all they're loving my shadow
And if they try to slow you down
Tell 'em all to go to hell

It's a lifeless life with no fixed address to give
But you're not mine to die for anymore so I must live
Ooooh
Ooooh

Born of a bottle, from heaven's hand
And now you know and here I am
Here I am
Ooooh

When they love you, and they will
Tell 'em all they're loving my shadow
And if they try to slow you down
Tell 'em all to go to hell
When they love me, and they will
Tell 'em all they're loving your shadow
And if they try to slow me down
I'll tell 'em all to go to hell

[Verse 1: Sia]
A shot in the dark
A past, lost in space
And where do I start?
The past and the chase
You hunted me down
Like a wolf, a predator
I felt like a deer in love lights

[Pre-Chorus: Sia]
You loved me and I froze in time
Hungry for that flesh of mine
But I can't compete with a she wolf who has brought me to my knees
What do you see in those yellow eyes?
'Cause I'm falling to pieces

[Chorus: Sia]
Falling to pieces
Falling to pieces

[Verse 2: Sia]
Did she lie and wait?
Was I bait to pull you in?
The thrill of the kill
You feel is a sin
I lay with the wolves
Alone, it seems
I thought I was part of you

[Pre-Chorus: Sia]
You lovеd me and I froze in time
Hungry for that flеsh of mine
But I can't compete with a she wolf who has brought me to my knees
What do you see in those yellow eyes?
'Cause I'm falling to pieces

[Chorus: Sia]
Falling to pieces
Falling to pieces

[Bridge: Sia]
(Woah-oh-oh-oh)
(Woah-oh)
(Woah-oh-oh-oh)
(Woah-oh)

[Chorus: Sia]
I'm falling to pieces
Falling to pieces

[Intro: Wiz Khalifa]
Is this thing on? Word

[Chorus: Bruno Mars & Wiz Khalifa]
So what? We get drunk
So what? We don't sleep
We’re just havin' fun
We don’t care who sees
So what? We go out (Ayy, let me get a lighter, please)
That’s how it's supposed to be
Living young and wild and free (Keep the L in there)

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
So what I keep ‘em rolled up?
Saggin’ my pants, not caring what I show
Keep it real, if y'all don't know me
Keep it player for these bros
It look clean, don't it?
Washed it the other day, watch how you lean on it
Give me some 501 jeans on it
Roll up bigger than King Kong’s fingers
And burn them things down ’til they stingers
You a class clown and if I skip for the day
I’m with your chick smokin’ grade A

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
You know what?
It’s like I’m 17 again
Peach fuzz on my face
Lookin’, on the case
Tryna find a hella taste
Oh my god, I’m on the chase, Chevy
It's gettin’ kinda heavy, relevant, sellin’ it
Dippin’ away, time keeps slippin’ away
Zip in the safe, flippin’ for pay
Tippin’ like I’m drippin’ in paint
Upfront, four (four), like, “Khalifa put the *ding* in a J”

[Chorus: Bruno Mars]
So what? We get drunk
So what? We don't sleep
We’re just havin' fun
We don’t care who sees
So what? We go out
That’s how it's supposed to be
Living young and wild and free

[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa & Snoop Dogg]
And I don't even care
'Long as me and my team in there
There's gon' be some green in the air
Tell 'em Mac
Blowin' everywhere we goin' and now you knowin'
When I step right up, get my lighter so I can light up
That's how it should be done
Soon as you thinkin' you're down
Find how to turn things around
Now things are lookin' up
From the ground up, pound up, this Taylor Gang
So turn my sound up and mount up and do my thang
Now I'm chillin', fresh outta class, feelin'
Like I'm on my own and I could probably own a building
Got my own car, no job, no children
Had a science project, me and Mac killed it
T-H-C, M-A-C, D-E-V, H-D-3, **** as me
This is us, we gon' fuss
And we gon' fight and we gon' roll
And live off life

[Chorus: Bruno Mars]
So what? We get drunk
So what? We don't sleep
We’re just havin' fun
We don’t care who sees
So what? We go out
That’s how it's supposed to be
Living young and wild and free

[Bridge: Wiz Khalifa]
Yea, roll one, smoke one
When you live like this you’re supposed to party
Roll one, smoke one, and we're all just having fun
So we just, roll one, smoke one
When you live like this you’re supposed to party
Roll one, smoke one, and we're all just having fun

[Chorus: Bruno Mars]
So what? We get drunk
So what? We don't sleep
We’re just havin' fun
And we don’t care who sees
So what? We go out
That’s how it's supposed to be
Living young and wild and free

[Outro: Snoop Dogg]
We don’t care who sees
That’s how it's supposed to be
Living young and wild and free

[Chorus]
When you wake up in the morning
And you're shadowed by the darkness of the night
When you wake up in the morning
Darling, I'll be by your side

[Verse 1]
When you get a little lonely
And you lose your rhythm, don't give up the fight
When you wake up in the morning
Darling, I'll be by your side

[Refrain]
I'll be there by your side
I'll be everything you wanted
I'll be there by your side
If you need a light that's shining
I'll be there
I'll be there

[Chorus]
When you wake up in the morning
And you're shadowed by the darkness of the night
When you wake up in the morning
Darling, I'll be by your side

[Refrain]
I'll be there by your side
I'll be everything you wanted
I'll be there by your side
If you need a light that's shining
I'll be there

[Interlude]
Oh
(Darkness of the night)
Oh-oh
(I'll be by your side)

[Bridge]
Oh, so lay out your hand
'Cause you know that you can
There'll be fire again in the da-ark
Hold out your hand
Let the stars shoot again
Let the light shine in through the dark
And I'll be there
Oh-oh

[Outro]
I'll be there by your side
If you need a light that's shining
I'll be there
I'll be there

[Intro: 20th Century Steel Band]
Children growing, women producing
Men go work and some go stealing
Everyone's got to make a living

[Verse: Kanye West]
No more promos, no more photos
No more logos, no more chokeholds
We on Bezos, we get payrolls
Trips to Lagos, connect like LEGOs
Make this final, make this, my eyes closed
Burn false idols, Jesus' disciples
I can feel your pain now, I done bled my vein out
New level the game now, simulation changed
No more problems, no more argue
No more askin', "Who really arе you?"
I know the real you, you know we feel you
You know Hе hears you, you know we with you
Straight from Beirut, Chicago, Beirut
You cray? We cray, too
You pray? We pray, too
Never too late for Him to save you
This your movie 'cause no one can play you
Devil, lay down, Devil, lay down
This that level, make devils pray now (Heaven and Hell)
Hold up, no peace, hold up, police
Don't call police, just stay focused (Is on Earth)
Pray for new life, pray for new breath
Hey, Lord, make sure it's safe for who's left (Heaven and Hell)
Know you can't find a place to rest
Know the Lord my bulletproof vest (Is on Earth)
When we survive, know that we blessed
Save my people through the music

[Outro: Kanye West]
Let it grrat, let it grrat, grrat
Let it grrat, grrat, grrat, grrat, grrat
Let it grrat, grrat, grrat
Let it grrat, let it grrat, grrat
Let it grrat, grrat, grrat, grrat, grrat
Let it grrat
(Intro)

1. Everybody knows where you go when the sun goes down. I think you only live to see the lights uptown. I wasted my time when I would try, try, try. When the lights have lost their glow, you'll cry, cry, cry
2. I lie awake at night to wait til you come in. You stay a little while and then you're gone again. Every question that I ask, I get a lie, lie, lie. For every lie you tell, you're gonna cry, cry, cry
Chorus: You're gonna cry, cry, cry and you'll cry alone when everyone's forgotten and you're lеft on your own. You're gonna cry, cry, cry

(Solo)

3. Soon your sugar daddies will all be gonе. You'll wake up some cold day and find you're alone. You're gonna call for me, but I'm gonna tell you bye, bye, bye. When I turn around and walk away, you'll cry, cry, cry. When your fickle love gets old, no one will care for you. Then you'll come back to me for a little love that's true. I'll tell you no and you're gonna ask me why, why, why? When I remind you of all of this, you'll cry, cry, cry. You're gonna cry, cry, cry and you'll want me then. It'll hurt when you think what a fool you've been. You're gonna cry, cry, cry

[Verse 1: Kanye West & Fivio Foreign]
Okay, now they got me, wanna rap again
Heal the wound and then you stab me in my back again (Uh)
You the type to play the joke and try to hide your hand (Uh)
Not the type to come around and try to play your friend (Bomb)
You the type to cut the grass and snake your bestest man
I'm the type to close the deal and cut my **** in
See me in person, I look like a ghost (Grr)
See me in person, I look like a ghost (Bow)
You wanna come in and play with the G.O.A.T (Bow)
You wanna come in and play with the G.O.A.T (God body)
All you rap **** sound like me, can't tell who is who
You got no real identity, can't tell you from you
Price went up (Yeah), angel investor (Yeah)
Price went up (Uh), angel investor (Yeah)

[Chorus: Kanye West & Fivio Foreign]
Okay, okay, I'm not okay
Think they're good, it's not okay
Okay, okay, not okay (Uh)
Think they’re good, get out the way (Uh)

[Verse 2: Lil Yachty]
Who said I did what? What did they do?
Why the hell you hatin' so damn hard? Someone must pay you
They don't keep me 'round 'cause I'm straight truth
My dawg locked up, had more home runs than Babe Ruth (Boom)
Had them chickens cleanin' my house, I told them, "Be of use" (Brr)
If I see disloyalty, then we gon' cut 'em loose (Yeah)
Havin' my hands 'round her neck, grip tight like a noose (Hee)
Tell you a story with a bad ending 'cause I'm not a Seuss (Yeah, bih')
Passin' 'round **** to the thugs for an immunity boost (Go)
Double cup filled to the top with the serenity juice (Yessir)
Moment of silence, R.I.P to Juice (Yeah, hey)
If they say it's up, it's up, I don't need a truce (Damn)
Everything I do is solely for the broken youth (Sheesh, yes)
I just took her over the mountain with my index (Wow)
She told me to go to Hell like I ain't been yet (Yuh)
And I still put in overtime like I ain't win yet

[Chorus: Kanye West & Lil Yachty]
Okay, okay, I'm not okay (Yuh)
Think they're good, it's not okay
Okay, okay, not okay
Think they're good, get out the way

[Verse 3: Rooga]
Yeah, it's been plenty times you closed the door on me
That **** really show me how much you say you a bro to me
Showed you love and you constantly cold-shouldered me
But ain't no goin' back to fixin' up, that's the older me, yeah
I'm done with all the fake ****, I had enough of that, yeah
I done had too many **** stab me in the back (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
They say they with you, but they really puttin' on a act
That's when **** hit the fan and all of a sudden, all the facts show
You gotta chin up and show a **** tough love
Let 'em go without you, just to show 'em what it was
We was so close, you would've thought we was blood
We got the same pain, we come from the mud
I swear this **** make me wanna put my all in it, yeah
You can hear the pain 'cause I put my heart in it, yeah
Most of these **** ain't real, they don't wanna see me winnin', no
Most of these **** ain't real, they don't wanna see me winnin', no

[Chorus: Kanye West & Rooga]
But it's okay, we gon' be okay
Only show up when we cut the cake (Oh, yeah)
Showin' love but we okay (We okay)
Find God 'fore it's too late

[Intro]
Life is a mystery
Everyone must stand alone
I hear you call my name
And it feels like home

When you call my name
It's like a little prayer
I’m down on my knees
I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour
I can feel your power
Just like a prayer
You know I'll take you there

[Verse 1]
I hear your voice
It's like an angel sighing
I have no choice
I hear your voice
Feels like flying
I close my eyes
Oh God, I think I’m falling
Out of the sky
I close my eyes
Heaven, help me

[Chorus]
When you call my name
It's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees
I wanna take you there

Just like a prayer
You know I'll take you there

It's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees
I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour

Just like a prayer
You know I'll take you there

Life is a mystery
Everyone must stand alone

Just like a prayer, I'll take you there

A long time ago

[Chorus]
But you got me messing around with you, baby
You got me crying on a killing floor, yeah

If I don't follow, yeah
My first mind
If I don't fallow, pretty baby
My first mind
I would have been gone since my second time
Yeah

[Bridge]
Lord knows, right now
I should have been gone
Lord knows, I should have been gone

Hey Joe, I said, where you going with that gun in your hand?

[Verse 2]

You know, I caught her messing around with another man

You know, I caught her messing around with another man

Hey Joe, you better run on down
Goodbye everybody, ow!
Hey Joe, run on down

[Spoken Intro: Jimi Hendrix]
Here's a song written by Dylan
A thing called "Like a Rolling Stone"

[Verse 1]
Once upon a time, you dressed so fine
Threw the bums a dime in your prime
Oh, didn't you?
People call, say "Beware doll
You're bound to fall"
You thought they all
A-kiddin' you
You used to laugh about
Everybody that was hangin' out
Now you don't talk so loud
Now you don't seem so proud
About having to be scrounging your next meal

[Chorus 1]
How does it feel?
How does it feel?
To be without a home?
Like a complete unknown?
Like a rolling stone?

[Verse 2]
Aw, you've gone to the finest school all right, Miss Lonely
But ya know ya only used to get juicеd in it
Nobody's ever taught ya how to live out on thе street
And now you’re gonna have to get used to it
You say you never compromise
With the mystery tramp, but now you realize
He's not selling any alibis
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
And say, “Do you want to make a deal?"

[Chorus 2]
How does it feel?
How does it feel?
To be on your own
With no direction home
A complete unknown
Like a rolling stone?

[Verse 3]
Aw, you never turned around to see the frowns
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all did tricks for you
Never understood that it ain't no good
You shouldn't let other people get your kicks for you
You used to ride on a chrome horse with your diplomat
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat
Ain't it hard when you discover that
He really wasn't where it's at
After he took from you everything he could steal?

[Chorus 3]
How does it feel?
How does it feel?
To hang on your own
With no direction home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone?

[Verse 4]
Aw, princess on the steeple and all the pretty people
They're all drinkin', thinkin' that they got it made
Exchangin' all precious gifts
But you'd better take your diamond ring, ya better pawn it, babe
You used to be so amused
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used
Go to him now, he calls ya, ya can't refuse
When ya ain't got nothin', you got nothin' to lose
You're invisible now, ya got no secrets to conceal

[Chorus 2]
How does it feel?
Aw, how does it feel?
To be on your own
With no direction home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone?

[Spoken Intro]
Right now, we're gonna dedicate this song to everybody here

[?] hearts and ears
It goes something like this
Yeah!
Yeah! What I say now?
Hey!
Yes, like I said before, it's really groovy
I'd like to bore you for about six or seven minutes to do a little thing
Yeah
Billy, 'cuse me for a minute, just let me play that guitar, right?
Right now, we're doin' thing by Bob Dylan
This little thing called "Like a Rolling Stone"

Were all a-kiddin' you
You used to, heh
Laugh about
Everybody that was, uh
Hangin' out
Look at ya
Now you don'
Talk so loud
Now you don't, baby
Seem so proud
About having to be scrounging, yeah

How does it feel?
How does it feel?
To be without a home?
Like a complete unknown?

With no direction home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone?

[Verse 1]
The morning is dead, and the day is too
There's nothing left here to lead me but the velvet moon
All my loneliness I have felt today
It's a little more than enough to make a man throw himself away
And I continue to burn the Midnight Lamp, alone

[Verse 2]
Now the smiling portrait of you
Is still hanging on my frowning wall
It really doesn't, it really doesn't bother me too much at all
It's just the ever falling dust that makes it so hard for me to see
That forgotten earring laying on the floor
Facing coldly towards the door

[Chorus]
And I continue to burn the Midnight Lamp, all alone
Burn!
Yeah, yeah
Lonely, lonely, lonely
Loneliness is such a drag!

[Verse 3]
So here I sit to face that same old fireplace
Getting ready for the same old explosion
Going through my mind
And soon enough, the time will tell
About the circus in the wishing well
And someone who will buy and sell for me
Someone who will toll my bell

[Chorus]
And I continue to burn the Midnight Lamp, all alone
Burn!
Yeah, yeah
Lonely, lonely, lonely
Loneliness is such a drag!

[Verse 1]
The morning is dead, and the day is too
There's nothing left here to lead me but the velvet moon
All my loneliness I have felt today
It's a little more than enough to make a man throw himself away
And I continue to burn the Midnight Lamp, alone

[Verse 2]
Now the smiling portrait of you
Is still hanging on my frowning wall
It really doesn't, it really doesn't bother me too much at all
It's just the ever falling dust that makes it so hard for me to see
That forgotten earring laying on the floor
Facing coldly towards the door

[Chorus]
And I continue to burn thе Midnight Lamp, all alone
Burn!
Yeah, yeah
Lonеly, lonely, lonely
Loneliness is such a drag!

[Verse 3]
So here I sit to face that same old fireplace
Getting ready for the same old explosion
Going through my mind
And soon enough, the time will tell
About the circus in the wishing well
And someone who will buy and sell for me
Someone who will toll my bell

[Chorus]
And I continue to burn the Midnight Lamp, all alone
Burn!
Yeah, yeah
Lonely, lonely, lonely
Loneliness is such a drag!

[Verse 1]
After all the jacks are in their boxes
And the clowns have all gone to bed
You can hear happiness staggering on down the street
Footprints dressed in red
And the wind whispers Mary

[Verse 2]
A broom is drearily sweeping
Up the broken pieces of yesterday's life
Somewhere a queen is weeping
Somewhere a king has no wife
And the wind it cries Mary

[Guitar solo]

[Verse 3]
The traffic lights they turn blue tomorrow
And shine their emptiness down on my bed
The tiny island sags downstream
'Cause the life they lived is dead
And the wind screams Mary

[Verse 4]
Will the wind ever remember
The names it has blown in the past?
And with its crutch, its old age, and its wisdom
It whispers no, this will be the last
And the wind cries Mary

[Spoken Intro: Jimi Hendrix, crowd]

We have to do it our own way, The Experience way, right?
And it goes something like this here:

[Intro]
Yeah

Well, I wish I was a catfish
Swimming in, Lord, the deep blue sea
I'd have all you pretty women
Fishing after me, fishing after me
Fishing after me, yeah
Ohh yeah, ohh yeah, ohh yeah, ohh yeah

[Verse 2]
When I went down, my girlfriends house
And I sat down, Lord, on her front step
And she said, "Come in now Jimi
My husband just now left, just now left"
Ohh yeah, ohh yeah, ohh yeah, ohh yeah

[Verse 3]
Well there's two, two trains running
But there's not one, Lord, that's going my way
You know there's a one train running at midnight
Other ones leave just for a day
Leave just for a day

[Outro]
Ohh yeah, ohh yeah, ohh yeah, ohh yeah

[Instrumental Outro]

[Intro]
Alright
Now dig this, baby

[Verse 1]
You don't care for me

[Pre-Chorus]
I have only one a-burnin' desire
Let me stand next to your fire

[Chorus]
(Let me stand next to your fire)
Hey, let me stand next to your fire

Whoa, let me stand, baby
(Let me stand next to your fire)
Let me stand
(Let me stand next to your fire)

Listen herе, baby
And stop acting so crazy
You say your mom ain't home, it ain't my concern
Just don't play with me, and you won't gеt burned

[Pre-Chorus]
I have only one a-itchin' desire
Let me stand next to your fire

[Chorus]
(Let me stand next to your fire)
Yeah, let me stand, baby
(Let me stand next to your fire)
Let me stand
(Let me stand next to your fire)
Oh, let me stand

[Interlude]
Oh! Move over, Rover
And let Jimi take over
Yeah, you know what I'm talkin' 'bout
Yeah, get on with it, baby

(Let me stand next to your fire)
Ow! A-let me stand

[Outro]
Yeah!
You better move over, baby
I ain't gonna hurt you, baby
Oh, I ain't talkin' 'bout your old lady
Ow!
Oh yeah, this is Jimi talkin' to you
Yeah, baby

[Intro]
Will I live tomorrow?
Well, I just can't say
Will I live tomorrow?
Well, I just can't say
But I know for sure
I don't live today

[Verse]
No sun comin' through my windows
Feel like I'm livin' at the bottom of a grave
No sun comin' through my windows
Feel like I'm livin' at the bottom of a grave
I wish you'd hurry up and execute me
So I can be on my miserable way

[Chorus]
I don't
Live today!
Maybe tomorrow
I just can't say; but, uh
I don't
Live today!

[Interlude]
It's such a shame to
Waste your time away like this

[Guitar solo]

[Chorus]
Well, I don't
Live today!
Maybe tomorrow
I just can't tell you, baby; but, uh
I don't
Live today!

[Interlude]
It's such a shame to
Spend the time away like this
Existing

[Interlude]
Yeah!
Ow!
Yeah!
Oh, no

[Instrumental]

[Interlude]
Oh, there ain't no life nowhere
Uh-huh, hmm

[Outro]
Are you experienced?
Get experienced
Get experienced
Are you experienced?

[Verse 1]
Well she's walking, through the clouds
With a circus mind that's running round
Butterflies and zebras
And moonbeams
And-a, fairytales
That's all she ever thinks about
Riding with the wind

[Verse 2]
When I'm sad, she comes to me
With a thousand smiles she gives to me free
It's alright, she said, it's alright
Take anything you want from me
Anything, anything
Fly on, little wing

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, little wing

[Verse 1]
There's a red house over yonder
That's where my baby stays
Lord, there's a red house over yonder
Lord, that's where my baby stays
I ain't been home to see my baby
In ninety nine and one half days

[Verse 2]
Wait a minute, something's wrong here
The key won't unlock this door
Wait a minute, something's wrong
Lord have mercy, this key won't unlock this door
Somethings goin' on here
I have a bad, bad feeling
That my baby don't live here no more
(That's alright I still got my guitar, look out now!)

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Well I might as well go on over yondеr
Way back up on the hill
(I got something to do)
Lord, I might as well go back ovеr yonder
Way back yonder 'cross the hill
'Cause if my baby don't love me no more
I know her sister will!

[Verse 1]
Purple haze all in my brain
Lately things, they don't seem the same
Acting funny, but I don't know why
'Scuse me while I kiss the sky

[Verse 2]
Purple haze all around
Don't know if I'm coming up or down
Am I happy or in misery?
Whatever it is, that girl put a spell on me
Help me! Help me!
Ah no, no

[Instrumental - Guitar solo]

[Verse 3]
Yeah! Purple haze all in my eyes
Don't know if it's day or night
You got me blowing, blowing my mind
Is it tomorrow, or just the end of time?

[Outro]
No, help me
No, yeah purple haze
Oh no, no
Oh, help me
Tell me, tell me
Can't go on like this
You makе me blow my mind
No, no, no
No, no, purple haze

[Verse 1]
Well, I stand up next to a mountain
And I chop it down with the edge of my hand
Well, I stand up next to a mountain
And I chop it down with the edge of my hand
Well, I pick up all the pieces and make an island
Might even raise a little sand
Yeah

[Chorus]
Because I'm a voodoo child
Lord knows I'm a voodoo child, baby

[Guitar solo]

[Verse 2]
I want to say one more last thing
I didn't mean to take up all your sweet time
I'll give it right back to ya one of these days, hahah
I said, I didn't mean to take up all your sweet time
I'll give it right back one of these days, oh yeah
If I don't meet you no more in this world
Then I'll meet you in the nеxt one
And don't be late
Don't bе late

[Chorus]
Because I'm a voodoo child, voodoo child
Lord knows I'm a voodoo child, baby

[Outro]
I'm a voodoo child, baby
I don't take no for an answer
Question no
Lord knows I'm a voodoo child, baby

[Verse 1]
Deep down in Louisiana close to New Orleans
Way back up in the woods among the evergreens
There stood a log cabin made of earth and wood
Where lived a country boy named Johnny B. Goode
Who never ever learned to read or write so well
But he could play a guitar just like a ringing a bell

[Chorus]
Go, go
Go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go
Johnny B. Goode

[Verse 2]
He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack
Go sit beneath the tree by the railroad track
Oh, the engineers would see him sitting in the shade
Strumming with the rhythm that the drivers made
People passing by they would stop and say
Oh my, but that little country boy could play

[Chorus]
Go, go
Go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go
Johnny B. Goode

[Verse 3]
His mother told him "Someday you will be a man
And you will be the leader of a big old band
Many people coming from miles around
To hear you play your music when the sun go down
Maybe someday your name will be in lights
Saying 'Johnny B. Goode Tonight'"

[Chorus]
Go, go
Go Johnny go
Go go go, Johnny go
Oh go go, Johnny go
Oh go go, Johnny go
Go, Johnny B. Goode

[Verse 1]
Well, it's one for the money
Two for the show
Three to get ready
Now go, cat, go
But don't you step on my blue suede shoes
You can do anything but lay off of my blue suede shoes

[Verse 2]
Well, you can knock me down
Step in my face
Slander my name
All over the place
Do anything that you want to do, but uh-uh
Honey, lay off of my shoes
Don't you step on my blue suede shoes
You can do anything but lay off of my blue suede shoes

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
You can burn my house
Steal my car
Drink my liquor
From an old fruit jar
Do anything that you want to do
But uh-uh honey, lay off of my shoes
Don't you step on my blue suede shoes
You can do anything but lay off of my blue suede shoes
Rock

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 1]
Well, it's one for the money
Two for the show
Three to get ready
Now go, cat, go
But don't you step on my blue suede shoes
You can do anything but lay off of my blue suede shoes

[Outro]
Well it's
Blue, blue, blue suede shoes
Blue, blue, blue suede shoes, yeah
Blue, blue, blue suede shoes baby
Blue, blue, blue suede shoes
You can do anything but lay off of my blue suede shoes

[Part I: Hey Baby (New Rising Sun)]

[Verse]
Hey, gypsy baby, where are you coming from?
She looked at me and smiled
And stared into space and said, "I'm coming from the land of the new rising sun"
And I said, "Hey baby, where are you trying to get to?"
Then she said, "I'm going to spread a lot of love around to everybody
A whole lot of peace of mind to you, and you, you
I said, "Baby, come along with your baby"
Yes, I'd come along
Then I fell in love, with you, baby, yeah

[Guitar Solo]

[Part II: In from the Storm]

[Verse]
Just came back from the storm
From the storm
I just came back, baby
Just came back from the storm
Well, I did not know it then
But I was suffеring, suffering
For my love to keep me warm
For my lovе to keep me warm
It was so cold and lonely
The wind and crying blue rain were tearing me up
Cold, cold, and lonely
Crying blue rain were tearing me up
I want to thank you, my sweet darling
For digging in the mud and picking me up
I wanna thank you for picking me up

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 1]
"There must be some kind of way out of here"
Said the joker to the thief
"There's too much confusion
I can't get no relief
Businessmen they drink my wine
Plowmen dig my earth
None will level on the line
Nobody offered his word"
Hey!

[Verse 2]
"No reason to get excited"
The thief, he kindly spoke
"There are many here among us
Who feel that life is but a joke
But, uh, but you and I, we've been through that
And this is not our fate
So let us stop talkin' falsely now
The hour's getting late
Hey!

[Guitar Solo]

Hey!

[Verse 3]
All along the watchtower
Princes kept the view
While all the women came and went
Barefoot servants too
Well, uh, outside in the cold distance
A wildcat did growl
Two riders were approaching
And the wind began to howl
Hey!

[Outro]
All along the watchtower
All along the watchtower

[Verse 1]
Well I, I just came back today
I just came back from the storm
Yeah

I said, I just came back, baby
I just came back from the storm
Yeah, from the storm

Well, I did not know it then
But I was suffering, suffering
For my love to keep me warm

[Chorus]

[x2]
It was so cold and lonely, yeah
The wind and crying blue rain
Were tearing me up

[Verse 2]
I want to thank you, my sweet darling
For digging in the mud and picking me up
Thank you so much
It was a crying blue rain, the burning my eyes
The wind and lightning struck by suprise
It was you, my love, who brought me in
I love you so much
I'll never stray from you again
Hey

[Outro]
I just came back today
I just came back to get my baby on her way
Yeah, yeah

[Verse]
Yeah
It was twenty years ago today
When 

[?] time to play
They've been going in and out of style
But they're 

[?] make a smile
So may I introduce to you
The act you've known felt like shit
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band

[Instrumental Outro]

[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
Here he comes, baby
Here comes your lover man
Here he comes
Here comes your lover man
I'm gonna get outta here
Get outta here as fast as I can
Reach up, baby
Hand me down my running shoes
Oh, reach up, baby
Hand me down my running shoes
See your man coming out the window
Lord, he ain't got time to lose

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2]
I wanna love you longer
Yes, I wanna love you stronger, baby
I wanna love you all night, baby
But that's your man over yonder
But that's your man, way over yonder now

[Instrumental Outro]

[Chorus: Vory]
Like who's here when I need a shoulder to lean on?
I hope you're here when I need them demons to be gone
And it's not fair that I had to fight 'em all on my own
Like who's here when I need a shoulder to lean on?
I hope you're here when I need them demons to be gone
And it's not fair that I had to fight 'em all on my own

[Verse 1: Vory]
Hard to keep my focus on what matters
Mandem hit my line like, "Some **** just got hit up on your block"
You can rest assured it's not us
'Cause we been out the wavе catchin' waves
They say, "We ain't seen you on thе block"
'Cause I been out the way
Chasin' millions in my sleep, I found the better way
Somewhere on an island, let me kick it, this my getaway
I pour up a drink for all my **** who ain't see the day
Tryna finish this with who I started with
Way too many fallen soldiers, no, I can't forgot
Hope they got headphones up in Heaven
You can vibe out and just hear this ****
It's just certain **** you can't forget

[Chorus: Vory]
Like who's here when I need a shoulder to lean on?
I hope you're here when I need them demons to be gone
And it's not fair that I had to fight 'em all on my own
Like who's here when I need a shoulder to lean on?
I hope you're here when I need them demons to be gone
And it's not fair that I had to fight 'em all on my own

[Verse 2: Lil Durk]
Kanye and Jay still brothers, they both billionaires
And we ain't see it, I lost my brother when we was millionaires
I wasn't scared to die, but him, that was my biggest fear
I got your son and your daughter like you still here
Know how it feel to lose a brother, we got a bond still
Twenty-six years, pops got out to see his son killed
And I don't give a **** if I hang with a Crip, I see blood still
I can be the cleanest millionaire, I'm from the mud still
Died with his chain on, I call it blood diamonds
It's to the point I drop my own lo' so they could find us
And it's been months and they still haven’t
Kanye did it for the city, he co-signed

[Chorus: Vory]
Like who's here when I need a shoulder to lean on?
I hope you're here when I need them demons to be gone
And it's not fair that I had to fight 'em all on my own

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Smoke a opp pack ain't funny like that
It get ugly like that, can't get no money like that
Holy Father, please, let me step in
Can't talk to buddy like that, it get bloody like that
Whole lotta steppers and they steppin'
And they sunny like that
And they comin' right back
And when you on tour, bet you check-in
'Cause my guys back to work, it's a Monday like that
And when you text, change the beginnin' of every word
You will speak to me with only no cap
Me and your big homie go back
And homie don't rap, you don't know me like that

[Chorus: Vory]
Like who's here when I need a shoulder to lean on?
I hope you're here when I need the demons to be gone
And it's not fair that I had to fight 'em all on my own
Like who's here when I need a shoulder to lean on?
I hope you're here when I need the demons to be gone
And it's not fair that I had to fight 'em all on my own

[Outro: Vory]
Like who's here when I need a shoulder to lean on?
I hope you're here when I need them demons to be gone
And it's not fair that I had to fight 'em all on my own
Like who's here when I need a shoulder to lean on?
I hope you're here when I need them demons to be gone
And it's not fair that I had to fight 'em all on my own

[Intro: Kanye West]
Take what you want
Take everything
Take what you want
Take what you want

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Better that I change my number so you can't explain
Violence in the night, violence in the night
Priors, priors, do you have any priors?
Well, that one time
I'll be honest, I'll be honest
We all liars
Let it go

[Pre-Chorus: Kanye West]
I'll be honest, we all liars
I'll be honest, we all liars
I'm pulled over and I got priors
Guess we goin' down, guess who's goin' to jail?

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Guess who's goin' to jail tonight?
Guess who's goin' to jail tonight?
Guess who's goin' to jail tonight?
God gon' post my bail tonight

[Verse 2: Kanye West & Dem Jointz]
Don't you curse at mе on text, why you try to hit the flex?
I hold up, likе, "What?"
I scroll, I scroll up like, "Next"
Guess who's getting 'exed?
Like, next
Guess who's getting 'exed?
You made a choice that's your bad, single life ain't so bad
But we ain't finna go there
Something's off, I'll tell you why
Guess who's goin' to jail tonight?
What a grand plan to sell you out
I could scream and shout, let it out

[Pre-Chorus: Kanye West]
I'll be honest, we all liars
I'll be honest, we all liars
I'm pulled over and I got priors
Guess we goin' down, guess who's goin' to jail?

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Guess who's goin' to jail tonight?
Guess who's goin' to jail tonight?
Guess who's goin' to jail tonight?
God gon' post my bail tonight

[Verse 3: JAY-Z]
God in my cells, that's my celly
Made in the image of God, that's a selfie
Pray five times a day, so many felonies
Who gon' post my bail? Lord, help me
Hol' up, Donda, I'm with your baby when I touch back road
Told him, "Stop all of that red cap, we goin' home"
Not me with all of these sins, castin' stones
This might be the return of The Throne (Throne)
Hova and Yeezus, like Moses and Jesus
You are not in control of my thesis
You already know what I think 'bout think pieces
Before you ask, he already told you who he think he is
Don't try to jail my thoughts and think precincts
I can't be controlled with programs and presets
Reset
On my cell, in my cell tonight
Don't have to see you to touch you
This is what braille look like, it's on sight
If they take me to jail, call my girl, tell her send my mail
We know what Hell look like
Still, it's a hell of a life, yikes

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Guess who's goin' to jail tonight?
Guess who's goin' to jail tonight?
Guess who's goin' to jail tonight?
God gon' post my bail tonight

[Intro: Donda West]
Two lessons that he passed along to his children
The first is that, no matter what, you never abandon your family
The second was that, no matter what, you love unconditionally
It is that kind of love that made my father the kind of father and the kind of man he is
He vowed that he would never walk away from his family, and he never has

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
You know why my spirit's callin'
Darkness can't take light from me
Haven't you gone far enough?
Sacrificed the ones you love
Gave up on your sanity
Like some twisted fantasy
What would I say to everything?
Your actions cost everything

[Refrain]
My, my, my family
My family, I'm losing my family
I'm losing my family
Losing my family

[Verse 2]
Cried out to you in my sleep, you thought it was a dream
"Why won't you answer me? I'm in the room"
"Tell mom you're sorry," she's screaming at me
"Daddy, how could you leave? Daddy, how could you leave?"
"Come back tonight, daddy, please, come back tonight, daddy, please"
"Daddy, how could you leave? Daddy, how could you leave?"
She don't know what this means, "How'd you become so mean?"
I wish I never screamed, alcohol when you breathe
These things, these things, these things, these things, they sting
"Daddy, promise you'll stay, don't you love me? Love me"

[Outro: Donda West]
Two lessons that he passed along to his children
The first -is that, no matter what, you never abandon your family
-Is that, no matter what, you never abandon your family
-Is that, no matter what, you never abandon your family
-Is that, no matter what, you never abandon your family
-Is that, no matter what, you never abandon your family
-Is that, no matter what, you never abandon your family
-Is that, no matter what, you never abandon your family
It is that kind of love that made my father the kind of father and the kind of man he is
He vowed that he would never walk away from his family, and he never has

[Verse 1]
So you wanna give up on us?
Wager all we had on lust
Sorry that I'm not enough for you
Settle for a careless love
Tarnish everything you touch
Sorry that I'm not enough for you, you

[Chorus]
Call me when your heart breaks
Tell me that you made a mistake
Saying that you couldn't stay
Now you know you need me
Call me when your heart breaks
Tell me that you made a mistake
Saying that you couldn't stay
Now you know you need me
So maybe don't leave me this way

[Verse 2]
You always make it sound so easy
Just stop the singing, start the healing
Like ya shouldn't be defeated by him leaving for no reason, eh

[Chorus]
Call me when your heart breaks
Tell me that you made a mistake
Saying that you couldn't stay
Now you know you need me
Call me when your heart breaks
Tell me that you made a mistake
Saying that you couldn't stay
Now you know you need me
So maybe don't leave me this way

[Bridge]
Don't you treat me like a fool
Don't you treat me like a foolish child
Soon as I get over you
You're telling me "Come over, stay a while"
A while, a while, a while, a while, a while, a while

[Chorus]
Call me when your heart breaks
Tell me that you made a mistake
Saying that you couldn't stay (mmm)
Now you know you need me
Call me when your heart breaks
Tell me that you made a mistake
Saying that you couldn't stay
Now you know you need me
So maybe don't leave me this way

[Chorus]
I can't help falling in love
I fall deeper and deeper the further I go
Kisses sent from heaven above
They get sweeter and sweeter the more that I know

[Verse 1]
When you know the notes to sing
You can sing most anything
That's what my mama told me
'Round and 'round and 'round you go
When you find love, you'll always know
I let my father mold me

[Pre-Chorus]
Daddy couldn't be all wrong, wrong, wrong
And my mama made me learn this song
That's why

[Chorus]
I can't help falling in love
I fall deeper and deeper the further I go
Kisses sent from heaven above
They get sweeter and sweeter the more that I know
The deeper I go

[Verse 2]
All is fair in love she said
Think with your heart, not with your head
That's what my mama told me
All the little things you do
Will end up coming back to you
I let my father mold me

[Pre-Chorus]
Daddy couldn't be all wrong
And my mama made me learn this song
That's why

[Chorus]
I can't help falling in love
I fall deeper and deeper the further I go
Kisses sent from heaven above
They get sweeter and sweeter the more that I know
I can't help falling in love
I fall deeper and deeper the further I go
Kisses sent from heaven above
They get sweeter and sweeter the more that I know

[Bridge]
Someone said that romance was dead
And I believed it instead of remembering
What my mama told me
Let my father mold me
Then you tried to hold me
You remind me what they said
This feeling inside
I can't explain
But my love is alive
And I'm never gonna hide it again

[Pre-Chorus]
Hey, yeah, hey, yeah
Hey, yeah, hey, yeah

I fall deeper and deeper the further I go
Kisses sent from heaven above
They get sweeter and sweeter the more that I know
I can't help falling in love
I fall deeper and deeper the further I go
Kisses sent from heaven above
They get sweeter and sweeter the more that I know

And when it comes to billions, I'll take two
It's only one life, you don't get two
So live life, don't let it live you

[Verse 2: Anthony Watts]
I got a pocket full of hundred dollar bills
Put on a jacket 'cause these diamonds give you chills
Two shots, I'm running
Two and I'm stunning tonight, tonight (Yeah)
Look in the mirror, I'm like who the hell is hе?
So many whips and cribs, I'm losing track of keys
Ooh, up to something
Ooh yeah, I lovе it alright, alright

It's only one life, you don't get two
So live life, don't let it live you

Make a baby will ya


Okay should I keep it vague for him
I'm too sick if I go, to the plague for him
I won't spend another day mourning

Where do you wanna go?
Can you make it on your own?
I jump into knee deep water
But I’m sinking, somehow
Trouble on every corner
But you’re all I need now

You, you give me something
What it is I just don’t know
But I feel like a time bomb ticking
And without you I might blow

You give me the feeling
You give me a hiding place
Our love is bitter
But I really like the taste
Who said it was easy
Taking it day by day
But always remember
That I’ll love you anyway

You make it feel right
Oh Oh Ooh Oh Oh Ooh

[Verse 1]
Purple haze all in my brain
Lately things, they don't seem the same
Acting funny, but I don't know why
'Scuse me while I kiss the sky

[Verse 2]
Purple haze all around
Don't know if I'm coming up or down
Am I happy or in misery?
Whatever it is, that girl put a spell on me
Help me! Help me!
Ah no, no

[Instrumental - Guitar solo]

[Verse 3]
Yeah! Purple haze all in my eyes
Don't know if it's day or night
You got me blowing, blowing my mind
Is it tomorrow, or just the end of time?

[Outro]
No, help me
No, yeah purple haze
Oh no, no
Oh, help me
Tell me, tell me
Can't go on like this
You makе me blow my mind
No, no, no
No, no, purple haze

And-a, fairytales
That's all she ever thinks about
Riding with the wind

When I'm sad, she comes to me
With a thousand smiles she gives to me free

Earth to number 1
Now it's getting hot like Kelvin

[Verse: Nicki Minaj]

Feel like I’m in a UFO
Baby when I F you slow
Don’t leave me boy, lest you know
Call you bro, not incest tho
We’re not bio (yuh)
Walls closing in and you’re all up in me
Like a boy with ADD you just wanna spin me
Feeling OCD so come rearrange me
Hoe to a house-whore, sorry you can’t change me
I’m claustrophobic (yuh), make a safe-space
Space-food, zero-G pussy all in your face
(9, 2, 4)
Boy get out that rocket, I'ma win this space-race

[Chorus: ???]

[Verse 1]
I used to live in a room full of mirrors
All I could see was me
Well, I take my spirit and I smash my mirrors
Now the whole world is here for me to see
I said the whole world is here for me to see
Now I am searching for my love to be
Hey!

[Chorus]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
Rubber glass was all in my brain
Cotton screaming crying in my head
Rubber glass was all in my brain
Just the thought of my dreams cut me in my bed
And just the thought of my dreams cut me in my bed
I said making love was strangе in my bed

[Chorus]
Yeah, yeah, yеah, yeah, yeah

[Bridge]
All right

Can't find the floor
Nowhere at all
See nothing but sunshine
All around

[Outro]
Love come shining over the mountains
Love come shining over the sea
Love will shine on my baby
Then I'll know who's exactly for me
Lord, I'll know who will be for me
In the meantime, which is a groovy time

[Verse 1]
Is it romantic how all my elegies eulogize me?
I'm not cut out for all these cynical clones
These hunters with cell phones

[Chorus]
Take me to the Lakes where all the poets went to die
I don't belong and, my beloved, neither do you
Those Windermere peaks look like a perfect place to cry
I'm setting off, but not without my muse

[Verse 2]
What should be over burrowed under my skin
In heart-stopping waves of hurt
I've come too far to watch some namedropping sleaze
Tell me what are my words worth

[Chorus]
Take me to the Lakes where all the poets went to die
I don't belong and, my beloved, neither do you
Those Windermere peaks look like a perfect place to cry
I'm setting off, but not without my muse

[Bridge]
I want auroras and sad prose
I want to watch wisteria grow right over my bare feet
'Cause I haven't moved in years
And I want you right here
A red rose grew up out of ice frozen ground
With no one around to tweet it
While I bathe in cliffside pools
With my calamitous love and insurmountable grief

[Chorus]
Take me to the Lakes where all the poets went to die
I don't belong and, my beloved, neither do you
Those Windermere peaks look like a perfect place to cry
I'm setting off, but not without my muse
Not without you
Take me to the Lakes where all the poets went to die
I don't belong and, my beloved, neither do you
Those Windermere peaks look like a perfect place to cry
I'm setting off, but not without my muse
No, not without you

[Verse 1]
I found the street of the house in which you stay
And my diary's full of your name on every page
'Cause I read somewhere you'll fall in love with me
I'll try and try again, one day you'll see
Your hair's under my pillow so I sleep (So I sleep)
And I'm dreaming of you leaving roses at my feet (At my feet)

[Chorus]
I'm obsessed with you in a way I can't believe
When you wipe your tears do you wipe them just for me? (Me, me, me, me)
Do you wipe them just for me? (Me, me, me, me)
I'm pleading on my knees (Knees, knees, knees, knees)
It's your touch that I need (Need, need, need, need)

[Verse 2]
I followed you today, I was in my car
I wanted to come and see you from afar
If you turned around and saw me, I would die
I'd pretend I was a person driving by
Wrote you a song, do you wanna hear it now? (Hear it now)
Don't bring your friends along to form a crowd (Crowd)
'Cause I need to prove I wrote it just for you (Just for you)
What's the need for them when it could be just us two? (Two, two, two, two)

[Chorus]
I'm obsessed with you in a way I can't believe
When you wipe your tears, do you wipe them just for me? (Me, me, me, me)
Do you wipe them just for me? (Me, me, me, me)
I'm pleading on my knees (Knees, knees, knees, knees)
It's your touch that I need (Need, need, need, need)

[Outro]
(Just for you)

[Verse 1]
I should have quit you
A long time ago
I should have quit you, baby
A long time ago

But you got me messing around with you, baby
You got me crying on a killing floor, yeah

If I don't follow, yeah
My first mind
If I don't fallow, pretty baby
My first mind
I would have been gone since my second time
Yeah

[Bridge]
Lord knows, right now
I should have been gone
Lord knows, I should have been gone

[Chorus]
But you got me messing around with you, baby
You got me crying on a killing floor, yeah
But you got me messing around with you, baby
You got me crying on a killing floor, yeah

[Verse 1]
Well, I wish I was a catfish
Swimming in, Lord, the deep blue sea
I'd have all you pretty women
Fishing after me, fishing after me
Fishing after me, yeah

[Refrain]
Ohh yeah, ohh yeah, ohh yeah, ohh yeah

[Verse 2]
When I went down, my girlfriends house
And I sat down, Lord, on her front step
And she said, "Come in now Jimi
My husband just now left, just now left"

[Refrain]
Ohh yeah, ohh yeah, ohh yeah, ohh yeah

[Verse 3]
Well there's two, two trains running
But there's not one, Lord, that's going my way
You know there's a one train running at midnight
Other onеs leave just for a day
Leavе just for a day

[Refrain]
Ohh yeah, ohh yeah, ohh yeah, ohh yeah

That a hero, a hero is so hard to find

[Verse 2]
When he takes you for his love (For his love)
And he tries to tell you, there isn't any other (Don't believe him)
Oh, he may kiss you and tell you he'll miss you (Such a shame)
But don't forget, a hero is so hard to find

[Verse 3]
When he says "hello," don't forget they're all the same
(You know they're all the same)
You may end up sitting all alone and with yourself to blame
Oh, don't

[Verse 4]
So when he tells you you've got diamonds in your eyes
(He's just lying)
Don't get carried away because you know he's selling you lies
(He's just lying)
So when you get the feeling the man you've got's no good
(He's no good)
Well, just remember, a hero is so hard to find
Well, just remember, a hero is so hard to find

[Outro]
Heroes, heroes are hard to find
Heroes, heroes are hard to find
Heroes, heroes are hard to find
Heroes, heroes are hard to find

[Verse 1]
Well, I stand up next to a mountain
And I chop it down with the edge of my hand

Might even raise a little sand

That's where my baby stays
Lord, there's a red house over yonder
Lord, that's where my baby stays
I ain't been home to see my baby
In ninety nine and one half days

[Verse 2]
Wait a minute, something's wrong here
The key won't unlock this door
Wait a minute, something's wrong
Lord have mercy, this key won't unlock this door
Somethings goin' on here
I have a bad, bad feeling
That my baby don't live here no more
(That's alright I still got my guitar, look out now!)

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Well I might as well go on over yonder
Way back up on the hill
(I got something to do)
Lord, I might as well go back over yonder
Way back yonder 'cross the hill
'Cause if my baby don't love me no more
I know her sister will!

[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse]
Just came back from the storm
From the storm
I just came back, baby
Just came back from the storm
Well, I did not know it then
But I was suffering, suffering
For my love to keep me warm
For my love to keep me warm
It was so cold and lonely
The wind and crying blue rain were tearing me up
Cold, cold, and lonely
Crying blue rain were tearing me up
I want to thank you, my sweet darling
For digging in the mud and picking me up
I wanna thank you for picking me up

[Guitar Solo]

[Introduction: Chuck Wein]
Welcome, cosmic brothers and sisters of Maui to the Rainbow Bridge laboratory color sound experiment
We're here for a very, very particular purpose
I think it applies
To all our brothers and sisters all across the planet
Rainbow Bridge is not just a bridge
It's something we all hope to walk across today
And have Jimi lead us across today
Just as there are cells that make up our body
We are cells in the body of the planetary being
And the purpose of humanity, for bеing on this planet
In the great cosmos, in thе multi-universes
The reason for being here is to build that bridge
Between the heart and the higher, middle spiritual centers of the planetary being
And every higher thought, and every higher action
That each of us participate in
Builds that bridge
So we all know about the vibration on the side of the crater, here
And we'd like to–
And the reason that we've–
That we've all kinda dropped out to here
And it's the first time that anybody's dropped out in large numbers since the Christians dropped out of Rome
Then, we want to convey that bond to everyone else
Instead of just kinda being a receptive, groovy audience and have what we have at every lovely concert, forever and ever, up to now
If we just met–
Turn on our energies so that Jimi can pick into that
And lead us across that bridge
And everybody across the world is gonna pick up on that
So, we're all counting on you
And here's your chance
And Jimi should be here in a few minutes

[Chorus]
Well, I hear my train a comin'
Hear my
Hear my train a comin'

[Interlude]
Ayy ayy ayy yeah-eah

[Verse]
Well, I
Wait around the train station
Waitin' for that train
Take me, take me
Take me away
From this
Lonesome town
Lonesome town
Too bad you don't love me no more, girl
Too bad your people put me down
Hey, hey, hey

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 2]
Tears burnin' me
Tears burnin' me in my eyes
Way down
Way down in my soul
Tears burnin' me way down in my heart
Yeah
Too bad you don't love me no more, girl
Too bad you and me had to part
Had to part

[Chorus]
Well, I hеar my train a comin'
Hear my train a comin'
Hear my train a comin'

Hey, gypsy baby, where are you coming from?
She looked at me and smiled
And stared into space and said, "I'm coming from the land of the new rising sun"
And I said, "Hey baby, where are you trying to get to?"
Then she said, "I'm going to spread a lot of love around to everybody
A whole lot of peace of mind to you, and you, you
I said, "Baby, come along with your baby"
Yes, I'd come along
Then I fell in love, with you, baby, yeah

Blow out all the other witches on the scene

Her tongue can even scratch the soul out of the devil's wife

On the words of love
Do they ever touch Dolly Brown
Better get in some highway and clear outta town
Here comes Dolly Dagger
Her love's so heavy, gonna make you stagger
Dolly Dagger
She ain't satisfied 'til she gets what she's after
She drinks the blood from the jagged edge
Better watch out, baby, here comes your master
Alright
Watch out there, baby
Gonna give a little bit of that

[Verse]
There goes Ezy
Ezy Ryder
Riding down the highway of desire
He says the free wind
Takes him higher
Trying to find his heaven above
But he is dying to be loved

He's telling me living
Is so magic
Something is forever
So he claims
He’s talking bout lying
It is so tragic, baby
But don't you worry about today
We got freedom coming our way

How long
Do you think
He's going to last
Carrying out on a gas 

[?]
See all the others say
Do what you please
Got to get the brothers together
And the right to be free
In a cloud of angel dust
I think I see me a freak
Hey motorcycle mama
You going to marry me? haha

[Outro]
I will be stone crazy
Love coming in at you
Stone crazy baby

[Verse 1]
You got my pride
Hangin' out of my bed

Or you just want to bleed me

[you're] Better sticking your dagger in someone else
So I can leave

A whole lot a people's coming right on down

Communication, yeah, is coming on strong
I don't give a damn baby
If your hair is short or long

I said get out of your grave
Oh, everybody is dancing in the street
Do what you know

You got to practice what you preach

Things ain't what they used to be
Keep on straight ahead
Keep on straight ahead

We got to stand together and organize
Send power to the people, that's what they're screaming
Freedom of the soul
Pass it on, pass it on, to the young and the old

You got to tell the children the truth
They don't need a whole lot of lies
Because one of these days, baby
They'll be running things
So when you give them love
You better give it right
Woman and child, man and wife
The best love to have is the Love Of Life

[Chorus 2]
Straight ahead baby
Straight ahead baby
Whoo!

[Chorus 1]
Hello my friend
It's so good to see you again
Hey now I've been all by myself
I don't think I can make it alone

[Verse 1]
Everyday in the week, I'm in a different city
If I stay too long, the people try to pull me down
They talk about me like a dog, talk about the clothes I wear
But they don't realize they're the ones who's square

[Pre-Chorus]
Hey, and that's why you can't hold me down
I don't want to be down
I got to move on

Stone free, to ride the breeze
Stone free, I can't stay
I got to, got to, got to get away right now
Yeah, alright

Listen to this baby
A woman here, a woman there, try to keep me in a plastic cagе
But they don't realize it's so еasy to break
Oh but sometimes I can, ha
I can feel my heart kind of running hot
That's when I got to move, before I get caught

[Pre-Chorus]
Hey, and that's why, listen to me baby, you can't hold me down
I don't want to be tied down
I got to be free
Aw!

[Verse 1]
Rhiannon rings like a bell through the night
And wouldn't you love to love her?
Takes to the sky like a bird in flight
And who will be her lover?

[Chorus]
All your life you've never seen a woman
Taken by the wind
Would you stay if she promised you heaven?
Will you ever win?

[Verse 2]
She is like a cat in the dark
And then she is the darkness
She rules her life like a fine skylark
And when the sky is starless
Once in a million years a lady like her rises
Oh no, Rhiannon, you cry, but she's gone
Your life knows no answer, your life knows no answer

[Chorus]
All your life you've never seen a woman
Taken by the wind
Would you stay if she promised you heaven?
Will you ever win?
Will you ever win?

[Refrain]

[Verse 1]
Monday morning, you sure look fine
Friday, I got travelin' on my mind
First you love me, and then you fade away
I can't go on believing this way
I got nothing but love for you
Tell me what you really want to do
First you love me, then you get on down the line

[Pre-Chorus]
But I don't mind

[Chorus]
I'll be there if you want me to
No one else that could ever do
Got to get some peace in my mind

First you love me, then you get on down the line

[Verse 1]
It was a blue letter she wrote to me
It's silver words she told
Wanna be on the road to paradise
I want a lover who don't get old

[Chorus]
Do I read a message in your eyes?
You want a love to stay another night
Baby, when your day goes down
I won't be waiting around for you

[Verse 2]
For every voice you've ever heard
There's a thousand without a word
Redbird, don't say you told me so
Give me one more song to go

[Chorus]
Do I read a message in your eyеs?
You want a love to stay another night
Baby, when your day goеs down

You can take me to the paradise
And then again you can be cold as ice
I'm over my head (Over my head)
Oh, but it sure feels nice

[Verse 2]
You can take me anytime you like
I'll be around if you think you might
Love me, baby (Over my head)
And hold me tight

That I'm wasting all of my time

{Instrumental}

[Verse 1]
Do you always trust your first initial feeling?
Special knowledge holds true, bears believing
I turned around and the water was closing all around
Like a glove, like the love that had finally, finally found me

[Chorus]
Then I knew in the crystalline knowledge of you
Drove me through the mountains
Through the crystal like a clear water fountain
Drove me like a magnet, to the sea
To the sea
To the sea, yeah

[Verse 2]
How the faces of lovе change, turning the pages
And I havе changed, oh, but you, you remain ageless
I turned around and the water was closing all around
Like a glove, like the love that had finally, finally found me

[Chorus]
Then I knew in the crystalline knowledge of you
Drove me through the mountains
Through the crystal like a clear water fountain
Drove me like a magnet, to the sea
To the sea
To the sea, yeah
To the sea, yeah

[Verse 1]
Have mercy, baby, on a poor girl like me
You know I'm falling, falling, falling at your feet
I'm tingling right from my head to my toes
So help me, help me, help me make the feeling go

[Chorus]
'Cause when the loving starts, and the lights go down
And there's not another living soul around
You woo me until the sun comes up
And you say that you love me

[Verse 2]
Have pity, baby, just when I thought it was over
Now you got me running, running, running for cover
I'm begging you for a little sympathy
And if you use me again, it'll be the end of me

[Chorus]
'Cause when the loving starts, and thе lights go down
And there's not another living soul around
You woo mе until the sun comes up
And you say that you love me
{Instrumental Bridge}

[Verse 3]
Baby, baby, hope you're going to stay away
'Cause I'm getting weaker, weaker everyday
I guess I'm not as strong as I used to be
And if you use me again it'll be the end of me

[Chorus]
'Cause when the loving starts, and the lights go down
And there's not another living soul around
You woo me until the sun comes up
And you say that you love me
'Cause when the loving starts, and the lights go down
And there's not another living soul around
You woo me until the sun comes up
And you say that you love me
Say that you love me
Say that you love me

[Outro]
Falling, falling, falling
Falling, falling, falling

[Verse 1]
I took my love, took it down
I climbed a mountain, and I turned around
And I saw my reflection in the snow-covered hills
Till the landslide brought me down

[Verse 2]
Oh, mirror in the sky, what is love?
Can the child within my heart rise above?
Can I sail through the changing ocean tides?
Can I handle the seasons of my life?

[Chorus]
Well, I've been afraid of changing
'Cause I've built my life around you
But time makes you bolder, even children get older
And I'm getting older too

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Well, I've been afraid of changing
'Cause I'vе built my life around you
But time makes you boldеr, even children get older
And I'm getting older too
Oh, I'm getting older too

[Verse 3]
I take my love, take it down
Oh, climb a mountain and turn around
And If you see my reflection in the snow-covered hills
Well, the landslide will bring you down

[Outro]
And If you see my reflection in the snow covered hills
Well, the landslide will bring you down
Oh, the landslide will bring it down

[Verse 1]
Everybody's trying to say I'm wrong
I just want to be back where I belong

[Chorus]
World turning
I got to get my feet back on the ground
World turning
Everybody's got me down

[Verse 2]
Maybe I'm wrong, but who's to say what's right?
I need somebody to help me through the night

[Chorus]
World turning
I got to get my feet back on the ground
World turning
Everybody's got me down

[Bridge]
Maybe I'm wrong but who's to say what's right?
I need somebody to help me through the night

[Chorus]
World turning
I got to get my feet back on the ground
World turning
Everybody's got me down
Turning
Everybody's got me down
World turning
Everybody's got me down

[Verse 1]
Well, I need a sugar daddy
He could be my friend
And if I needed a little money
I know he would lend me, lend me a hand

[Chorus 1]
But when it comes to loving
He'd better leave me alone
Because I've got you, baby
And you give me all the love I need
Yes, you give me all the love I need

[Verse 2]
And when I get a little hungry
If he could give me all I could eat
And if I needed whiskey
He could serve it to me neat

[Chorus]
But when it comes to love
He'd better leave me alone
Because I've got you, baby
And you give me all the love I need
Yes, you give me all the love I need

[Bridge]
All that I want is someone to take care of me
I'm not asking for love, just a little sympathy

[Verse 4]
And he could pick me up
In a big fancy car
Then I could pretend
I was a big movie star

[Chorus]
But when it comes to love
He'd better leave me alone
Because I've got you, baby
And you give me all the love I need
Yes, you give me all the love I need

[Bridge]
All that I want is someone to take care of me
I'm not asking for love, just a little sympathy

[Outro]
I'm not asking for love
I'm not asking for love
I'm not asking for love
I'm not asking for love
Just a little sympathy
I'm not asking for love
I'm not asking for love

[Verse 1]
I've been alone
All the years
So many ways to count the tears

[Pre-Chorus]
I never change
I never will
I'm so afraid the way I feel

[Chorus]
Days when the rain and the sun are gone
Black as night
Agony's torn at my heart too long
So afraid
Slip and I fall and I die

[Verse 2]
I been alone
Always down
No one cared to stay around

[Pre-Chorus]
I never change
I never will
I'm so afraid the way I feel

[Chorus]
Days when the rain and the sun are gone
Black as night
Agony's torn at my heart too long
So afraid
Slip and I fall and I die
How I feel
Days when the rain and the sun are gone
Black as night
Agony's torn at my heart too long
So afraid
Slip and I fall and I die

[Verse 1]
If you were the Mona Lisa
You'd be hanging in the Louvre
Everyone would come to see you
You'd be impossible to move

[Pre-Chorus]
It seems to me that's what you are
A rare and priceless work of art
You stay behind your velvet rope
But I will not renounce all hope

[Chorus]
And I'm right by your side, like a thief in the night
I stand in front of the masterpiece
And I can't tell you why it hurts so much
To be in love with a masterpiece
'Cause, after all, nothing's indestructible

[Verse 2]
From the moment I first saw you
All the darkness turned to white
An Impressionistic painting
Tiny particles of light

[Pre-Chorus]
It seems to me that's what you're like
The "Look but please don't touch me" type
And honestly, it can't be fun
To always be the chosen one

[Chorus]
And I'm right by your side, like a thief in the night
I stand in front of the masterpiece
And I can't tell you why it hurts so much
To be in love with a masterpiece (Masterpiece)
'Cause, after all, nothing's indestructible
Nothing's indestructible, nothing's indestructible
Nothing's indestructible

[Chorus]
And I'm right by your side, like a thief in the night
I stand in front of the masterpiece
And I can't tell you why it hurts so much
To be in love with a masterpiece
And I'm right by your side, like a thief in the night
I stand in front of the masterpiece
And I can't tell you why it hurts so much
To be in love with a masterpiece (Masterpiece)
'Cause, after all, nothing's indestructible
'Cause, after all, nothing's indestructible

To feel the wind on your face and your skin
And it's here I begin my story

Let me out of my cage cause I'm dying

I've been waiting for somebody to pick up my stroll, ah
Ah, well, don't waste time
Give me a sign, tell me how you wanna roll, mmm
I want somebody to speed it up for me, then take it down slow
There's enough room for both
Well, I can handle that, you just gotta show me where it's at
Are you ready to go? Are you ready to go?
(Fikki fikki, fikki fikki, come on)

Sometimes I think what I need is a "you" intervention, yeah
And you know I can tell that you like it

But if I die tonight, at least I can say I did what I wanted to do
Tell me, how 'bout you?

There's no other way I can be with you

I know it's late, whoa I can't wait
So come on and steal away

Oh, by my side
Yes. Oh, honey I need you
I need you, I need you to bе my guide

[Snippet]
Put em up till they shut em down
You never ain't not around, yeah
Don't matter what time, what town, I can't get you gone
Turn a party upside down, just looking for something that does it
I'll give them all my money
Ain't nobody selling nothing "you proof"
Something stronger than I'm used to
I’ve been pouring 90 to 100 feelin’ like nothings gonna cut it that’s the hard truth
I need something "you proof," I need something "you proof"

I've been mixing liquors trying to get you gone
But I guess I must be doing something wrong
'Cause I've been working hard to fade your memory
But the only thing faded is me

I need something "you proof," something stronger than I'm used to
I’ve been pouring 90 to 100 feelin’ like nothings gonna cut it that’s the hard truth
I need something "you proof," I need something "you proof"

[Chorus]
Burning desire sets my soul on fire
Burning desire sets my soul on fire

[Verse 1]
I feel my body drowning in your sea of love
But in the meantime there's nothing to dream
Between Hell and Heaven you just may see me chase my heart everywhere

[Chorus]
Burning desire hotter than an electric chair
Burning desire hotter than an electric chair

[Verse 2]
Last night sure was sweet
It sure was good this time around
You really sent me around and around, round and round

[Verse 3]
You came on down hard on me baby
You showed me just how love could be
I wish I could stay baby
But I'm just a night bird flying over the sea
And I'm trying not to drown

[Chorus]
Burning desire hotter than an electric chair

[Verse 1: Jimi Hendrix]
Well, I see hands, and I see tear-stained faces
Reaching up but not quite touching the promised land
Well, I taste tears and the precious years wasted
Saying Lord, please, send us a helping hand

[Chorus: Jimi Hendrix, (Background Singers)]
(Lord, Lord, Lord)
On the mountain stands a woman
(Lord, Lord, Lord)
Hey, I feel her shining light
(Lord, Lord, Lord)
Lord, must be the answer
(Lord, Lord, Lord)
Thank you, Lord, and keep her alright
Got them earth blues today

[Verse 2: Jimi Hendrix]
I hear the thunder of freedom's beating heart
Sirens clashing with black earth and rocking stone
I think you better love me now, darling, it just might be too late after a while
And tell our child to bury old daddy's broken clothes

[Chorus: Jimi Hendrix, (Background Singers)]
(Lord, Lord, Lord)
Hey, I see a beautiful woman
(Lord, Lord, Lord)
Yes, and I feel her shining light on me
(Lord, Lord, Lord)
Lord! Must be the answer
(Lord, Lord, Lord)
Help me, Lord, and keep her alright for me

[Bridge: Jimi Hendrix, (Background Singers)]
(Help me, darling)
Help me, darling

(Help me, darling)
Ooh!

Got those earth blues today
(Lord, Lord, Lord)
Oooh!
(Lord, Lord, Lord)

[Verse 3: Jimi Hendrix]
Yeah but, uh, sometimes my imagination grabs me by surprise
A queen of ebony in chains I visualize
And back on the moon, I see her portrait in a tomb
And these words are written, first woman from God's womb

[Chorus: Jimi Hendrix, (Background Singers)]
(Lord, Lord, Lord)
Hey! Stands a woman
(Lord, Lord, Lord)
And I feel her shining light
(Lord, Lord, Lord)
Lord, must be the answer
(Lord, Lord, Lord)
Thank you, Lord, and keep her alright
Yeah!

Shake these earth blues away from me, baby

For nothing desperately
Hey, I'm trying, trying
Trying to keep my cool
Well, I'm trying to keep my gloom
Yea, yea, yea
Well, until I find that sweet love of mine
I'm just a rolling
Screaming, tumbling
Crying, girly loving, rolling stone

Hey, if you're a woman
At least, you say you are
You're a woman
At least, you look like you are
You're a woman
At least, you say you are
But you make it off, in bed with my guitar
And you leave thе real me outside
To lеave out, 'round the nighttime
You say you just want a ticket to ride
You don't give a damn about-

You're just a screaming
Didn't love 'ya sometimes
But a, rolling, tumbling, stepping, stepping stone
That's all you-

Burning desire sets my soul on fire
Burning desire sets my soul on fire

But in the meantime there's nothing to dream
Between Hell and Heaven you just may see me chase my heart everywhere

[Chorus]
Burning desire hotter than an electric chair
Burning desire hotter than an electric chair

[Verse 2]
Last night sure was sweet
It sure was good this time around
You really sent me around and around, round and round

[Verse 3]
You came on down hard on me baby
You showed me just how love could be
I wish I could stay baby
But I'm just a night bird flying over the sea
And I'm trying not to drown

[Chorus]
Burning desire hotter than an electric chair

[Verse 1]
Everyday in the week, I'm in a different city
If I stay too long, the people try to pull me down
They talk about me like a dog, talk about the clothes I wear

Machine gun
Tearing my body all apart
Machine gun
Tearing my body all apart

[Verse 1]
Evil man make me kill you
Evil man make you kill me
Evil man make me kill you
Even though we're only families apart

[Verse 2]
Well I pick up my axe and fight like a farmer
You know what I mean?
Hey, and your bullets keep knocking me down
Hey, I pick up my axe and fight like a farmer now
Yeah, but you still blast me down, to the ground

[Verse 3]
The same way you shoot me down, baby
You'll be going just the same
Three times the pain
And your own self to blame
Hey, machine gun

[Solo]

[Verse 4]
I ain't afraid of your mess no morе, babe

Because I know all the time you're wrong baby
And you'll be going just the same

[Refrain]
Yeah, machine gun
Tearing my family apart
Yeah, yeah, alright
Tearing my family apart

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 5]
Don't you shoot him down
He's about to leave here
Don't you shoot him down
He's got to stay here
He ain't going nowhere
He's been shot down to the ground
Oh where he can't survive no, no

[Outro]
Yeah, that's what we don't want to hear anymore, alright
(No bullets)
At least here, huh huh
(No guns, no bombs)
Huh huh
No nothing, just let's all live and live
You know instead of killing

[Verse 1]
Here he comes, baby
Here comes your lover man
Here he comes
Here comes your lover man
I'll sneak out your window, babe
I really gotta go as fast as I can
Reach down, baby
And get on my running shoes
Reach down, baby
And get on my running shoes
See your man coming
Babe, I've got no time to lose

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2]
I wanna love you longer, baby
I wanna love you stronger, stronger
But I wanna love you all night longer
But that's your man, way over yonder now

[Instrumental Outro]

[Verse 1: Jimi Hendrix]
Well, I see hands, and I see tear-stained faces
Reaching up but not quite touching the promised land
Well, I taste tears and the precious years wasted
Saying Lord, please, send us a helping hand

[Chorus: Jimi Hendrix, (Background Singers)]
(Lord, Lord, Lord)
On the mountain stands a woman
(Lord, Lord, Lord)
Hey, I feel her shining light
(Lord, Lord, Lord)
Lord, must be the answer
(Lord, Lord, Lord)
Thank you, Lord, and keep her alright
Got them earth blues today

[Verse 2: Jimi Hendrix]
I hear the thunder of freedom's beating heart
Sirens clashing with black earth and rocking stone
I think you better love me now, darling, it just might be too latе after a while
And tell our child to bury old daddy's brokеn clothes

[Chorus: Jimi Hendrix, (Background Singers)]
(Lord, Lord, Lord)
Hey, I see a beautiful woman
(Lord, Lord, Lord)
Yes, and I feel her shining light on me
(Lord, Lord, Lord)
Lord! Must be the answer
(Lord, Lord, Lord)
Help me, Lord, and keep her alright for me

[Bridge: Jimi Hendrix, (Background Singers)]
(Help me, darling)
Help me, darling
(Help me, darling)
To keep the light
(Help me, darling)
Everything alright

Keep shining bright
(Help me, darling)
Help me darling

Help me darling
(Help me, darling)
Ooh!
(Help me, darling)
Got those earth blues today
(Lord, Lord, Lord)
Oooh!
(Lord, Lord, Lord)

[Verse 3: Jimi Hendrix]
Yeah but, uh, sometimes my imagination grabs me by surprise
A queen of ebony in chains I visualize
And back on the moon, I see her portrait in a tomb
And these words are written, first woman from God's womb

[Chorus: Jimi Hendrix, (Background Singers)]
(Lord, Lord, Lord)
Hey! Stands a woman
(Lord, Lord, Lord)
And I feel her shining light
(Lord, Lord, Lord)
Lord, must be the answer
(Lord, Lord, Lord)
Thank you, Lord, and keep her alright
Yeah!
I think I'll be alright with my baby now
Shake these earth blues away from me, baby

[Intro]
Well, I'm a voodoo chile
Lord, I'm a voodoo chile
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Well, the night I was born
Lord, I swear the moon turned a fire red
The night I was born
I swear the moon turned a fire red
Well my poor mother cried out "Lord, the gypsy was right!"
And I've seen her, fell down right dead
(Have mercy)

[Verse 2]
Well, mountain lions found me there waitin'
And set me on a eagle's back (oh, Lord)
Well, mountain lions found me there
And set me on a eagle's wing (yeah)
(It's the eagle's wing baby, what did I say)
Well uh, he took me past to the outskirts of infinity
And when he brought me back
He gave me a Venus witch's ring
Hey! (yeah) and he said "Fly on, fly on"

[Chorus]
Because I'm a voodoo chile baby, voodoo chile
Hey!
Yeah

[Verse 3]
Well, I make love to you
And Lord knows you'll feel no pain, yeah
Say, I make love to you in your sleep
And Lord knows you felt no pain
(Have mercy)
Because I'm a million miles away
And at the same time I'm right here in your picture frame
(Yeah! What did I say now?)

[Chorus]
Because I'm a voodoo Chile
Lord knows I'm a, voodoo Chile
Yeah!

[Instrumental Break]
Yeah (yeah)
Yeah, turn it up
Yeah, go ahead uh
What I say
Yeah

[Verse 4]
Yeah, well my arrows are made of desire
From far away as Jupiter's Sulphur mines
Say my arrows are made of desire, desire
From far away as Jupiter's Sulphur mines
Way down by the Methane Sea, yeah
I have a hummingbird and it hums so loud
You think you were losing your mind, hmm

[Drum solo]
Yeah, yeah
Turn that damn git-tar down!
(Ha-ha-ha) Ha-ha-ha
Yeah

[Verse 5]
Well, I float in liquid gardens
And Arizona new red sand (Yeah)
I float in liquid gardens
Way down in Arizona red sand (yeah now, baby)
Well, I taste the honey from a flower named Blue
Way down in California
And the New York drowns as we hold hands
Yeah, Hey!

[Chorus]
Because I'm a voodoo Chile, Lord knows
I'm a voodoo Chile, yeah!

Hey Joe, where you going with that gun in your hand?
Hey Joe, I said, where you going with that gun in your hand?

[Verse 2]
I'm going down to shoot my old lady
You know, I caught her messing around with another man
I'm going down to shoot my old lady
You know, I caught her messing around with another man
And that ain't too cool

[Verse 3]
Hey Joe, I heard you shot your woman down
You shot her down, now
Hey Joe, I heard you shot your old lady down
You shot her down to the ground

[Verse 4]
Yes I did, I shot her

Yes I did, I shot her
You know, I caught my old lady messing around town
And I gave her the gun, I shot her!

[Guitar Solo/Bridge]
Hey Joe, alright
Shoot her one more time, baby

[Verse 5]
Hey Joe, where you going to run to now?
Where you going to run to?
Hey Joe, I said, where you going to run to now?
Where you, where you going to go?
Well, dig it

[Verse 6]
I'm going way down south
Way down to Mexico way, alright
I'm going way down south
Way down where I can be free
There's no one going to find me

[Verse 7]
Ain't no hangman going to
He ain't gonna put a rope around me
You better believe it right now, I got to go now

[Outro]
Hey Joe, you better run on down
Goodbye everybody, ow!
Hey Joe, run on down

[Verse 1]
Purple haze all in my brain
Lately things, they don't seem the same
Acting funny, but I don't know why
'Scuse me while I kiss the sky

[Verse 2]
Purple haze all around
Don't know if I'm coming up or down
Am I happy or in misery?
Whatever it is, that girl put a spell on me
Help me! Help me!
Ah no, no

[Instrumental - Guitar solo]

[Verse 3]
Yeah! Purple haze all in my eyes
Don't know if it's day or night
You got me blowing, blowing my mind
Is it tomorrow, or just the end of time?

[Outro]
No, help me
No, yeah purple haze
Oh no, no
Oh, help me
Tell me, tell me
Can't go on like this
You make me blow my mind
No, no, no
No, no, purple haze

[Intro]
Are we ready?

[Verse 1]
I had a hard run
Running from your window
I was all night running
I wonder if you care
I had a run-in
Run around and run down
Run around a corner
I run smack into a tree

[Chorus]
I had to move
Really had to move
That's why if you please
I am on my bended knees
Bertha, don't you come around here anymore

[Verse 2]
Dressed myself in green
I went down under the sea
See what's going down
Try to read between the lines
I had a sinking feeling I was falling
I looked around to see
Heard a sweet voice calling
You was coming back to me

[Chorus]
I had to move
Really had to move
That's why if you please
I am on my bended knees
Bertha, don't you come around here anymore

[Verse 3]
Ran into a rainstorm
I ducked back into a bar door
It was all night pouring
Not a drop on me
Test me, test me, test me
Why don't you arrest me?
Throw me into the jailhouse
Until the sun goes down

[Chorus]
I had to move
Really had to move
That's why if you please
I am on my bended knees
Bertha, don't you come around here anymore
I had to move
Really had to move
That's why if you please
I am on my bended knees
Bertha, don't you come around here anymore

[Outro]
I had to move
Really had to move
That's why if you please
I am on my bended knees
Bertha, don't you come around here anymore
Anymore, anymore, anymore, anymore
Anymore, anymore, anymore

[Instrumental Break]

I had to move
Really had to move
That's why if you please
I am on my bended knees
Bertha, don't you come around here anymore

Well, this isn't driving a train but it's almost as good

[Chorus 1]
Truckin', got my chips cashed in
Keep truckin', like the do-dah man
Together, more or less in line
Just keep truckin' on

[Verse 1]
Arrows of neon and flashing marquees out on Main Street
Chicago, New York, Detroit and it's all on the same street
Your typical city involved in a typical daydream
Hang it up and see what tomorrow brings

[Chorus 2]
Dallas, got a soft machine
Houston, too close to New Orleans
New York got the ways and means
But just won't let you be

[Verse 2]
Most of the cats you meet on the street speak of true love
Most of the time they're sittin' and cryin' at home
One of these days they know they gotta get goin'
Out of the door and down on the street all alonе

[Chorus 3]
Truckin', like the do-dah man
Once told mе "You've got to play your hand"
And sometimes your cards ain't worth a dime
If you don't lay 'em down

[Bridge]
Sometimes the light's all shinin' on me
Other times I can barely see
Lately it occurs to me
What a long, strange trip it's been

[Verse 3]
What in the world ever became of sweet Jane?
She lost her sparkle, you know she isn't the same
Livin' on reds, and vitamin C, and cocaine
All her friend can say is "Ain't it a shame"

[Chorus 4]
Truckin', up to Buffalo
I've been thinkin', you got to mellow slow
It takes time to pick a place to go
And just keep truckin' on

[Verse 4]
You're sittin' and starin' out of the hotel window
Got a tip they're gonna kick the door in again
I'd like to get some sleep before I travel
But if you got a warrant, I guess you're gonna come in

[Chorus 5]
Busted, down on Bourbon Street
Set up, like a bowling pin
Knocked down, it gets to wearin' thin
They just won't let you be

[Verse 5]
You're sick of hangin' around and you'd like to travel
Get tired of travelin' and you want to settle down
I guess they can't revoke your soul for tryin'
Get out of the door and light out and look all around

[Bridge]
Sometimes the light's all shinin' on me
Other times I can barely see
Lately it occurs to me
What a long, strange trip it's been

[Outro]
Truckin', I'm goin' home
Whoa whoa, baby, back where I belong
Back home, sit down and patch my bones
And get back truckin' on
Get back truckin' on
Get back truckin' on
Get back truckin' on
Hey, get back truckin' on
Hey now, get back truckin' on
Hey, get back truckin' on

[Instrumental]

Truckin', I'm goin' home
Whoa whoa, baby, back where I belong
Back home, sit down and patch my bones
And get back truckin' on
Hey now, get back truckin' on
Hey now, get back truckin' on
Hey now, get back truckin' on
Hey, ow

[Verse 1]
You said you was hurting
Almost lost your mind
'Cause the man you've been lovin'
Hurt you all the time

[Chorus]
But when things go wrong
Wrong with you
It hurts me too

[Verse 2]
You love him a little more now, child
When you know you ought to love him less
Why pick up behind him
And take his mess?

[Chorus]
'Cause when things go wrong
Wrong with you
It hurts me too

[Verse 3]
You love another man
Now you know that I love you
Yeah, and I know you love him, baby
Stick to him just a lot like glue

[Chorus]
But when things go wrong
Wrong with you
You know it hurts me too

[Instrumental break with harmonica solo]

[Verse 4]
Well, he better leave you
Or you best put him down
I just can't stand to see the way
See they way you've been pushed around

[Chorus]
'Cause when things go wrong
Wrong with you
It hurts me too

[Outro]
Thank you
You're witnessing possibly the only ritual older than music, that being tuning up. That's a fact

[Verse 1]
If I had a gun for every ace I have drawn
I could arm a town the size of Abilene
Don't you push me, baby, 'cause I'm moaning low
And you know I'm only in it for the gold

All that I am asking for is one gold dollars
And I could pay you back with one good hand
You can look around about the wide world over
And you'll never find another honest man

[Chorus]
Last fair deal in the country (Sweet Suzie)
Last fair deal in the town
Put your gold money where your love is, baby
Before you let my deal go down, go down

[Verse 2]
Don't you push me, baby, because I'm moaning low
But I know a little something you won't ever know
Don't you touch hard liquor, just a cup of cold coffee
Gonna get up in the morning and go
Evеrybody's laughing and drinking that wine
You can tell the Queen of Diamonds by thе way she shines
Come to daddy on an inside straight
Well, I've got no chance of losing this time
Well, I've got no chance of losing this time
Well, I've got no chance of losing this time

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Last fair deal in the country (Sweet Suzie)
Last fair deal in the town
Put your gold money where your love is, baby
Before you let my deal go down, go down

[Outro]
Everybody's laughing and drinking that wine
I can tell the Queen of Diamonds by the way she shines
Come to daddy on an inside straight
Well, I've got no chance of losing this time
Well, I've got no chance of losing this time
Well, I've got no chance of losing this time

We're gonna beg your indulgence and try another new song out on you. Okay, Mickey wants to call this one "The Pump Man" for reasons of his own

[Verse 1]
Moses come riding up on a guitar
His spurs were jingling, the door was ajar
His buckle was silver, his manner was bold
I asked him to come on in out of the cold
His brain was boiling, his reason was spent
If nothing is borrowed, nothing is lent
I asked him for mercy, he gave me a gun
Now and again, these things just got to be done

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Gideon come in with his eyes on the floor
Said, "You ain't got a hinge, you can't close the door"
Moses stood up, a full six-foot-ten
Said, "You can't close the door when the wall's caved in"
I asked him for water, he poured me some wine
We finished the bottle and broke into mine
You get what you come for, you're ready to go
And it's more than ten thousand that come for the show

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Way down in Louisiana close to New Orleans
Nestled in the pines among the evergreens
There is an old cabin made of earth and wood
There lived a country boy named Johnny B. Goode
He never learned to read or write so well
But he could play the guitar just like ringing a bell

[Chorus]
Go go, go Johnny go, go; go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go; go Johnny go, go
Hey, Johnny B. Goode

[Verse 2]
He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack
Go sit up in the trees by the railroad track
The engineers seen him sitting in the shade
Strumming to the rhythm that the drivers made
The people passing by would all stop and say
"Whoa, my, that little country boy can play!"

[Chorus]
Go go, go Johnny go, go; go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go; go Johnny go, go
Johnny B. Goode

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
His mama told him "Someday you will be a man
You will be the leader of a big old band
Many people coming from miles around
Will hear you play your music when the sun goes down
Someday your name gonna be in lights
Saying Johnny B. Goode tonight"

[Chorus]
Whoa, go Johnny go, go; go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go; go Johnny go, go
Johnny B. Goode

[Verse 1]
The first thing I remember knowing
Was a lonesome whistle blowing
And a youngin's dream of growing up to ride
On a freight train leaving town
Not knowing where I'm bound
No one could steer me right but Mama tried

One and only rebel child
From a family meek and mild
Mama seemed to know what lay in store
In spite of all my Sunday learning
Towards the bad I kept on turning
'Til Mama couldn't hold me anymore

[Chorus]
And I turned twenty-one in prison doing life without parole
No one could steer me right, but Mama tried, Mama tried
Mama tried to raise me better, but her plеading I denied
That leavеs only me to blame 'cause Mama tried

[Verse 2]
Dear old Daddy, rest his soul
Left my mom a heavy load
She tried so very hard to fill his shoes
Working hours without rest
She wanted me to have the best
She tried to raise me right but I refused

[Chorus]
And I turned twenty-one in prison doing life without parole
No one could steer me right, but Mama tried, Mama tried
Mama tried to raise me better, but her pleading I denied
That leaves only me to blame 'cause Mama tried

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
And I turned twenty-one in prison doing life without parole
No one could steer me right, but Mama tried, Mama tried
Mama tried to raise me better, but her pleading I denied
That leaves only me to blame 'cause Mama tried

[Outro]
That leaves onlyl me to blame 'cause Mama tried

[Verse 1]
Baby, here I am and I'm a man upon the scene
And I can give you what you want but you got to come home with me
And I've got a whole lot of good ol' lovin' and I got some in store
When I get through throwin' it on you, you got to come back for more

[Chorus]
Boys and things will come by the dozen
Ain't nothin' but drugstore lovin'
Pretty little woman, let me light your candle
'Cause mama I'm sure hard to handle now, yes, I am

[Verse 2]
An action speaks louder than words and I'm a man with great experience
I know you got you another man, but I can love you better than him
Take my hand and don't bе afraid, I'm gonna prove every word I say
I'm advеrtising love for free so won't you place your ad with me

[Chorus]
Boys and things will come by the dozen
Ain't nothin' but drugstore lovin'
Pretty little thing, let me light your candle
'Cause mama I'm sure hard to handle now, yes, I am

[Bridge]
Give it to me, I got to have some
Some of your love, and it's all I need
Early in the morning, I guess I get a little hard to handle
Just about sometime, yes, I do
I begin, I begin to get hungry for your love sometime
You know, mama, now, yes, I do
I gotta tell you sometime when I have it tend to get hungry
All, all I need
A little bit of your love, little bit of your love
But if I don't get it, I begin
I begin to get just a little bit hard to handle sometime, yes, I do
My, my, it's so good, just can't get away from it, no
It's so good, can't get around now, no, no

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Baby, here I am and I'm a man upon the scene
And I can give you what you want but you got to come home with me
And I've got a whole lot of good ol' lovin' and I got some in store
When I get through throwin' it on you, you got to come back for more

[Chorus]
Boys and things will come by the dozen
Ain't nothin' but drugstore lovin'
Pretty little thing let me light your candle
Mama I'm sure hard to handle now, yes, I am

[Outro]
Thank you

[Instrumental]

[Verse]
Dark star crashes
Pouring its light into ashes
Reason tatters
The forces tear loose from the axis
Searchlight casting
For faults in the clouds of delusion

[Refrain]
Shall we go
You and I while we can
Through
The transitive nightfall of diamonds

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Old man down
Way down down, down by the docks of the city
Blind and dirty
Asked me for a dime, a dime for a cup of coffee
I got no dime but I got some time to hear his story

[Verse 2]
My name is August West, and I love my Pearly Baker best, more than my wine
More than my wine
More than my maker, though he's no friend of mine
Everyone said
I'd come to no good, I knew I would, Pearly, believe them
Half of my life
I spent doing time for some other fucker's crime
The other half found me stumbling around drunk on burgundy wine

[Bridge]
But I'll get back on my feet someday
The good Lord willing, if he says I may
I know that the life I'm living's no good
I'll get a new start, live the life I should

[Refrain]
I'll get up and fly away
I'll get up and fly away, fly away

[Verse 2]
"Pearly's been true
True to me, true to my dying day," he said
I said to him
I said to him, "I'm sure she's been"
I said to him, "I'm sure she's been true to you"

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Got up and wandered
I wandered downtown, nowhere to go but just to hang around
I've got a girl
Named Bonnie Lee, I know that girl's been true to me
I know she's been, I'm sure she's been true to me

[Instrumental]

[Instrumental]

[Verse]
Mirror shatters
In formless reflections of matter
Glass hand dissolving
In ice, petal flowers revolving
Lady in velvet recedes in the nights of goodbye

[Outro]
Shall we go
You and I while we can
Through
The transitive nightfall of diamonds

[Verse 1]
Me and my uncle went riding down
South Colorado, west Texas bound
We stopped over in Santa Fe
That being the point just about halfway
And you know it was the hottest part of the day

[Verse 2]
I took the horses up to the stall
Went to the barroom, ordered drinks for all
Three days in the saddle, you know my body hurt
It being summer, I took off my shirt
Hey, and I tried to wash off some of that dusty dirt

[Verse 3]
West Texas cowboys, they's all around
With liquor and money, they loaded down
So soon after payday, know it seemed a shame
You know my uncle, he starts a friendly game
Hey, high-low jack and thе winner take the hand

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 4]
My unclе started winning; cowboys got sore
One of them called him, and then two more
Accused him of cheating; well, oh no, it couldn't be
I know my uncle, he's as honest as me
Hey, I'm as honest as a Denver man can be
One of them cowboys, he starts to draw
I shot him down, Lord, he never saw
Shot me another, well, hot damn, he won't grow old
In the confusion, my uncle grabbed the gold
Hey now, we high-tailed it down to Mexico

[Outro]
I love those cowboys, I love their gold
I love my uncle, God rest his soul
He taught me good, Lord, he taught me all I know
Taught me so well, well, I grabbed that gold
And I left his dead ass there by the side of the road

Folks, we're gonna take a short break. (We're gonna take a break.) We'll be back in a little while. (That's right, we're gonna take a break and you can watch our dust.) You guys can boogie all night long. (You can take a break, too. Everybody gets to take a break.)

[Intro]
Ah, that's the one, that's the one. Now, you can dim it just a taste, you know, if you care to dim it, just as long as we can see. (Dim it way down, dim it way the fuck down, way down.) (I don't think it goes down any farther than that.) (He's just sitting there.) I can't see a thing. Now, let's take a show of hands, how many people want that light on? A show of hands, show of hands. (We can't see any hands, the lights aren't on.) Ha, I was about to get to that. (You can't see, ah, wait a minute, let's see, let's see, let's see, let's see.) This better be good. (One, two, three, four)

[Chorus]
Driving that train, high on cocaine
Casey Jones you better, watch your speed
Trouble ahead, trouble behind
And you know that notion just crossed my mind

[Verse 1]
This old engine
Makes it on time
Leaves Central Station
At a quarter to nine
Hits river junction
At seventeen to
At a quarter to ten
You know it's traveling again

[Chorus]
Driving that train, high on cocaine
Casey Jones you better, watch your speed
Trouble ahead, trouble behind
And you know that notion just crossed my mind

[Verse 2]
Trouble ahead
A lady in red
Take my advice
You'd be better off dead
Switch-man sleeping
Train hundred-and-two
Is on the wrong track
And headed for you

[Chorus]
Driving that train, high on cocaine
Casey Jones you better, watch your speed
Trouble ahead, trouble behind
And you know that notion just crossed my mind

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Trouble with you is
The trouble with me
Got two good eyes
But they still don't see
Come 'round the bend
You know it's the end
The fireman screams
And the engine just gleams

[Chorus]
Driving that train, high on cocaine
Casey Jones you better, watch your speed
Trouble ahead, trouble behind
And you know that notion just crossed my mind
Driving that train, high on cocaine
Casey Jones you better, watch your speed
Trouble ahead, trouble behind
And you know that notion just crossed my mind
Driving that train, high on cocaine
Casey Jones you better, watch your speed
Trouble ahead, trouble behind
And you know that notion just crossed my mind
Driving that train, high on cocaine
Casey Jones you better, watch your speed
Trouble ahead, trouble behind
And you know that notion just crossed my mind

[Outro]
And you know that notion just crossed my mind

Hey, is that the picture we were gonna see in a few seconds? (Yeah, that ain't a Rembrandt, that's a Dahli, isn't it?) Yeah, that's a Dahli. (I was led to believe it was a Rembrandt, however, that'll do.) What's the name of that one? What's the name of that one? (Man with his head exploding, ha ha) That's an excellent picture if you see it in really full stunning color, a good reproduction of the real thing. You guys ready? We're gonna unload a new one on you, another new one, yet another. Ready?

[Intro]
Eight, nine, ten

[Verse 1]
Some folks trust to reason
Others trust to might
I don't trust nothing
But I know it come out right
Say it once again now
Oh, I hope you understand
When it's done and over
Lord, a man is just a man

[Chorus]
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on the land

[Verse 2]
Standing on a tower
World at my command
You just keep turning
While I'm playing in the band
If a man among you
Got no sin upon his hand
Let him cast a stone at me
For playing in the band

[Chorus]
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on the land

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Standing on a tower

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Busted flat in Baton Rouge and waiting for a train
And feeling nearly faded as my jeans
Bobby flagged a diesel down and just before it rained
Took us all the way to New Orleans
I took my harpoon out of my dirty red bandanna
I was playing sad while Bobby sang the blues
With them windshield wipers slapping time, Bobby clapping hands
We pined to sing near every song that driver knew

[Chorus]
Freedom's just another word for nothing left to do
Nothing ain't worth nothing, but it's free
And feeling good was easy, Lord, when Bobby sang the blues
And feeling good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
From the coal mines of Kentucky to the California sun
Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Standing right beside me, Lord, through everything I've done
Bobby's body kept me from the cold
Then somewhere near Salinas, Lord, I let her slip away
Looking for that home I hope she finds
And I'd trade all my tomorrows for a single yesterday
Holding Bobby's body close to mine

[Chorus]
And freedom's just another word for nothing left to lose
Nothing was all she left for me
And feeling good was easy, Lord, when Bobby sang the blues
And feeling good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee

[Bridge]
Lalala, lalalala, lalala, lelela, lalaleha, lalaleha, lalala
Leleleheee, lalala, leleleheee, lalala, leleleha, leleleha
Lalala, lalala

[Outro]
And freedom's just another word for nothing left to lose
And nothing ain't worth nothing, but it's free
And feeling good was easy, Lord, when Bobby sang the blues
And feeling good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee

[Verse 1]
Come on pretty women
With your hair hanging down
Open up your windows
'Cause the Candyman's in town
Come on, boys, and gamble
Roll those laughing bones
Seven come eleven, boys
I'll take your money home

[Chorus]
Look out, look out, the Candyman
Here he come and he's gone again
Pretty lady ain't got no friend
'Til the Candyman comes around again

[Verse 2]
I come in from Memphis
Where I learned to talk the jive
When I get back to Memphis
Be one less man alive
Good morning, Mr. Benson
I see you're doing well
If I had me a shotgun
I'd blow you straight to hell

[Chorus]
Look out, look out, the Candyman
Here he come and he's gone again
Pretty lady ain't got no friend
'Til the Candyman comes home again

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Come on, boys, and wager
If you have got the mind
If you've got a dollar, boys
Lay it on the line
Hand me my old guitar
Pass the whiskey around
Won't you tell everybody you meet
That the Candyman's in town

[Chorus]
Look out, look out, the Candyman
Here he come and he's gone again
Pretty lady ain't got no friend
'Til the Candyman comes around again

[Outro]
Look out, look out, the Candyman
Here he come and he's gone again
Pretty lady ain't got no friend
'Til the Candyman comes around again
We're gonna check and see if our monitors are still working. It's some question in our minds. (Monitors, monitor) (Well, it seems to work) (I'll check yours if you check mine) (It works now but I can never hear it while we're playing. I wonder if that means anything.)

[Chorus]
Big boss man, can't you hear me when I call?
Big boss man, can't you hear me when I call?
Well now, you ain't so big, you just tall, that's just about all

[Verse 1]
Now, you got me working boss man, workin' around the clock
I want a little drink of whiskey, you sure won't let me stop

[Chorus]
Big boss man, can't you hear me when I call?
Of course now, you ain't so big, you just tall, that's just about all

[Instrumental break with harmonica solo]

[Verse 2]
Well, I'm gonna get me a boss man, one gonna treat me right
I work hard in the daytime, sure get stoned at night

[Chorus]
Big boss man, can't you hear me when I call?
Of course, you ain't so big, you just tall, that's just about all

[Outro]
Thank you

We're gonna hold everything

[Verse 1]
Sugar magnolia, blossoms blooming
Heads all empty, and I don't care
Saw my baby down by the river
Knew she'd have to come up soon for air

Sweet blossom come on, under the willow
We can have high times if you'll abide
We can discover the wonders of nature
Rolling in the rushes down by the riverside

[Chorus]
She's got everything delightful
She's got everything I need
Takes the wheel when I'm seeing double
Pays my tickets when I speed

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
She comes skimmin' through rays of violet
She can wade in a drop of dew
She don't come, and I don't follow
Waits backstage while I sing to you
She can dance a Cajun rhythm
Jump like a WIllys in four-wheel drive
She's my summer love in the spring, fall, and winter
She can make happy any man alive

Sugar magnolia, ringing that bluebell
While caught up in sunlight
Come on out singing, I'll walk you in the sunlight
Come on, honey, come along with me

[Chorus]
She's got everything delightful
She's got everything I need
A breeze in the pines and the sun and bright moonlight
Lazing in the sunlight? Yes, indeed

[Verse 3]
Sometimes when the cuckoo's crying
When the moon is halfway down
Sometimes when the night is dying
I take me out, and I wander 'round
Walk around

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
Sunshine daydream, meet you in the tall trees
Going where the wind goes
Blooming like a red rose
Roll on over sweetly
Then ride out singin'; I'll walk you in the morning sunshine
Hey, sunshine daydream, sunshine daydream, oh
Sunshine daydream, hey, oh
Sunshine daydream, hey, oh
Hey, sunshine daydream, come on, oh, woo-hoo, woo-hoo
Sunshine daydream
As we're just standing around scratching our asses, we'll come up with something in a minute

[Verse 1]
Saint Stephen with a rose
In and out of the garden he goes
Country garland in the wind and the rain
Wherever he goes, the people all complain

[Verse 2]
Stephen prospered in his time
Well, he may and he may decline
Did it matter? Does it now?
Stephen would answer if he only knew how

[Verse 3]
Wishing well with a golden bell
Bucket hanging clear to Hell
Hell halfway 'twixt now and then
Stephen fill it up and lower down
And lower down again

[Bridge]
Ladyfinger dipped in moonlight
Writing "What for?" across the morning sky
Sunlight splatters dawn with answers
Darkness shrugs and bids the day goodbye
Speeding arrow, sharp and narrow
What a lot of fleeting matters you have spurned
Several seasons with their treasons
Wrap the babe in scarlet covers, call it your own

[Verse 4]
Did he doubt or did he try?
Answers aplenty in the bye and bye
Talk about your plenty, talk about your ills
One man gathers what another man spills

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
Saint Stephen will remain
All he lost he shall regain
Seashore washed by the suds and foam
Been here so long, he's got to calling it home
Fortune comes a crawlin', calliope woman
Spinnin' that curious sense of your own
Can you answer? Yes, I can
But what would be the answer to the answer man?

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
I'm gonna tell you how it's gonna be
You're gonna give your love to me
I wanna love you night and day
You know our love will not fade away
You know our love will not fade away
Yeah

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
My love is bigger than a Cadillac
I try to show you but you drive me back
Your love for me has got to be real
You're gonna know just how I feel
Our love is real, not fade away
Yeah

[Instrumental]

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad, bad, yeah
I don't wanna be treated this a-way

[Verse 1]
Goin' where the climate suits my clothes
Goin' where the climate suits my clothes
Goin' where the climate suits my clothes
I don't wanna be treated this a-way

[Chorus]
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad, bad, yeah

I'm goin' where the water tastes like wine
I'm goin' where the water tastes like wine
Goin' where the water tastes like wine
I don't wanna be treated this a-way

[Chorus]
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad, bad, yeah
I don't wanna be treated this a-way
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad, bad, yeah, yeah
I don't wanna be treated this a-way
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad, bad, bad
I don't wanna be treated this a-way

I wanna tell you how it's gonna be
You're gonna give your love to me
I wanna love you night and day
You know our love will not fade away
You know our love will not fade away

[Outro]
You know our love will not fade away (Not fade away)
You know our love will not fade away (Not fade away, not fade away)
You know our love will not fade away (Not fade away, not fade away)
You know our love will not fade away (Not fade away, not fade away)
You know our love will not fade away (Not fade away, not fade away)
(Not fade away, not fade away)
(Not fade away, not fade away)
(Not fade away, not fade away)
(Not fade away, not fade away)
(Not fade away, not fade away)
(Not fade away, not fade away)
(Not fade away)
(Hey, hey, ow)

[Verse 1]
Well, the first days are the hardest days
Don't you worry anymore
'Cause when life looks like Easy Street
There is danger at your door
Think this through with me
Let me know your mind
Whoa-oh, what I want to know
Is are you kind?

[Verse 2]
It's a buck dancer's choice, my friends
Better take my advice
You know all the rules by now
And the fire from the ice
Will you come with me?
Won't you come with me?
Whoa-oh, what I want to know
Will you come with me?

[Bridge]
Goddamn, well, I declare
Have you seen the like?
Thеir walls are built of cannon balls
Their motto is don't tread on mе

[Chorus]
Come hear Uncle John's Band
Playing to the tide
Come with me or go alone
He's come to take his children home

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
It's the same story the crow told me
It's the only one he know
Like the morning sun you come
And like the wind you go
Ain't no time to hate
Barely time to wait
Whoa-oh, what I want to know
Where does the time go?

[Verse 4]
I live in a silver mine
And I call it "Beggar's Tomb"
I got me a violin
And I beg you call the tune
Anybody's choice
I can hear your voice
Whoa-oh, what I want to know
How does the song go?

[Chorus]
Come hear Uncle John's Band
By the riverside
Got some things to talk about
Here beside the rising tide
Come hear Uncle John's Band
Playing to the tide
Come on along or go alone
He's come to take his children home

[Instrumental Break]

[Refrain]
Whoa-oh, what I want to know
How does the song go?

[Chorus]
Come hear Uncle John's Band
By the riverside
Got some things to talk about
Here beside the rising tide
Come hear Uncle John's Band
Playing to the tide
Come on along or go alone
He's come to take his children home

[Outro]
Good night, people. See you all later

[Verse 1]
Come on you pretty women
With your hair hanging down
Open up your windows
'Cause the Candyman's in town
Come on, boys, and gamble
Roll those laughing bones
Seven come eleven, boys
I'll take your money home

[Chorus]
Look out, look out, the Candyman
Here he come and he's gone again
Pretty lady ain't got no friend
'Til the Candyman comes around again

[Verse 2]
I come in from Memphis
Where I learned to talk the jive
When I get back to Memphis
Be onе less man alive
Good morning, Mr. Benson
I trust you'rе doing well
If I had me a shotgun
I'd blow you straight to hell

[Chorus]
Look out, look out, the Candyman
Here he come and he's gone again
Pretty lady ain't got no friend

'Til the Candyman comes around again
Look out, look out, the Candyman
Here he come and he's gone again
Pretty lady ain't got no friend
'Til the Candyman comes around again

[Verse 1]
In the attics of my life
Full of cloudy dreams unreal
Full of tastes no tongue can know
And lights no eye can see
When there was no ear to hear
You sang to me

[Verse 2]
I have spent my life
Seeking all that's still unsung
Bent my ear to hear the tune
And closed my eyes to see
When there were no strings to play
You played to me

[Bridge]
In the book of love's own dreams
Where all the print is blood
Where all the pages are my days
And all my nights grow old
When I had no wings to fly
You flew to me
You flew to me

[Verse 3]
In the secret space of dreams
Where I dreaming lay amazed
When the secrets all are told
And the petals all unfold
When there was no dream of mine
You dreamed of me

[Outro]
Thank you

[Verse 1]
Arrows of neon and flashing marquees out on Main Street
Chicago, New York, Detroit and it's all on the same street
Your typical city involved in a typical daydream
Hang it up and see what tomorrow brings

[Chorus 1]
Dallas, got a soft machine
Houston, too close to New Orleans
New York got the ways and means
But just won't let you be

[Verse 2]
Most of the cats you meet on the street speak of true love
Most of the time they're sittin' and cryin' at home
One of these days they know they gotta get goin'
Out of the door and down on the street all alone

[Chorus 2]
Truckin', like the do-dah man
Once told me "You've got to play your hand"
Sometimes your cards ain't worth a dimе
If you don't lay 'em down

[Bridge]
Sometimes thе light's all shinin' on me
Other times I can barely see
Lately it occurs to me
What a long, strange trip it's been

[Verse 3]
What in the world ever became of sweet Jane?
She's lost her sparkle, you know she isn't the same
Livin' on reds, and vitamin C, and cocaine
All her friend can say is "Ain't it a shame"

[Chorus 3]
Truckin', up to Buffalo
I've been thinkin', you got to mellow slow
It takes time to pick a place to go
And just keep truckin' on

[Verse 4]
Sittin' and starin' out of the hotel window
Got a tip they're gonna kick the door in again
I'd like to get some sleep before I travel
But if you got a warrant, I guess you're gonna come in

[Chorus 4]
Busted, down on Bourbon Street
Set up, like a bowling pin
Knocked down, it gets to wearin' thin
They just won't let you be

[Verse 5]
You're sick of hangin' around and you'd like to travel
Get tired of travelin' and you want to settle down
I guess they can't revoke your soul for tryin'
Get out of the door and light out and look all around

[Bridge]
Sometimes the light's all shinin' on me
Other times I can barely see
Lately it occurs to me
What a long, strange trip it's been

[Outro]
Truckin', I'ma goin' home
Whoa whoa, baby, back where I belong
Back home, sit down and patch my bones
And get back truckin' on

[Instrumental]

Truckin', I'ma goin' home
Whoa whoa, baby, back where I belong
Back home, sit down and patch my bones
And get back truckin' on

[Instrumental]

[Instrumental]

[Verse]
I went down to see a gypsy woman
I wanna find out, oh, what's wrong with me
I said please, please, please help me out
What's wrong with me?
Alright
Well, she looked at me and said "Man"
She said, "Man, why you here?
All you need, all you need, all you need
All you need is a mojo hand, mojo hand
All you need, a mojo hand"
That's what I'm gon' do, get myself a mojo hand
And everything will be alright
Everything will be alright

[Refrain: Strick]
I gotta tell you that you'll die tonight
You go against these people, you gon' die slow, die slow

[Intro: Young Thug & Strick]
We out in Italy on the water (Slime, what's going on? It's feeling like they won)
Me and Strick recordin' (Gotta get back up, you a Black Panther's son)
Smokin' weed, smokin' dope (I gotta tell you that you'll die slow, die slow, die slow)
Drinkin' a lil' lean
I actually did good, I ain't drink nothin' but a pint this whole tour
Yeah, on tour, I done missed my son's birthday
It's, uh, July the 15th
Nah, I— I lowkey, like, really see people ridin' past on boats right now out the window (Die slow, die slow)
It's just the— just the penthouse suite, it's nothin'— nothin' major, yeah

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
Told the lawyer that my brother ain't goin' back to prison
I don't give a fuck if I gotta turn that nigga Jehovah Witness
I'm just seekin' for God's soul 'cause I know something's missin'
Comme des Garçons boxers and I came from penny-pinchin'
Came out the struggle, nigga, I really had lost a brother, nigga
Got to fightin' with the deputy sheriff, I almost lost my mother, nigga

[Interlude: Young Thug]
And that's funny, that's funny, like
My mama had broke up with my dad for having another kid on her, and, um
He had came home one day and he saw, um, a car in the driveway
It was an off-duty sheriff— ahem
A deputy sheriff that my mom was fuckin' with, and, uh
They had a few words, and it ended with, um, my dad shooting and ended up in the hospital in a coma, and, uh, yeah, so
Fast forward like eight years later, so my sisters had got to fighting, and, uh
And they— and they— and they had a family member that was a deputy sheriff, and, um
My mom came outside to goddamn stop the fighting
The lady had got in the car and just pulled off doing at, like, sixty miles per hour, ran my mom over
She had a stroke and shit, but she alright
Yeah

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
I always knew I wasn't gon' be gay
I had her sendin' pictures to my mom phone when I was like eight, tuh
I always knew that I'd be great
'Cause my coach told me I was slow, but I was runnin' at a fast pace, huh
They tryna divide us and conquer the world with it
They got a couple of the guys and all of the girls with it
But I'm a mastermind, I see right through it
I see that you got couple diamonds and the rest of 'em pearls in it
They say you poor 'cause you Black right to your face (Yeah)
They say where you live, you'll never be able to own that place
My father said you can change it all with your performance
And by the way, your life is a VV stone charm
They take the land and then detect who all can come
But I tell you with a long-sleeve, I bear arms, ayy
I'm high enough to be on the Milky Way 'til morning
If you want it, you gon' get up earlier than any morning
If you want it, you gon' get up earlier than anyone
Put on my socks, grab my Glock, the stick under the couch
Tie off my shoes, you in flip-flops, and it's top of the top
R.I.P. Nipsey, know what I'm sayin'?

[Bridge: Young Thug & Strick]
If you were the one in my shoes, would you love?
Would you love, would you love, would you love, would you love?
If you were the one in
If you were the one in the prejudice, so why for hostility? Yeah
Would you run away, or would you come back nightly? (Woo)

[Refrain: Strick]
I gotta tell you that you'll die tonight
You go against these people, you gon' die slow, die slow, die slow

[Outro: Strick & Young Thug]
Slime, what's going on? It's feeling like they won
Gotta get back up, you a Black Panther’s son
I gotta tell you that you'll die slow, die slow, die slow
You gon' die slow, die slow, die slow
Mom, what's going on? It's feeling like the Devil won
Die slow, die slow

[Verse 1]
No, no, she can't take your mind and leave
I know it's just another trick she's got up her sleeve
Well, I can't believe that she really wants you to die
After all it's more than enough to pay for your lie

[Chorus]
Wait a minute, watch what you're doing with your time
All the endless ruins of the past must stay behind, yeah

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Wait a minute, watch what you're doing with your time
All the endless ruins of the past must stay behind, yeah

[Verse 2]
Well, can't you see that you're killing each others soul
Well, you're both out in the streets and you got no place to go
Well, your constant battles are getting to be a bore
So go somewhere else and continue your cream puff war

Dark star crashes
Pouring its light into ashes
Reason tatters
The forces tear loose from the axis
Searchlight casting
For faults in the clouds of delusion

[Refrain]
Shall we go
You and I while we can
Through
The transitive nightfall of diamonds

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Mirror shatters
In formless reflections of matter
Glass hand dissolving
In ice, petal flowers revolving
Lady in velvet recedes in the nights of goodbye

[Outro]
Shall we go
You and I while we can
Through
The transitive nightfall of diamonds

[Verse 1]
My time coming, any old day now
Don't worry about me, no
Been so long I felt this way now
And I'm in no hurry, no
Seems so long I felt this way now
And time sure passing slow
My time coming, voices saying
And they tell me where to go

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't worry about me
No, no, don't worry about me, no
And I'm in no hurry
No, no, no, I know where to go

[Chorus]
California
Preaching on the burning shore
California
I'll be knocking on the golden door
Like an angel
Standing in a shaft of light
Rising up to paradise
And I'm gonna shine

[Verse 2]
My time coming, any old day now
Don't worry about me, no
It's gonna be just like they say
Them voices tell me so
Been so long I felt this way now
And time sure passing slow
Still I know I lead the way now
And they tell me where to go

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't worry about me
No, no, don't worry about me, no
And I'm in no hurry
No, no, no, I know where to go

[Chorus]
California
A prophet on the burning shore
California
I'll be knocking on the golden door
Like an angel
Standing in a shaft of light
Rising up to paradise
I know I'm gonna shine

[Bridge]
Now you've all been asleep, you would not believe me (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Them voices telling me you will soon receive me (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Shinin' on the beach, sea will part before me
(Fire wheel burning in the air)
And they will show a sign and we will rise to glory
(Way up the middle of the air)
And I'll call down thunder and speak the same
And my work fills the sky with flame
And might and glory gonna be my name
And they gonna light my way

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
My time coming, any old day now
Don't worry about me, no
Been so long I felt this way now
And time sure passing slow
This afternoon, streets turned gray
And I watch the cars below
My time coming, any old day now
Don't worry about me, no

[Chorus]
Then don't worry about me
No, no, don't worry about me, no
And I'm in no hurry
No, no, no, I know where to go

[Verse 1]
Sitting in Mangrove Valley chasing light beams
Everything wanders from baby to Z
Baby, baby, pretty, young on Tuesday
Old like a rum drinking demon at tea
Baby, baby, tell me what's the matter
Why, why tell me, what’s your why now?
Tell me why will you never come home?
Tell me what's your reason if you got a good one

[Chorus]
Everywhere I go
The people all know
Everyone is doing that rag
Everywhere I go, the people all know
Everyone is with thе rag

[Verse 2]
Take my line go fishing for a Tuesday
Maybе take my supper, eat it down by the sea
Gave my baby twenty, forty good reasons
Couldn't find any better ones in the morning at three
Rain gonna come but the rain gonna go, you know
Stepping off sharply from the rank and file
Awful cold and dark like a dungeon
Maybe get a little bit darker ’fore the day

[Chorus]
Hipsters, tripsters
Real cool chicks, sir
Everyone's doing that rag
Hipsters, tripsters, real cool chicks
Everyone is doing that rag

[Verse 3]
You needn't gild the lily, offer jewels to the sunset
No one is watching or standing in your shoes
Wash your lonely feet in the river in the morning
Everything promised is delivered to you
Don't neglect to pick up what your share is
All the winter birds are winging home now
Hey Love, go and look around you
Nothing out there you haven't seen before now

[Chorus]
Wade in the water
You never get wet
If you keep on doing that rag
Wade in the water, never get wet
If you keep on doing the rag

[Verse 4]
One-eyed jacks and the deuces are wild
The aces are crawling up and down your sleeve
Come back here, Baby Louise
And tell me the name of the game that you play

[Refrain]
Is it all fall down?
Is it all go under?
Is it all fall down?
Is it all go under?
Is it all fall down?
Is it all go under?
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Da-da-da-da-da, doo-doo-doo-doo-doo

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
Everywhere I go, the people all know
Everybody's doing that rag

[Verse 1]
Hey, hey, coming out around the world

A chance for folks to meet

Well, mama got the rub board, sister got the tub
They're going around doing the rub-de-rub

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Thank you

[Verse 1]
Take my hand and run with me out of the past called yesterday
And run with me into the future of tomorrow
Yesterday must be forgot, no looking back no matter what
There's nothing left but memories that bring sorrow
Yesterday is gone but tomorrow is forever

[Verse 2]
No more crying, tears leave tracks
And memories find their way back
Tomorrow's waiting, let's journey there together
Yesterday is gone but tomorrow is forever

[Bridge]
I care not for yesterday
I love you as you are today
Yesterday just helped to pass the time while waiting
We must forget the passing time
My love for you is the real kind
The kind that won't hurt you, no, never
Yesterday is gone but tomorrow is forever

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
Yesterday is gone but tomorrow is forever
I care not for yesterday
I love you as you are today

Yesterday is gone but tomorrow is forever
Yesterday is gone but tomorrow is forever

Wake of the flood, laughing water, forty-nine
Get out the pans, don't just stand there dreaming
Get out the way, get out the way

Well, the first days are the hardest days
Don't you worry anymore
'Cause when life looks like Easy Street
There is danger at your door
Think this through with me
Let me know your mind
Whoa-oh, what I want to know
Is are you kind?

[Verse 2]
It's a buck dancer's choice, my friends
Better take my advice
You know all the rules by now
And the fire from the ice
Will you come with me?
Won't you come with me?
Whoa-oh, what I want to know
Will you come with me?

[Bridge]
Goddamn, well, I declare
Have you seen the like?
Their walls are built of cannon balls
Their motto is don't tread on me

[Chorus]
Come hear Uncle John's Band
By the riverside
Got some things to talk about
Here beside the rising tide

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
It's the same story the crow told me
It's the only one he know
Like the morning sun you come
And like the wind you go
Ain't no time to hate
Barely time to wait
Whoa-oh, what I want to know
Where does the time go?

[Verse 4]
I live in a silver mine
And I call it "Beggar's Tomb"
I got me a violin
And I beg you call the tune
Anybody's choice
I can hear your voice
Whoa-oh, what I want to know
How does the song go?

[Chorus]
Come hear Uncle John's Band
By the riverside
Got some things to talk about
Here beside the rising tide
Come hear Uncle John's Band
Playing to the tide
Come on along or go alone
He's come to take his children home

[Instrumental Break]

[Refrain]
Whoa-oh, what I want to know
How does the song go?

[Chorus]
Come hear Uncle John's Band
By the riverside

Playing to the tide
Come on along or go alone
He's come to take his children home

[Verse 1]
In another time's forgotten space
Your eyes looked through your mother's face
Wildflower seed in the sand
May the four winds blow you safely

[Chorus]
Roll away the dew
Roll away the dew
Roll away the dew
(I wanna) Roll away the dew

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
I'll tell you where the four winds dwell
In Franklin's tower there hangs a bell
It can ring, turn night to day
Can ring like fire if you lose your way

[Chorus]
Roll away the dew
Roll away the dew
Roll away the dew
Roll away the dew

[Verse 3]
God save thе child who rings that bell
Might have one good ring, baby, you can't tеll
One watch by night, one watch by day
You get confused, listen to the music play

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 4]
Some come to laugh their past away
Some come to make it just one more day
Whichever way your pleasure tends
If you plant ice you're gonna harvest wind

[Chorus]
Roll away the dew
Roll away the dew
Roll away the dew
Roll away the dew

[Verse 5]
I'll tell you where the four winds sleep
—the lighthouse keep
—in the sand and wind
May the four winds blow you home again

Roll away the dew
Roll away the dew
Roll away the dew
Roll away the dew
(You better) Roll away the dew
(You better) Roll away the dew (Roll away)
Roll away the dew
Roll away, roll away
Roll away the dew
Roll away the dew (Roll away)
Roll away the dew
Roll away the dew (Roll away)
Roll away the dew
Roll away the dew (Roll away)
Roll away the dew
Roll away the dew (Roll away)

[Verse 1]
Was walking 'round Grosvenor Square
Not a chill to the winter
But a nip to the air
From the other direction
She was calling my eye
Could be an illusion
But I might as well try
Might as well try

[Verse 2]
She had rings on her fingers
And bells on her shoes
And I knew without asking
She was into the blues
She wore scarlet begonias
Tucked into her curls
I knew right away
She was not like other girls
Other girls

[Verse 3]
In the heat of the evening
When the dealing got rough
She was too pat to open
Too cool to bluff
As I picked up my matches
And was closing the door
I had one of those flashes
I'd been there before
Been there before

[Bridge]
Well, I ain't often right
But I've never been wrong
It seldom turns out the way
It does in the song
Once in a while
You get shown the light
In the strangest of places
If you look at it right

[Verse 4]
Ain't nothing wrong
With the way she moves
Or scarlet begonias
Or a touch of the blues
There's nothing wrong with
The look that's in her eye
I had to learn the hard way
To let her pass by
Let her pass by

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 5]
The wind in the willows played tea for two
The sky was yellow and the sun was blue
Strangers stopping strangers
Just to shake their hand
Everybody's playing
In the Heart of Gold Band
Heart of Gold Band

If I had my way
I would tear this whole building down

[Verse 1]
Delilah was a woman, she was fine and fair
She had good looks, God knows, and coal black hair
Delilah she gained old Samson's mind
When first he saw this woman, Lord, she looked so fine
Delilah she sat down on Samson's knee
Said "Tell me where your strength lies, if you please"
And she spoke so kind, talked so fair
Samson said, "Delilah, you cut off my hair
You can shave my head, clean as my hand
My strength come as natural as any old man"

[Chorus]
If I had my way
If I had my way
If I had my way
I would tear this whole building down (Right now)

[Verse 2]
You read about Samson, all from his birth
He was the strongest man that ever has lived on Earth
Onе day while Samson was walking along
Looked down on the ground, hе saw an old jaw bone
Then he stretched out his arm, God knows, his chains broke like threads
And when he got to move, ten thousand was dead

[Chorus]
If I had my way
If I had my way
If I had my way
I would tear this whole building down (That's right)

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Well now, Samson and the lion, they got in attack
Samson he crawled up on the lion's back
You read about this lion, he killed a man with his paws
Samson got his hands up around that lion's jaws
He ripped that beast, God knows it, killed him dead
And the bees made honey in the lion's head

[Chorus]
If I had my way
If I had my way
If I had my way
I would tear this whole building down

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
If I had my way
If I had my way
If I had my way

[Outro]
If I had my way
If I had my way
If I had my way
I would tear this whole building down
I would tear this whole building down
If I had my way
If I had my way
If I had my way
I would tear this whole building down

[Lost Sailor]

[Verse 1]
Compass card is spinning
Your elm is swingin' to and fro
Ooh, where's the dog star?
Ooh, where's the moon?

[Chorus]
You're a lost sailor
You've been way too long at sea

[Verse 2]
Some days the gales are howling
Some days the sea is still as glass
Ooh, reef the main sail
Ooh, lash the mast

[Chorus]
You're a lost sailor
You've been way too long at sea
Now the shore lights beckon
You say there's a price for being free

[Bridge]
Hear the sea birds cry
There's a ghost wind blowin'
And it's calling you, to that misty swirling sea
'Til the chains of your dreams are broken
No place in this world you can be

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
You're a lost sailor
You've been way too long at sea
Now the shore lights beckon
We hear there's a price for being free

[Outro]
Maybe drift your life away now
Drifting and dreaming
'Cause you're going for a dream
Going for a feeling
'Cause there's a place you've never been
Maybe a place you've never seen now
You can hear them calling on the wind
Hey, going for a dream and going on a feeling
They're going on a feeling
Hey now, drift your life away now
Drifting and dreaming, yes, and going on a dream
Going on a feeling
Maybe going on a feeling
Maybe going on a feeling

[Saint of Circumstance]

[Verse 1]
This must be heaven
Last station on the line
You, you must be an angel
What else could be so fine?
Was that you I heard singing
On the time I was chasing dreams?
Driven by the wind
Like the dust that blows around

[Chorus]
And the rain fallin' down no—

[Verse 2]
Well, yes, this is heaven
'Cause here's where the rainbows end
Sure feel like the real thing
If it ain't, we can just pretend
But when that wind blows
And that rain about to fall
I can hear the sirens call
It's a certain sort of sound

[Chorus]
When the rain fallin' down

[Bridge]
Holes in what's left of my reason
Holes in the knees of my blues
Odds against me been increasin'
But I'll pull through
Never could read no road map
No, I don't know what the weather might do
Hear that witch wind whinin'
See that dog star shinin'
I've got a feelin' there's no time to lose
No time to lose

[Verse 3]
Yes, this is heaven
But even rainbows will end
Now my sails are fillin'
And the wind is willin'
And I'm good as gone again
I'm still walkin', so I'm sure that I can dance
Like a tiger in a trance
Just a Saint of Circumstance
In the rain fallin' down

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
Well, I sure don't know what I'm going for
But I'm gonna go for it for sure
Yeah, I sure don't know what I'm going for
But I'm gonna go for it for sure
Well, I sure don't know what I'm going for
(Maybe going on a feeling)
But I'm gonna go for it for sure
Hey, I sure don't know what I'm going for
But I'm going to go for it for sure
(Going on a feeling)

You tell me this town ain't got no heart
(Well, well, well, you can never tell)
The sunny side of the street is dark
(Well, well, well, you can never tell)
Maybe it's 'cause it's midnight
In the dark of the moon besides

Maybe the dark is from your eyes

Maybe the dark is from your eyes
(Maybe the dark is from your eyes)
Maybe the dark is from your eyes

Used to be the heart of town
Don't tell me this town ain't got no heart
You just gotta poke around

[Verse 2]
You think you've seen this town clear through

Nothing here that could interest you

It's not because you missed out
On the thing that we had to start

Maybe you had too much too fast

All I know is something like a bird
Within her sang
All I know she sang a little while
And then flew on

[Refrain]
Tell me all that you know
I'll show you
Snow and rain

[Verse 2]
If you hear that same sweet song again
Will you know why?
Anyone who sings a tune so sweet
Is passing by

[Refrain]
Laugh in the sunshine
Sing
Cry in the dark
Fly through the night

[Chorus]
Don't cry now
Don't you cry
Don't you cry anymore
La-la-la-la
Sleep in the stars
Don't you cry
Dry your eyes on the wind
La-la-la-la, la

My brother Esau killed a hunter
Back in 1969
Before the killing was done
His inheritance was mine
But his birthright was a wand to wave
Before a weary band
Esau gave me sleeplessness
And a piece of moral land

[Verse 2]
My father favored Esau
Who was eager to obey
All the wild commandments
The Old Man shot his way
But all this favor ended
When my brother failed at war
He staggered home
And found me in the door

[Chorus]
Esau, he's on roller skates today
So hе made a statement to somеone in L.A., hey
Sometimes at night I dream
He's still that hairy man
Shadowboxing the Apocalypse
And wandering the land
Shadowboxing the Apocalypse
And wandering the land

[Verse 3]
Esau holds a blessing
Esau holds a curse
I would say that the blame is mine
But I suspect it's something worse
The more my brother looks like me
The less I understand
The silent war that bloodied both our hands
Sometimes at night, I think I understand
Way late at night, some think, I think I grasp it

[Outro]
So it's brother to brother and man to man now
The silent war that rage within now
Neither one can win now
Shadowboxing the Apocalypse within now
No one can win now
Shadowboxing the Apocalypse
And wandering the land
Shadowboxing the Apocalypse
And wandering the land
Shadowboxing the Apocalypse
And wandering the land

[Verse 1]
Inside you're burning
I can see clear through
Your eyes tell more than you mean them to
Lit up and flashing
Like the reds and blues
Out there on the neon avenue
But I

[Chorus]
(Feel like a stranger)
Feel like a stranger, ooh

[Verse 2]
The music's thundering
We're reckless and hot
You keep firing glances across the room
And I can't stop wondering
Just what you got
Get the feeling I'm gonna find out real soon
Still I

[Chorus]
(Feel like a stranger)
Feel like a stranger

[Refrain]
You know it's gonna get stranger
So let's get on with the show
Let's go, yo

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
And the wheel
Gets smoking 'round midnight
You shoot me a look that says "Let's go"
Yes and it feels 'bout like we're running a red light
There ain't no point in looking behind us, no
Still I

[Chorus]
(Feel like a stranger)
Feel like a stranger, how about you?

[Outro]
You know it's gonna get stranger
Let's get on with the show
How about now? Let's go
Just like, just like a stranger, how about you?
(Feel like a stranger)
How about you? Feel like a stranger, too
(Feel like a stranger)
Feel like a stranger, how about you?
(Feel like a stranger)
(It's gonna be a long, long, crazy, crazy night)
Crazy night (Crazy night), crazy night
(Feel like a stranger)
(It's gonna be a long, long, crazy, crazy night)
Crazy night, crazy night
(Feel like a stranger)
(It's gonna be a long, long, crazy, crazy night)
Hey, crazy night (Hey, crazy night), crazy night
(Feel like a stranger)
(It's gonna be a long, long, crazy, crazy night)
Crazy night (Long, long, crazy, crazy night)
(Feel like a stranger) Crazy night
(It's gonna be a long, long, crazy, crazy night)
Ooh yeah, long, long, crazy, crazy night
(Feel like a stranger)
Crazy night (Crazy night), crazy night (Crazy night)

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Morning comes, she follows the path to the river shore
Lightly sung, her song is the latch on the morning's door
See the sun sparkle in the reeds, silver beads, pass into the sea

[Pre-Chorus]
She comes from the town where they call her the woodcutter's daughter
And she's brown as the bank where she kneels down to gather her water
And she bears it away with a love that the river has taught her

[Chorus]
Let it flow, let it flow, wide and clear

[Verse 2]
Round and round, the cut of the plow in the furrowed field
Seasons round, the bushels of corn and the barley meal
Broken ground, open and beckoning to the spring
Black dirt live again

[Pre-Chorus]
The plowman is broad as the back of the land he's sowing
As he dances the circular track of the plow ever knowing
That the work of his days measures more than the planting and growing

[Chorus]
Let it grow, let it grow, greatly yield

[Bridge]
What shall we say, shall we call it by a name?
As well to count the angels dancing on a pin
Water bright as the sky from which it came
And the name is on the earth that takes it in
We will not speak but stand inside the rain
And listen to the thunder shout, "I am! I am! I am! I am!"

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
So it goes, we make what we make since the world began
Nothing more, the love of the women, the work of man
Seasons round, creatures great and small
Up and down as we rise and fall
Rise and fall

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
What shall we say, shall we call it by a name?
As well to count the angels dancing on a pin
Water bright as the sky from which it came
And the name is on the earth that takes it in
We will not speak but stand inside the rain
And listen to the thunder shout, "I am! I am! I am! I am!"

[Instrumental]

[Outro]
We're gonna be back in just a little bit

[Chorus]
Comes a time when the blind man takes your hand, says "Don't you see?
Gotta make it somehow on the dreams you still believe."
Don't give it up, you got an empty cup only love can fill
Only love can fill

[Verse 1]
Walking all morning, been walking all night
I can't see much difference between the dark and the light
And I feel the wind, I taste the rain
Never in my mind to cause so much pain

[Chorus]
Comes a time when the blind man takes your hand, says "Don't you see?
Gotta make it somehow on the dreams you still believe."
Don't give it up, you got an empty cup only love can fill
Only love can fill

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
From day to day just letting it ride
You get so far away from how it feels inside
You can't let go 'cause you're afraid to fall
But the day may come when you can't feel at all

[Chorus]
Comes a time when the blind man takes your hand, says "Don't you see?
Gotta make it somehow on the dreams you still believe."
Don't give it up, you got an empty cup only love can fill
Only love can fill
Only love can fill

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Walk me out in the morning dew, my honey
Walk me out in the morning dew today
I'll walk you out in the morning dew, my honey
I can't walk you out in the morning dew today

[Verse 2]
Thought I heard a baby cry this morning
I thought I heard a baby cry today
I thought I heard a baby cry this morning
I can't walk you out in the morning dew today

[Verse 3]
Thought I heard a young man mourn this morning
Thought I heard a young man mourn today
Thought I heard a young man mourn this morning
I can't walk you out in the morning dew today

[Verse 4]
Where have all the people gone, my honey?
Where have all the people gone today?
There's no need for you to be worrying about all those peoplе
You never see those pеople anyway

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 5]
Walk me out in the morning dew, my honey
Walk me out in the morning dew today
I'll walk you out in the morning dew, my honey
I guess it doesn't matter anyway
I guess it doesn't matter anyway
I guess it doesn't matter anyway

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
I guess it doesn't matter anyway

[Verse 1]
I wanna tell you how it's gonna be
You're gonna give your love to me
I wanna love you night and day
You know our love will not fade away
You know our love will not fade away
Will not fade away

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
My love is bigger than a Cadillac
I try to show you but you drive me back
Your love for me has got to be real
You're gonna know just how I feel
Our love is real, not fade away
Not fade away

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
I wanna tell you how it's gonna be
You're gonna give your love to me
I wanna love you night and day
You know our love will not fade away
You know our love will not fade away

[Outro]
You know our love will not fade away

You know our love will not fade away

[Verse 1]
A man and a woman come together as strangers
When they part they're usually strangers still
It's like a practical joke played on us by our maker
Empty bottles that can't be filled

[Chorus]
Baby, who's to say it should have been different now that it's done
(Baby, who's to say)
Baby, who's to say that it should have been, anyway
Baby, who's to say that it even matters in the long run
(Baby, who's to say)
Give it just a minute
And it'll blow away

[Verse 2]
You fancy me to be the master of your feelings
You barely bruise me with your looks to kill
I admit we were sometimes brutal in our dealings
I never hеld you against your will

[Chorus]
Baby, who's to say it should have been different now that it's donе
(Baby, who's to say)
Baby, who's to say that it should have been, anyway
Baby, who's to say that it even matters in the long run
(Baby, who's to say)
Give it just a minute
It'll blow away

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Your case against me is so very clearly stated
I plead no contest, I just turn and I shrug
I've come to figure all importance overestimated
You must mean water when you get on your knees and you beg me for blood

[Chorus]
Baby, who's to say it should have been different now that it's done
(Baby, who's to say)
Baby, who's to say that it should have been, anyway
Baby, who's to say that it even matters in the long run
(Baby, who's to say)
Give it just a minute
It'll blow away, it'll blow away

[Outro]
Like a feather in a whirlwind (Blow away)
Just as surely as the world spins (Blow away)
Oh, it'll blow away (Blow away)
Ooh, it'll blow
Give it just a little minute, give it just a little minute now
Give it just a little little bitty minute now
Give it just, give it just a, give it just a little minute now
And it'll blow away
Give it just a little minute
It'll blow, it'll blow, it'll blow away
Just a little minute

[Instrumental Break]

Give it just a little, little bitty minute, bitty minute now, baby
And it'll blow, it'll blow, it'll blow away
Give it just a little bitty minute
And let it blow, let it blow, let it blow, let it blow
Let it blow, let it blow, let it blow, let it blow away
Just a litt', just a litt', just a little, little bitty goddamn minute, baby
Can't you spare just one little goddamn minute?
Ah, ooh, it'll blow, it'll blow away
It'll blow, it'll blow, it'll blow, it'll blow, it'll blow
It'll blow, it'll blow, it'll blow, it'll blow, it'll blow away
Wait a minute

[Verse 1]
Just like Jack the Ripper
Just like Mojo Hand
Just like Billy Sunday
In a shotgun ragtime band
Just like New York City
Just like Jericho
Pace the halls and climb the walls
And get out when they blow

[Chorus]
Did you say your name was
Ramblin' Rose?
Ramble on, baby
Settle down easy
Ramble on, Rose

[Verse 2]
Just like Jack and Jill
Mama told the tailor
One heat up or one cool down
Nothin' for the sailor
Just like Jack and Jill
Papa told the jailer
One heat up, one go down
Do yourself a favor

[Chorus]
Did you say your name was
Ramblin' Rose?
Ramble on, baby
Settle down еasy
Ramble on, Rose

[Bridge]
I'm gonna sing you a hundred vеrses in ragtime
I know this song it ain't never gonna end
I'm gonna march you up and down the local county line
Take you to the leader of the band

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Just like Crazy Otto
Just like Wolfman Jack
Sittin' plush with a royal flush
Aces back to back
Just like Mary Shelley
Just like Frankenstein
Clank your chains, and count your change
And try to walk the line

[Chorus]
Did you say your name was
Ramblin' Rose?
Ramble on, baby
Settle down easy
Ramble on, Rose

[Bridge]
I'm gonna sing you a hundred verses in ragtime
I know this song it ain't never gonna end
I'm gonna march you up and down the local county line
Take you to the leader of the band

[Verse 4]
Goodbye, Mama and Papa
Goodbye, Jack and Jill
The grass ain't greener, the wine ain't sweeter
On either side of the hill

[Chorus]
Did you say your name was
Ramblin' Rose?
Ramble on, baby
Settle down easy
Ramble on, Rose

[Outro]
Ramble on, Rose

[Verse 1]
You told me goodbye, how was I to know
You didn't mean goodbye, you meant please don't let me go

[Chorus]
I'm having a high time, living the good life
Well, you know

[Verse 2]
The wheels are muddy, got a ton of hay
Now listen here, baby, 'cause I mean what I say

[Chorus]
I'm having a hard time, living the good life
Don't be that way

[Bridge]
I was losing time, I had nothing to do
No one to fight, I came to you
Wheels broke down, the leader won't draw
The line is busted, the last one I saw

[Verse 3]
Tomorrow come trouble, tomorrow come pain
Now don't think too hard, baby, 'cause you know what I'm saying

[Chorus]
I could show you a high time, living the good lifе
Well, you know

[Verse 4]
Nothing's for certain, it could always go wrong
Come on in whеn it's raining, go on out when it's gone

[Chorus]
We could have us a high time, living the good life
Don't be that way

[Verse 1]
I told Althea I was feeling lost
Lacking in some direction
Althea told me upon scrutiny
That my back might need protection
I told Althea that treachery
Was tearing me limb from limb
Althea told me, "Now, cool down, boy
Settle back easy, Jim"

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
You may be Saturday's child all grown
Moving with a pinch of grace
You may be a clown in the burying ground
Or just another pretty face
You may be the fate of Ophelia
Sleeping and perchance to dream
Honest to the point of recklessness
Self-centered to the extremе

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Ain't nobody messing with you but you
Your friends are gеtting most concerned
Loose with the truth, maybe it's your fire
Baby I hope you don't get burned
When the smoke has cleared, she said
That's what she said to me
You're gonna want a bed to lay your head
And a little sympathy

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
There are things you can replace
And others you cannot
The time has come to weigh those things
This space is getting hot
You know this space is getting hot

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 4]
I told Althea I was a roving sign
I was born to be a bachelor
Althea told me: "Okay, that's fine"
You know now I'm trying to catch her
Can't talk to you without talking to me
We're guilty of the same old thing
Thinking a lot about less and less
And forgetting the love we bring

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
Who else is gonna bring you a broken arrow?
Who else is gonna bring you a bottle of rain?
There you goes moving across the water
There you go turning my whole world around

[Verse 1]
Do you feel what I feel?
Can we make it so that's part of the deal?
I gotta hold you in these arms of steel
Lay my heart on the line this time
I wanna breathe when you breathe
When you whisper like that hot summer breeze
Count the beads of sweat that cover me
Didn't you show me a sign this time?

[Chorus]
Who elsе is gonna bring you a broken arrow?
Who else is gonna bring you a bottlе of rain?
There you go moving across the water
There you go (There you go) turning my whole world around

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Do you see what I see?
Can you cut behind the mystery?
I will meet you at the witness tree
Leave the whole world behind
I want to come when you call
I'll get to you if I have to crawl
They can't hold me with these iron walls
We got mountains to climb

[Chorus]
Who else is gonna bring you a broken arrow?
Who else is gonna bring you a bottle of rain?
There you go moving across the water
There you go (There you go) turning my whole world around

[Outro]
There you go (There you go) moving across the water
There you go (There you go) turning my whole world around
Turning my whole world around (There you go)

[Verse 1]
Thought I heard a blackbird singin'
Up on Bluebird Hill
Call me a whinin' boy if you will
Born where the sun don't shine
The rain refuse to fall
And you don't seem to hear me when I call

Thought I heard that KC whistle
Moanin' sweet and low
Thought I heard that KC when she blow
Down where the sun don't shine
Underneath the Kokomo
Whinin' boy got no place to go

[Chorus]
So many roads I tell you
So many roads I know
All I want is one to take me home
From the high road to the low
So many roads I know
So many roads, so many roads

[Verse 2]
Thought I heard a jug band playin'
"If you don't, who else will?"
From over on the far side of the hill
All I know the sun don't shine
And thе rain refuse to fall
You don't seem to hear mе when I call

Wind inside and the wind outside
Tangled in the window blind
Tell me why you treat me so unkind
Down where the sun don't shine
Lonely and I call your name
Got no place to go, ain't that a shame?

[Chorus]
New York to San Francisco
So many roads I know
All I want is one to lead me home
From the high road to the low
So many roads I know
So many roads, so many roads

[Verse 3]
In the land of the midnight sun
Where ice blue roses grow
'long those roads of gold and silver snow
Howlin' wide or moanin' low
So many roads I know

[Outro]
So many roads to heal my soul
So many roads to heal my soul
So many roads to heal my soul
So many roads to heal my soul
So many roads to heal my soul
So many roads to heal my soul
So many roads to heal my soul
So many roads to heal my soul
So many roads to heal my soul
So many roads to heal my soul
So many roads to heal my soul
So many roads
So many roads to heal my soul
So many roads to heal my soul
So many roads
So many roads to heal my soul
So many roads to heal my soul
So many roads
Oh, so many roads to heal my soul
To heal my soul
So many roads to heal my soul
So many roads to heal my soul
So many roads to heal my soul
So many roads to heal my soul

[Verse 1]
Ain't it just like the night to play tricks
When you're tryin' to be so quiet?
We sit here stranded, though we're all doing our best to deny it
And Louise holds a handful of rain tempting you to defy it
Lights flicker from the opposite loft
The country music station plays soft
Nothing, really nothing to turn off
Just Louise and her lover so entwined
These visions of Johanna conquer my mind

[Verse 2]
Empty lot where the ladies play
Blindman's bluff with the keychain
The all-night girls, they whisper out on the "D" train
We can hear thе night watchman click his flashlight
Ask himself if it's him or them, it's insane
Louisе, she's alright, she's just near
She's delicate and seems like the mirror
She makes it all too concise and too clear
That Johanna's not here
The ghost of electricity howls in the bones of her face
Where these visions of Johanna have taken my place

[Verse 3]
Little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously
He brags of his misery, he likes to live dangerously
When bringing her name up he speaks of her farewell kiss to me
He's sure got a lot of gall to be so useless and all
Muttering small talk at the wall while I'm in the hall
How can I explain? It's so hard to get on
And these visions of Johanna, kept me up past the dawn

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 4]
Inside the museums Infinity goes up on trial
Voices echo this is what salvation must be like after a while
But Mona Lisa must have had the highway blues
You can tell by the way she smiles
The primitive wallflower freeze
The jelly-faced women all sneeze
Hear the one with the mustache say "Jeez, I can't find my knees."
Jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule
Visions of Johanna make it all seem so cruel

[Verse 5]
The peddler now speaks to the countess who's pretending to care for him
"Name me someone that's not a parasite
And I'll go out and say a prayer for him."
Like Louise always says "Ya can't look at much, can ya, man?"
As she, herself, prepares for him
Madonna, she still has not showed
We see this empty cage now corrode
Where her cape of the stage once had flowed
The fiddler now steps to the road
He writes everything's been returned which was owed
On the back of the fish truck that loads
While my conscience explodes
Oh, the harmonicas play the skeleton keys and the rain
These visions of Johanna are now all that remain

[Outro]
These visions of Johanna are now all that remain

[Chorus]
I taught that weeping willow how to cry, cry, cry
Taught the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky
Tears I cried for that woman are gonna flood you, big river
I'm gonna sit right here until I die

[Verse 1]
Well, I met her accidentally in St. Paul, Minnesota
She tore me up every time I heard her drawl, that Southern drawl
Well, I heard my dream went back downstream, cavorting in Davenport
And I follow you big river when you called

[Chorus]
Taught that weeping willow how to cry, cry, cry
Taught the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky
Tears I cried for that woman are gonna flood you, big river
I'm gonna sit right hеre until I die

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Well, I followеd her down to St. Louie, later on down the river
Trader said she's been here, but she's gone, boy, she's gone
Then I followed her down to Memphis
But she just walked off the bus
She raised a few eyebrows when she went on down alone

[Chorus]
Taught that weeping willow how to cry, cry, cry
Taught the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky
Tears I cried for that woman are gonna flood you, big river
I'm gonna sit right here until I die

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
I've gotten on down to Baton Rouge, River Queen roll on
Take that woman down to New Orleans, to New Orleans
I give up, 'cause I've had enough
Followed my blues on down to the gulf
She loves you, big river, more than me

[Chorus]
Taught that weeping willow how to cry, cry, cry
Taught the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky
Tears I cried for that woman are gonna flood you, big river
I'm gonna sit right here until I die

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Well, I taught that weeping willow how to cry, cry, cry
Taught the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky
Tears I cried for that woman are gonna flood you, big river
I'm gonna sit right here until I die

[Outro]
I'm gonna sit right here until I die
I'm gonna sit right here until I die

[Instrumental]

[Verse]
Dark star crashes
Pouring its light into ashes
Reason tatters
The forces tear loose from the axis
Searchlight casting
For faults in the clouds of delusion

[Refrain]
Shall we go
You and I while we can
Through
The transitive nightfall of diamonds

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
I left my home in Norfolk, Virginia
California on my mind
Straddled that Greyhound, it rode me past Raleigh
And on across Carolin'
Stopped in Charlotte and bypassed Rock Hill
And we never was a minute late
We was ninety miles out of Atlanta by sundown
Rolling across the Georgia state
Stopped in Charlotte and bypassed Rock Hill
And we never was a minute late
We was ninety miles out of Atlanta by sundown
Rolling across the Georgia state

[Verse 2]
Straight off bought me a through train ticket
Right across Mississippi clean
And I was on that midnight flyer out of Birmingham
Smoking into New Orleans
Somebody hеlp me get out of Louisiana
Just help mе get to Houston town
There's people there who care a little about me
And they won't let the poor boy down
Sure as you're born, they bought me a silk suit
Put luggage in my hands
And I woke up high over Albuquerque
On a jet to the promised land

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Working on a T-bone steak a la carte
Flying over to the Golden State
When the pilot told us in thirteen minutes
We'd be heading in the terminal gate
Swing low sweet chariot, come down easy
Taxi to the terminal zone
Cut your engines and cool your wings
And let me make it to the telephone
Los Angeles, give me Norfolk, Virginia
Tidewater four-ten-oh-nine
Tell the folks back home this is the promised land calling
The poor boy's on the line, woo

[Verse 1]
When they come to take you down
When they bring that wagon 'round
When they come to call on you
And drag your poor body down

[Pre-Chorus]
Just one thing I ask of you, it's just one thing for me
Please forget you knew my name, my darling Sugaree

[Chorus]
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
You thought you was the cool fool
Never could do no wrong
You had everything sewn up tight
How come you lay awake all night long?

[Pre-Chorus]
Just one thing I ask of you, it's just one thing for me
Please forget you knew my name, my darling Sugaree

[Chorus]
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
You know in spite of all you gained
You still have to stand out in the pouring rain
One last voice is calling you
And I guess it's time to go

[Pre-Chorus]
Just one thing I ask of you, it's just one thing for me
Please forget you knew my name, my darling Sugaree

[Chorus]
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
Shake it up now, Sugaree
I'll meet you at the Jubilee
If that Jubilee don't come
Maybe I'll meet you on the run

[Pre-Chorus]
Just one thing I ask of you, it's just one thing for me
Please forget you knew my name, my darling Sugaree

[Chorus]
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me

[Verse 1]
Laid back in an old saloon with a peso in my hand
Watching flies and children on the street
And I catch a glimpse of black-eyed girls that giggle when I smile
There's a little boy that wants to shine my feet
And it's a three days ride from Bakersfield and I don't know why I came
I guess I came to keep from paying dues
So instead I've got a bottle and a girl that's just fourteen
And a damn good case of the Mexicali Blues, yeah

[Chorus]
Is there anything a man don't stand to lose
When the devil wants to take it all away?
Cherish well your thoughts, and keep a tight grip on your booze
'Cause thinkin' and drinkin' are all I have today

[Verse 2]
She said her name was Billie Jean and she was fresh in town
I didn't know a stage line ran from Hell
She had raven hair, a ruffled dress, a necklace made of gold
And all the French perfume you'd care to smell
She took me up into her room and whispered in my ear
"Go on, my friend, do anything you choose"
So instead I've got a bottle...
...rest of my lifetime running of the Mexicali Blues, yeah

[Chorus]
Is there anything a man don't stand to lose
When the devil wants to take it all away?
Cherish well your thoughts, and keep a tight grip on your booze
'Cause thinkin' and drinkin' are all I have today

[Verse 3]
Then a man rode into town, some thought he was the law
Billie Jean was waiting when he came
She told me he would take her, if I didn't use my gun
But I'd have no one but myself to blame
I went down to those dusty streets, blood was on my mind
I guess that stranger hadn't heard the news
'Cause I shot first and killed him, Lord, he didn't even draw
And now I'll spend my lifetime running with the Mexicali Blues, yeah

[Outro]
Is there anything a man don't stand to lose
When he lets a woman hold him in her hands?
You just might find yourself out there on horseback in the dark
Just riding and running across the desert sands

[Verse 1]
Cold iron shackles and ball and chain
Listen to the whistle of the evening train
You know you bound to wind up dead
If you don't head back to Tennessee, Jed

[Verse 2]
Rich man step on my poor head
When you get back you better butter my bread
Well, you know, it's like I said
You better head back to Tennessee, Jed

[Chorus]
Tennessee, Tennessee
There ain't no place I'd rather be
Baby, won't you carry me
Back to Tennessee

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Drink all day and rock all night
The law come to get you if you don't walk right
Well, you got the morning paper and all it read:
You better head back to Tennessee, Jed

[Verse 4]
Dropped four flights and cracked my spine
Honey, come quick with the iodine
Catch a few winks, baby, down under the bed
You better head back to Tennessee, Jed

[Chorus]
Tennessee, Tennessee
There ain't no place I'd rather be
Baby, won't you carry me
Back to Tennessee

[Verse 5]
I run into Charlie Phogg
He blacked my eye and he kicked my dog
My dog, he turned to me and he said:
You better head back to Tennessee, Jed

[Verse 6]
I woke up a-feeling mean
I went down to play the slot machine
The wheels turned around, baby, the letters read:
You better head back to Tennessee, Jed

[Chorus]
Tennessee, Tennessee
There ain't no place I'd rather be
Baby, won't you carry me
Back to Tennessee

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
Tennessee, Tennessee
There ain't no place I'd rather be
Baby, won't you carry me
Back to Tennessee

[Verse 1]
I woke today, felt your side of the bed
The covers were still warm where you'd been layin'
You were gone, my heart was filled with dread
You might not be sleeping here again

[Chorus]
It's alright, 'cause I love you
That's not gonna change
Run me around, make me hurt again and again
But I'll still sing you love songs
Written in the letters of your name
And brave the storm to come
For it surely looks like rain

[Verse 2]
Did you ever waken to the sound of street cats making love?
You guess from their cries you were listening to a fight
Well, you know, oh, hate's just the last thing they're thinking of
You're only tryin' to make it through the night

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
I only wanna hold you, I don't wanna tie you down
Or fit you in the lines I might've drawn
It's just that I, I, have gotten used, used to havin' you around
My landscape would be empty if you were gone

[Chorus]
But it's alright, 'cause I love you
That's not gonna change
Run me around, make me hurt again and again
But I'll still sing you love songs
Written in the letters of your name
And brave the storm to come
For it surely looks like rain

[Outro]
Brave the storm to come 'cause it looks like rain
In the world the people say, here comes the rain
Looks like rain and it feels like rain
Oh, oh, looks like rain, it looks like rain
Everywhere the people say, here comes the rain
Whole world looks gray, it looks rain
Looks like rain and it feels like rain
Oh, oh, here comes the rain, it looks like rain
Oh, looks gray and it looks like rain
We gotta, we gotta re-plug some stuff here, it'll take about thirty seconds, so you in this time should feel free to talk amongst yourselves

[Chorus]
Don't ease, don't ease
Don't ease me in
I've been all night long coming home, don't ease me in

[Verse 1]
I was walking down Main
With a dollar in my hand
I was looking for a woman
Sweet mama didn't have a man

[Chorus]
Don't ease, don't ease
Don't ease me in
I've been all night long coming home, don't ease me in

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
I was walking down Main, Deep Elem in June
You know all those women down there got the Texas blues

[Chorus]
Don't ease, don't ease
Don't ease me in
I've been all night long coming homе, don't ease me in

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Thе girl I love, she's sweet and true
The dress she wears, sweet mama, it's pink and blue
She brings me coffee, she brings me tea
She brings me about every darn thing but the jailhouse key

[Chorus]
Don't ease, don't ease
Don't ease me in
I've been all night long coming home, don't ease me in

[Outro]
Don't ease, don't ease
Don't ease me in
I've been all night long coming home, don't ease me in

[Verse 1: The Grateful Dead]
We can share the women, we can share the wine
We can share what we got of yours 'cause we done shared all of mine
Keep on rollin', just a mile to go
Keep on rollin' my old buddy, you're movin' much too slow

[Verse 2: Jerry Garcia, Bob Weir]
I just jumped the watchman, right outside the fence
Took his rings, four bucks in change, ain't that Heaven sent?
Hurts my ears to listen, Shannon, it burns my eyes to see
Cut down a man in cold blood, Shannon, it might as well've been me

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3: Bob Weir]
We used to play for silver, now we play for life
One's for sport and one's for blood at thе point of a knife
Now the die is shakеn, now the die must fall
There ain't no winner in the game, he don't go home with all
Not with all

[Verse 4: The Grateful Dead]
Leavin' Texas, fourth day of July
Sun so hot, the clouds so low, the eagles filled the sky
Catch the Detroit Lightning out of Santa Fe
The Great Northern out of Cheyenne, from sea to shining sea

[Verse 5: Jerry Garcia, Bob Weir]
Gotta go to Tulsa, first train we can ride
Gotta settle one old score, one small point of pride
Ain't a place a man can hide, Shannon, will keep him from the sun
Ain't a bed can give us rest now, you keep us on the run

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 6: The Grateful Dead]
Jack Straw from Wichita
Cut his buddy down
Dug for him a shallow grave
And laid his body down
Half a mile from Tucson
By the morning light
One man gone and another to go
My old buddy, you're moving much too slow

[Outro: The Grateful Dead]
We can share the women, we can share the wine

[Verse 1]
Merry run around, sailin' up and down
Looking for a shove in some direction
Got it from the top, it's nothing you can stop
God, you know they made a fine connection

[Chorus]
They love each other
You can see that it's true
You can see that it's true

[Verse 2]
He could pass his time, around some other line
But you know he chose this place beside her
Though you'll make a noise, they just can't hear your voice
They're on a dizzy ride and you're cold sober

[Chorus]
They love each other
You can see that it's true
You can see that it's true

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Nothing you can play, it's likе a diesel train
You bettеr not be there when it rolls over
Though you'll make a noise, they still can't hear your voice
They're on a dizzy ride and you're cold sober

[Chorus]
They love each other
You can see that it's true
You can see that it's true

[Bridge]
Hope you believe what I say is true
Everything I tell you, I heard it first from you

[Verse 4]
Heard your news report, you knew you're falling short
Pretty soon won't trust you for the weather
When that ship comes in, you won't know where it's been
You got to try to see a little further

[Chorus]
They love each other
You can see that it's true
You can see that it's true
You can see that it's true

[Verse 1]
Out in the West Texas town of El Paso
I fell in love with a Mexican girl
Night time would find me in Rosa's Cantina
Music would play and Felina would whirl
Black as the night were the eyes of Felina
Wicked and evil while casting a spell
My love was strong for this Mexican maiden
I was in love, but in vain I could tell

[Bridge]
One night a wild young cowboy came in
Wild as the West Texas wind
Dashing and daring, a drink he was sharing
With wicked Felina, the girl that I love
So in anger

[Verse 2]
I challenged his right for the love of this maiden
Down went his hand for the gun that he wore
My challenge was answered in less than a heartbeat
The handsome young stranger lay dead on the floor
Just for a moment I stood there in silence
Shocked by the foul evil deed I had done
Many thoughts raced through my mind as I stood there
I had but one chance and that was to run

[Bridge]
Out through the back door of Rosa's I ran
Out where the horses were tied
I picked a good one, he looked like he could run
Up on his back and away I did ride
Just as fast as I

[Verse 3]
Could from the West Texas town of El Paso
Out through the badlands of New Mexico
Back in El Paso my life would be worthless
Everything's gone in life, nothing is left
But it's been so long since I've seen the young maiden
My love is stronger than my fear of death

[Bridge]
I saddled up and away I did go, riding alone in the dark
Maybe tomorrow a bullet may find me
Tonight nothing's worse than this pain in my heart
And at last here I

[Verse 4]
Am on the hill overlooking El Paso
I can see Rosa's Cantina below
My love is strong and it pushes me onward
Down off the hill to Felina I go
Back in El Paso I see five mounted cowboys
Off to my left ride a dozen or more
Shouting and shooting, I can't let them catch me
I've got to make it to Rosa's back door

[Bridge]
Something is dreadfully wrong, for I feel
A deep burning pain in my side
I am trying to stay in the saddle
I'm getting weary, unable to ride
But my love for

[Verse 5]
Felina is strong
And I writhe where I've fallen
Though I am weary, I can't stop to rest
I see the white puff of smoke from the rifle
I feel the bullet go deep in my chest
From out of nowhere, Felina has found me
Kissing my cheek as she kneels by my side
Cradled by two loving arms that I'll die for
One little kiss and Felina goodbye

[Outro]
Thank you

[Verse 1]
Julie catch a rabbit by his hair
Come back stepping, like to walk on air
Get back home where you belong
And don't you run off no more

Don't hang your head and let the two time roll
Grass shack nailed to a pine wood floor
Ask the time, baby, I don't know
Come back later, gonna let it show

[Chorus]
And I say row, Jimmy, row
Gonna get there? I don't know
Seems a common way to go
Get down, row
Row, row, row, row

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Here's a half a dollar if you dare
Double twist when you hit the air
Look at Julie down below
The levee doing the do-pas-o

[Chorus]
And I say row, Jimmy, row
Gonna get there? I don't know
Seems a common way to go
Get down, row
Row, row, row, row

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Broken heart don't feel so bad
You ain't got half of what you thought you had
Rock your baby to and fro
Not too fast and not too slow

[Chorus]
And I say row, Jimmy, row
Gonna gеt there? I don't know
Seems a common way to go
Get down, row
Row, row, row, row

[Bridge]
That's thе way it's been in town
Ever since they tore the jukebox down
Two-bit piece don't buy no more
Not so much as it done before

[Chorus]
And I say row, Jimmy, row
Gonna get there? I don't know
Seems a common way to go
Get down, row
Row, row, row, row
I say row, Jimmy, row
Gonna get there? I don't know
Seems a common way to go
Get down, row
Row, row, row, row

[Outro]
Oh, get down, row
Row, row, row, row
Oh, get down, row
Row, row, row, row

[Intro]
Three, five, seven, eight, nine, ten

[Verse 1]
Some folks trust to reason
Others trust to might
I don't trust nothing
But I know it come out right
Say it once again now
Oh, I hope you understand
When it’s done and over
Lord, a man is just a man

[Chorus]
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on the land

[Verse 2]
Some folks look for answers
Others look for fights
Some folks up in treetops
Just looking for their kites
But I can tell your future
Oh, look what's in your hand
But I can't stop for nothing
I’m just playing in the band

[Chorus]
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on the land

[Instrumental Break]

[Interlude]
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 3]
Standing on a tower
World at my command
You just keep turning
While I'm playing in the band
And if a man among you
Got no sin upon his hand
Let him cast a stone at me
For playing in the band

[Chorus]
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on the land

[Instrumental Break]

[Interlude]
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on the land
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on the land
Playing
Like a wave upon the sand
Daybreak
While I'm playing in the band

[Instrumental]

[Outro]
Thank y'all. We're gonna take a short break and we'll be back in just a few minutes, so everybody hang loose

[Verse 1]
Look for a while at the china cat sunflower
Proud walking jingle in the midnight sun
Copperdome bodhi drip a silver kimono
Like a crazy quilt stargown through a dream night wind

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Krazy Kat peeking through a lace bandanna
Like a one-eyed cheshire, like a diamond-eye jack
A leaf of all colors plays a golden-string fiddle
To a double-e waterfall all over my back

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Comic book colors on a violin river
Crying a lot of words from out a silk trombone
I rang a silent bell, beneath a shower of pearls
In the eagle-winged palace of the Queen Chinee

[Instrumental]

[Chorus: The Grateful Dead]
I know you, rider, gonna miss me when I'm gone
I know you, rider, gonna miss me when I'm gone
Gonna miss your baby, from rolling in your arms

[Verse 1: The Grateful Dead]
Laid down last night, Lord, I could not take my rest
Laid down last night, Lord, I could not take my rest
My mind was wandering like the wild geese in the West

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2: The Grateful Dead]
The sun will shine in my back door someday
The sun will shine in my back door someday
March winds will blow all my troubles away

[Verse 3: Jerry Garcia]
I wish I was a headlight, on a northbound train
I wish I was a headlight, on a northbound train
I'd shine my light through the cool Colorado rain

[Chorus: The Grateful Dead]
I know you, rider, gonna miss me when I'm gone
I know you, rider, gonna miss me when I'm gone
Gonna miss your baby, from rolling in your arms

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro: The Grateful Dead]
I know you, rider, gonna miss me when I'm gone, gone, gonе
I know you, rider, gonna miss me when I'm gonе, gone, gone
Gonna miss your baby, from rolling in your arms

[Verse 1]
Well, me and my uncle went riding down
South Colorado, west Texas bound
We stopped over in Santa Fe
That being the point just about halfway
And you know it was the hottest part of the day

[Verse 2]
Well, I took the horses up to the stall
Went to the barroom, ordered drinks for all
Three days in the saddle, you know my body hurt
It being summer, I took off my shirt
And I tried to wash off some of that dusty dirt

[Verse 3]
West Texas cowboys, oh, they's all around
With liquor and money, oh, they's loaded down
So soon after payday, know it seemed a shame
You know my uncle, he starts a friendly game
Hеy, high-low jack and the winner take thе hand

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 4]
My uncle started winning; cowboys got sore
One of them called him, and then two more
Accused him of cheating; well, oh no, it couldn't be
I know my uncle, he's as honest as me
You know, I'm as honest as a Denver man can be, that's me
One of them cowboys, he starts to draw
Well, I shot him down, Lord, he never saw
Shot me another, well, hot damn, he won't grow old
In the confusion, my uncle grabbed the gold
You know, we high-tailed it down to Mexico

[Outro]
I love those cowboys, I love their gold
I love my uncle, well, God rest his soul
He taught me good, Lord, he taught me all I know
Taught me so well, well, I grabbed that gold
And I left his dead ass there by the side of the road

[Verse 1]
On the day when I was born, Daddy sat down and cried
I had the mark just as plain as day that could not be denied
They say that Cain caught Abel rolling loaded dice
Ace of Spades behind his ear and him not thinking twice

[Chorus]
Half-step, Mississippi uptown toodeloo
Hello, baby, I'm gone, goodbye
Half a cup of rock and rye
Farewell to you old Southern skies
I'm on my way, on my way

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
If all you got to live for is what you left behind
Get yourself a powder charge and seal that silver mine
Lost my boots in transit, baby, pile of smoking leather
Nailed a retread to my feet and prayеd for better weathеr

[Chorus]
Half-step, Mississippi uptown toodeloo
Hello, baby, I'm gone, goodbye
Half a cup of rock and rye
Farewell to you old Southern skies
I'm on my way, on my way

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
They say that when your ship comes in, first man takes the sails
Second takes the afterdeck, the third, the planks and rails
What's the point of calling shots
This cue ain't straight in line
Cue balls made of Styrofoam and no one's got the time

[Chorus]
Half-step, Mississippi uptown toodeloo
Hello, baby, I'm gone, goodbye
Half a cup of rock and rye
Farewell to you old Southern skies
I'm on my way, on my way
On my way

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
Across the Rio Grande-o
Across the lazy river
Across the Rio Grande-o
Across the lazy river
Across the Rio Grande-o
Across the lazy river
Across the Rio Grande-o
Across the lazy river
Across the Rio Grande-o
Across the lazy river
Across the Rio Grande-o
Across the lazy river

[Verse 1]
Walk me out in the morning dew, my honey
Walk me out in the morning dew today
I can't walk you out in the morning dew, my honey
I can't walk you out in the morning dew today

[Verse 2]
I thought I heard a baby cry this morning
I thought I heard a baby cry today
You didn't hear no baby cry this morning
You didn't hear no baby cry today

[Verse 3]
Where have all the people gone this morning?
Where have all the people gone today?
There's no need for you to be worrying about all those people
You never see those people anyway

[Verse 4]
I thought I heard a young man mourn this morning
I thought I heard a young man mourn today
I thought I heard a young man mourn this morning
I can't walk you out in the morning dew today

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 5]
Walk me out in the morning dew, my honey
Walk me out in the morning dew today
I can't walk you out in the morning dew, my honey
I guess it doesn't matter anyway
I guess it doesn't matter anyway
I guess it doesn't matter anyway

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
I guess it doesn't matter anyway

[Verse 1]
Sugar magnolia, blossoms blooming
Heads all empty, and I don't care
Saw my baby down by the river
Knew she'd have to come up soon for air

Sweet blossom come on, under the willow
We can have high times if you'll abide
We can discover the wonders of nature
Rolling in the rushes down by the riverside

[Chorus]
She's got everything delightful
She's got everything I need
Takes the wheel when I'm seeing double
Pays my ticket when I speed

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
She comes skimmin' through rays of violet
She can wade in a drop of dew
She don't come, and I don't follow
Waits backstage while I sing to you
She can dance a Cajun rhythm
Jump like a Willys in four-wheel drive
She's my summer love in the spring, fall, and winter
She can make happy any man alive

Sugar magnolia, ringing that bluebell
While caught up in sunlight
Now, come on out singing, I'll walk you in the sunshine
Ooh, come on, honey, come along with me

[Chorus]
She's got everything delightful
She's got everything I need
A breeze in the pines and the sun and bright moonlight
Lazing in the sunlight? Yes, indeed

[Verse 3]
Sometimes when the cuckoo's crying
When the moon is halfway down
Sometimes when the night is dying
I take me out and I wander around
Walk around

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
One, two, one, two, three, four
Sunshine daydream, walk you in the tall trees
Going where the wind goes
Blooming like a red rose
Come on over sweetly
Ride out singin'; I'll catch you in the morning sunshine
Sunshine daydream, sunshine daydream
Well, coming, coming from a sweet dream
Sunshine daydream
Now come on over, daydream
Sunshine daydream
Wading in a cold stream
Crawl on out your window
Going, going where the wind goes
They're never gonna miss us
Ride out singin', I'll catch you in the morning sunshine
Sunshine daydream, sunshine daydream, woo-hoo
Sunshine daydream, woo-hoo
Sunshine daydream
Come on over, daydream
Sunshine daydream, come on, coming from a sweet dream
Sunshine daydream, woo-hoo
Sunshine daydream, woo-hoo
Sunshine, sunshine daydream, oh yeah
Sunshine daydream, woo-hoo
Sunshine daydream, oh yeah
Sunshine daydream, woo-hoo
Come on, come on over, daydream, woo-hoo
Come on over, daydream
Sunshine daydream, woo-hoo
Come on over, daydream
Sunshine daydream, sunshine daydream
Sunshine daydream
Sweet lovin' daydream
Come on, daydream; come on, daydream

[Instrumental Break]

Thank you all and good night

[Verse 1]
Right outside this lazy summer home
Ain't got time to call your soul a critic, no
Right outside the lazy gate of winter's summer home
Wondering where the nut-thatch winters
Wings a mile long just carried the bird away

[Chorus]
Wake up to find out that you are the eyes of the world
The heart has its beaches, its homeland and thoughts of its own
Wake now, discover that you are the song that the morning brings
The heart has its seasons, its evenings and songs of its own

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
There comes a redeemer, and he slowly too fades away
Follows his wagon behind him that's loaded with clay
The seeds that were silent all burst into bloom and decay
And night comes so quiet, it's close on the heels of the day

[Chorus]
Wake up to find out that you are the eyes of the world
The heart has its beaches, its homeland and thoughts of its own
Wake now, discover that you are the song that the morning brings
The heart has its seasons, its evenings and songs of its own

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Sometimes we live no particular way but our own
Sometimes we visit your country and live in your home
Sometimes we ride on your horses, sometimes we walk alone
Sometimes the songs that we hear are just songs of our own

[Outro]
Wake up to find out that you are the eyes of the world
The heart has its beaches, its homeland and thoughts of its own
Wake now, discover that you are the song that the morning brings
The heart has its seasons, its evenings and songs of its own

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
All the years combine, they melt into a dream
A broken angel sings from a guitar
In the end there's just a song, comes crying up the night
Through all the lonely streets and vanished years

[Chorus]
Stella Blue
Stella Blue

[Verse 2]
When all the cards are down, there's nothing left to see
There's just the pavement left and broken dreams
In the end there's just a song, it's crying like the wind
Down every lonely street that's ever been

[Chorus]
Stella Blue
Stella Blue

[Bridge]
I've stayed in every blue light cheap hotel
Can't win for trying
Dust off those rusty strings just one more time
Gonna make 'em shine

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
It all rolls into one, and nothing comes for free
There's nothing you can hold for very long
Then you hear that song, crying like the wind
It seems like all this life was just a dream

[Chorus]
Stella Blue
Stella Blue

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Deep down in Louisiana close to New Orleans
Way back up in the woods among the evergreens
There is an old cabin made of earth and wood
There lived a country boy named Johnny B. Goode
He never learned to read or write so well
But he could play his guitar like ringing a bell

[Chorus]
Go go, go Johnny go, go; go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go; go Johnny go, go (Get back on TV)
Johnny B. Goode

[Verse 2]
He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack
Go sit up in the trees by the railroad track
The engineers seen him sitting in the shade
Strumming to the rhythm that the drivers made
The pеople passing by would all stop and say
"Whoa, my, that little country boy can play!"

[Chorus]
Go go, go Johnny go, go; go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go; go Johnny go, go
Johnny B. Goode

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
His mama told him "Somеday you will be a man
You will be the leader of a big old band
Many people coming from miles around
Will see you play your music when the sun goes down
Maybe someday your name will be in lights
Saying Johnny B. Goode tonight"

[Chorus]
Ah, go, go Johnny go, go; go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go; go Johnny go, go (Go, go)
Johnny B. Goode

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
Ah, go, go Johnny go, go; go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go; go Johnny go, go (Go, go)
Johnny B. Goode
Thank y'all, good night

[Verse 1]
Late night, baby, it get dark off the '42
You a pricey little bitch, I could afford you
Too much goin' on, won't fuck it up, I can't afford to
Bitch, this ain't a Ford, this a foreign, you
Ask me where I been, bitch, I've been way up
I can't text you my location 'case this shit a set-up
Jewelry on me, hundred thou', try and take it, you get wet up (Haha)
My bitch badder than Zendaya

[Pre-Chorus]
I still bought her new Bottega (I do)
This tequila got me wavy, I can't even keep my head up
I don't even know who with me, who for real, and who for show
I don't know

[Chorus]
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
I don't know, I don't know

[Verse 2]
Late night, baby, it get dark off the Hennessy (Woah, woah)
I could feel the tension in your enеrgy (I do, oh)
Even if we black out, I'm gon' make surе you remember me
I was tryna stay a night, you want me to spend the week
Yeah, we went M.I.A. in the 305
Pour me up some more so I could feel alive
She tell me I'm the only one
She tellin' lies, yeah, she tellin' lies
You was never mine

[Pre-Chorus]
I still bought her new Bottega (I do)
This tequila got me wavy, I can't even keep my head up
I don't even know who with me, who for real, and who for show
I don't know

[Chorus]
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
I don't know, I don't know

[Outro]
Cup muddied up
Reminiscin' on days when I was tryna get my money up
I do this shit for the 2017, man, that shit a different type of love
Shout out Kenny from the block, the only one that held it down before I was up
There's not a lot of people that I trust
My new girl got trust issues 'cause the hoes that I used to fuck
Lot of shit that I'm goin' through, but I keep it cool, I can't even front
Lot of people want me to lose, they gon' hate what's comin' soon
I promise you shit ain't over, album 2022

[Verse 1]
I, I had a dream that I was sinkin', slow motion
(Every superficial moment)
I get overwhelmed in all the messy emotions
(Before that I never noticed)
Every time I cry, I get a little bit stronger
Stronger, I know, I know that
Angel used to be the Devil on my shoulder
Shoulder, oh, not anymore

[Pre-Chorus]
When the voices get loud, I’m turnin' them down
Feel good in my body forever and ever
When the tears start to fall, I'm catchin’ them all
And I know the future is better, 'cause

[Chorus]
Every time I cry, I get a little bit stronger
Stronger, little bit stronger
Every time I cry, I get a little bit stronger
Stronger, little bit stronger
I, I used to spend the nights inside my head, thinkin'
(Where the hell you think you're goin'?)
I, I used to count the days inside my bed, drinkin'
(Up the fear but now I know that)

[Pre-Chorus]
When the voices get loud, I'm turnin' them down
Feel good in my body forever and ever
When the tears start to fall, I’m catchin’ them all
And I know the future is better, 'cause

[Chorus]
Every time I cry, I get a little bit stronger
Stronger, little bit stronger
Every time I cry, I get a little bit stronger
Stronger, little bit stronger

[Break]
Stronger
Stronger

[Pre-Chorus]
When the voices get loud, I’m turnin' them down
Feel good in my body forever and ever
When the tears start to fall, I'm catchin' them all
And I know the future is better, ’cause

[Chorus]
Every time I cry, I get a little bit stronger
Stronger, little bit stronger
Every time I cry, I get a little bit stronger
Stronger, little bit stronger (Stronger)
Every time I cry, I get a little bit stronger
Stronger, little bit stronger (Oh)
Every time I cry, I get a little bit stronger (Oh)
Stronger, little bit stronger

Lost niggas say they here, tryna run up your account
Picked up on a 'thou, this summer they was down

All bad bitches take a group pic

Saved up to buy an ass of your very very own
FaceTime body look like Dom Perignon

Rain, wash away my sorrow
Take away my pain
Your love's coming down like rain

[Verse 1]
When your lips are burning mine
And you take the time to tell me how you feel
When you listen to my words
And I know you've heard, I know it's real

For the first time I can hear my heart sing
Call me a fool but I know I'm not
I'm gonna stand out here on the mountain top
'Til I feel your

Could you see my tears?
When I turnеd the other way
Did you hear me say
I'd wait for all the dark clouds bursting in a perfect sky?
You promised me when you said goodbye
That you'd return when the storm was done
And now I'll wait for the light, I'll wait for the sun
'Til I feel your

Rain, feel it on my finger tips
Hear it on my window pane
Your love's coming down like
Rain, wash away my sorrow

(I tell myself that if I believe in you)
(I feel like I've known you before)
(In the dream of you)
(And I want to understand you)
(With all my heart and all my soul)
(More and more and more)
(That by sheer force of will I will raise you from the ground)
(When I'm with you I feel like a magical child)
(And without a sound, you'll appear)
(Everything strange)
(And surrender to me)
(Everything wild)
(To love)

[Part I: SpaceX]

[Intro]
Dear ones, we are looking to bring you enlightenment
To offer illumination in stormy skies
We are here as beings of light
Benevolent, invested in humanity and her evolution

[Chorus: Ant Clemons]
Turned to a Mothra, this that Godzilla
Turned to a monster, more like Othello
Phantom of the opera, it goes where it goes
My nightmares still haunt me
When I sleep, they haunt me
When I sleep, they haunt me
And my nightmares, they haunt me
But I won't let 'em get the best of me

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
(Yeah) Sixteen years, I've been popping these pills (Ah)
This my anniversary, I had my chopper for ten years

I was just rockin' a brand new fox and it didn't come with a tail
I was just tellin' my bitch that call me soft, I got bells (Okay)
I just been rockin' this Gucci, I had my Giuseppes and Yeezys where I live
I got locked up and then I had to take the helicopter to LIV

[Chorus: Ant Clemons]
My nightmares still haunt me
When I sleep, they haunt me
When I sleep, they haunt me
And my nightmares, they haunt me
But I won't let 'em get the best of me

She wanna go to the sunken place told her to giddy up, ándale

Put you in brand new fabrics, let you go drip on the runway (Woop, drip)
Demons they shake off my back when I walk into church on a Sunday (Help me, God!)
Niggas don't know how to act so that's why I bought a new AK

Me and my future, we shall begin
Trippin' out on this LSD, takin' the journey beyond the weed
I float around 'till we find the key, couple girls, they my family
Here I am, here I am, holdin' the bean since I was ten
Open your mouth for the stars and then
Hop on the board and we soarin' in
Nigga can never be tamed, I fall the hard, I weather the rain

And I pimp for the fallen, no stolen, my car, and been here for a minute now
Learn from my destiny, and I'm hearin you Lord
Oh, I'm hearin' you Lord, oh, I'm hearin' you Lord

Alien, alien, fall right through Hell and come back again
Fly to Hell in this whip we're in, alien, alien

[Intro: Kanye West]
Seasons changing
'Fore life start for me, 'fore life start for me
Thoughts and thoughts to me
80 degrees
Warmin' up to me
I did it free
I did know, indeed
And I run out to sea, I can walk on the water
Honey, I want you, I can't float on the bottom
Father, hold me close, don't let me down
I know you won't

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
I chose not to be a slave
Dropped the Wave Runners, now we run the wave
Like we ain't had all the hood rats and mud rats
Like you ain't had 'em, good stats and all that
Nobody gon' ruin me
I just called my wife up, let's get Hoover free
I put all my ice up and my Louis V
I just copped my mom a crib, I'm back over East
Let me get your ear like Holyfield
From the home of Soldier Field
Coming home, that's how a soldier feel
All that killing over, that's just overkill
Yeezy back in the Chi, this that Oprah field

[Chorus: Ant Clemons]
Seasons changing, summer starts to leave
Autumn falls on me, fall, winter, then spring
80 degrees
Warmin' up for me
I fell deep, sun ain't have to leave
Open my eyes and see, I can walk on water
Made it back to shore, I can't float from the bottom
Father, lift me up, don't let me drown
I know you won't

[Verse 2: Ty Dolla $ign]
(Ooh, yeah, ooh, ooh, yeah)
Who really loves me? Somebody loves me (Ooh yeah)
Who really wants me? Who really cares about me?
Said I remember when you left me by my grandma house
Yeah, I remember when you let me buy my grandma a house
You ain't my nigga if you ain't ever been by my grandma house (No)
This ain't real love if we never fuck on my grandma couch (No)
Nobody loves me, can't trust nobody
Don't want no fake niggas around me, don't need nobody (Yeah)

[Verse 3: Young Thug]
Okay, I've been on the road, fuck it, I guess that's how we gotta be (Uh)
Gettin' too much cash, not to upgrade percentages and salaries
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, oh
All I ever wanted is someone to be genuine
And to truly show me love, gotta be high like she Seroquel
Don't take nothin' from us, I don't got time to be watchin' them

[Bridge: Kanye West & Young Thug]
(Ooh, the way she walkin' with legs, can't keep up, uh, uh)
Seasons changing
'Fore life start for me, (I see them watchin' me) 'fore life start for me (They still watchin' me)
Thoughts and thoughts to me (Oh, oh, oh)
80 degrees
Warmin' up to me
I did it free
I did know, indeed
And I run out to sea, I can walk on the water
Honey, I want you, I can't float on the bottom
Father, hold me close, don't let me down
I know you won't

[Verse 4: Big Sean]
(Woah, woah, yeah, yeah)
Look, my life is exciting as Dennis Rodman's (Woah)
Stars intertwine, my soul back in alignment
If we don't have the same vision, no point in exchanging contact (No)
Only ex I love running into is at the end of my contracts, yeah
Bottom line, I'm seeing through the mask of the fakes
Like we're at the Comic Con, I point 'em out from time to time
Speaking of time, me and my mom been gettin' closer
Either I took her for granted or didn't know her
Or is it, I'm getting older?
Or is it, Lucas finally turning into Yoda?
Only new beginnings, no such thing as over
We should have just stayed friends
That never opened up or needed closure, God (God)
Give me directions like Noah
Not on no hopeless romantic shit
But I can't wait to see Ye get back with HOVA
Look bitch, this the new chain of command (Bitch)
Might bring the Pow chains back like me and Ye in Japan
Cudi back at it again, Push, that's 'till the end, yeah
Just like it should have been
Nothing but that G.O.O.D. and the G around us
I knocked don the walls and my head free my mind up (Woah)
I didn't change the game, ho, I helped redesign it, yeah
Goin' against us, you need logic, Muhammad
I'm so fuckin' conscious, that shit is my compass, yeah, yeah
Don

[Intro: Kanye West]
(Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm)
I been, I been countin'
When's enough enough bae? When's enough enough?
Shit, I feel like

[Bridge: Kanye West]
Feel like De Nero on Casino
Where they got the sun up for the C-note
Know I'm shining when you growin' on the ice
What you expect? Me and the girl, she was blowin' on the dice, uh

[Verse 1: Ant Clemons]
She just told me, "Yandhi, you my hero"
I can tell that girl just wants the free clothes
For her cousins, aunties and her freak hoes
But her cousin's auntie is a freak-ho

[Chorus: Ant Clemons & Kanye West]
Change in few can move a country
Inner peace don't cost no money
That's the stuff you learn, another lesson learned
All you do is party, you've been lookin' for somebody with some
All that ass don't hurt nobody, me and all my posse we brought
When's enough enough bae? When's enough enough?
Shit, I feel like

[Verse 2: Ant Clemons]
Everything's all gucci when we up in Gucci
I just made a (Rrr-ghgh) and I called it Chewie
The B-I-G contour, no, this shit ain't juicy
But I just hit the fade when I'm feelin' Boosie
Been had these dreams since I was yay-high
Pull up-up in the Benz and let the bass ride
I was doin' this shit before you was outside
Everythin' is good here on our side
Everythin' is good here on our side

[Outro: Kanye West]
You can say what you want, you've been done, I know you hiding
(Mumbling)
All that ass don't hurt nobody, me and all my posse we brought
When's enough enough bae? When's enough enough?
Shit, I feel like

[Intro: Dua Lipa]
There've been no lies, there's been no wait in me, dawn or night
Tell me you'll call, tell me you waitin' on my mind
Tell me to wait, tell me to love, tell me to go
Tell me to be, I've been lost on my phone
See you again, see you again, see you again
Have I been out my mind? And I've been wasting time
Believing you'll come back to me

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
"How you get so much favor on your side?"
"Accept Him as your Lord and Saviour," I replied
Thou shalt love thy neighbor, not divide
I'ma ride, that's on God
His light shine the brightest in the dark
Single mothers know they got my heart
And all my brothers locked up on the yard
You can still be anything you wanna be
Went from one in four to one in three
Thirteenth amendment, gotta end it, that's on me
He the new commander and the chief
That's on Keef, that's on God

[Chorus: Dua Lipa]
I will fly with you, if you ain't happy now
I will fly with you, and I've been waiting, uh
I will fly with you, if you ain't happy now
I will fly with you, ah, ah, ah, ah

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Before the ranch, I had horses in the garage
When the Forbes cover was just a mirage
They had me chasin' statues, that's on pride
"Oh my God," Bust said that's on Tribe
When I thought the Book of Job was a job
The Devil had my soul, I can't lie
Life gon' have some lows and some highs
Before the Grammy's ever gave a nod
I wore my heart on my sleeve, I couldn't hide
In '03, they told me not to drive
I bleached my hair for every time I could've died
But I survived, that's on God

[Chorus: Dua Lipa]
I will fly with you, if you ain't happy now
I will fly with you, and I've been waiting, uh
I will fly with you, if you ain't happy now
I will fly with you, ah, ah, ah, ah

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
I've been tellin' y'all since '05
The greatest artist restin' or alive
That's on L.A. Reid, that's on Clive
That's no Jive, that's on God
Off the 350s He supplied
The IRS want they fifty plus our tithe
Man, that's over half of the pie
I felt dry, that's on God
That's why I charge the prices that I charge
I can't be out here dancin' with the stars
No, I cannot let my family starve
I go hard, that's on God

Yo Pi'erre, you wanna come out here?

[Outro: Dua Lipa]

That's why I'm respected and I'm steppin' anywhere, nigga, lil' Tory

[Verse 1: Frank Howard]
I remember not too long ago
I was searchin' for someone new
And all of the time, yes I did
I knew she had to be true

[Chorus: Frank Howard (The Commanders)]
Now that search is over
And my last company too
And I'm so glad (Hey, baby)
My, my baby

[Spoken Intro: King Curtis]
This is called "Instant Groove"
Now, while we start to whip up the groove
We want everybody to come on out here and do your thing
Now, everybody got a thing
We want you to come out and do it, now
Now, that's what everybody is doin' now
Their own thing
That's what I want to see you do right now
Go on and get it
Go on and do it
Do it one more time

[Instrumental]

[Spoken Interlude: King Curtis]

We're gonna let our bass player do his thing right now
Come on, Jerry
Go on and get down
That's it right now
Work your show

[Instrumental Outro]

[Verse 1]
Green light, Seven Eleven
You stop in for a pack of cigarettes
You don't smoke, don't even want to
Hey now, check your change
Dressed up like a car crash
Your wheels are turnin' but you're upside down
You say when he hits you, you don't mind
Because when he hurts you, you feel alive

[Verse 2]
Oh, is that what it is?
Red lights, grey morning
You stumble out of a hole in the ground
A vampire or a victim
It depends on who's around
You used to stay in to watch the adverts
You could lip synch. to the talk shows
And if you look, you look through me
And when you talk, you talk at me
And when I touch you, you don't feel a thing

[Chorus]
If I could stay, then thе night would give you up
Stay, and the day would keep its trust
Stay, and the night would bе enough

[Verse 3]
Faraway, so close
Up with the static and the radio
With satellite television
You can go anywhere:
Miami, New Orleans
London, Belfast and U.A.E

[Bridge]
And, if you listen, I can't call
And, if you jump, you just might fall
And, if you shout, I'll only hear you

[Chorus]
If I could stay, then the night would give you up
Stay, and the day would keep its trust
Stay with the demons you drowned
Stay with the spirit I found
Stay, and the night would be enough

[Outro]
Three o'clock in the morning
It's quiet, there's no one around
Just the bang and the clatter
As an angel runs to ground
Just the bang and the clatter
As an angel hits the ground

[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
I know that I
Will never love again
I know that I
Will be my only friend
Will if I could, I'd like for you to see
The lovesicken image I've turned out to be
Turned out to be
Turned out to be
Na na na na
Na na na na
Da da da da

[Verse 2]
Remember the things
That we used to do
Remember the night
I gave all my love to you
How did we part?
How could it be?
It's all because she found my diary
My diary
My diary
La la la la
La la la la
Da da da
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 3]
I sit at home
I think of you each day
Never 

[?]
A word to me you say
We'rе so alike
Each and every way
Evеn our birthdays
Is on the same ol' day
The same old day
The same old day
Na na na na
Na na na na
Da da da
Yeah, hey
Yeah

[Verse 4]
People get ready; there's a train a comin'
Pickin' up passengers from coast to coast
All you need is a little faith
Open the door in boredom
There's room for all
You just thank the Lord
All you gotta do is thank the Lord
People, are you ready for that train journey?
Pickin' up passengers from coast to coast
All you need is a little faith
Open the door in boredom
There's room for all
You just thank the Lord

[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
There's a new dance goin' around

[Chorus]

[Chorus]
Come on baby

Strut to the left, then back to the right
Don't you know the Utee is outta sight?
Hey

[Outro]
You and me

[Chorus]
Baby, I don't know what you got
Honey, I don't know what you got
But it's got me

But you know just where it's at
You don't have one thin dime
Still I can't leave you behind

[Chorus]
Baby, I don't know what you got
Honey, I don't know what you got
But it's got me
I'm tellin' you, it's got me

[Bridge]
Baby, baby, baby, I feel so all alone
Sometimes I just cry, I sigh
Sometimes I even moan
Because baby, I don't know what it is
But I find myself living at your will
Oh baby, please
Sometimes my best friend comes to me on my job
And he looks at me and he said
"Richard, man, you don't know what's going on"
And I look at my friend because I'm innocent
And my friend look at me and says
"Richard you don't know what's going on
I got something to tell you"
And look what my friend tells me
This what he say to me

[Verse 4]
Now, you cheat, cheat, cheat, cheat on me
But baby let me be

[Chorus]
Honey, I don't know what you got
Baby, I don't know what you got
But it's got me
I cry sometimes because I know it's got me

[Verse 5]
Listen, I gave you all the money I had in the bank
Not one time, not one time did you say thanks

[Outro]
But baby, I don't know what you got
Honey, I say, I don't know what you got
Sometimes it makes my cry
I don't know what you got
I feel sometimes like I wanna to die
I don't, oh oh oh baby
Sometimes it makes me wanna moan
Sometimes it makes me wanna leave my happy home

[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse]
Into rich life
Some rain has fallen
Sometimes I get that feeling
Too much has fallen
Sometimes I wonder
I really wonder
Was I born to suffer?
Sometimes I feel
I'm only wastin' my time
All of the lonely people, yeah yeah
What do we all come from?
If y'all can tell me
I would surely like it
Drivin' in my car
On the lonely highway
Which exit should I turn on?
Tell me where I should run
I was born in 

[?]
I was born to feel
Ever since I was a child
I felt the things that are real
My daddy told me
Told mе stand up and say what was on my mind
Now my daddy's gone
Seems such a long, long time
How many times
Do wе go along with something?
With some of the things we know
Ain't right?
Have to be wrong
Sometimes I feel, yeah
Oh, I feel so disappointed
Every little thing that I try
Looks like turns out to be in vain
And I turn around and look at my friends
And ask them for some kind of understanding
And they said "Oh look at me, don't look at me"
Ooh, how they changed
So tell me, who?
Tell me who do I turn to?
Where?
Where can I go?
Who has the answer?
Seems that don't know, don't know
Don't nobody know
Someday I'll find
Someplace where's there love and peace of mind
And wipe all
All my troubles away
Whoa, I'd be so vain
To see that day
Gotta keep on searchin'
And I know I'll find a way

[Outro]
Whoa, no more sadness
Oh, no more fears
Oh, no more heartaches
Oh, no more tears
No more sanity
Oh, no more tears
Well, no more heartaches
No more fears
Yeah, no more...

[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse]
Go on
Innocence sunk the glow and drowned in covers
Send for all your absent lover's things
Sheepish wolves looking lived in eating buttons
Wink, just don't put your teeth on me
(Go on)
Accidents let the evening in the back door
Filled the room ceiling to the floor
Beat backbones, grazed the poem and made it strange
I wasn't born to be a skeleton
(Go on)
Go on, grab your hat and fetch a camera
Go on, film the world before it happens
Go on, grab your hat and fetch a camera
Go on, film the world beforе it happens
(Go on)
Jealous orchard the sky is falling off thе ceiling
While I'm tucking fibs into a cookie jar
Reverie it's useless searching in the cupboards
When everything you have is on your back
(Go on)
Go on grab your hat and fetch a camera
Go on film the world before it happens
(Go on)
Go on grab your hat and fetch a camera
Go on film the world before it happens
Go on grab your hat and fetch a camera
Go on film the world before it happens
(Go on)
Film the world before it happens
Film the world before it happens

[?]
You're a sweet thang
You're a sweet, sweet thang
Come on, girl
Lord, have mercy

[Verse 1]
After all the jacks are in their boxes
And the clowns have all gone to bed
You can hear happiness staggering on down the street
Footprints dressed in red
And the wind whispers Mary

[Verse 2]
A broom is drearily sweeping
Up the broken pieces of yesterday's life
Somewhere a queen is weeping
Somewhere a king has no wife
And the wind it cries Mary

[Guitar solo]

[Verse 3]
The traffic lights they turn blue tomorrow
And shine their emptiness down on my bed
The tiny island sags downstream
'Cause the life they lived is dead
And the wind screams Mary

[Verse 4]
Will the wind ever remember
The names it has blown in the past?
And with its crutch, its old age, and its wisdom
It whispers no, this will be the last
And the wind cries Mary

[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1: Jimi Hendrix]
We carry to you
In arms
On Independence Day
And uh, now you throw us
All aside
Put us on our way
Oh, when the daughter
Beneath the sun
Treat her father so
Wait upon him
Hand and foot
Always answer "No"
Well, I'll say:

[Chorus: Unknown]
Tears of rage
Tears of greed
I must not be the one who does either thing
Come to me now, you know it
So all alone
And life is free

[Verse 2: Jimi Hendrix]
We point it out to you
The way to go
And scratch your name in sand
Though you thought it was
Nothing more than a
Cool place for you to stand
And I want you to know
That while we watched you discover
There was no one truе
By myself, yeah
Remеmber now
Was a challenging thing to do

[Chorus: Unknown]
Tears of rage
Tears of greed
Why am I always the one 

[?]
Come to me now, you know it
So all alone
And life is free

[Harmonica Solo]

[Verse 3: Jimi Hendrix]
Is was all
The painless
When you went out to recieve
All that false instruction
Which we could never believe
And now my heart
Is filled with gold
If it was a purse
Oh, what kind of love is this?
Which goes from bad to worse?
Yeah

[Chorus: Unknown]
Tears of rage
Tears of greed
Why am I always the one who is 

[?]
Come to me now, you know it
So all alone
And life is free

[Harmonica Outro]

[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
Hooray, I awake from yesterday
Alive but the war is here to stay
So my love, Katherina and me
Decide to take our last walk
Through the noise to the sea
Not to die but to be reborn
Away from a life so battered and torn
Forever, forever

[Verse 2]
Oh, say can you see, it's really such a mess
Every inch of earth is a fighting nest
Giant pencil and lipstick tube-shaped things
Continue to rain and cause screaming pain
And the Arctic stains
From silver blue to bloody red
As our feet find thе sand and the sea
Is straight ahead, straight up ahеad

[Verse 3]
Well, it’s too bad, that our friends can't be with us today
Well, that's too bad
"The machine that we built would never save us"
That’s what they say
(That's why they ain't coming with us today)
And they also said
"It's impossible for man to live and breathe underwater forever"
Was their main complaint
(Yeah)
And they also threw this in my face, they said:
"Anyway, you know good and well
It would be beyond the will of God
And the grace of the King"
Grace of the King, yeah, yeah

[Verse 4]
So my darling and I make love in the sand
To salute the last moment ever on dry land
Our machine has done its work, played its part well
Without a scratch on our bodies and we bid it farewell
Starfish and giant foams greet us with a smile
Before our heads go under, we take a last look
At the killing noise of the out of style
The out of style, out of style

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 5]
So down and down and down and down
And down and down we go
Hurry, my darling, we mustn't be late for the show
Neptune champion games to an aqua world is so very dear
Right this way, smiles a mermaid
I can hear Atlantis full of cheer
Atlantis full of cheer
I can hear Atlantis full of cheer

[Instrumental Outro]

[Guitar Solo]

[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
Sure was a long, long, long, hot summer night
As far as my eyes could see
But my heart was way down
In a cold, cold winter storm
My darling, where can you be?
Where can you be, baby?
Where can you be?

[Verse 2]
There were three sugar walls and-a two candy cane windows
(Whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop)
But the serious moon melted all those in sight (all those in sight)
Everybody's on fire but I'm a snowing in a cold blizzard
Where are you on this-a hot cold summer?
Where are you on this-a hot cold summer?
Where are you on this-a hot cold summer night?

[Verse 3]
Around about this time the telephone blew its horn across the room
Scared little Annie clean out of her mind, clean out of her mind
Roman the Candle, he peeps out of his peekaboo hide and seek
And grabbed little Annie from the ceiling just in time
And the telephone keeps on screaming
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

[Verse 4]
Hello, says my shaky voice, well, how are you doing
I start to stutter
Ah, can't you tell I'm doing fine
It was my baby talking, she's way down across the border
She says, I'm going to hurry to you, I've been a fool
And I'm tired of crying

[Verse 5]
Yeah, a long, long, long, hot summer night
As far as my eyes could see (as far, as far as I could see)
But I can feel the heat coming on as my baby's getting closer
I'm so glad that my baby's coming to rescue me
So glad that my baby's coming to rescue me
So glad my baby's coming to rescue me
Rescue, rescue, rescue
Rescue, rescue
Rescue, rescue, what'd I say
Rescue me, rescue me
Rescue, rescue me, rescue me
Rescue

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Before I could ask "Was it the East or West side?"
My feet they howled in pain
The wheels of a bandwagon cut very deep
But not as deep in my mind as the rain
As they pulled away, I could see her words
Stagger and fall on my muddy tent
I picked them up, brushed them off
To see what they said
And you wouldn't believe
"Come around to my room, with the tooth in the middle
And bring along the bottle and a president"

[Chorus]
And eh sometimes it's not so easy, baby
Especially when your only friend
Talks, sees, looks and feels like you
And you do just the same as him
(Gets very lonely up this road, baby)
(Yeah, hmmm, yeah)
(Got more to say)

[Verse 2]
Well I'm riding through LA (huh)
On a bicycle built for a fool
And I seen one of my old buddies
And he say, "You don't look the way you usually do"
I say, "Well, some people look like a coin-box"
He says, "Looks like you have got no coins to spare"
And I laid back and I thought to myself, and I said this
I just picked up my pride from underneath the pay phone
And combed this breath right out of my hair

[Chorus]
And eh sometimes it's not so easy
Especially when your only friend
Talks, sees, looks and feels like you
And you do just the same as him

[Verse 3]
I just got out of a Scandinavian jail
And I'm on my way straight home to you
But I feel so dizzy, I take a quick look in the mirror
To make sure my friend's here with me too
And you know good well I don't drink coffee
So you fill my cup full of sand
And the frozen tea leaves on the bottom
Cherry lipstick around the broken edge
And my coat that you let your dog lay by the fire on
And your cat he attacks me from his pill-box ledge
And I thought you were my friend too
Man, my shadow comes in line before you

[Chorus]
I'm finding out that it's not so easy, baby
Especially when your only friend
Talks, sees, looks and feels like you
And you do the same just like him

[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
Hey baby where are you coming from?
Well she looked at me and smiled
And looked into space and said "I'm coming from the land of the new rising sun"
Then I said, "Hey baby, where are you trying to go to?"
Then she said "I'm going to
Spin and spread around peace of mind and a whole lot of love to you and yours"

[Chorus]
Hey girl I'd like to come along
Yes, I'd love to come along

[Verse 2]
"Would you like to come along?" She asked me
"Yes, take me along right now"
Hey baby, can I step into your world for a while?

"Yes you can," she said
Come on back with me for a while
We're going to go across the Jupiter sand and see all you people one by one
We got to help you people out right now
That's why I'm doing it all about

[Chorus]
Hey girl I'd like to come along
Yes, I'd love to come along

[Instrumental Outro]

You ain't nothing but a hound dog
Scratchin' all the time
You ain't nothing but a hound dog, baby
Scratchin' all the time
You ain't got no friend of mine
But I ain't gonna feed you no more

[Verse 1]
You told me you was high class
But I could see through that
She told me you was high class
But I could see through that
And daddy I know
You ain't no real cool cat

[Chorus]
You ain't nothing but a hound dog
Scratchin' all the time
You ain't nothing but a hound dog, baby
Scratchin' all the time
You ain't got no friend of mine
But I ain't gonna feed you no more

[Verse 2]
You made me feel so blue
You made me weep and moan
You made me feel so blue
You made me weep and moan
Cause you ain't looking for a woman
All you're lookin' is for a home

[Chorus]
You ain't nothing but a hound dog
Scratchin' all the time
You ain't nothing but a hound dog, baby
Scratchin' all the time
You ain't got no friend of mine
But I ain't gonna feed you no more

[Verse 1]
Purple haze all in my brain
Lately things, they don't seem the same
Acting funny, but I don't know why
'Scuse me while I kiss the sky

[Verse 2]
Purple haze all around
Don't know if I'm coming up or down
Am I happy or in misery?
Whatever it is, that pill put a spell on me

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Purple haze all in my eyes
Don't know if it's day or night
You got me blowing, blowing my mind
Is it tomorrow, or just the end of time?

(Intro)

1. I got rid of the shackles that bound me and the guards that were always around me
There were tears on the mail Mother wrote me in jail, but I'm free from the chain gang now
2. Back home, I was known and respected. Then, one day, I was wrongly suspected. So, they put me in chains in a cold, freezin' rain. But I'm free from the chain gang now
3. All the years I was known by a number. How I kept my mind is a wonder. And the bare prison cell that was one step from Hell. But I'm free from the chain gang now
4. I pray that the gossip will spare me when I return to the one I will marry. Like a bird in a tree, I got my liberty. And I'm free from the chain gang now

[Hook]
Blood seeping into the mulch, I needed a quick result
I read it and don't respond, she see it, it's salt sprinkled
I needed another gulp, I'm seeing her when I want

[Verse]
Finally went out the hole, deep breathing only make me grow
They ain't wanna leave the clutch, find me if ? with y'all
? into the crutch, speak through the love
Take heat, we took an oath to the sword
The shield took a couple chinks, it never broke
I know what it mean how a player mates on love's shoulder
Consolidate thе cream then I made it homе
Chain shine like 14-carat gold, rewiring
And patching holes, there's no rewinding
For the umpteenth time, it's only forward
Peace to Akai Solo the soldier
I couldn't toast a drink to devise
I heard the clink, life could change in the blink of an eye
A wrinkle in time
I'mma leave it to y'all to get hoodwinked and surprised
Threw on some Bootsy, I'd rather be with you when I'm high
I went ahead and mixed some beetlejuice with the wine
Skin contact, ? squeeze down
It's been a minute since I blew up your line
I leave town fast, out the dungeon like OutKast
Funnels with the loud-pack
Hunter's boots crunching through the brown grass

[Hook]
Blood seeping into the mulch, I needed a quick result
I read it and don't respond, she see it as sprinkled salt
I needed another gulp, I'm seeing her when I want

[Intro: The Kid LAROI & TKingston]
(Ayy, f**k that nigga Haan, man)
Yeah, I'ma come, yeah, uh

[Chorus: The Kid LAROI]
I just touched down on a late flight (I did)
Shawty blowing up my phone (She is)
I'ma come through on the late night (Oh, oh)
She wanna chill and do date night (She do)
She wanna chill in the daytime (Oh, yeah)
But shawty, you know I'm a dog (I did)
I don't got time just to play around (No)
(Oh, wow) Shawty, I don't want your love, I just want the bands now
(Oh, wow) Shawty, I just want to fuck and keep it like friends now
(Oh, wow) But you want attention
You want attention (Oh, wow), you want attention, uh, uh, uh

[Verse 1: The Kid LAROI]
Come through, girl, I need some attention
I don't, don't know what your intentions are
I think that we need some time away
You want me all the time, I can't do every day
Not to mention, I don't want to do this all over again
Did I mention, I've been through my own fair share of things
I feel the tension when I walk into the room
Don't know what you want me to do
Either way, I'm gon' lose

[Chorus: The Kid LAROI]
I just touched down on a late flight (I did)
Shawty blowing up my phone (She is)
I'ma come through on the late night (Oh, oh)
She wanna chill and do date night (She do)
She wanna chill in the daytime (Oh, yeah)
But shawty, you know I'm a dog (I did)
I don't got time just to play around (No)
(Oh, wow) Shawty, I don't want your love, I just want the bands now
(Oh, wow) Shawty, I just want to fuck and keep it like friends now
(Oh, wow) But you want attention
You want attention (Oh, wow), you want attention, uh, uh, uh

[Verse 2: Swae Lee]
I keep fresh like date night (Date night)
I'm on the move like hang tight (Tight)
Beat up the pussy like cage fight (Cage fight)
Told the bitch eat it like steak fries (Very nice)
Oh, she want attention ('Tention)
Pockets endless (Endless), diamonds three dimensions ('Mensions)
I got a sixth sense
Friends and I'm an acquaintant (Yeah)
Bust on
