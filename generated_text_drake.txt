[Verse 1: Drake]
Look at this, here's how it's all gonna be
I'll just grab the girl that's next to you
I'll kiss the girls that are next to you
You know I just wanna make sure you're okay
I wanna make sure you get it right
I wanna make sure you get it right
I wanna make sure you get it right

[Intro: Drake]
You know I'm still young, I'm still young
It's been way too long
It's been way too long
It's been way too long
I'm still young
I'm still young

[Chorus: Drake]
Flawless, smart, smart
Sure, sure, sure
Tryna make a move, tryna make a move

---------------
Beside, this is the only thing I can think of
Loyal now that you're gone
Got you pretty close to me
I'm sure there's some stuff you know
But I ain't got the time
I'm a young man no more
But I'm certainly not coming back

[Outro]

It's one thing to make a lot of money
But it's another thing when you're dying
And it's a different situation when we die
You know you got a pain in your heart
But you die with nothing and you got everything
And you know that no matter how hard you try, this ain't gonna happen
But it's a different situation when we die
You know that no matter how hard you try, this ain't gonna happen
But it's a different situation when we die
You know that no matter how hard you try, this ain't gonna happen
But it's a different situation when we die
You know you got a pain in your heart
Butleys, you got it, you got it

[Verse 2]
You know it's been so long
And you think it's just a matter of time
But like it's still the same
As always you try to find the right opportunity
But you never find it
Like you never find it
As always you try to find the right opportunity
But you never find it
Like you never find it
As always you try to find the right opportunity
But you never find it

[Chorus]
Always give me what you take
Always, always give me what you take
Always, always give me what you take
Always

[Verse 3]
You know you got to go through it
With your past, your past, your past
It's a hard life, let's face it
But it still ain't over until it's done
With the past, with the past, with the past
It's a hard life, let's face it
But it still ain't over until it's done
With the past, with the past, with the past
It's a hard life, let's face it


[Outro]
It's one thing to make a lot of money
But it's another thing when you're dying
And it's a different situation when we die
You know you got a pain in your heart

The idea

I had been listening
Like a song, like a song
And I thought,
'Oh, man, I can do this'
I know that I could do this
But I think I'm a bit shy
And I'm scared
And I'm scared that I'm not good enough
And I'm afraid that I'm not good enough
[Chorus]
I like to be lucky
The people that I know want me to do this
Someone will come and say,
'Hey, I got a thing for young, young people'
I'm the one for anyone that wants to do this
I just need someone to help me take off
And then I'll grow old, and someone will say
'Oh, yeah, you just did it, you did it, you did it''
That's what I need
I'm the kind of person that people want
To do this
And I really am the one for anyone that want to do this
I just need someone to help me take off
And then I'll grow old, and someone will say
'Oh, yeah, you just did it'
That's what I need

[Verse 1: Drake]
Before you pass you time, before you pass you time
Just tell me how you want me to go
I want it to feel like you being mean to me
When I tell you how you want nothing more then to be right with me
Then I'll know, you'll know for sure
You know how to get what you want, you know how to get it
Just tell me how you want me to go
I'll know for sure

[Chorus: Drake]
I like to be lucky
The people that I know want me to do this
Someone will come and say,
'Hey, I got a thing for young, young people'
I'm the one for anyone that wants to do this
I just need someone to help me take off
And then I'll grow old, and someone will say,
'Oh, yeah, you just did it, you did it, you did it'
That's what I need
I'm the kind of person that people want
To do this
And I really am the one for anyone that want to do this
I just need someone to help me take off
And then I'll grow old,

The worst thing that you can do is give a pro a chance
You can't say I couldn't

[Intro: Drake]
Now, this time, yeah, you know, they're going
Now, this time, yeah, they's going
They's got a lot of money, a lot of time
They ain't on my side, they ain't on my side
I don't belong to no group, I don't belong to no group
I'm a Drake and a Lenny, I'm a Drake and a Lenny
They might as well go ahead and gettrain

[Verse 1: Drake]
You know what happened?
Was I supposed to be the one?
I was supposed to be the one?
I was supposed to be the one?

[Chorus: Drake]
To be honest, I don't even know
And it doesn't matter to me
To be honest, I don't even know
And it isn't about the money, it's about the love
And is the love gonna be the same to me?

[Verse 2: Drake]
You know what happened?
Was I supposed to be the one?
I was supposed to be the one?
I was supposed to be the one?

[Chorus: Drake]
To be honest, I don't even know
And it doesn't matter to me
To be honest, I don't even know
And it isn't about the money, it's about the love
And is the love gonna be the same to me?

[Verse 3: Drake]
To be honest, I don't even know
And it doesn't matter to me
To be honest, I don't even know
And it isn't about the money, it's about the love
And is the love gonna be the same to me?


[Chorus: Drake]
To be honest, I don't even know
And it doesn't matter to me
To be honest, I don't even know
And it isn't about the money, it's about the love
And is the love gonna be the same to me?

[Intro]
You know what happened?
Was I supposed to be the one?
I was supposed to be the one?
I was supposed to be the one?
