Even my friends said I was a bit old school, right?

But I said...
If... if I get my kid back

I'll take me back to the bar

And we'll make breakfast together

I've got a friend who's really a slut
And I know I can't be quiet

She's the one that's the worst

She's the one who's a monster
And it's the one who's killing me

Now she's the one who's killing me

She's the one that's the worst

<|endoftext|>The nation's 5th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled Tuesday that Florida's voter registration law discriminates against black and Latino voters due to race, the ACLU said in a statement.

In a case that went on to become one of the nation's most famous case, the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals said Broward County's voter registration law discriminates against black and Latino voters.

"With some minority groups denied access to the voting process based on political affiliation and race, Florida's voter registration law does little more than make them feel like they're denied a right to vote because of race," the ACLU said.
